	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 3 October 2013 Marcus Sabra (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty to:
	



	
	two (2) counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity, contrary to s. 134.3(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”); and
	
	
	three (3) counts of attempting, by deception, to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity, contrary to ss. 11.1(1) and 134.2(1) of the Code.
	



	
	Pursuant to s. 16 BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the applicant asked the Court to take into account on sentence:
	



	
	two further counts contrary to s. 134.3 of the Code; and
	
	
	one further count contrary to ss. 11(1) and 134.2(1) of the Code.
	



	
	On 11 April 2014 the applicant was sentenced by Syme DCJ as follows:
	



	
	in respect of each of the counts in 3(i) above, imprisonment for 2 years and 7 months commencing 11 April 2014;
	
	
	in respect of each of the counts in 3(ii) above, imprisonment for 2 years and 7 months commencing 11 July 2014.
	



	
	The total term of imprisonment imposed by her Honour was one of 2 years and 10 months. Her Honour ordered that the applicant be placed on a recognizance release order after serving a period of 2 years imprisonment, such order being conditional upon the applicant:
	



	
	being subject to the supervision by the Probation and Parole Service; and
	
	
	entering into an agreement to forfeit a sum of $1,000.00 in the event that the order was breached.
	



	
	In addition, her Honour ordered that an amount of $84,000.00 be paid to the Commonwealth by way of reparation.
	


THE FACTS


	
	An agreed statement of facts (AB 54-64) was tendered to her Honour on sentence. In her remarks on sentence, her Honour summarised those facts as follows (commencing at [5]):
	


“[5] The facts are contained in an agreed set of facts tendered by the crown and agreed to by the offender. They will if necessary form a schedule to the reasons for decision.

HIP Online Claims System

In 2009 the Federal government set up a home insulation program whereby householders could obtain reimbursement for installation of insulation into their homes. Stage 2 of the program which commenced in July 2009 and ran until February 2010 allowed contractors who were properly registered to seek and obtain payment direct from the government via its Medicare office for installation to a particular premises. Government officers were (theoretically at least) supposed to check with householders the veracity of the payments claimed.

[6.] In order to comply with the government requirements, a business seeking payment was required to register itself on the Installer Provider Register and to agree to the accompanying terms and conditions. Registered applicants were required to provide proof of their qualifications as an insulation installer and proof of the appropriate public liability and workers compensation insurance including details of the business and employees. Upon successful registration an installer was issued with a user ID and password so they could enter claims data online and facilitate payment for installation direct to them as installers.

[7] In order to claim the rebate, registered installers were required to complete forms detailing the identity of the installer, the person who completed the installation and details of the household where the insulation was installed.

[8] A registered installer was required by the terms and conditions of the program among other things to certify that the insulation had been installed in accordance with the relevant program guidelines, the insulation of was of a particular rating and that a copy of the work order form would be retained for five years for auditing purposes. They were also provided with information that false or misleading information given under the HIP scheme was a criminal offence under the Criminal Code.

[9] Upon claims being made the relevant Commonwealth Department was to assess the claims for processing and subject those claims to various compliance checks. In reality it would appear that this was an entirely computer based check. If a claim was approved, the relevant department would provide Medicare with instructions to authorise the payment of the claim via the Reserve bank of Australia to credit the nominated bank account to the value of the allowed claim. After that occurred, Medicare would then write the occupant of the address requesting advice and confirmation of the installation. It seems to this objective observer that for payment to be made before any checking had occurred to confirm installation was absurd.

[10] The online claim system was discontinued on the 19th of February 2010 due to ongoing compliance and safety concerns.

In relation to this particular offender

[11] In 2005 the offender registered a business Sabra Mahmoud. It wasallocated an ABN. The principal place of business was the offender's homeaddress. He opened a bank account in his lawful name with Westpac bank.

[12] On 20 November 2009 the offender applied for and ultimately was approvedas a registered installer for the HIP. There is no information in the agreedfacts as to how this occurred or even if he had any relevant qualifications.None are before the court. His letter to the court states that he wasexperienced in the process. With respect, Mr Sabra has admitted a fraud onthe system. He did not give evidence of his qualifications. He was given auser ID and password. He provided his bank account details for payment ofclaims once they were lodged. Between 26th December 2009 & the 15th ofFebruary 2010 the offender lodged 285 online claims for the rebate usingthe online claims system. He claimed the maximum allowable amount underthe claims system for most of the claims. No independent check was madeas to the feasibility of completing this number of jobs in that time frame.

[13] In each of those claims the offender declared that he had installed insulation at a nominated dwelling in accordance with the programs guidelines. All of those claims were false. Of these claims Medicare paid a sum of $84,000 to the offender's bank account. A further 215 claims were approved for payment but no payments were made as at the time the scheme was shut down. On each occasion claims submitted were entirely false. No insulation had been installed and indeed in some of the premises physical installation was impossible. Details of the individual claims, payments and addresses are contained in an annexure to the facts. There is no explanation how such claims could have been approved and/ or payments made. It is obvious that this system was very easy to abuse. It appears that no checking occurred at all.

Facts on Sentence

[14] Agreed facts were tended in the sentencing hearing by consent and counsel referred to them during the course of their submissions. The offender did not give evidence but in the pre-sentence report dated 11 March 2014 the offender is reported to say that ""he had subcontracted out the work that he had obtained and that the subcontractors were responsible for the illegal activities"". And later in the same report: ""Mr Sabra indicated he had unwittingly offended and he had been unaware that the subcontractors he had employed were acting dishonestly or illegally"". Mr Lloyd QC for the offender said that these statements were inaccurate and the result of a ""misunderstanding"" between the offender and the author of the presentence report. They were not relied upon and Counsel confirmed that his instructions were consistent with the agreed facts. This is however a good illustration of why courts ought be careful to accept statements of third parties when making findings in sentence proceedings.

[15] Therefore the summary of facts above is accepted as being an accurate version of the offending behaviour. The offender acted alone and lodged entirely false claims relating to properties where no insulation was installed.”

THE APPLICANT’S CASE ON SENTENCE


	
	The applicant did not give evidence before her Honour and no oral evidence was called on his behalf. However a number of documents were tendered in his case on sentence, including:
	



	
	a pre-sentence report;
	
	
	a psychological assessment prepared by Mae Abu Mahmoud, psychologist dated 10 March 2014;
	
	
	a report of Colleen Hirst, clinical psychologist;
	
	
	a letter written by the applicant to the sentencing judge dated 12 March 2014; and
	
	
	testimonial material touching upon (inter alia) the applicant’s work history.
	


HER HONOUR’S FINDINGS ON SENTENCE


	
	Her Honour noted that in his handwritten letter to the court the applicant had expressed regret for his offending and had said that he took full responsibility for it. However her Honour found (at ROS [27]; AB49) that even though the applicant had been employed in the period leading up to being sentenced, he had made no effort to repay any of the money which he had illegally obtained. This caused her Honour to express some doubt as to whether or not the applicant’s stated remorse was genuine.
	
	
	Her Honour made reference (at ROS [28]; AB49) to the applicant’s lengthy criminal history, in light of which she concluded that his prospects of rehabilitation were “hopeful rather than confirmed”. In expressing that view, her Honour did acknowledge that the applicant deserved recognition for the fact that he had attended counselling to address various issues in his personal life (at ROS [29]; AB49).
	
	
	Her Honour considered (at ROS [30]-[32]; AB45-50) the evidence of the applicant’s traumatic childhood at the hands of his father. However she found (at ROS [32]; AB50) that the applicant had the support of the remaining members of his family. She concluded that there was no causal connection between any aspect of the applicant’s background and his offending.
	
	
	Her Honour’s attention was drawn to sentences imposed in a number of other cases which were said to have involved comparable offending. She concluded (at ROS [37]; AB52) that amongst the considerations relevant to the determination of sentence were:
	



	
	the amount of $84,000.00 which the applicant obtained;
	
	
	the additional amount of $258,000.00 which he attempted to obtain;
	
	
	the period of the offending;
	
	
	the fact that the applicant did not cease his activity voluntarily; and
	
	
	the absence of any identifiable remorse or contrition.
	



	
	Her Honour noted (at ROS [38]; AB53) that it was necessary for any sentence to reflect both deterrent and punitive considerations. Ultimately her Honour concluded (at ROS [39]-[40]; AB 53):
	


“[39] In my view a full-time custodial sentence is the only appropriate way to deal with this matter. Taking into account the appropriate discount for a plea of guilty I propose to sentence the charges separately allowing for a short accumulation to reflect the course of conduct over a short period of time. Specific and general deterrence considerations require that a reasonable portion of that be served in a full time custodial setting. A period of supervision on his release will assist in his rehabilitation, by targeting his particular needs including addressing his reported gambling and drug issues, and ensuring employment in a legitimate industry.

[40] I propose to set a single recognisance release order that he be release (sic) and subject to supervision after serving 2 years.”

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in failing to give due weight to the delay in sentencing.

Ground 2 – Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant suffered no detriment due to the delay.

Ground 3 – Her Honour erred when considering the issue of delay, by imposed (sic) and evidentiary burden on the applicant in respect of employment.


	
	The parties dealt with these three grounds together, and I will adopt a similar course.
	


THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE SENTENCING JUDGE


	
	It was not in dispute before her Honour that the last of the offences committed by the applicant was on 5 February 2010. Thirteen months later, on 2 March 2011, a search warrant was executed on the applicant’s residential premises. In this regard, paragraph [54] of the agreed facts which were before her Honour (at AB 60) was in the following terms:
	


Statements made during the search warrant

[54] Unrecorded conversation with the offender during execution of a search warrant at the offender’s home on 2 March 2011 included the following conversation with Federal agent Tim Stainton:

Sabra: I was wondering when this would catch up with me.

Stainton: Tell me what you know about the insulation fraud.

Sabra: I didn’t make much money compared to other people, others made millions.

Stainton: How much did you make from it?

Sabra: Just over $200,000 I’ll plead guilty.

Stainton: Where is all the money now?

Sabra: I gambled it all away on pokies. I only started doing it to gamble on the pokies. Pokies music is the last thing I hear at night and the first thing I hear when I wake up in the morning.

Stainton: How did you find out about the scheme?

Sabra: The Lebanese community in Guildford. I started insulation as a legitimate job – but then found out there was good money in it.

Stainton: Do you have any documentation in relation to the work you claimed that you did?

Sabra: No, I threw it all out last year.”


	
	On 28 January 2012 the applicant was arrested and charged with a number of offences contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Those charges arose from items seized in the course of the execution of the search warrant on 2 March 2011. The applicant was refused bail in respect of those matters and appeared at the District Court for sentence on 22 June 2012, having spent almost 5 months in custody. The sentence imposed on that day was backdated to the date of the applicant’s arrest, and he was released.
	
	
	On 6 August 2012, approximately 17 months after the execution of the search warrant, the applicant was issued with a Court Attendance Notice (“CAN”) in relation to the offending which is the subject of the present appeal. On 3 October 2013, more than 12 months later, an indictment was presented in the District Court. 5½ months after that, the matter first came before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	It appears that the slow progress of the matter after the issue of the CAN was attributable to the fact that despite his admissions at the time of the execution of the search warrant, the applicant initially pleaded not guilty. In these circumstances counsel for the applicant in this Court made it clear that the period of delay relied upon in support of Grounds 1, 2 and 3 was the period of approximately 17 months which elapsed between the execution of the search warrant and the issue of the CAN. When asked by the sentencing Judge to explain that delay, the Crown Prosecutor responded in the following terms (AB 23):
	


“CROWN: I’m instructed your Honour that after the scheme was ceased there were 3,818 installers suspected of having made fraudulent claims and the department responsible for the investigation has 13 staff. That in my submission – that’s as far as I can put that.

HER HONOUR: Okay, so lack of resources in the investigation department.

CROWN: Yes. We certainly agree with my friend its certainly not Mr Sabra’s fault. It’s a consequence of the type of offence if I can put it that way.

HER HONOUR: Sure.”


	
	The evidence of the effect of the delay upon the applicant was limited to the following part of his statement to the sentencing judge (AB 113):
	


“I still remember that when the police came to my house I was terrified as I knew I was going to prison. I remember looking at my mother who was so disappointed in me and my brother Ahmed, telling me off for causing nothing but problems for the family and being nothing but a junkie.

My feelings only got worse when police charged me for some Ice and other items that they found in my bedroom when they were searching my house. Not a day went by when I didn’t regret my actions and wait for the police to come and charge me for these offences.

Eventually, once I was released from prison and finished my court cases for supplying Ice the police charged me for these offences.”

HER HONOUR’S FINDINGS IN RESPECT OF DELAY


	
	Her Honour dealt with the issue of delay commencing at ROS [22] (AB 46):
	


“Delay

22. It took considerable time for the Commonwealth to investigate these fraudulent claims and payments. The last claim was lodged in February 2010 when the scheme shut down, due to various concerns, including fraud. On 2 March 2011 a search warrant was executed at the offender's premises. Not much of relevance was located it seems, but drugs for which he has since been charged, convicted and served a sentence were discovered. He admitted his involvement in this offence and told investigators that he had not kept any documents relative to the claims and that he'd spent all of the money that he had received. He did not otherwise participate in an interview.

23. In August 2012, 2 1/2 years after lodging the last claim the offender was charged with these offences. He claims that delay has caused difficulty. It is submitted that if he was dealt with at the same time as he was dealt with for the drug matters referred to above, there would have been a potential for an accumulation of sentences to be considered. The offender received a 9 month sentence for the drug supply matters and was released on the day of sentence, having then served nearly 5 months. I have had access to his Honour Judge Keleman's reasons for decision. The offender was the beneficiary of a finding of special circumstances. I do not consider that if these matters had been dealt with at the same time accumulation of sentences would have resulted in a different outcome in terms of time served.

24. The delay in charging the offender in this matter is not well explained. Even taking into account the very long delay between the offender committing the offences and being discovered (and there is no viable explanation for that) there was a further 18 months delay in between the search warrant being executed and the charges being laid. The Commonwealth's only explanation is that there were numerous offences committed by many people and very few investigatory staff allocated. While I do not doubt the accuracy of the explanation, it is not satisfactory. I do not understand how or why a fraud of such proportions, apparently part of a series of frauds committed by others, was not the subject of intense and proactive investigation.

25. It was submitted that the delay has caused the offender to become anxious and concerned. I accept this would be a natural response. On the other hand the delay has given him the opportunity to provide evidence to the court that he has really changed his way of life, as it was submitted he has. In proceedings before Judge Keleman in June 2012, he provided evidence that he then could be employed as a motor trimmer on his release from custody. He was released that day. There is no evidence of employment in that or any other capacity and only evidence I have of employment is as a concreter, from January this year.

26. The delay, while unsatisfactory and against the interests of justice, has not been of detriment to the offender” (emphasis added in each case).

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that in concluding (at ROS [26]; AB n48) that the delay had not been of detriment to the applicant, her Honour had erred. It was pointed out, in particular, that her Honour had previously found that the delay had caused the applicant anxiety and concern. It was further submitted that her Honour had erroneously ignored those matters when determining sentence.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the overall effect of her Honour’s conclusions was that in order for delay to be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence, it was necessary for an offender to demonstrate that such delay had caused something more than mere anxiety and concern. It was submitted that such approach disclosed error and was contrary to authority. Counsel submitted that the fact that the applicant had not established any greater degree of detrimental effect arising from the delay did not mean that such detrimental effect as he did establish was irrelevant and of no weight. It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, the period of delay, and the consequences to the applicant which were found by her Honour to have resulted from it, ought to have resulted in a substantial degree of leniency being afforded to the applicant on sentence.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	The Crown accepted that the sentencing judge found that the delay had caused the applicant to be anxious and concerned. However, the Crown submitted that in concluding that this was not a factor which mitigated an otherwise appropriate sentence her Honour had not erred.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that anxiety, suspense and concern arising from delay were properly regarded as “generic” bases for mitigating a sentence. It was submitted that her Honour had correctly concluded that consequences of that nature were not generally a reason to mitigate a sentence, in the absence of evidence that the delay had brought about some substantial additional change in an offender’s circumstances, be it in terms of an interruption to rehabilitation or otherwise.
	
	
	In support of that position the Crown relied upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia R v Pickard [2011] SASCFC 134, and in particular upon the judgment of Blue J (commencing at [95]). I have considered this judgment below.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, Street CJ said (at 519):
	


“ … where there has been a lengthy postponement, whetherdue to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requiresweight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of hisearlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state ofuncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course hecomes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact thatsentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, callsfor a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach —passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often leadto considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a

dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.”


	
	The decision in Todd was referred to by the plurality (Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) in Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 in the following terms (at 66):
	


“The long deferment of the trial or punishment of an offender, with the consequent uncertainty as to what will happen to him, raise considerations of fairness to an offender which must be taken into consideration when the second court is determining an appropriate head sentence.”


	
	The decisions in both Mill and Todd considered the impact and relevance of delay arising from the fact that an offender had served a sentence in one state, at the expiration of which he was sentenced for offences in another state. Those circumstances are obviously quite different from those in the present case. However, later decisions make it clear that the relevance of delay on sentence is not confined to circumstances of that nature.
	
	
	In Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 a delay arose solely as a consequence of tardiness on the part of the authorities in proceeding to arrest the offender and charge him. Wood CJ at CL said (at [16]-[17]; 306):
	


“[16] The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: See, in addition to Todd and Mill, the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 24 February 1998).”

[17] The present was not a case where the applicant had been arrested and had spent a long time awaiting sentence, or in a state of suspense as to whether he might be charged; nor is it a case where he had shown any commitment towards rehabilitation after having realised the error of his ways. However, it remains the fact that it is highly desirable that the prosecuting authorities act promptly where they have evidence of serious criminality. If they fail to do so, then they must expect that circumstance to be taken into account on sentencing. It is in the public interest that those who are suspected of serious criminality be brought to justice and be brought to justice quickly, particularly where there is a strong case available against them. I will return to this fact later, because it does seem to me that insufficient weight was given to it in the sentencing process.”


	
	Ultimately, with the concurrence of Bell J (as her Honour then was) and Smart AJ his Honour found (at [26]; 308) that the sentence imposed was “outside the legitimate range once allowance (was) made for the inordinate and unexpected delay in the prosecution of the appellant”.
	
	
	In expressing those conclusions, his Honour made reference (at [16]) to another decision of this Court in King v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 288 where Hunt CJ at CL said (at 294):
	


“The fourth matter argued was that the judge failed to take into account the lengthy delay which had occurred between the offence and the sentence. Such delay, for whatever reason, requires weight to be given to the state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to the prisoner when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and it calls for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach.”


	
	The proposition that delay which gives rise to uncertainty, suspense and anxiety is a matter deserving of weight on sentence was adopted by Vincent AJA in the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Schwabegger [1998] 4 VR 649 at 659:
	


“Delay which is not attributable to the offender, of course, constitutes “a powerful mitigatory factor”: R. v Liang and Li (1995) 124 F.L.R. 350 at 356; 82 A. Crim. R. 39 at 45. It can have relevance at a number of levels. In Duncan v R. (1983) 47 A.L.R. 746; 9 A. Crim. R. 354 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia stated at A.L.R. 749; A. Crim. R. 356-7:

‘… where, prior to sentence, there has been a lengthy process of rehabilitation and the evidence does not indicate a need to protect society from the applicant, the punitive and deterrent aspects of the sentencing process should not be allowed to prevail so as to possibly destroy the results of that rehabilitation.

… The very fact of the long delay in bringing the matter to court which led the applicant to have this matter hanging over his head for nearly four years is rightly prayed in aid on his behalf.’

Further, there is, in my opinion, a serious incongruity between the assertion that an offence is serious and that the courts must, through the sentences they impose, endeavour to limit its incidence, on the one hand, and such a leisurely progression of the criminal justice proceedings which follow its commission that literally years pass before the matter comes before the court, on the other. For a number of reasons, the investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct should be conducted as quickly as is reasonably practicable if the objectives of the system are to be attained. Additionally, a legitimate sense of unfairness can develop when the criminal justice process proceeds in what can be perceived as too leisurely a fashion.”


	
	In R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6 Mason P (with the concurrence of R S Hulme and Hidden JJ) expressly agreed (at [17]) with the observations of Vincent AJA in Schwabegger before saying (at [18]):
	


“[18] One hopes that the present circumstances are fairly unique. If they are not, then the practice of the Australian Taxation Office and/or the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must change. … The public interest as well as the legitimate private interests of the offender require a matter such as this to be brought to justice quickly. A failure by the authorities to do so will mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence.”


	
	The delay considered by the Court in Gay was substantially greater, and the admissions made by the offender far more extensive, than in the present case. However what is significant is that Mason P, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, expressly agreed with the proposition that for the purpose of sentencing, delay can have relevance at a number of levels, including situations in which it has resulted in matters “hanging over the head” of an offender for a long period.
	
	
	More recently, in Giourtalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 216 Bathurst CJ considered the relevance of delay on sentence in a case involving allegations of complex fraud. His Honour said (at [1787]-[1788]):
	


“[1787] There is no doubt that delay in the prosecution of an offence in many cases will be a matter to be taken into account in imposing sentence on the convicted person. As stated in Todd supra, weight needs to be given in those circumstances to the progress of rehabilitation during the period of the delay and the uncertainty imposed on the convicted person during such period. Each of Todd and Mill were cases where the delay was occasioned by the offender serving sentences for cross border crimes of the same nature and committed at around the same time as the offences the subject of the sentence proceedings. In those circumstances principles of totality were also relevant.

[1788] However, the principle is not limited to those circumstances: R v Schwabegger (1998) 4 VR 649 at 655, 659; R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6; (2002) 49 ATR 78 at [15]-[18].”


	
	His Honour proceeded to cite the decision in R v Scook [2008] WASCA 114 where Buss JA (at [57]-[65]) summarised a number of principles governing the relevance of delay on sentence. In doing so, Buss JA pointed out that whilst such principles were not intended to be exhaustive or inflexible, they included the principle that delay will ordinarily be a mitigating factor on sentence where:
	



	
	it has resulted in significant stress for the offender, or left him or her, to a significant degree, in uncertain suspense; or
	
	
	during the period of delay, the offender has adopted a reasonable expectation that he or she would not be charged, or that a pending prosecution would not proceed, and the offender has ordered his or her affairs based on the faith of that expectation.
	



	
	As I have previously noted, the Crown before this Court relied upon the judgment of Blue J in Pickard (supra) where his Honour said (at [95]):
	


“[95] The following general principles have been established as to whether or not unnecessary delay in the investigation and prosecution of an offence is a factor to be taken into account in favour of the defendant.

1.  Mere unnecessary delay, without being coupled with relevant changes occurring during the delay, is not usually a reason in itself to reduce or suspend a sentence if otherwise indicated (although this will obviously depend on the length of the delay and the particular circumstances)

2. Where, during the period of the unnecessary delay, the defendant has taken major steps in the progress of his or her life resulting in a substantial change in his or her personal circumstances, the combined effect of the unnecessary delay and the changed life circumstances may play a dominant role in the determination of an appropriate sentence.

3. Where, by the time of sentencing, the defendant has undergone rehabilitation, the combined effect of the unnecessary delay and rehabilitation will usually be taken into account in favour of the defendant.

4. The existence of genuine remorse and contrition are taken into account in conjunction with, or as part of, rehabilitation”(emphasis in original).


	
	The Crown submitted that the present case fell squarely within the first principle set out by Blue J. However the Crown accepted that even allowing for the level of generality at which his Honour had approached the matter, there may be some tension between that first principle and other decisions of this Court to which I have referred.
	
	
	In the terms in which Blue J articulated it, the first principle tends to suggest that as a general proposition, a period of delay is unlikely to operate to mitigate a sentence unless an offender can demonstrate that it has caused some particular change in his or her circumstances, over and above mere suspense or anxiety. It must be acknowledged that his Honour pointed out that much would depend upon the circumstances of the case, and specifically spoke in general terms, consistent with the flexible approach and that the authorities emphasise must be taken. That said, in my view the suggestion conveyed by the first of the principles his Honour set out is not wholly consistent with the decisions of this Court in Blanco, King, Gay and Giourtalis. Generally speaking, those decisions support the proposition that delay can be relevant at a number of levels, and that it can operate to mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence in the absence of evidence that it caused a particular change in an offender’s circumstances.
	
	
	In oral submissions before this Court, the Crown conceded that in the present case her Honour had found that the delay had caused anxiety and concern to the applicant. The Crown accepted that in those circumstances the delay was a relevant factor on sentence. However it is clear from her Honour’s judgment that she effectively dismissed delay as a relevant consideration and afforded it no weight. In my view, having found that the delay had caused the applicant anxiety and concern, her Honour should have had regard to it when determining sentence. Her failure to do so was an error. It follows that Ground 1 is made out.
	
	
	In my view, a further error arises from her Honour’s reasons. Her Honour concluded (at ROS [25]; AB47) that the delay had caused the applicant to become anxious and concerned. In reaching that finding, her Honour must have accepted the applicant’s assertions in his statement (set out at [20] above), that being the sole evidence of the effect of the delay upon him. Having accepted that evidence, her Honour then concluded (at ROS [26]; AB48) that the applicant had failed to establish that the delay was to his detriment. In my view, those two conclusions cannot sit comfortably together. Given what the applicant had said (which her Honour must have accepted) the anxiety and concern brought about by the delay must have been detrimental to him, at least to some degree.
	
	
	For these reasons Ground 2 is made out.
	
	
	In light of the submissions made before this Court, there is one further matter arising from Grounds 1 and 2 to which I should refer. Her Honour’s reasons (at ROS [25]-[26]; AB 47-48) suggest that she may have tended to the view that before delay could be taken into account, consequences greater than the anxiety and concern which she had found needed to be established. That approach may be consistent with the first principle enunciated by Blue J in Pickard (supra). However, is not wholly consistent with previous judgments of this Court. The resolution of the present appeal does not depend upon interpreting her Honour’s reasons in that way. However, in light of the submissions made by the parties, the Court’s position on the issue of the relevance of delay on sentence, where such delay is not attributable to the offender, should be clearly stated.
	
	
	Delay which is not attributable to an offender may be relevant on sentence at a number of different levels. Ordinarily, such delay will be a mitigating factor if (as in the present case) it has resulted in significant stress to the offender, or has left him or her, to a significant degree, in a state of uncertain suspense. Where there is evidence that delay has led to consequences being visited upon an offender which are adverse to his or her circumstances and which are over and above stress and anxiety, be those consequences in the nature of interrupted rehabilitation or otherwise, then the weight to be given to such delay in the sentencing process will obviously be greater. But that is not to say that an offender must be able to establish consequences of that kind before delay can become relevant at all. To so conclude would be contrary to the weight of previous authority in this Court.
	
	
	Ground 3 asserts that her Honour erred by imposing what was described as an “evidentiary burden” on the applicant in respect of employment when considering the issue of delay. How the applicant put this ground was not entirely clear, although it was apparent that it had its genesis in ROS [25] (AB47) in which her Honour made references to the applicant’s employment.
	
	
	If her Honour did impose some evidentiary burden upon the applicant in respect of the issue of delay generally, she did not err in doing so. Delay was plainly a matter which was relied upon by the applicant as a mitigating factor. If there are mitigating circumstances which a judge proposes to take into account in favour of an offender on sentence, those matters must be established by the offender on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27].
	
	
	For these reasons Ground 3 is not made out.
	
	
	Because I have found error in respect of Grounds 1 and 2, the Court’s power in s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is enlivened. I have considered this issue further below.
	


GROUND 4 – Her Honour erred in failing to reduce the total sentence on principles of totality.

GROUND 5 – Her Honour erred in imposing a non-parole period of approximately 70% of the total sentence.

GROUND 6 – Her Honour erred in partially accumulating the sentences


	
	Once again, the parties dealt with these grounds together and I have adopted the same course.
	


HER HONOUR’S FINDINGS


	
	At ROS [23]; AB 47 her Honour said:
	


“23. In August 2012, 2½ years after lodging the last claim the offender was charged with these offences. He claims that delay has caused difficulty. It is submitted that if he was dealt with at the same time as he was dealt with for the drug matters referred to above, there would have been a potential for an accumulation of sentences to be considered. The offender received a 9 month sentence for the drug supply matters and was released on the day of sentence, having then served nearly 5 months. I have had access to his Honour Judge Keleman's reasons for decision. The offender was the beneficiary of a finding of special circumstances. I do not consider that if these matters had been dealt with at the same time accumulation of sentences would have resulted in a different outcome in terms of time served.”


	
	Subsequently, her Honour said (ROS [37] and following; AB 52-53):
	


“[37] The sentencing considerations in this case relate to the amount of the fraud, which was substantial. A total of $84,000 was paid to Mr Sabra and a further $258,000 was approved to be paid. Each and every one of his claims was false. The amount of time over which the offences occurred was relatively short. The offender did not cease his activity voluntarily. The scheme was stopped because of the level of concern about the operation of the scheme. The offender has expressed remorse and contrition but there is no identifiable evidence of that.

[38] In tax fraud cases, the deterrent and punitive effects of sentences for serious tax fraud must be reflected both in the head sentence and also in any provision for earlier release from custody (Hili v The Queen at 41).

[39] In my view a full-time custodial sentence is the only appropriate way to deal with this matter. Taking into account the appropriate discount for a plea of guilty I propose to sentence the charges separately allowing for a short accumulation to reflect the course of conduct over a short period of time. Specific and general deterrence considerations require that a reasonable portion of that be served in a full time custodial setting. A period of supervision on his release will assist in his rehabilitation, by targeting his particular needs including addressing his reported gambling and drug issues, and ensuring employment in a legitimate industry.

[40] I propose to set a single recognisance release order that he be release and subject to supervision after serving 2 years.”

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT


	
	As to Ground 4, the applicant submitted that her Honour’s conclusion that no different outcome would have resulted had all matters been dealt with at the same time was an error. It was submitted that the applicant had lost the opportunity for one sentence to be passed in respect of all matters, and had also lost the opportunity for consideration of what was said to be an appropriate apportionment between the non-parole period and the total sentence.
	
	
	As to Ground 5, whilst acknowledging that there was no “normal” ratio between a head sentence and the period of release on a recognizance release order, counsel for the applicant submitted that her Honour’s approach was inconsistent with the general ratio adopted when sentencing for Commonwealth offences.
	
	
	As to Ground 6, it was submitted that in circumstances where the applicant had engaged in essentially the same conduct over a continuous period, her Honour had erred in accumulating, even to a minimal degree, the sentences which she imposed. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that questions of accumulation are necessarily discretionary. However, he submitted on behalf of the applicant that there was no reasonable basis for any accumulation at all, and that the sentences ought to have been wholly concurrent.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	In terms of Ground 4, the Crown pointed out that the offences dealt with in June 2014 had been brought to light as a consequence of the execution of the search warrant in relation to the investigation of the present offences. The Crown submitted that the fact that evidence was located at that time which resulted in discreet charges being laid against the applicant was largely, if not completely, irrelevant to the question of how any sentence(s) for those and any other offences might be structured. The Crown pointed to the fact that the offences which are the subject of this appeal, and those dealt with in June 2014, were completely unrelated in any factual sense.
	
	
	As to Ground 5, the Crown submitted that no error had been established. It was submitted that part of her Honour’s function was to impose a sentence which incorporated a minimum term which was to be served, and that the mere fact that the sentence imposed by her Honour required the applicant to serve 70 per cent of the head sentence before being released did not, of itself, reflect error.
	
	
	In respect of Ground 6, the Crown relied on the fact that the sentences imposed were largely cumulative in any event. It was submitted that any sentence imposed was required to reflect the total criminality for which the applicant was to be sentenced. It was submitted the structure of the sentences, and the sentences themselves, met that test and that it remained within her Honour’s discretion to partially accumulate the sentences as she did.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38, Hall J (at [52]) made reference to the decision of Howie J in R v Cahyadi [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 in which his Honour (commencing at [27]) articulated a number of general principles regarding the structure of sentences. Amongst those principles are the following:
	
	
	(i)   questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary;
	
	
	(ii)   whether sentences in respect of two or more offences committed in the course of a single episode, a criminal enterprise or a particular day, should be concurrent or cumulative is to be determined by principles of totality, and the relevant factors to be taken into account in the application of those principles;
	
	
	(iii)   in applying principles of totality, the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other;
	


(iv)   if the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences;

(v)   if not, the sentences should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.


	
	In terms of Ground 4, what may or may not have happened had the entirety of the charges laid against the applicant following the execution of the search warrant been dealt with together is largely speculative. So much was conceded by counsel for the appellant before this Court. However, as the two sets of offences related to quite separate criminality, there is a reasonable expectation that consistent with the principles in [60](iv) and (v) above, there would have been at least some accumulation. In these circumstances Ground 4 is not made out.
	
	
	As to Ground 5, in determining the period in which the applicant would be required to remain in custody before release, her Honour was doing no more than determining the minimum term which she considered was required to be served in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [40]-[44]. The submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant in support of Ground 5 assume that there is some starting point in terms of setting a ratio between the head sentence and the period during which an offender will be subject to a recognizance release order. Such an approach is directly contrary to the judgment of the plurality in Hili (supra) at [44] where it was said:
	


“ … there neither is, nor should be, a judicially determined norm or starting point (whether expressed as a percentage of the head sentence, or otherwise) for the period of imprisonment that a federal offender should actually serve in prison before release on a recognizance release order. … It is wrong to begin from some assumed starting point and then seek to identify “special circumstances”. Rather, a sentencing judge should determine the length of sentence to be served before a recognizance release order takes effect …”


	
	In these circumstances, Ground 5 is not made out.
	
	
	As to Ground 6, I am not satisfied that any error has been made out. In Cahyadi (supra) Howie J said (at [26] and [27]):
	


“[26] The Crown accepts that there were some common features of the three offences in that the applicant was in the business of being able to provide and use false documentation for the purposes of illegal banking transactions. However, the assertion on behalf of the applicant that it was a relevant factor that all of the documentation relevant to the offending which was found in the search of the applicant’s premises should be rejected. The fact that the evidence of a number of discrete offences is located in the one place is completely irrelevant to any question of how the sentences for those offences should be imposed.

[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	More recently in Panchal v R; R v Panchal [2014] NSWCCA 275 this Court (Leeming JA, Fullerton and Bellew JJ) said (at [81]):
	
	
	“It is well recognised that, subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation and concurrency are discretionary and that sentencing judges may exercise their discretion in differing ways without either being wrong: LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24]. It is equally as well recognised that while separate offences committed in the course of the one criminal episode may point to concurrent sentences being imposed, this will not be the inevitable sentencing result. The critical question in every case is whether an order for concurrency is productive of a sentence that reflects or comprehends the totality of the criminality involved in a single episode of offending or a single course of criminal conduct”.
	
	
	Having referred to the decision in Cahyadi, the Court (citing the decision of Rothman J in JT v R [2012] NSWCCA 133) then observed (at [83]):
	
	
	“The question in any given case as to whether there ought to be an order for concurrency in whole or in part, calls for a discretionary judgment”.
	
	
	It is evident that by reference to principles of totality, her Honour considered it appropriate to marginally accumulate the sentences for the offences of attempt upon the sentences for the offences of obtaining a benefit. It was clearly within her Honour’s discretion to approach the matter in that way, and no miscarriage of that discretion has been established. For all of these reasons Ground 6 is not made out.
	


GROUND 7 – The sentence is manifestly excessive

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT


	
	Whilst acknowledging the objective seriousness of the offending, counsel for the applicant placed significant reliance upon sentences imposed in other cases of what was said to be comparable offending, in order to demonstrate what was said to be the manifest excess of the sentence imposed by her Honour. In addition, he pointed to what he submitted was the significant effect of the delay, something to which her Honour had ascribed no weight.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	The Crown submitted that the objective criminality of the applicant’s offending was high and the amount of money involved was significant. Whilst the Crown acknowledged that the sentences imposed on the applicant were greater than those imposed in the suggested comparable cases, it was pointed out that each of those other cases involved fewer acts of fraudulent conduct. Implicit in this submission was the proposition that each case must be determined on its own facts, and that there are necessarily restrictions upon using, for comparative purposes, the outcomes of other cases.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that taking into account all relevant factors, the sentence imposed by her Honour was within the appropriate range of sentencing discretion.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In order to make out this ground, the applicant must establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.
	
	
	The applicant’s offending resulted in a sum of $84,000.00 being dishonestly obtained. He also submitted claims which, had they been processed and paid, would have resulted in a further $258,000.00 being paid to him. In offending of this nature, the amount involved is a significant consideration on sentence: R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435 per Lee J, Newman and Loveday JJ agreeing.
	
	
	It is also relevant to consider the period over which the offending occurred. In the present case, although the period was one of only 7 weeks, the applicant lodged almost 300 fraudulent claims in that time, 70 of which resulted in the payment of money. The offending was consistent and persistent over that period of time: Hawkins (supra) at 435 per Lee J. Further, as the sentencing judge correctly pointed out (at ROS [37]; AB52) the applicant did not cease his offending voluntarily. Rather, the offending ceased because the scheme under which the claims were being made was itself discontinued. Moreover, no issue has been taken with her Honour’s finding that the applicant showed little or no remorse.
	
	
	The applicant’s offending necessarily involved some degree of planning. Businesses seeking the payment of the relevant rebate were required to register and provide proof of various matters before any claims could be lodged. Upon successful registration, a business was issued with a unique user id together with a password, both of which were required to be entered when lodging a claim for payment (see agreed facts at para [14]-[16]; AB 56). The applicant applied to have his business approved as a registered installer and in accordance with the above procedure, was sent the material necessary to enable him to make claims. The necessary password was sent to him on 17 December 2009. Although the applicant stated in his letter to the sentencing judge (AB 113) that he had started undertaking insulation work as a “legitimate business”, the first of the offences occurred less than three weeks after he had been sent the password which he needed to be able to make claims.
	
	
	The applicant has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 2001 which contains repeated entries for various offences of dishonesty including:
	



	
	robbery in company;
	
	
	stealing;
	
	
	receiving stolen property;
	
	
	obtaining money by deception;
	
	
	knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	



	
	Further, and on his own admission, the applicant used the money to fund his drug and gambling habits, and saw his offending as an easy way to make money. In his letter to the sentencing judge he stated:
	


“I realised that it would be easy to cheat the home insulation program by simply lodging claims on line for work which I didn’t do. After all, I thought I was only stealing from the Government who had plenty of money and no one would ever really find out”.


	
	The only available conclusion is that the applicant’s offending was motivated by greed. In light of his criminal history, and his motivation, there was a clear need for any sentence to reflect a strong measure of specific deterrence: R v Alimic [2006] VSCA 273 at [26] per Nettle JA (as his Honour then was), Warren CJ and Redlich JA agreeing. General deterrence was also an important consideration given the nature of the offending: Director of Public Prosecutions v Milne [2001] VSCA 93 at [12]-[13] as was the difficulty of detecting such offending: R v Purdon CCA (NSW) 27 March 1991, unreported. On the applicant’s own admission, the difficulty associated with detecting offending of this kind formed part of his motivation.
	
	
	The applicant’s position in support of this ground was based, to a large extent, upon comparing the sentences imposed in other cases involving what was said to be comparable offending. This Court has repeatedly warned of the difficulties which are prone to arise from a comparison of a number of cases in an attempt to show some established sentencing range for particular offences: Eriyo v R [2015] NSWCCA 16 at [31] per Davies J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing) citing MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41]-[44] per Bellew J (Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreeing) and Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264 at [74]-[78] per Gleeson JA (Bellew and Schmidt JJ agreeing). I do not propose to engage in any lengthy analysis of the cases which were before her Honour. As the Crown pointed out, the cases are fundamentally distinguishable in any event.
	
	
	I accept, as her Honour did, that the delay caused the applicant anxiety and concern over a significant period of time. For at least part of that period he was incarcerated on other charges, no doubt wondering when he would be charged with the present offending. For the reasons I have already expressed, the applicant was entitled to have those factors taken into account on sentence. There was also evidence before her Honour that the applicant had taken some steps towards rehabilitation. In her report of 10 March 2014, Ms Mahmoud found (AB 101) that the applicant was moderately depressed but had formulated some “defined goals for his life”. However, even when full weight is given to those observations it is difficult, in light of the applicant’s criminal history, to cavil with the assessment of the sentencing judge that his prospects of rehabilitation were “hopeful rather than confirmed” (ROS [28]; AB 49).
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, and particularly given the seriousness of the offending, the amount involved, the absence of remorse and the need for both general and specific deterrence, I am not persuaded that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. It follows that Ground 7 is not made out.
	


IS SOME OTHER SENTENCE WARRANTED IN LAW?


	
	Notwithstanding the view I have reached in respect of Ground 7, given that I have found error in respect of Grounds 1 and 2, s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is enlivened.
	
	
	The decision of the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37 makes it clear that once error is established, the sentencing discretion is to be exercised afresh by this Court, taking into account all relevant considerations. The Court’s power was explained this way (at [42]):
	


“[42] Spigelman CJ’s analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be “warranted in law”. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not “warranted in law” unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion.”


	
	The Court went on to say (at [43]):
	


“[43] After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the court required to re-sentence. Nor is the court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender’s appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.”


	
	The applicant does not have to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive in order for the Court to exercise its discretion in his favour under s. 6(3). The judgment in Kentwell makes it clear that it is the function of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh when error is established.
	
	
	An affidavit of the applicant of 13 February 2015 was tendered before the Court. I have taken the contents of that affidavit into account. The applicant has clearly continued his efforts towards rehabilitation whilst in custody. He has managed to obtain employment and undertake an associated course of study. He has not come under notice for any disciplinary offence.
	
	
	However, giving weight to all of the relevant factors which I have considered in the context of Ground 7, and in the exercise of my independent discretion, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed is the appropriate one. I am not satisfied that any other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. This was serious offending, involving a substantial loss to the revenue. It was motivated by greed, and committed by a person with a substantial history of offences of dishonesty.
	
	
	Although the observations of the plurality in Hili (at [63]) were made in the context of a taxation fraud, they are necessarily applicable to revenue fraud in general. They are particularly apt in the present case:
	


“[63] The applicants’ offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognizance release orders that were made.”

ORDERS


	
	In view of the above I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2766205,R v Scott (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 459,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The Crown seeks to lead evidence arising from the discovery of a letter evidently from the accused to the witness Kayla Houston, and apparently conveyed by him to her yesterday, and of her reply, which was seized from her before it was delivered to the accused.
	
	
	The accused and Ms Houston were accommodated in the holding cells at the courthouse yesterday and in some way used that proximity to communicate.
	
	
	Mr Cavanagh for the accused objects to the evidence.
	
	
	The letter from the accused, which is Marked For Identification (MFI) 22, is an apparent attempt by him to influence Ms Houston’s testimony in the trial. He refers to the trial all coming down to her and her evidence, and urges that if she says the “right thing” he will “beat the trial”.
	
	
	Ms Houston’s response makes her continuing allegiance to the accused plain. She refers to her resolve in the letter to “always protect” Mr Scott.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to lead the evidence as relevant to consciousness of guilt. The accused concedes the relevance and admissibility of the evidence but submits that the evidence is so prejudicial that it should be excluded from evidence, as the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.
	
	
	The probative value is high in my view. Ms Houston is a witness of some significance. An attempt by the accused to influence her evidence is clearly capable of contributing to proof of the charge in that it is conduct indicative of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	To undertake such a risky manoeuvre as the transference of a letter, at the courthouse, and during the trial, when both the accused and the witness were being held in the same facility, in open cells that were monitored, is indeed strongly indicative of a consciousness of guilt. It may be that such extraordinary action could arise from nothing more than panic in an unsophisticated but innocent individual, but that would ordinarily be a matter for a jury to assess.
	
	
	The disputed evidence has relevance in two other ways. Firstly, the Crown can rely upon it to rebut any defence of self defence or indeed to rebut any defence which would seek to blame Hayley Orchard for the death of Mr Dehn. Secondly, the evidence is relevant to an assessment of the evidence given before the jury by Kayla Houston.
	
	
	The timing of the advent of the letters and how that might have had an impact on the evidence Ms Houston gave is a relevant consideration to that latter feature. Prior to lunch yesterday, when it appears this correspondence was discovered, Ms Houston gave evidence that appeared to be quite compromised by the failure of memory.
	
	
	After lunch, when she was aware that the existence of the letters was known, her memory seemed to improve. It is reasonable to infer that the improvement is attributable to her awareness that the authorities were in possession of the accused’s letter and were thus aware of his exhortation to her to give evidence in such a way that he could “beat the trial”.
	
	
	This all goes back to the probative value of the evidence and its high degree of probative value in my assessment. The question is whether the high degree of probative value of that evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect such that it could be unfair or would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence. Mr Cavanagh relies upon s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 in that regard.
	
	
	There is a prejudicial effect in the receipt of this evidence as there is with any evidence that tends to prove the Crown case against the accused. The potential effect this evidence will or may have, needs however to be assessed in the context of other evidence and having regard to the overall manner in which the trial has been conducted by the parties.
	
	
	I assume the accused’s case is one of self-defence, although there may also be an issue as to the liability of Hayley Orchard, having regard to some of the telephone intercept material and some of the evidence about the accused’s claims in this regard. There has already been a considerable amount of telephone intercept evidence with all but one call admitted without objection, in which the accused appears to be seeking to interfere with Crown witnesses in an endeavour to have them alter evidence, or even to prevent them from testifying by arranging for them to be given what has been referred to as a hot shot, that is, to be killed.
	
	
	The jury could be under no misapprehension as to that evidence; the potential meaning of the evidence or what its relevance to the question of proof of guilt will ultimately be is up to them. In light of that evidence admitted without objection, I see no additional prejudicial effect attaching to the disputed evidence, or prejudicial effect which is sufficiently unfair to the accused as to give rise to its exclusion from evidence.
	
	
	As noted the evidence of the telephone intercepts has been lead without objection and that is the context in which this evidence needs to be considered. The evidence of the letters is of the same nature as that of the telephone intercept material, although of a less dramatic character in my assessment, in that it does not contain any reference to an attempt to “staunch” or intimidate a witness.
	
	
	On balance I do not think the evidence is unfairly prejudicial. That it is evidence the accused has handed to the Crown goes without saying. I would not refuse to admit the evidence in the exercise of my discretion.
	
	
	Following the decision to admit the evidence of the letters, the parties took the view that Ms Houston was an unfavourable witness and would be so characterised on any application to this Court to declare her such. My understanding, from raising it with the parties is that counsel discussed the question of adducing further evidence from Ms Houston yesterday afternoon, and the manner in which she has given her evidence in chief today has been by consent.

		23 April 2015",2015-03-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766210,Sarina v Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 196,"Judgment


	
	Pursuant to rr 14.28 and 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”), the defendants seek a separate trial as to the capacity and defamatory meaning of imputations pleaded and to strike out imputations the form of which is embarrassing. These are my reasons for orders made on 26 March 2015.
	


The relevant principles


	
	Where a separate trial of the capacity of imputations is sought, it must be sought pursuant to UCPR r 28.2: Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Hibbert [2015] NSWCA 13.
	
	
	The principles for determining objections to capacity are explained in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 at [6], Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 and Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 (“Corby”) at [135]-[136]. In Corby, the court held that the determination of capacity is a test of generosity, and not of parsimony, as well as being a “matter of impression”, in that “the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant” (citing Berezovsky v Forbes [2001] EWCA Civ 1251 at [16]).
	


Imputations of guilt and suspicion of guilt


	
	Particular problems arise in publications where the defendant seeks to assert that the matter complained of connotes reasonable suspicion as opposed to guilt.
	
	
	First, it should be noted that imputations that a person is reasonably suspected by the police or by some other investigatory organisation, such as the ICAC (Greig v WIN Television NSW Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 632) are capable of being defamatory because the status and official role of that entity is enough in itself for the ordinary reasonable reader to conclude that the person is either guilty of the conduct alleged, or has at least conducted themselves in such a way as to warrant the suspicion: Alex v Gridneff [2013] NSWSC 2025 at [17].
	
	
	The correct approach to capacity issues where the capacity of imputations of guilt is challenged, as explained in Corby at [135]-[136], requires careful examination of any assertion that the antidote (in this case, the fact that police had dropped the charges) could outweigh the bane, as this is generally a jury issue. An increasing number of Australian decisions refer, in this exercise, to what are commonly called Chase level 1 and Chase level 2 imputations (Chase v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1772; [2003] EMLR 11 (“Chase”) at [45]). Chase level 1 imputations of outright guilt are pleaded (see R Parkes QC; Professor A Mullis; G Busuttil; A Speker; A Scott; C Strong, Gatley On Libel and Slander (12th ed, 2013, Sweet & Maxwell) at [11.13]), and the question is whether they, or alternatively Chase level 2 imputations of reasonable grounds for suspicion, arise: see the discussion of such imputations at the capacity stage in Moran v Schwartz Publishing Pty Ltd [2014] WASC 334 at [32].
	


Defamatory meaning


	
	The relevant principles for the determination of defamatory meaning are set out in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 686 – 9 by Hutley JA. The imputation in those proceedings, where the plaintiff was a medical practitioner, was that the plaintiff was an abortionist. The legality of abortion was irrelevant to the defamatory meaning conveyed (at 686B), as the word could carry a defamatory meaning even to those uncommitted to any particular moral code which disapproved of abortion (at 686D).
	
	
	I also note, on the question of form (which often overlaps with defamatory meaning) that a challenge to the imputation on the grounds that the precise act or condition were not identified, and that the defendant therefore did not know what it had to justify, was rejected by Hutley JA at 687 (Glass and Priestly JJA agreed, at 693 and 696 respectively).
	
	
	The test for determining whether the antidote exceeds the bane is explained in Corby at [135] – [136].
	


Challenges to the form of imputations


	
	The correctness of Hutley JA’s statement that “there are no forms of imputations” (Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671A) has been affirmed in many recent decisions, including Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135. Principles frequently referred to in imputations arguments include the following:
	



	
	The plaintiff is obliged to identify for the defendant the act or condition which was understood by the ordinary reasonable reader as having been attributed to him or her, to assist the defendant in knowing the case to meet (Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [125]).
	
	
	While imputations need not be more precise than the matter complained of (Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 137A per Gleeson CJ – “X is disgusting”), they must be sufficiently clear so as to avoid the likelihood of confusion in relation to the meaning the plaintiff contends (Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273 per McColl JA at [21]; Amalgamated Television v Marsden at 162). Confusion may arise from terms which have a dual meaning such as “breach of trust”: Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425 per McHugh JA at 433 and 435. However, the English language contains many words with more than one meaning, and the actual meaning of the word used can generally be understood without difficulty from the context in which it is used. Claims by a publisher that the words he, she or it used are ambiguous and/or devoid of meaning should be viewed with some suspicion, for the reasons explained by Hutley JA in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd at 688B.
	
	
	The actual words of the matter complained of may be used where their meaning is clear (Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 per McColl JA at [29]; Waller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 611 per McCallum J at [18]). There are cases where the actual sting of the imputation will not be conveyed merely by repeating the language of the publication (Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 per Beasley P and Ward JA at [21]). However, courts should be cautious not to “straitjacket” (Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos & Ors (2001) 54 NSWLR 165 at [18]) a plaintiff into Thesaurus-based alternatives by an opponent who is hopeful of putting to the jury at the trial that the imputation does not refer to the actual words of the matter complained of.
	


The matter complained of


	
	The language and layout of the matter complained of do not shrink from making allegations about the plaintiff. The manner of presentation, use of repetition and trenchant language are relevant to the determination of capacity of the imputations.
	
	
	The text of the matter complained of is as follows:
	


“1 McGurk’s confidants have colourful pasts

2 Vanda Carson

4 Michael McGurk’s confidants – Clinton Sarina and Terrence Reddy

5 Michael McGurk's two closest confidants, who were last week named as part of an investigation into an alleged $150 million mortgage fraud, have colourful histories of their own.

6 Terrence Reddy and mortgage broker Clinton Sarina each have alleged connections to criminal groups police believe may be responsible for the massive bank frauds.

7 Mr Reddy is believed to be on the run because he allegedly owes $150,000 to a group of Lebanese gangsters from Bankstown, sources in the finance industry say.

8 The loan was arranged last year by Mr Sarina, his friend, and has blown out to three times its original size after high interest penalty charges have been added.

9 It is not the only money Mr Reddy is alleged to owe.

10 Mr Reddy, a renowned party-boy who has been dubbed ""The Black Prince"" for his lavish lifestyle, cannot return to any of Justin Hemmes's bars because he has a large outstanding bar tab, sources say.

11 He also owes money to several private Sydney lenders including Tommy Wayne Powers.

12 He also owes money that is the subject of legal proceedings.

13 Mr Reddy gave evidence to a court last month that he was afraid of a man called Alex Marcello, believed to be a member of the Hells Angels from South Australia.

14 Mr Reddy and Mr Sarina worked for Mr McGurk's company Bentley Smythe. They met him just hours before he was executed, allegedly by two hitmen, in September last year.

15 Mr Reddy recently had his dark green convertible Mercedes repossessed by car dealer Martin Cass at Alex Holland in Rushcutters Bay.

16 It was not the first time he has had a car repossessed, having lost a BMW in 2005 and several other cars since then.

17 ""He's got people looking for him everywhere, he's not going home, he's not doing the usual things, he is definitely looking over his shoulder,"" one source said.

18 Mr Reddy told the NSW Supreme Court last month he was associated with the head of the Sydney chapter of the Hells Angels, Felix Lyle.

19 Mr Reddy has admitted he was involved in a scam to rip off $437,000 from Perpetual Trustees Victoria in 2005 after a lender's signature was forged. He blamed Mr Lyle for stealing the money.

20 He has not been charged with any offences, but admitted to the crimes during hearings.

21 Meanwhile, Mr Sarina was at one stage charged with kidnapping one of his clients, small-time criminal Tim Xenos, who failed to repay a loan of $180,000, which had come with a hefty 25 per cent interest.

22 Mr Sarina was accused of taking Mr Xenos to the ritzy Quay West apartments overlooking Circular Quay in 2002.

23 Grabbing a pair of scissors, Mr Sarina's alleged associate Richard Lawandos screamed: ""I'll cut your kids' toes in front of you. I'll kill your kids, kill your mother, I dont care.""

24 After allegedly threatening him with death by a drug overdose, or by pushing him over the rails of the high-rise tower unless he paid the money, Mr Sarina was then accused of handing Mr Xenos the hotel bill. The matter was eventually no-billed by the NSW Attorney-General and the charges against Mr Sarina dropped.

25 Mr Sarina continues to lend money although he is not an accredited broker with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

26 Both men are alleged to have boasted of connections to criminals in order to protect themselves from possible retribution over loans.

27 Several sources say they have exaggerated their connections, and on many occasions their ""protection"" has failed to materialise.

28 Mr Sarina did not return calls to his home and his Double Bay lawyer, Robert Shacklady.

29 Mr Reddy was unable to be contacted as his mobile phone has been seized by the NSW Supreme Court.

The imputations


	
	The imputations pleaded were substantially amended in correspondence. Further applications to amend were made at the hearing, which led to the proceedings being conducted with a degree of informality. The imputations pleaded at paragraph 4 of the statement of claim (namely, imputations (a) to (k)) are set out below, with appropriate notes of the changes.
	
	
	Some of those changes were set out in the plaintiff’s letter of 14 March 2015, in response to the defendants’ objections dated 27 February 2015, where the plaintiff sought to amend imputations (b), (c), (e) and (g). In addition, the plaintiff sought to add imputations (l) to (t) at the commencement of the argument.
	
	
	These imputations, and their amendments, are currently as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff was named as part of an investigation into an alleged $150 million mortgage fraud (paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5).
	
	
	The plaintiff has alleged connections to criminal groups police believe may be responsible for massive bank frauds (paragraph 6) – In correspondence, the plaintiff amended this imputation to read “The police reasonably suspect the plaintiff of being connected with criminal groups that the police believe may be responsible for massive bank frauds.”
	
	
	The plaintiff arranged a loan for his friend Terrence Reddy which has blown out to three times its original size because of high interest penalty charges (paragraphs 7 and 8) – In correspondence, the plaintiff amended this imputation to read “Whilst the plaintiff was not an accredited broker with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, he arranged a loan for his friend Terrence Reddy which, because of high interest penalty charges, has blown out to 3 times its original size”.
	
	
	The plaintiff was charged with kidnapping one of his clients (paragraph 21).
	
	
	The plaintiff kidnapped Tim Xenos who failed to repay a loan of $180,000 which had come with a hefty 25% interest (paragraph 21) – In correspondence, the plaintiff amended this imputation to plead two imputations, which are pleaded in the alternative, namely: (e)(i) “The plaintiff kidnapped Tim Xenos”; and (e)(ii) “The plaintiff was reasonably suspected by police of having kidnapped Tim Xenos”.
	
	
	The plaintiff lent money at exorbitant rates of interest and exorbitant penalty charges (paragraphs 7, 8 and 21).
	
	
	The plaintiff threatened Tim Xenos with death by drug overdose or by pushing him over the rails of a high rise tower (paragraph 24) – In correspondence, the plaintiff amended this imputation to plead two imputations: (g)(i) “The plaintiff threatened Tim Xenos with death by drug overdose”; and (g)(ii) “The plaintiff threatened Tim Xenos with death by pushing him over the rails of a high-rise tower”.
	
	
	The plaintiff boasted of connections to criminals in order to protect himself from possible retribution over loans (paragraph 26).
	
	
	The plaintiff engages in criminal activities (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff is dishonest (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff is an usurer (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff is a violent person (whole article).
	
	
	The plaintiff continues to arrange loans even though he is not accredited by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (paragraph 25).
	
	
	The plaintiff arranged a loan for Tim Xenos which came with a hefty 25% interest rate (paragraph 21).
	
	
	The plaintiff, in association with Richard Lawandos, threatened to chop the toes off of the children of Mr Xenos (paragraph 23).
	
	
	The plaintiff, in association with Richard Lawandos, threatened to kill Mr Xenos’s [sic] children (paragraph 23).
	
	
	The plaintiff, in association with Richard Lawandos, threatened to kill Mr Xenos’s [sic] mother (paragraph 23).
	
	
	The plaintiff condoned the threatened violence of Richard Lawandos (paragraphs 1, 23, 24 and 26).
	
	
	The plaintiff is a standover man (paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6, 23, 24 and 26).
	
	
	The plaintiff is a close criminal associate of notorious standover man, Michael McGurk (the whole article).
	



	
	I shall now set out the basis for my ruling in relation to each of the imputations.
	


Imputation 4(a)


	
	This imputation was not objected to and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 4(b)


	
	The defendants object to use of the words “connections to” (used without comment in Aldridge v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 17 September 1985)) and “may be” (rejected in Christiansen v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1258).
	
	
	The vice of the imputation is not so much the use of these actual words (both of these occurred in the matter complained of), but that the matter complained of does in fact give very clear specificity to the nature of the connection between the plaintiff and the criminal groups and, for that matter, his role in relation to the “massive bank frauds”. The key to the capacity of this imputation is the repeated links between the references to the plaintiff and Mr Reddy as Mr McGurk’s “confidants” in the headline, the photograph caption and paragraph 5. This leads into paragraph 6 where “the massive bank frauds” is clearly a reference to the “alleged $150 million mortgage fraud” in paragraph 5. The matter complained of goes on to identify the plaintiff not only as a person working for the late Mr McGurk but as a person who arranged the following loans:
	



	
	the loan to his friend Mr Reddy of $150,000 (at paragraph 7);
	
	
	the loan to Mr Xenos of $180,000 (at paragraph 21); and
	
	
	other loans identified at paragraph 25 as being made in circumstances where he is not an accredited broker with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.
	



	
	These references make clear, principally by reference to what is stated to be “the” massive bank frauds in paragraph 6, that the “massive” bank frauds are the $150 million mortgage fraud referred to in paragraph 5.
	
	
	The matter complained of does not suggest, even to a reader at the bottom of the “ordinary reasonable reader” scale of carelessness, that the plaintiff is involved in two frauds. The matter complained of identifies one very big fraud, namely the massive $150 million mortgage fraud for which “criminal groups” are believed by police to be responsible, and not two separate transactions.
	
	
	Imputation 4(b), both in its original and in its redrafted form, seeks to isolate a second and separate fraud, using the language of the matter complained of to encapsulate the sting. However, I am satisfied that the clear meaning of these paragraphs identifies the plaintiff’s connection with this transaction as the mortgage broker who organised the loan that is the massive fraud, namely the $150 million mortgage fraud, and not a separate transaction. This imputation is struck out, but with leave to replead in the event that it can capture the aspect of the one massive fraud that Mr Rasmussen is seeking.
	
	
	A second objection made by the defendants is, however, of less merit. This is the submission that there is no reference in the matter complained of attributing the reasonable suspicion to the police as to the plaintiff’s involvement. Mrs Barnett submits that the police suspicion relates to the involvement of a criminal group and the fact that a massive fraud has been perpetrated, not to the plaintiff’s involvement. She submits that there is no evidence that the investigation in question is carried out by the police as opposed to some other body.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission. The plaintiff is identified as the person who is named in an investigation for his role in a fraud under investigation where the police suspect criminal groups are involved. This allegation occurs as one of a series of matters involving the plaintiff and his fellow confidant in police investigations. Applying the test set out by the Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd of generosity rather than parsimony, I am satisfied that an imputation that the plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police is conveyed, and should be included in the repleaded imputation.
	


Imputation 4(c)


	
	Both the original and redrafted imputations struggle to come to terms with the sting of the libel, namely that the interest penalty charges were so high that the loan had increased from $150,000 to three times its original size. The redrafted imputation, which imports a reference to whether or not the plaintiff is licensed, is both rolled up and strained in meaning.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead. The revised imputation 4(c) must differ in substance from imputations 4(f) and 4(m).
	


Imputation 4(d)


	
	This imputation was withdrawn during argument.
	


Imputations 4(e)(i) and 4(e)(ii)


	
	These are Chase level 1 and Chase level 2 imputations in their redrafted form. Mrs Barnett submitted that the reference to the charges being “eventually no billed by the NSW Attorney General”, resulting in the charges being dropped (paragraph 24) is sufficient antidote to render neither imputation conveyed.
	
	
	This submission overlooks both the structure and tone of the matter complained of which recites, between paragraphs 21 and 24, a series of criminal acts by the plaintiff in terms strongly suggestive of culpability. The reference to the charges being no billed is followed by references to the plaintiff continuing to lend money without accreditation and boasting of connections to criminals to protect himself from possible retribution over loans.
	
	
	Having regard to the test identified in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the jury to determine whether the Chase level 1 or Chase level 2 meaning is conveyed, and that on a capacity basis, each imputation is capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	These imputations will go to the jury as alternatives.
	


Imputations 4(f) and 4(m)


	
	Mrs Barnett submitted that neither of these imputations is conveyed and that, if conveyed, were not capable of being defamatory.
	
	
	The matter complained of clearly identifies the plaintiff as carrying out each of these activities, and I am satisfied that each of these imputations is conveyed.
	
	
	As to imputation 4(m), conformably with the principles explained by Hutley JA in Hepburn, it is irrelevant whether or not arranging these transactions without the appropriate licence is illegal. As to imputation 4(f), whether lending money at “exorbitant” rates is capable of defamatory meaning should be, for the reasons explained in Corby, a matter for the jury. To say of any person (such as, for example, a member of the legal profession) that their rates are “exorbitant” would be capable of defamatory meaning.
	
	
	These imputations will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 4(g)


	
	After complaint by the defendants that this imputation is rolled up because of the reference to death threats, the plaintiff sought to split this imputation in two. The defendants then objected to the splitting of the allegation to two imputations, and submitted that only an imputation of making a death threat should be permissible.
	
	
	Mrs Barnett defined the test relevant to an imputation in terms of form as being whether an imputation is capable of being further precision in light of what is contained in the matter complained of. This is a clear example where the precise nature of the threats were spelled out. The fact that Mr Xenos was threatened in that specific manner, namely with two alternatives of his manner of death, is an appropriate issue in terms of the sting and seriousness of the libel.
	
	
	In the course of argument Mr Rasmussen reverted to the original imputation. I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the sting of the imputation to include the fact that alternative methods of death were offered. This is the kind of precision in imputations that defendants generally seek, and it encapsulates the sting as well as the seriousness of the imputation for both methods to be identified in this clear fashion.
	
	
	The originally pleaded imputation 4(g) (“The plaintiff threatened Tim Xenos with death by drug overdose or by pushing him over the rails of a high rise tower”) will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 4(h)


	
	The defendants submitted that an imputation of boasting of connections to criminals was not capable of being defamatory. It is submitted that the ordinary reasonable reader would not think less of a person who retained an “enforcer” to recover sums of money owed by borrowers.
	
	
	The imputation is defamatory on several levels. First of all, any imputation of boasting is capable of being defamatory (Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Tingle [2001] NSWCA 194). Secondly, connections to criminals (which Mr Rasmussen pointed out of itself could be a criminal offence) is itself capable of a defamatory meaning.
	
	
	The use of the word “connections” is drawn from the matter complained of and despite its lack of specificity will, in the specific parameters of this imputation, be acceptable.
	
	
	This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputations 4(i), 4(j), 4(k) and 4(l)


	
	Mrs Barnett submitted that these imputations do not differ in substance from the imputations of acts already pleaded.
	
	
	The entitlement of a plaintiff to plead a “condition” imputation, as well as and in addition to, or in addition to an “act” imputation, is well established (Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 20 February 1980)). In the present case, the plaintiff is accused of a series of acts of dishonesty, charging excessively high interest and using or threatening to use violence, or retaining other persons to commit violence on his behalf. Each of these imputations is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury. However, there is one exception, namely imputation 4(j).
	
	
	This is an unusual case of an imputation not being conveyed because it is too weak. The imputations conveyed in relation to the plaintiff are so serious that an imputation of mere dishonesty is, in my view, not capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	Imputations 4(i), 4(k) and 4(l) will go to the jury. Imputation 4(j) is struck out.
	


Imputation 4(n)


	
	Mrs Barnett submitted that this imputation is not capable of being defamatory, in that charging a “hefty” interest rate is not capable of defamatory meaning.
	
	
	This is a good example of an imputation the sting of which is not captured by the matter complained of. This imputation is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Imputations 4(o), 4(p), 4(q) and 4(r)


	
	In the course of argument, Mr Rasmussen agreed that these imputations should be redrafted to become one imputation.
	
	
	Imputations 4(o), 4(p) and 4(q) are to be pleaded as one imputation, with imputation 4(r) to be pleaded as a fall back imputation.
	


Imputation 4(s)


	
	The defamatory meaning imputed by being a “standover man” is helpfully set out in the first instance and appeal decisions Ell v Milne (No 8) [2014] NSWSC 175 and Milne v Ell [2014] NSWCA 407, albeit in the context of being pleaded as a true innuendo rather than in the imputation pleaded.
	
	
	The allegations concerning the plaintiff are that he boasts of connections to criminals in order to protect himself from possible retribution, and that he took an associate with him who threatened Mr Xenos in the manner set out in the matter complained of at paragraph 23. While the matter complained of says that the plaintiff made similar threats to Mr Xenos, they were in his capacity as the outraged lender, not as a standover man or “enforcer”. The allegation in the matter complained of is that he took an enforcer (or “standover man”) with him to do his bidding, not that he himself is a standover man.
	
	
	While many allegations are laid by the defendants at the door of the plaintiff, this is not one of them. This imputation is struck out.
	


Imputation 4(t)


	
	The reference to “close criminal associate” appears to be a rare attempt by the pleader to use language other than that contained in the matter complained of, which identifies him as a “confidant”. The matter complained of does not identify the plaintiff as having performed any criminal activities on behalf of the late Mr McGurk; he is identified as an employee of Mr McGurk’s company Bentley Smythe (paragraph 14), but there is no suggestion that this is a criminal organisation. Nor is there any suggestion that the plaintiff is himself a person with a criminal record (the charges against him having been no billed); what is said is that he himself has “connections to criminals”. The word “confidant” contains the sting the plaintiff should be seeking to convey.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to repleaded with, if considered necessary, extrinsic facts.
	


Costs


	
	While the plaintiff has substantially repleaded his case, many of the objections taken by the defendant (particularly as to defamatory meaning) were without merit. Each party has had a degree of success and failure and the appropriate costs order is for the costs to be the parties’ costs in the cause.
	


Orders


	
	Note the application is brought pursuant to rr 14.28 and 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).

2766213,R v Pluis [2015] NSWSC 320,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	JOHNSON J: The Offender, Robert James Pluis, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Darren Greenfield on or about 21 January 2013 at Wyalong.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life: s.19A Crimes Act 1900. There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years for this crime.
	


Facts of the Offence


	
	What follows is drawn from an Agreed Statement of Facts tendered on sentence.
	
	
	Mr Greenfield was aged 44 years at the time of his death. He had lived in the West Wyalong area all his life. At the time of his death, he resided in premises which he owned at 78 George Bland Avenue, Wyalong. Wyalong is a small town about 3.5 kilometres from West Wyalong.
	
	
	Mr Greenfield was a single man, separated from his former partner. He had a close relationship with his 19-year old son, Dylan.
	
	
	At the time of his death, Mr Greenfield was employed as a pest control officer at Graincorp and had been so employed for over 20 years. Despite having a drinking problem, Mr Greenfield was regarded as a reliable worker and as a gentle, kind person who was willing to lend a helping hand to others in need.
	
	
	The Offender was born in July 1969 and was 43 years of age at the time of the offence. He had resided in the West Wyalong area since about 2010.
	
	
	The Offender met Mr Greenfield whilst working for Graincorp when he first moved to West Wyalong. The Offender was a seasonal worker, employed during the harvest period in November and December. For the 2012 harvest season, he was employed by Grainflow West Wyalong.
	
	
	Around October 2012, the Offender moved in with Mr Greenfield at his residence at 78 George Bland Avenue, Wyalong. Prior to that time, the Offender was living in a shipping container in bushland. The living arrangement was organised by Mr Greenfield and his son, when they learnt of the Offender’s residential circumstances. The Offender was to pay $100.00 per week rent to Mr Greenfield.
	
	
	As at January 2013, the Offender was unemployed and received government benefits. At that time, the Offender was a client of Sureway Employment & Training at West Wyalong, and had been on that organisation’s books for some three years. His case manager was Anne Maree Davies. Ms Davies had placed the Offender in a number of employment positions, but the positions were short lived due to the Offender’s discipline and temper issues.
	


Mr Greenfield Tells the Offender to Move Out


	
	In January 2013, Mr Greenfield told the Offender that he had to move out and find other accommodation. Mr Greenfield had arranged for his own father to come and stay at the end of January 2013.
	
	
	Between 10 and 20 January 2013, the Offender expressed his displeasure with Mr Greenfield arising from the request to leave.
	
	
	On Thursday, 10 January 2013, the Offender attended the offices of his employment agency and spoke to Ms Davies. He told her that he was sick and tired of Mr Greenfield, that Mr Greenfield was kicking him out when intoxicated and when sober, he would tell the Offender he could stay. The Offender told Ms Davies that he felt Mr Greenfield was happy to have him stay when his unemployment benefit was there, but when his money ran out, he would be asked to leave again. The Offender felt cranky because Mr Greenfield was supposed to be his mate.
	
	
	On Wednesday, 16 January 2013, the Offender returned to Sureway Employment & Training and spoke with Ms Davies. He told her a number of times that he was sick of Mr Greenfield and that he was “pissed off” with him.
	
	
	At about 11.00 am on Saturday, 19 January 2013, Mr Greenfield and the Offender dropped off a lounge to Terry Reid and were assisted by Mr Reid to pick up another lounge.
	
	
	At 10.30 am on Sunday, 20 January 2013, Mr Reid went to Mr Greenfield’s house. The Offender was asleep on the new lounge. Mr Greenfield hit the Offender on the leg and told him to go to bed, but the Offender did not respond. Mr Greenfield told Mr Reid that his father was coming from Campbelltown to stay and that he wanted the Offender to move out. Mr Greenfield held up three fingers and told the Offender that he had three days to move out. The Offender yelled out “You are an areshole”. Mr Greenfield told Mr Reid “That’s why I have given him three days to get out”. Mr Greenfield told Mr Reid that the Offender had drunk his beer and asked Mr Reid to go to the hotel with him. Mr Reid declined and left at 12.30 pm.
	


20-21 January 2013 - The Offence


	
	At about 2.45 pm on Sunday, 20 January 2013, the Offender attended the Top Town Tavern and purchased four long necks of beer, using loose coins, and then left the hotel.
	
	
	At about 3.30 pm, Mr Greenfield came into the same hotel, where he drank beer and socialised. During the afternoon, Mr Greenfield received a telephone call. The bar attendant observed Mr Greenfield to be agitated and heard him say loudly “That’s not good enough”. After the call, Mr Greenfield quickly finished his beer and left the hotel. The bar attendant sold a slab of “Melbourne Bitter” cans that afternoon, but cannot recall if she sold it to Mr Greenfield.
	
	
	At about 6.30 pm, Terry Cronin, a work colleague and close friend of Mr Greenfield, saw him leave the hotel and walk across the road to the take-away shop where he purchased fish for dinner. Mr Greenfield was carrying a case of beer. The proprietor of the take-away shop saw Mr Greenfield take his fish and beer and walk into the laneway that leads to Mr Greenfield’s residence, a distance of around 180 metres.
	
	
	Around 8.00 pm, Mr Greenfield was observed on his back in the front yard of his home at George Bland Avenue. He was moving around and trying to roll on to his side. He was observed to have a graze on the left side of his face. Mr Greenfield was further observed lying on the ground at the front of his house with his pants falling down, and then trying to get up and again lying face down. No person observed a carton of beer on the ground.
	
	
	Around 8.00 pm, Ms Tricia Reynolds saw Mr Greenfield on the footpath running from the mailbox to the veranda and front door of his house. Mr Greenfield was lying flat out on the footpath on his stomach, with both his arms out in front of him. Ms Reynolds turned her car around and stopped it on the opposite side of the road in front of Mr Greenfield’s home. She saw Mr Greenfield try and push himself up four or five times to his hands and knees, on each occasion falling back to the ground on his stomach. On about the third occasion, Mr Greenfield fell to the ground, his jeans and underpants came down exposing his buttocks. Ms Reynolds did not see a carton of beer.
	
	
	At about 8.25 pm, Ms Reynolds saw the Offender leave Mr Greenfield’s residence and pick him up, pulling his pants up and assisting him into the house.
	


The Location of Mr Greenfield’s Body


	
	Mr Greenfield failed to attend work on Monday, 21 January 2013. It was highly unusual for him not to attend work without contacting his employer. It was Mr Greenfield’s usual practice to travel to work with Mr Cronin. Mr Greenfield did not arrive at Mr Cronin’s home as usual for this purpose. However, Mr Cronin thought that Mr Greenfield must have been picked up by an earlier work crew.
	
	
	On 22 January 2013, Mr Greenfield again failed to arrive at Mr Cronin’s home. At about 7.29 am, Mr Cronin rang Mr Greenfield’s mobile telephone which was answered by the Offender. Mr Cronin asked the Offender if Mr Greenfield was there. The Offender said he would go and see. Mr Cronin heard the Offender calling out Mr Greenfield’s name in the background. The Offender came back to the telephone and said “Jeez, he don’t look good”. Mr Cronin told the Offender to get Mr Greenfield to a doctor and ended the call.
	
	
	At 7.31 am, the Offender rang “000” and told the operator he had found Mr Greenfield in his bedroom and requested an ambulance. The Offender told the operator he had found Mr Greenfield kneeling beside the bed, with his arms cradling his head which was resting on the bed. The operator told the Offender to lay Mr Greenfield on his back. The Offender moved Mr Greenfield and told the operator he could tell that Mr Greenfield was dead.
	


Ambulance Officers Arrive


	
	Ambulance officers attended Mr Greenfield’s residence at about 7.35 am. Upon arrival, they were met by the Offender who directed them to Mr Greenfield. They determined that he was dead and observed signs of decomposition. Both ambulance officers noted facial trauma and blood around the face and nose, specifically to the right side of Mr Greenfield’s face. Both ambulance officers noticed dried blood about halfway up the path leading to the house and on the veranda outside and on the front door.
	
	
	The Offender initially told one of the ambulance officers that he had last seen Mr Greenfield “last night around midnight”, leaving him intoxicated in the lounge room when the Offender retired to bed. A short time later, the Offender stated that he had last seen Mr Greenfield on Sunday night.
	
	
	Both ambulance officers knew the Offender and had treated him previously for seizures. At different times, the Offender was alone with one or the other of the ambulance officers who had conversations with him. One of the ambulance officers observed that the Offender seemed very vague and almost dazed, as if he had just woken up. He seemed not to realise what day it was and he seemed to have no memory of the previous 24 hours.
	
	
	The other ambulance officer also noted a problem with his recall of the days and observed him to be quite distressed, agitated and emotionally upset. The Offender approached one of the ambulance officers and stated “There is sugar all over the table, there must have been a struggle”. An examination revealed a small amount of sugar on the countertop.
	


Arrival of Police


	
	At about 8.35 am, the first police officer arrived at Mr Greenfield’s house. Bloodstains were observed on the path leading to the house and the veranda. The Offender told the police officer that Mr Greenfield was kneeling when he found him. He told the police officers that he did not really remember when he last saw Mr Greenfield, that he saw him before he went to bed and that Mr Greenfield had been drinking all night and was quite drunk, and that he did not see any bloodstains on the path and had not been outside at all the day before (21 January 2013).
	
	
	Police observed three empty beer cans of Melbourne Bitter in the house on the dining room table. There were 18 empty Victoria Bitter beer cans, 21 empty Melbourne Bitter beer cans and three empty 750 ml Tooheys New beer bottles within two garbage bins beside the refrigerator, and an empty can of each brand of beer found on the floor in the lounge room. Remnants of the take-away fish meal were found on the veranda.
	
	
	The stains on the concrete path outside, on the veranda, on the exterior of the front door jamb, on the exterior of the door to the bedroom of Mr Greenfield and found in and on tiles at the entry to the bedroom occupied by the Offender, were found to be human blood. The DNA profile extracted from the path, the front door and the tiles outside the Offender’s bedroom matched Mr Greenfield’s profile.
	


The Offender is Interviewed


	
	On 22 January 2013, police conducted an electronically recorded interview with the Offender who, at that stage, was not being interviewed as a suspect. He confirmed that he had last seen Mr Greenfield around midnight on Sunday, 20 January 2013, in the living room at 78 George Bland Avenue.
	
	
	The Offender told police that he had been heading to bed and had been watching television. He stated that he and Mr Greenfield had a brief conversation before the latter retired to his bedroom. Mr Greenfield was said to be in good spirits. The Offender stated that he did not have any disagreement with Mr Greenfield and that the latter did not have any injuries on him when he arrived home.
	
	
	The Offender stated that, when he rose the next morning about 8.00 am, he did not see Mr Greenfield, but did not think it unusual as Mr Greenfield normally went to work around 7.00 am.
	
	
	The Offender told police that Mr Greenfield’s bedroom door was closed all day and that no one was at the house, apart from himself, between Sunday, 20 January and Tuesday, 22 January 2013.
	
	
	He said that he had found Mr Greenfield when he answered a call on Mr Greenfield’s mobile telephone on Tuesday morning from a work colleague checking as to the whereabouts of Mr Greenfield. The Offender went into Mr Greenfield’s bedroom and found him kneeling on the floor and leaning over the bed in a “praying sort of position”. The Offender stated that on 21 January 2013, he smelt a bad smell in the house, but did not know where it was coming from. At this time, West Wyalong was experiencing temperatures around the high 30 degrees.
	
	
	The Offender denied seeing bloodstains on the path on the Sunday and Monday. When asked about the bloodstains, he stated that he thought they might have been from his dog hurting himself. The Offender had checked his dog and found that it was uninjured.
	


The Post-Mortem Findings


	
	A post-mortem was conducted on the victim on 24 January 2013. The cause of death was found to be thoracic and abdominal blunt-force injuries. Externally identified injuries included a full thickness blunt-force injury of the right ear (1.27 centimetres in length) and a Y-shaped superficial laceration (three centimetres) behind the same ear. The knuckles of the right hand showed two faint contusions with associated subcutaneous mild haemorrhage.
	
	
	The autopsy revealed that Mr Greenfield suffered extensively fractured ribs on the left side only, accompanied by severe contusions of corresponding intercostal muscles. Ribs 2 to 10 were fractured with Ribs 5 and 7 being fractured at two locations and Rib 6 at three locations. Examination also showed the presence of 200 mls of frank blood on the left side. Deeper soft-tissue haemorrhage was noted on the back. The extensive rib fractures compromised the respiration of the victim.
	
	
	Abdominal examination showed the presence of 900 ml of frank blood. The source of that bleeding was lacerations to the liver and lacerations to the spleen. Bilateral retroperitoneal haemorrhage was noted, however no definite bowel injury was identified.
	
	
	In the opinion of the pathologist, the possible mechanism of the infliction of the injuries observed was the application of repetitive and relatively large force to the abdominal and thoracic areas. There were no facial skull or brain injuries. There was a moderately high alcohol level (0.231 grams/100 ml) in the post-mortem sample of the victim’s leg blood.
	
	
	Mr Greenfield was of slim build, weighed 57 kilograms and was 1.73 metres tall.
	


Other Events Shedding Light on What Had Happened to Mr Greenfield


	
	Mr Greenfield’s son, Dylan, had two missed calls from his father’s number at 6.11 am and 6.22 am on Monday, 21 January 2013.
	
	
	Pene Iremonger accidentally dialled Mr Greenfield’s mobile telephone number at 6.23 pm on 21 January 2013, with the call being answered by the Offender. Ms Iremonger hung up on hearing the Offender answering the call.
	
	
	James Barber, a retired farmer, went to Mr Greenfield’s residence on Monday, 21 January 2013 where he observed what appeared to be bloodstains on the footpath. He knocked on the door, but no one answered.
	
	
	Mr Barber had known the Offender since 2010 and regarded him as a good worker. He was aware that the Offender had trouble keeping work and that he was a heavy drinker. He had also seen the Offender suffer fits. Mr Barber was aware that the Offender had been told by a medical practitioner to stop drinking or his fits would get worse. As a result, the Offender stopped drinking in the Christmas period. The Offender later confirmed this in his second interview with police.
	
	
	On 22 January 2013, Mr Barber rang the Offender early in the morning to offer him work for the day. The Offender said “Somebody’s rang me to wake up Darren, he hasn’t turned up at work”. The Offender ended the call. The Offender called Mr Barber back a short time later and said “I think he’s dead” and stated that he had called an ambulance.
	
	
	On 23 January 2013, the Offender attended the office of Ms Davies with a view to handing in an employment form. The Offender said to Ms Davies “I know you know I was pissed off with Darren, but I wasn’t that pissed off that I would kill him. He was my mate and my only mate”. The Offender also stated “I was in the house when it happened” and “Apparently he was bashed outside on our lawn and then they dragged him inside and left him in the bedroom”. When interviewed later by police, the Offender denied this conversation.
	
	
	On 25 January 2013, the Offender attended the West Wyalong Police Station and was informed by police that he could leave town. The Offender relocated to the Top Hotel in Narrandera.
	
	
	Also staying in Narrandera at that time was Nicholas Dolan, who had previously worked with the Offender. He was aware that the Offender sometimes got into aggressive moods. Mr Dolan was informed of Mr Greenfield’s death and was aware that the Offender had been living with the victim. He also knew that the Offender, when drunk, would “spit out things”.
	
	
	Mr Dolan and the Offender drank heavily together on about 25 January 2013. When Mr Dolan asked the Offender questions about Mr Greenfield’s death, the Offender said “I can’t remember if I killed Darren or if I didn’t kill Darren. I just can’t remember”.
	
	
	During the week commencing 28 January 2013, the Offender was staying at the Town Centre Motel in Leeton. There the Offender met and spoke with Kenneth Noack. The Offender told Mr Noack that he was unable to go to his mate’s funeral that was coming up at West Wyalong. The Offender, during that conversation, began to cry. The following evening, Mr Noack had another conversation with the Offender. The Offender again repeated that he could not go to his mate’s funeral stating “I think I murdered my best friend” and “I had an argument with my mate and punched him in the nose and he fell backwards hitting his head on the gutter. I grabbed his ankles and dragged him inside and left him there”. The Offender was upset and crying when speaking with Mr Noack.
	
	
	On 4 February 2013, Mr Noack contacted police after seeing a news report about the arrest of a man for a murder at West Wyalong.
	
	
	On 31 January 2013, the Offender engaged in a lengthy conversation with a registered source, with that conversation being recorded on a listening device. This conversation followed a period of three days where the registered source booked in, met the Offender at the Town Centre Motel at Leeton and spent time in his company. The registered source was offering to find work for the Offender and, in the course of organising that work, put concerted pressure on the Offender to tell him about the death of Mr Greenfield. In lawfully recorded conversations, the Offender stated that Mr Greenfield could have been killed by Trevor Reid or by himself “in a fit”. Mr Reid was eliminated by police as a suspect.
	
	
	In summary, the Offender said in these recorded conversations that he had no memory of the period of time when Mr Greenfield must have been assaulted. He said he had lost chunks of time before and had waited until the memory came back. He could not think of an explanation as to why he might have assaulted Mr Greenfield other than that he may have had a fit. He also observed that it would be unlikely that he would have been able to hit Mr Greenfield hard during the course of a fit, and that Mr Greenfield would have been able to cope with this by pushing him over. He repeatedly said that he could not remember assaulting Mr Greenfield, that he had been thinking about it all the time and would like to know if he did or did not kill him. He further said “Well I could say ‘No I didn’t do it’ but I don’t know and I could say ‘Yeah I did do it’ and I’d be pissing in your pocket, because I don’t fucken know mate”. He also said “… If it was me, I don’t mind going and nodding my head and fucken doing whatever, you know what I mean, copping it on the chin like”.
	


Arrest and Charging of the Offender


	
	The Offender was arrested at Griffith on 1 February 2013 and participated in an electronically recorded interview. The Offender added to what he had told police in his initial interview. He stated that he had been drinking heavily on Sunday, 20 January 2013 after not drinking since Christmas, and that he had no memory of events until Tuesday morning.
	
	
	The Offender was visibly upset during the interview, leading to the interview being temporarily suspended. The Offender stated that he last saw Mr Greenfield around midnight on Sunday, 20 January 2013. The Offender stated that he might have committed the offence, but he had no memory of doing so.
	
	
	The Offender was charged with murder and has remained in custody since his arrest on 1 February 2013.
	


The Offender’s Plea of Guilty


	
	The Offender suffers from epilepsy and takes medication for that condition. The matter remained in the Local Court for a lengthy period whilst that issue was examined, and reports were obtained by the Offender’s legal representatives. As soon as the Offender was in a position to do so, he entered a plea of guilty to murder in the Local Court at Griffith on 24 September 2014 and was committed for sentence.
	
	
	Given the foregoing account drawn from the Agreed Statement of Facts, it is appropriate to recite the concluding paragraphs of that document, which address the basis of the Offender’s plea of guilty:
	


“38.   The offender assaulted the deceased by the application of repetitive and large force to the abdominal and thoracic areas causing the injuries noted at autopsy. That assault caused the death of the deceased. The assault was a deliberate act on the part of the offender and done without lawful excuse. 

39.   The offender by his plea admits that he either intended to inflict grievous bodily harm to the deceased or to kill the deceased when he assaulted him.”

The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Offender was 43 years of age at the time of the offence and is now 45 years old.

	The following documents concerning the Offender were relied upon in the defence case:
	



	
	affidavit of the Offender dated 15 February 2015 - he was not cross-examined on this affidavit;

	documents obtained on subpoena from the Department of Corrective Services concerning the Offender.
	



	
	The Offender had a highly disturbed upbringing. The evidence reveals that the Offender lived with his mother until he was three months of age and did not know his father, although he now knows his name. He was placed in a children’s home as a baby, as his mother could not care for him. The Offender was fostered out to a stable family between the ages of three and seven years.
	
	
	His mother reclaimed him when he was seven years old and he lived with her and her partner for some months, experiencing violence himself from his stepfather and his mother. At seven years of age, the Offender was placed by the Department of Community Services in a children’s home at Bathurst, where he lived for two years. Between the ages of nine and 11 years, he was placed again with the foster family with whom he had resided when he was aged three to seven years.
	
	
	Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, the Offender resided at a children’s home at Lismore in which he experienced some abuse.
	
	
	Between the ages of 14 and 20 years, the Offender lived at times with his mother’s former de facto partner and his mother’s sister.
	
	
	The Offender became involved in a relationship at the age of 20 years. A son, now aged 22 years, was born of that relationship. The Offender did not have contact with his son over the years, until he came into custody for the present offence and his son has attempted to visit him.
	
	
	The Offender attended many schools, but left during Year 10 before he had obtained his School Certificate. The Offender states that he intends to further his studies and obtain his Higher School Certificate whilst in custody, and undertake a bakery apprenticeship and a small business course.
	
	
	Testing undertaken by Ms Robilliard indicated that the Offender had a full-scale IQ on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale between 100 and 113, or equal to or ahead of 68% of his age group.
	
	
	The Offender was not employed at the time of the offence with his last period of employment being in 2012 with Graincorp. He has a history of casual employment working as a builder’s labourer and engaging in farm work, such as fencing, tractor driving, harvesting and seasonal work.
	
	
	The Offender has undertaken work in custody including ground maintenance and bakery duties in 2013 and 2014.
	
	
	The Offender first used cannabis whilst in a children’s home at the age of 11 or 12 years, and he became a regular user from about 16 or 17 years of age.
	
	
	The Offender consumed alcohol from the age of 18 years and became a heavy drinker in his 30s. He moderated his drinking when employed.
	
	
	The Offender’s criminal history discloses a long association with alcohol and the commission of alcohol-related offences.
	
	
	The Offender moderated his drinking in the period prior to the commission of the present offence, but had increased his consumption of alcohol in the weeks leading up to the murder. The evidence suggests that the Offender drank heavily on the day of the offence.
	
	
	The Offender has a history of epilepsy which appears to date back to a motor vehicle accident in Victoria in 2003. He has been taking, and continues to take, medication for this condition. Associate Professor Somerville considers that the Offender suffers from focal epilepsy, which has been invariably controlled by medication. Dr Reid noted that the Offender’s medical records indicated multiple admissions to hospital accident and emergency departments following seizures. The Offender has experienced seizures in custody including a seizure noted in Corrective Services’ records on 6 September 2013.
	
	
	Associate Professor Somerville has expressed the opinion that the Offender is not cognitively impaired by his epilepsy, nor does his medication produce any significant cognitive effects or add to the effects of alcohol in more than a minor way. He has expressed the opinion that the offence could not have been committed whilst a seizure was taking place.
	
	
	Dr Westmore has expressed the opinion that, whilst the Offender may have suffered from periods of depression in the past, there was no history to suggest that he was depressed at the time of the offence or that he may have suffered from a psychiatric illness or a psychotic condition.
	
	
	Dr Reid conducted testing of the Offender leading to the conclusion that the Offender’s premorbid level of intelligence was within normal limits. However, Dr Reid continued:
	


“On examination he had widespread impairment in his cognitive functioning affecting his information processing skills, verbal abstract reasoning, memory for both verbal and visual information and impairment in his executive/adaptive skills effecting his verbal abstract reasoning and speed and flexibility of thinking.”


	
	Dr Reid expressed the opinion that the Offender’s difficulties with memory were due, on the balance of probabilities, to psychological factors and were consistent with a DSM-V diagnosis of dissociative amnesia.
	
	
	Personality testing undertaken by Ms Robilliard revealed a marked elevation on the schizotypal scale, part of the severe personality pathology scales which measure system clusters that are likely to attract a diagnosis of personality disorder.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard concluded that the first years of the Offender’s life in the children’s home would be highly likely to have given rise to disrupted attachment disorder, which typically manifests itself later in life in an inability to maintain close emotional relationships. Ms Robilliard reported that individuals exposed to prolonged traumatic life events and circumstances may become adept at cognitively disassociating from emotional distresses as a survival strategy, something which can continue to occur throughout life. Ms Robilliard pointed to the Offender’s life history and conditions, which he described, which were likely to translate into later dysfunctional personality attributes and particularly dysfunctional interpersonal behaviour.
	
	
	The affidavits of the Offender and Ms Pearce indicate that, despite his difficult upbringing, his loner-type existence and his offending history, he does have some family support at this time. Further, since the Offender has been in custody for the present offence, his mother has sought to make contact with him as has his son.
	
	
	An assessment of the Offender’s prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded given his history and the lengthy period of time for which he will be in custody before possible release on parole. The existence of some constructive plans for education and employment in custody, combined with the existence of some level of family support, leads to a cautious view that there are some prospects of rehabilitation. That said, the Offender has a long history of offending with courts having extended opportunities to him in the past with limited success. The present offence was committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. A guarded view only can be formed at this time, with the Offender’s future progress in custody being significant.
	


The Offender’s Plea of Guilty


	
	The Offender was arrested on 1 February 2013 and charged with the present offence. He pleaded guilty to the charge of murder before the Griffith Local Court on 24 September 2014, and was thereafter committed for sentence in this Court.
	
	
	Despite the passage of time between February 2013 and September 2014, Mr Wilson SC for the Offender, submitted that the Court should approach the matter upon the basis that the Offender’s plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court at the earliest possible time. He submitted that a discount of 25% should be extended for the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	Mr Wilson SC pointed to aspects of the Offender’s medical background which required consideration and were explored by way of reports from Dr Westmore, Dr Reid and Associate Professor Somerville. He submitted that these aspects were important to allow a conclusion, firstly, that the Offender was fit to be tried and, secondly, that no other aspect of his health stood in the way of a plea of guilty to the charge of murder.
	
	
	The Crown did not advance a submission against a finding that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity, so that a discount of 25% was open.
	
	
	Applying the relevant principles, I am satisfied that a discount of 25% should be extended to the Offender for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. The plea was entered in the Local Court. To the extent that there was delay prior to the entry of the plea in September 2014, the Local Court was informed that steps were being taken to explore the complex medical and psychological issues bearing upon the plea.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	A number of victim impact statements were made for the purpose of the sentencing hearing. Statements were made by Dylan Lee Greenfield, the son of Mr Greenfield, Natalie Hanily-Greenfield, the sister of Mr Greenfield, Geraldine Anne Greenfield, his mother, and David Greenfield, his father.
	
	
	Each of these statements was given by a family victim. The Crown applied under s.28(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the Court take into account these statements in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence, on the basis that the harmful impact of Mr Greenfield’s death on the members of his immediate family was an aspect of harm done to the community. One of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender is to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The victim impact statements speak eloquently of the generosity of Mr Greenfield and the care demonstrated by him towards his family and the community. He was a valuable and hard-working member of the community. The great loss caused by his death to his parents, sister and his son is demonstrated in the statements. The shock and horror experienced by the family members is clear and entirely understandable.
	
	
	I accept that the harmful impact of the offence upon the primary victim’s immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community in this case. Under the law, all lives are precious and the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community in general: R v Barbetta [2008] NSWSC 688 at [18] (Howie J). Harm to the community is always caused when an innocent life is taken, but the way in which the harm is felt varies.
	
	
	The victim impact statements in this case evidence the harmful impact of Mr Greenfield’s death on the members of his immediate family, and this is a particular aspect of the harm done to the community. I take it into account in determining sentence in this case.
	
	
	I extend the condolences of the Court and the community to the family of Mr Greenfield for the great loss which they have suffered as a result of this crime.
	
	
	I am conscious that substantial parts of these remarks on sentence concern the circumstances of the Offender. The law requires that these matters be considered on sentence. It should not be thought, however, that I have lost sight of the impact of this terrible crime on those affected by it.
	


Objective Gravity of the Offence


	
	I have had regard to the provisions in ss.54A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in considering the role of the standard non-parole period on sentence. The standard non-parole period is a guidepost to be taken into account, together with the maximum penalty, as part of the instinctive synthesis process. The standard non-parole period is to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, together with other relevant considerations: s.54B(2). The Court must record reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period: s.54B(3). However, the Court is not required to record the extent to which the seriousness of the offence differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period applies: s.54B(6).
	
	
	Using the statutory language in s.54A(2), the Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the present offence lay within the mid-range for murder.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Offender submitted that the offence lay below the mid-range of objective seriousness for the crime of murder.
	
	
	I have considered the objective gravity of this crime, having regard to both common law and statutory factors which bear upon this topic. In forming a view concerning the objective gravity of the Offender’s crime, I have taken into account a number of the features of the crime addressed by counsel, including the moral culpability of the Offender. I note that a number of these features extend beyond “objective factors affecting the relative seriousness” of the offence for the purpose of the standard non-parole period: s.54A(2) and 54B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The factors to which I have had particular regard in assessing objective gravity appear in the following paragraphs.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the context in which the Offender attacked the victim fatally was his grievance arising from the repeated statements by Mr Greenfield that it was necessary that the Offender vacate the premises. The evidence indicates that the Offender has anger problems. I am satisfied that the physical attack upon the victim arose in a relatively spontaneous context, likely in circumstances where both men had consumed substantial amounts of alcohol. Viewed in this way, the attack was not planned or premeditated, but involved a significant loss of control on the part of the Offender in which he launched a severe attack upon the victim. I am satisfied that both the Offender and the victim were significantly affected by alcohol at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The Offender used a significant level of violence involving force to the abdominal and thoracic areas and multiple rib fractures. There was internal organ damage and bleeding. There is no evidence to suggest that a weapon was employed. It is likely that the Offender used his fists and perhaps his feet in the attack.
	
	
	The evidence indicates that the attack upon the victim was not confined to one area in the house. The forensic evidence suggests that there was an assault on the path to the house and in the victim’s bedroom.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Mr Wilson SC submitted that the appropriate finding was that the Offender acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm as opposed to an intention to kill. Having regard to the totality of the evidence, including the evidence of injuries, I am satisfied that the Offender acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim, but not to kill him.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the victim acted in any way to provoke the Offender prior to the attack upon him. It should be kept in mind that the Offender only came to live in Mr Greenfield’s house in the first place because Mr Greenfield and his son felt sorry for the Offender (then living in a shipping container in bushland) and wished to help him.
	
	
	The fatal attack occurred in and about the home of the victim. This aspect aggravates the crime. Mr Greenfield was entitled to feel safe in his own home. It is true, as Mr Wilson SC submits, that the Offender resided in the house as well (at least temporarily pending his forced departure). This is not a case of a person being attacked in his own home by a stranger or intruder. However, those features do not reduce to any real extent the aggravation of the crime which involved a fatal attack upon Mr Greenfield in what should have been the sanctity of his own home.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender was intoxicated by alcohol at the time of the commission of the offence, although the extent of that intoxication is difficult to assess. The murder occurred in January 2013 before the introduction of s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, the law applying before that provision was enacted made clear that an offender’s intoxication could explain an offence, but ordinarily did not mitigate penalty: R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [220]. The Offender’s intoxication does not mitigate penalty in this case.
	
	
	It is the case that the Offender, having attacked Mr Greenfield with considerable force, left him and took no steps to assist him. The process whereby Mr Greenfield was discovered by others following Mr Cronin’s telephone call and the Offender’s “000” call was referred to earlier (at [25]) above). An extended period of time passed before the Offender took any step to report what had happened to Mr Greenfield. It is the case that the Offender did not flee, but remained in the house, with subsequent investigations leading to him being arrested and charged. On the evidence, it appears that the Offender’s varying accounts were the product of memory problems, rather than any contrivance on his part. These features do not operate against the Offender on sentence.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender’s history of deprivation and exposure to alcohol, violence and abuse bear, to some extent, on his moral culpability given the role of alcohol in the commission of the offence: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at 594-595 [43]-[44]. The fact that this circumstance may be taken into account in assessing the Offender’s moral culpability must be balanced as well with the seriousness of his offending: Munda v State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600 at 621 [57].
	
	
	There is no psychiatric explanation for the Offender committing the offence which may have operated to reduce his moral culpability. The medical evidence does not indicate that his epilepsy played a part in the commission of the offence so as to operate in this way.
	
	
	The psychological evidence points to the existence of anger issues in the Offender, with his anger being easily triggered. The Offender, of course, was 43 years old at the time of the offence and his criminal history included a number of offences of violence.
	
	
	All offences of murder are, of course, most serious. This was an offence of significant objective gravity.
	
	
	To the extent that it may assist the sentencing process, I record my conclusion, using the statutory language of s.54A(2), that the present offence lies in the middle of the range of seriousness for an offence of murder.
	


Other Factors Relevant to Sentence


	
	An assessment whether the Offender has demonstrated remorse and contrition in this case is not without its complications. Having fatally attacked Mr Greenfield in the house, the Offender took no steps to assist him. The Offender remained in the house, answering Mr Greenfield’s mobile phone in the manner described earlier in these remarks. The Offender did not flee nor does it appear that he took any action to cover up his crime. It was the Offender who made the “000” call as a result of the telephone call as to the whereabouts of Mr Greenfield. As said earlier (at [119]), the Offender’s behaviour over this period appears to have been the product of memory problems, rather than any contrivance on his part.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender has come to demonstrate remorse for killing a person who had been a friend of his. This remorse is demonstrated by his plea and statements made by him accepting responsibility for the death of Mr Greenfield and expressing regret for his actions and the harm it has caused to others.
	
	
	The Offender has a significant criminal history including offences of violence. It is clear that alcohol has played a part in past offences. The Offender was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the present offence and this is an aggravating factor on sentence.
	
	
	The Offender’s criminal history does not assist him on sentence. It stands in the way of leniency being extended to him on sentence.
	
	
	General deterrence is an important factor on sentence for a crime involving substantial violence causing the death of another person. Specific deterrence is important as well, in circumstances where the Offender has had opportunities extended to him by criminal courts in the past, but nevertheless has committed this serious offence.
	
	
	I take into account the Offender’s highly disturbed upbringing involving different carers and homes in an atmosphere marked by violence and abuse. These factors shed light upon the Offender’s makeup and personality.
	


Determining an Appropriate Sentence


	
	I have referred to a range of factors to be considered on sentence. It is necessary now to conclude the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence.
	
	
	The offence committed by the Offender is of significant objective gravity. Aspects of the Offender’s background and personal history operate to reduce his moral culpability.
	
	
	The Offender’s criminal history does not assist him on sentence. His subjective circumstances, including his health issues, must be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	The sentence to be imposed must reflect the need for specific deterrence and general deterrence.
	
	
	The Offender has demonstrated remorse and, although difficult to assess, his prospects of rehabilitation are not without hope.
	
	
	The Offender is entitled to a 25% discount on sentence for his plea of guilty.
	
	
	Having regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors and relevant sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an appropriate head sentence, prior to application of the 25% discount, would be one of 26 years. After allowance is made for the 25% discount, a head sentence of 19 years and six months ought be fixed.
	
	
	Mr Wilson SC submitted that special circumstances might be found here. He submitted that the Offender will need an extended period of supervision to readjust to community life after what will necessarily be a lengthy custodial sentence. I do not make a finding of special circumstances in this case. I am satisfied that the parole period component, which will form part of the sentence, will provide ample opportunity to the Offender by way of conditional liberty, in the event that he is released to parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Accordingly, the sentence to be imposed will comprise a head sentence of 19 years and six months with a non-parole period (after some rounding) of 14 years and seven months. The sentence will commence from 1 February 2013.
	
	
	These remarks on sentence record my reasons for setting a non-parole period that is shorter than the standard non-parole period in accordance with the requirements of s.54B(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Would the Offender please stand.
	
	
	Robert James Pluis, for the crime of murder of Darren Greenfield, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 14 years and seven months commencing on 1 February 2013 and expiring on 31 August 2027 with a balance of term of four years and 11 months commencing on 1 September 2027 and expiring on 31 July 2032.
	
	
	The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 1 September 2027.
	
	
	Pursuant to s.25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, I advise you of the existence of that Act and the fact that it applies to you and to this offence.

2766219,R v AX [2015] NSWSC 317,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	JOHNSON J: The Offender, AX, appears before the Court for sentence for the crime of murder. A pseudonym is used in these remarks to describe the Offender because of evidence before the Court concerning his assistance to authorities on an unrelated matter, to which reference will be made in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	On 5 December 2014, the Offender pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to the charge that on 16 April 2014 at The Rock, he did murder Rodney James Willis. That plea of guilty confirmed the plea entered by the Offender in the Local Court at an earlier time.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies.
	


Facts of the Offence


	
	It is necessary to make findings of fact with respect to the offence. A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, the Offender gave evidence.
	
	
	What follows is drawn from the Statement of Agreed Facts with express reference being made to any findings arising from the evidence of the Offender.
	
	
	At the time of his death on 16 April 2014, Mr Willis was 76 years of age. He resided in a granny flat at the rear of 9 Scott Street, The Rock (“9 Scott Street”). Residing in the main residence at 9 Scott Street was Edwin Owen, the nephew of Mr Willis. The main residence had been owned previously by Mr Owen’s parents who had both passed away, leaving the house to Mr Owen and his sister.
	
	
	Also residing in the main residence from about December 2013-January 2014 were the Offender (aged 23 years), his wife and their two young daughters. The Offender had grown up in The Rock, but had moved to live in Sydney. When he moved back to The Rock in late 2013, the Offender told a number of friends that he was a police informer and was scared of paybacks and that he had moved back so that nobody knew where he was.
	
	
	The Offender and his wife were friends of Mr Owen who permitted them to live in the main residence at 9 Scott Street.
	


Mr Willis Discovers $30,000.00 is Missing From His Bank Account


	
	Around 8.40 am on 16 April 2014, Mr Willis withdrew $100.00 from an ATM. The ATM receipt revealed that $30,000.00 was missing from his bank account. Mr Willis went to the IGA supermarket at The Rock. He spoke to staff at the IGA supermarket about the missing money. Mr Willis returned to his home and telephoned the Friendship Club at Meals on Wheels at 8.58 am, where he left a message advising that he would pick up his meal after he went to the Men’s Shed. Mr Willis then departed for the Men’s Shed at The Rock.
	
	
	Around 9.00 am, the Offender’s wife also attended the IGA supermarket where she purchased groceries and told staff about moving to Melbourne with their family.
	
	
	At the Men’s Shed, Mr Willis spoke of the missing money and said that he was going home to sort it out. He left the Men’s Shed between 9.45 am and 10.00 am to return home to contact his bank.
	
	
	Upon his return home, Mr Willis arranged paperwork relating to the missing money to facilitate his planned contact with the bank. He placed three ATM receipts on his dining table. The first receipt was dated 14 April 2014 showing a balance of $32,287.71. The second receipt was dated 15 April 2014 with a balance of $31,959.07. The third receipt was dated 16 April 2014 and was time stamped “8.40.56”. It was this receipt which revealed that the sum of $30,000.00 was missing from the account.
	
	
	Also on the table was the local Telstra phone book opened to numbers for the Westpac Bank, Mr Willis’ bank. The portable landline telephone, which had its cradle in the granny flat, but was also used by occupants of the main residence, was not immediately located by Mr Willis and he searched for it.
	


The Offender Had Defrauded Mr Willis’ Account of $30,000.00


	
	The Offender was responsible for the defrauding of the account of Mr Willis of the sum of $30,000.00.
	
	
	Mr Willis was in the habit of recording account balance information on the butts of his cheques. The Offender and Mr Owen had on occasions gone through Mr Willis’ property when he was away from the premises. The cheque butts revealed the balance from time to time in Mr Willis’ account and, in early April 2014, indicated that he had a little over $30,000.00 in it.
	
	
	One cheque and its butt were both completely removed from the cheque book. The Offender used this cheque to make out the sum of $30,000.00 from Mr Willis’ account to himself.
	
	
	Mr Willis had written the account balance from the preceding cheque butt and carried it over to the butt of the cheque following the one used by the Offender to withdraw $30,000.00, thereby indicating that Mr Willis was unaware that the cheque had been removed.
	
	
	Mr Willis had in fact driven the Offender and Mr Owen to Wagga Wagga on 15 April 2014. Unbeknown to Mr Willis, the Offender had deposited the cheque into his own St George Bank account.
	


The Offender Learns that Mr Willis Has Discovered the Fraud


	
	On 16 April 2014, the Offender’s wife asked Mr Owen to walk to the IGA supermarket to buy mobile telephone credit. He was also asked to obtain two sticks of cannabis which he did. He purchased the phone credit at 10.16 am and then went and purchased the cannabis before returning home. Mr Owen was gone for about an hour, between approximately 10.00 am and 11.00 am.
	
	
	The Offender’s wife learned that Mr Willis had discovered that $30,000.00 was missing from his bank account. She told the Offender about this. The Offender said in evidence that his wife told him of Mr Willis’ discovery over an hour before he entered the granny flat and commenced to attack Mr Willis (T16-17, 19 February 2015).
	
	
	Before Mr Owen returned, the Offender went to the main sliding door to the granny flat of Mr Willis. The Offender had armed himself with a tyre iron (T17-18, 19 February 2015). The door of the flat was open and Mr Willis was just inside. The Offender assaulted Mr Willis with the tyre iron. His intention, at that stage, was to knock Mr Willis out. The Offender left Mr Willis in the granny flat and went to get a second and heavier weapon, a pipe. He returned with the pipe and renewed his attack on Mr Willis. At this stage, he intended to kill Mr Willis.
	
	
	Mr Willis suffered numerous blows to the head. Mr Willis was initially attacked near the open sliding glass door in the granny flat living room. Cast off stains and impact patterns were located in various parts of the granny flat, indicating that an attack on Mr Willis took place in that area.
	
	
	The Offender then dragged Mr Willis into the bedroom of the granny flat. Blood impact patterns and further cast off patterns were located in the bedroom, indicating that Mr Willis was struck to the head more than once whilst he was on the floor in the bedroom.
	
	
	After Mr Owen returned, the Offender, his wife and Mr Owen went into Mr Owen’s bedroom where the three smoked cannabis for about 20 minutes.
	


Mr Owen Discovers Mr Willis After the Attack


	
	Some time before 11.30 am, Mr Owen went to the granny flat and heard Mr Willis whimpering through the bedroom window. He looked through the window and saw Mr Willis lying on the floor with blood on his head. Mr Owen thought that Mr Willis had fallen over. He went into the flat where Mr Willis was lying face up on the bedroom floor. Mr Willis had blood on his head and was gasping for breath.
	
	
	Mr Owen went back to the main residence and told the Offender’s wife what he had observed. The Offender’s wife and Mr Owen went into the bathroom to tell the Offender, who was in the shower.
	
	
	Mr Owen left the bathroom and contacted “000” at approximately 11.30 am on his way back to the granny flat. Mr Owen was unable to follow the directions of the “000” operator to assist Mr Willis. Neither the Offender nor his wife assisted Mr Willis.
	
	
	Mr Owen was able to locate a neighbour to provide first aid to Mr Willis. CPR commenced until an ambulance and police arrived around 11.50 am. Mr Willis was unresponsive and CPR ceased. Death was pronounced at 12.17 pm.
	


The Offender Departs for Melbourne


	
	Around 11.50 am, the Offender made arrangements with his sister to travel to Melbourne by train. He left 9 Scott Street shortly thereafter and went to his sister’s house. The Offender and his sister caught the 2.15 pm XPT train from The Rock to Melbourne.
	
	
	The Offender departed before the arrival of police at 9 Scott Street. A crime scene was established and investigations into the death commenced.
	


The Offender Makes Admissions and Returns from Melbourne


	
	Whilst in Melbourne, the Offender admitted to others that he had committed the murder. A friend contacted “000” and advised police of admissions made by the Offender.
	
	
	Following police notification of an outstanding warrant (for failure to perform community service for an earlier offence), the Offender returned to The Rock of his own volition to have the warrant matter finalised. He made further admissions once back in The Rock.
	
	
	At one stage, the Offender stated that if only Mr Willis had not found out until the next day about the $30,000.00, the cheque would have cleared and they would have already left for Melbourne.
	
	
	The Offender and his wife were arrested at The Rock on 20 April 2014. The Offender declined to answer questions in an electronically recorded interview. On 28 April 2014, the Offender’s sister contacted police and advised that the Offender now wished to participate in an interview.
	


Police Interview With Offender on 30 April 2014


	
	On 30 April 2014, the Offender was interviewed by police and made admissions to killing Mr Willis. It is appropriate to set out extracts from this interview, which assist in following the Offender’s thought processes.
	
	
	The Offender said that Mr Willis was standing in the doorway entrance to the granny flat and “I just fuckin’ cracked, cracked of [sic] on the top of the head … he was still like, just a bit dazed and then fuckin’ I hit him again”.
	
	
	The Offender stated he then ran around the side of the house and dropped to his knees thinking “like what have I, what have I fuckin’ done”. He then went into the main residence and made sure “I turned up the TV loud”.
	
	
	He returned to the granny flat and found Mr Willis “sitting on his arse and … he was just kind of dazed and I didn’t know what to do I thought, fuckin’ oh, what he’s going to fuckin’ get up. So I ran straight through like, in there and then fuckin’ cracked him on the head again” and “I seen that like, he was, he was kind of still alive and I didn’t know what to do like, whether to finish him or not”.
	
	
	The Offender told police that he used a bar and a pipe obtained from the yard of the premises. The initial blows were caused by the smaller item with which he confronted Mr Willis, but when its impact was not substantial, he went back into the yard and found the larger pipe.
	
	
	The Offender told police that he dragged Mr Willis into the bedroom. At that time, the Offender observed that Mr Willis was severely injured, but was still alive.
	
	
	The Offender explained the way he had assaulted Mr Willis with the larger pipe:
	


“Um, it was just an actual pipe, it was big ‘cause I thought fuck I’m not going to kill with that that’s so fuckin’ mean, like you know what I mean, if I’ve got something bigger like, fuckin’ maybe it might like do it quicker but I couldn’t fuckin’ do it. I couldn’t do it and then when, when Eddy came back and like, fuckin’ I was stressing out, we had a sesh [session of smoking marijuana], we had a sesh and then he kind of already knew something was wrong, you know what I mean.”


	
	The Offender told police that he had no recollection of striking Mr Willis in the bedroom of the granny flat.
	


Injuries Observed on Post-Mortem Examination


	
	Post-mortem examination of Mr Willis showed extensive blunt-force injuries involving the head.
	
	
	These injuries included a larger number of lacerations to the scalp (top of the head, right and left side) along with numerous skull fractures (right and left and base of the skull). The brain also showed numerous blunt-force injuries (bruises and tears) involving both sides, with some extending into the underlying white matter. There were numerous areas of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage around the brain along with subdural haemorrhages on each side of the brain.
	
	
	Five separate blunt-force injuries to the back of the head were noted, accompanied by lacerations measuring up to 6.2 centimetres. The top of the head showed three lacerations of the scalp measuring up to three centimetres in length, with an underlying fracture of the right parietal bone measuring 18.5 centimetres. Examination of the left side of the head revealed lacerations of up to five centimetres in length. Internal examination of the left side of the head revealed extensive fracturing of the left temporal region. There were numerous areas of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage around the brain along with subdural haemorrhages on each side of the brain. Bilateral haemorrhage between the scalp and skull was also noted, together with an extensive transverse hinge-type fracture of the base of the skull along with multiple fractures of the frontal aspect of the base of the skull. The cause of death was blunt-force head injuries.
	
	
	It is apparent from the description of the injuries to Mr Willis that the attack upon him involved considerable force, with the use of weapons, directed to Mr Willis’ head. This was a savage and sustained attack by a young man to a much older man, with the use of heavy weapons.
	


The Offender’s Drug Use


	
	The Offender told police during the interview of 30 April 2014 that he was using drugs heavily on a daily basis in the lead up to the offence, and that he was affected by drugs (cannabis) at the time of the commission of the offence. He disclosed that he became aware on the morning of 16 April 2014 that Mr Willis had discovered the money missing from his account.
	
	
	The Offender has been in custody since his arrest on 20 April 2014.
	
	
	The Offender’s wife has also been charged with murder. She has pleaded not guilty. The Crown asserts that the Offender and his wife were part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill Mr Willis. That is denied by the Offender.
	


The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Offender was 23 years old at the time of the offence and is now 24 years of age.
	
	
	He has a prior criminal history. On 29 July 2009, he appeared before the Wagga Wagga Local Court on a charge of destroying property and was fined $250.00.
	
	
	On 8 November 2013, he appeared before the Mt Druitt Local Court on a charge of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, for which he was ordered to perform 120 hours’ community service.
	
	
	The Offender failed to comply with his community service order and an arrest warrant issued in that respect on 30 January 2014. It was this warrant which was mentioned earlier in these remarks (at [32]).
	
	
	On 22 October 2014, the Offender appeared before the Wagga Wagga Local Court. He was sentenced for the offence (previously dealt with by way of community service order on 8 November 2013) to imprisonment for one month, commencing on 20 April 2014 and expiring on 19 May 2014.
	
	
	The Offender has been in custody solely with respect to the offence of murder since 19 May 2014.
	
	
	An affidavit of the Offender dated 19 February 2015 was relied upon at the sentencing hearing. As mentioned, the Offender gave evidence at that hearing.
	
	
	In addition, a report dated 9 February 2015 of Michelle Player, psychologist, was tendered in the defence case on sentence. The Offender’s affidavit confirmed that (subject to some limited matters), the history contained in Ms Player’s report was true.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that the Offender was born in New Zealand and came to Australia in 1998, when he was eight years old. He has three sisters, two older and one younger than him. The family relocated fairly frequently before settling at The Rock when the Offender was 13 years old. The Offender left home and lived in Sydney from 2009 when he was 18 years old. As mentioned, he resided at The Rock from about December 2013 to April 2014.
	
	
	After completing Year 10, the Offender left school in early Year 11 in order to pursue employment. He worked at an oil refinery for a period and then undertook door-to-door sales and telemarketing. He had generally been claiming Centrelink benefits between 2012 and his arrest in April 2014.
	
	
	The Offender stated that he had met his wife in Sydney in 2010 when he was 19 years old. They married in 2011. There are two daughters of the relationship, now aged three and two years. The children are currently in the care of their grandparents.
	
	
	The Offender has a history of drug use, including cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines as well as methamphetamine (ice) since he was 19 years old.
	
	
	The Offender stated that his gambling behaviour had been problematic since he was 18 years old.
	
	
	Ms Player undertook cognitive assessment testing of the Offender and noted that the Offender achieved a result that placed him within the low-average to average range of cognitive ability, outperforming 37% of the normative sample for his age. Ms Player stated that the Offender impressed with reasonably well developed intellectual skills which appeared commensurate with his report at school and employment history.
	
	
	Ms Player undertook a risk assessment with respect to the Offender. Ms Player considered historical and clinical risk factors and assessed the Offender as being a moderate risk for future violence.
	


The Offender’s Plea of Guilty and Assistance to Authorities


	
	It was common ground that the Offender had pleaded guilty to the charge of murder at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court. In accordance with accepted principles, the Offender is entitled to a discount of 25% as a result of his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The Crown has placed material before the Court which indicates that the Offender has assisted law enforcement authorities in the detection and investigation of drug supply offences. The Offender’s assistance arose following his arrest in April 2013 when he was charged with certain drug offences. These charges were withdrawn in November 2013 as a result of drug analysis which determined that no prohibited drugs were contained within the samples to which the charges related. The Offender’s assistance played no part in the decision to withdraw the charges against him.
	
	
	Investigating police have described the Offender’s assistance as being crucial to the success of a police operation and the subsequent charging of a person with drug supply offences.
	
	
	Assistance to authorities for the purpose of s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 may relate to assistance in areas unrelated to the crime for which the Offender is to be sentenced. In this case, the assistance of the Offender predated the commission of the crime of murder.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledges that the assistance was of crucial significance to the police and substantially contributed to the prosecution of a drug dealer. The Crown submitted that the Offender’s assistance would attract a discount in the order of 5%.
	
	
	Ms Rigg SC, for the Offender, submitted that a discount equal to or a little higher than that suggested by the Crown would be appropriate, perhaps in a range of a total discount (including 25% for the plea of guilty) of between 30% to 33⅓% from a notional starting point.
	
	
	Section 23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a lesser penalty imposed, as a result of assistance to authorities, must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence for which sentence is to be passed.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Offender acknowledged fairly that, especially in circumstances where there is no evidence of hardship in custody, there may be an unfair advantage to a person in the Offender’s situation in receiving a particular percentage as a discount as compared to another offender whose assistance was exactly the same and with equivalent resulting risk or fears of reprisals, but who has committed, for example, a robbery or a break, enter and steal offence.
	
	
	The fact that the Offender is to be sentenced to a long period of imprisonment for murder is a factor to be kept in mind in determining any appropriate allowance for his assistance to authorities. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that a total discount of 30% should be allowed; 25% relating to the Offender’s plea of guilty and 5% for his past assistance to authorities with respect to unrelated crime. Any greater allowance for the Offender’s assistance would result in a sentence which was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence of murder.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	Three victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing. These were the statements of Ms Meaghan Owen, a niece of Mr Willis, Mrs Christine Willis, the sister-in-law of Mr Willis and Ms Holly Marsden, a niece of Mr Willis.
	
	
	The makers of these victim impact statements lay outside the definition of “family victim” for the purpose of ss.26 and 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Court was asked to take these statements into account in accordance with the principles in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87.
	
	
	The statements of Ms Owen, Mrs Willis and Ms Marsden speak of the devastating effect upon the family arising from the death of Mr Willis. It is clear that Mr Willis was a highly respected member of The Rock community and that his loss has affected many members of that community. He contributed a great deal to community life.
	
	
	I express the sympathy of the Court and the community to the family of Mr Willis for their loss.
	
	
	The law of sentencing requires that substantial parts of these remarks on sentence concern the circumstances of the Offender. It should not be thought, however, that I have lost sight of the impact of this terrible crime on those affected by it.
	


Objective Gravity of the Offence


	
	The Crown submitted that this case, although extremely serious and approaching the worst category, did not call for a sentence of life imprisonment under s.61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a substantial determinate sentence should be passed in this case.
	
	
	I have had regard to the provisions in ss.54A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in considering the role of the standard non-parole period of 20 years on sentence. The standard non-parole period is a guidepost to be taken into account, together with the maximum penalty, as part of the instinctive synthesis process. The standard non-parole period is to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, together with other relevant considerations: s.54B(2).
	
	
	The Court must record reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period: s.54B(3). However, the Court is not required to record the extent to which the seriousness of the offence differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period applies: s.54B(6).
	
	
	Using the statutory language in s.54A(2), the Crown submitted that this offence lay within the upper range of objective seriousness for murder. Ms Rigg SC submitted that the objective seriousness of this offence lay somewhat above the mid-range of objective seriousness, but not within the upper range and not approaching the worst category of case.
	
	
	I have considered the objective gravity of this crime, having regard to both common law and statutory factors which bear upon this question. In forming a view concerning objective gravity, I have taken into account a number of the features of the crime addressed by counsel, including the moral culpability of the Offender. A number of these features extend beyond “objective factors affecting the relative seriousness” of the offence for the purpose of the standard non-parole period: ss.54A(2) and 54B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The factors to which I have had particular regard in assessing objective gravity are the following:
	



	
	the victim, Mr Willis, was vulnerable by reason of his age (76 years) with the Offender (23 years) being more than 50 years younger than him;
	
	
	Mr Willis had done nothing to the Offender to bring about this attack - on the contrary, Mr Willis appears to have got on well with the Offender and he assisted the Offender from time to time;
	
	
	the offence was committed in the home of the victim, the granny flat at the rear of the separate residence where the Offender resided;
	
	
	the offence involved the use of two weapons and two separate attacks by the Offender upon the victim, separated by some time;
	
	
	the Offender armed himself with the tyre iron and made his way to the granny flat where he attacked Mr Willis in the doorway, striking him a number of blows to the head;
	
	
	the lack of any defensive type injuries (apart from a bruise over the back of the left forearm) suggests a sudden attack carried out without warning from the Offender;
	
	
	after the initial attack, the Offender returned to the main house and “turned up the TV loud” before returning to the granny flat, with this act done to cover any noise that might emanate from the granny flat during the continued attack upon the victim - clearly, the Offender had given some thought to what should be done in between the two attacks, to reduce the prospect of others hearing the second phase;
	
	
	upon the Offender’s return to the granny flat, Mr Willis was still alive - the Offender had obtained a more substantial and heavier weapon (a pipe) - the Offender dragged Mr Willis from the lounge room area to the bedroom where he was further attacked and left to die, before his discovery by Mr Owen;
	
	
	the Offender made no effort to assist Mr Willis - he went into the main residence, smoked cannabis with the others and then showered;
	
	
	the degree of violence, as evidenced by the injuries and forensic evidence of blood patterns and blood stains at different points in the granny flat, was very substantial;
	
	
	the motive for the attack was to ensure that he obtained the sum of $30,000.00, which the Offender had sought to obtain fraudulently from Mr Willis - the attack occurred when the Offender became aware that Mr Willis had discovered that the money was apparently missing from his bank account - the Offender was motivated by greed by way of his wish to ensure he obtained the money and to reduce the prospect of discovery by others of his fraud;
	
	
	the Offender’s desire to obtain money was linked to his wish to leave The Rock and travel to Melbourne, a plan which was affected by some anxiety on his part arising from his involvement in drugs and possible knowledge that he had provided information to police in that respect.
	



	
	I accept that the Offender had used cannabis prior to the commission of the offence. This constituted self-induced intoxication at the time of the offence which is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence: s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	To the extent that it may assist the sentencing process, and using the language of s.54A(2), I record my conclusion that the present offence lies well above the middle of the range of seriousness for an offence of murder.
	
	
	This offence involved sustained violence with a weapon directed to an elderly man in his own home by a young assailant. The victim had done nothing to the Offender to bring about this attack. All that Mr Willis had done was to detect that someone had defrauded him of almost all of the funds in his bank account. When it became clear to the Offender that Mr Willis was taking action to stop the fraud being finalised, the Offender proceeded to viciously attack Mr Willis.
	
	
	The Offender was putting into effect a plan to defraud Mr Willis. I accept that the Offender’s decision to attack Mr Willis began as an impulsive reaction, albeit in circumstances where about one hour had passed between his learning of Mr Willis’ discovery of the fraud and the commencement of the attack. It was an extreme response adopted by the Offender to protect his own interests against those of Mr Willis.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender acted with the intention to kill Mr Willis, certainly at the time of the second attack upon him. I am satisfied that the Offender acted at the least with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Willis at the time of the first attack.
	
	
	I accept that, at the conclusion of the second attack, the Offender was aware that he had caused extremely grave injuries to Mr Willis. He took no steps to assist Mr Willis. This fortifies a conclusion that he wished and expected Mr Willis to die. It was only when Mr Owen heard Mr Willis that a call for emergency assistance was made.
	
	
	The fact that the Offender was somewhat anxious at the time of the offence, concerning the prospect of discovery of his assistance to authorities about drug supply, provides limited assistance to him. There were, of course, other steps which he could have taken to reduce concerns of this type which were not apparently availed of by him. Although this aspect does bear upon the Offender’s moral culpability and thus the objective gravity of the crime, it provides limited assistance to the Offender.
	
	
	It may be said, at one level, that the Offender could have simply run away to Melbourne without harming Mr Willis. Given this simple alternative, it may be considered difficult to understand why the Offender would choose the extreme option of killing Mr Willis. However, it must be kept in mind that the Offender, in acting as he did, wished to maximise the prospect that he would obtain the sum of $30,000.00, with the killing of Mr Willis at that time reducing the prospect that the payment of the money would be stopped.
	
	
	Although it may be said that all crimes of murder are most serious, I am satisfied that the murder in this case is a very grave example of the crime, and that this conclusion will be a critical one in determining the appropriate sentence.
	


Other Factors Relevant to Sentence


	
	Although the Offender manifested no remorse for his crime immediately after its commission and at the time when he fled to Melbourne, it may be said that a level of remorse commenced to manifest itself when he returned voluntarily to New South Wales, and soon after made admissions to police. Since then, his plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity. He expressed contrition, in his own way, in evidence at the sentencing hearing before me.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender has demonstrated remorse and contrition for his offence.
	
	
	Although the Offender has a limited prior criminal history, he had not taken advantage of a sentence by way of community service imposed only months before the present offence. The present offence was committed whilst the Offender was subject to a form of conditional liberty: R v Cicekdag [2004] NSWCCA 357; 150 A Crim R 299 at [5]-[8]. This factor does not assist the Offender on sentence.
	
	
	It is difficult to form a conclusion favourable to the Offender concerning prospects of rehabilitation at this time. It must be kept in mind that the head sentence and non-parole period to be imposed will be very lengthy, so that any assessment of his prospects of reoffending, and his level of dangerousness, will relate to a potential release date many years away. The fact that the Offender was capable of committing a terrible crime like this, for reasons of self-interest, is also relevant to an assessment of his dangerousness and risk of reoffending in the future. What may be said is that the report of Ms Player, taken with the evidence of the Offender as to steps which he proposes to take in custody, provides some foundation for the view that he proposes to make constructive use of his time in custody. Time will tell in this respect.
	
	
	General deterrence is an important factor on sentence for a crime such as this, where wanton violence is directed to an elderly citizen with deadly consequences and for no good reason.
	
	
	Specific deterrence is important as well in this case. The Offender had opportunities in the courts but came to commit this offence.
	
	
	I take into account the evidence of the Offender’s disturbed upbringing and his substance abuse and gambling difficulties. His personal history, and these manifestations, provide a background against which this most serious crime was committed.
	


Determining an Appropriate Sentence


	
	I have referred to a range of factors to be considered on sentence. It is necessary now to conclude the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence.
	
	
	The offence committed by the Offender is of a very high level of objective gravity. The Offender’s subjective circumstances serve to explain aspects of his background, and provide some context for the commission of this offence.
	
	
	The Offender has demonstrated remorse. His prospects of rehabilitation are difficult to assess at this time.
	
	
	The sentence to be imposed must reflect the need for specific deterrence and general deterrence.
	
	
	The Offender is entitled to a combined discount of 30% for his plea of guilty (25%) and his assistance to authorities (5%).
	
	
	Having regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors and relevant sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an appropriate head sentence, prior to application of the 30% discount, would be one of 38 years. After allowance is made for the 30% discount, and with some rounding, a head sentence of 26 years and seven months ought be fixed.
	
	
	Given the length of the head sentence and non-parole period involved, a finding of special circumstances should not be made in this case, except to the very limited extent to which rounding alters the strict statutory ratio. I am satisfied that the parole period component to be incorporated in the sentence to be passed will provide ample opportunity, by way of conditional liberty, in the event that the Offender is released to parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period to be fixed.
	
	
	Accordingly, the sentence to be imposed will comprise a head sentence of 26 years and seven months with (after some rounding), a non-parole period of 19 years and 11 months. The sentence will commence from 19 May 2014.
	
	
	These remarks on sentence record my reasons for setting a non-parole period that is shorter than the standard non-parole period, in accordance with the requirements of s.54B(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Would the Offender please stand.
	
	
	For the crime of murder of Rodney James Willis, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 19 years and 11 months commencing on 19 May 2014 and expiring on 18 April 2034 with a balance of term of six years and eight months commencing on 19 April 2034 and expiring on 18 December 2040.
	
	
	The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 19 April 2034.
	
	
	Pursuant to s.25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, I advise you of the existence of that Act and the fact that it applies to you and to this offence.

		30 March 2015",2015-03-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766221,Clegg v R [2015] NSWCCA 49,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against an interlocutory judgment or order of her Honour Judge Huggett in the District Court at Sydney.
	
	
	John Marshall Clegg is to be tried in the District Court in respect of 17 child sexual assault offences he is alleged to have committed in the 1980s against 4 boys who were boarders at a school (""the school"") operated by a religious order (""the religious order""). The Crown proposed a joint trial concerning all complainants on the basis that it was relying upon cross-admissibility of tendency evidence.
	
	
	The applicant sought orders to the effect that there be a separate trial in respect of each complainant upon the basis that the Crown should not be permitted to rely upon tendency evidence. Accordingly, her Honour was first called upon to determine the admissibility of evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The question of joint or separate trials would depend upon that determination.
	
	
	Her Honour heard evidence and submissions over six days and gave judgment on 12 September 2014. She determined that the trial in relation to one of the complainants should be severed on the basis that the evidence he would give was not admissible in the trial concerning the other complainants. However, she also determined that the evidence of the other complainants was admissible in the separate trial of the single complainant.
	
	
	The trial concerning the three complainants was due to commence on 7 October 2014. However, the application for leave to appeal was filed in this Court on 29 September 2014. The trial has now been deferred and is due to commence on 13 April 2015. I understand that the trial concerning the fourth complainant is expected to follow immediately after.
	
	
	By his Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal the applicant seeks orders of the same type as had been sought in the District Court. The proposed grounds of appeal are:
	


1.   That her Honour erred in law.

2.   That the probative value of the tendency evidence in question does not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect that it may have on the applicant.

3.   That a joint trial of the above counts against the accused would not be a fair trial according to law.


	
	A short (one day) extension of time for the filing of the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was sought. It was not opposed and should be granted.
	


The Crown case


	
	Included in annexures to an affidavit sworn by the solicitor for the applicant in support of the notice of motion in the District Court was a document summarising the ""facts"" upon which the proposed Crown case was based. I have derived the following from that document, supplemented by the summary in the judgment of Huggett DCJ.
	
	
	The school was one of a number established and run by the religious order for boys with educational problems, including intellectual disabilities and behavioural problems. It was a boarding school for boys predominantly aged between 8 and 15 years. They lived in dormitories and were grouped together according to their age. They were taught by lay teachers. (The school has since been closed.)
	
	
	During the relevant period in the 1980s there were between 4 and 10 Brothers at the school. Each was allocated a dormitory and was responsible for the care and welfare of the boys in their dormitory. One Brother acted as the ""headmaster/prior"".
	
	
	The applicant was a Brother who was employed by the religious order and was stationed at the school from 25 May 1983 until 22 June 1985 and again from 19 July 1986 until 1 July 1989.
	


The complainant MW (counts 1 to 4A)


	
	The complainant MW experienced learning difficulties and was sent to the school on 10 September 1980 when he was 8 years old. He was discharged on 15 December 1983. All of the offences alleged in counts 1 to 4A were alleged to have occurred in the period 14 August 1983 to 15 December 1983.
	
	
	Count 1 (indecent assault) involves an allegation that around Fathers' Day in 1983 there was an outing to Newcastle Beach. At some point, MW was in a shower cubicle and the applicant came in and masturbated him to ejaculation.
	
	
	Count 2 (indecent assault) involves an allegation that on an outing to some nearby markets MW was in a toilet cubicle and the applicant entered and masturbated him.
	
	
	Count 3 (indecent assault) involves an allegation that during MW's final school week the applicant came into the school gym change room where MW was getting changed. He cuddled MW and said ""When you leave, don't tell anyone what went on here because no one will believe you. That goes for Brother … as well.” MW understood him to be referring to the sexual acts that had been committed upon him by the applicant and the other Brother nominated. The applicant then placed his hand on MW's penis on the outside of his clothing, squeezing and rubbing it for about a minute before leaving the change room.
	
	
	Counts 4 and 4A (sexual intercourse without consent, alternatively, indecent assault of a person under the age of 16) involves an allegation that there was masturbation and fellatio by the applicant upon MW during an outing to a factory.
	


The complainant DJ (count 5)


	
	It is count 5 that Huggett DCJ agreed should be the subject of a separate trial. It is useful to refer to the facts alleged by the Crown as it assists in illustrating an aspect of her Honour's assessment of the tendency evidence.
	
	
	DJ commenced at the school when aged 13 and after he began to exhibit behavioural problems. He was at the school from 30 March 1987 until 3 July 1987.
	
	
	One day, DJ went to the toilet where he heard a boy crying. He saw a boy aged about 8 sitting on the toilet crying, holding a piece of toilet paper which had blood staining on it and there was also blood on the boy's underpants. The boy told him that one of the Brothers had hurt him. DJ understood this to mean that he had been sexually assaulted.
	
	
	That night, DJ got out of bed and went to a payphone. He called his parents and begged to be picked up and brought home but was refused. As he hung up the applicant approached and demanded to know what he was doing out of bed. He responded, ""Fuck off, I want to go home and get away from you poofter bastards. I know what you do here.""
	
	
	The applicant took hold of him and brought him to an office in the middle of the dormitory. He physically assaulted him by slamming his head down onto a desk. He held his head down and had forceful and painful anal intercourse with DJ, saying ""This will teach you to keep your mouth shut"". After a number of minutes he ejaculated and said ""Pull your pants back up, be a good boy, and get back to your room. I don't want to hear another thing from you."" This relates to count 5 in which the Crown alleges an offence of sexual intercourse with a person of or above the age of 10 and under the age of 16 whilst being under the authority of the applicant.
	
	
	The next morning the applicant called DJ into his office and asked, ""Are you over that rubbish last night?"" Two weeks later, DJ returned home for a holiday and never returned to the school.
	


The complainant JJ (counts 6 to 13)


	
	JJ exhibited behavioural problems from the age of 7 and there was domestic violence in the home. He was aged 14 when he first went to the school on 11 February 1987 and remained until 25 March 1988.
	
	
	The Crown alleges sexual assault offences arising from three incidents concerning JJ.
	
	
	The first incident occurred about 3 months after JJ arrived at the school. The applicant invited him to his dormitory one afternoon for a cigarette. He showed him a pornographic magazine, asked him about the size of his penis and then showed him a pornographic movie. The applicant noticed that JJ's penis became erect. He then masturbated and fellated him to the point of ejaculation. When JJ left the applicant told him not to say anything to anyone as they would both get into trouble.
	
	
	The second incident is alleged to have occurred several weeks later. JJ accompanied the applicant to the applicant's residence where they smoked a cigarette. The applicant asked him about the oral sex they had on the previous occasion and whether it made JJ feel good. After JJ responded in the affirmative, the applicant took him into the lounge room and masturbated his penis. He then removed his own penis and wrapped JJ's hand around it, forcing him to masturbate him. He then removed JJ's pants and moved him into another position whereby he penetrated his anus. JJ asked that he stop, complaining that it hurt. The applicant desisted and JJ left.
	
	
	The third incident was another occasion when JJ was smoking a cigarette with the applicant. They smoked a cigarette in the applicant's residence and then the applicant fondled JJ's penis and then had forceful anal intercourse with him.
	
	
	A couple of days after the last incident, JJ climbed a tree and deliberately fell, breaking his collar bone. He claims that he saw this as a way to get away from the school. The Brothers put him on a train and his mother picked him up at the end of the journey and took him to hospital. He did not return to the school.
	


The complainant JF (counts 14 to 17)


	
	JF commenced at the school at age 14 on 10 August 1987 after having been expelled from another school for behavioural problems. He remained until 8 February 1988. JF was a boy then but is now a woman. To avoid confusion but without meaning any disrespect, I will refer to JF by the masculine gender as she was at the time.
	
	
	The Crown alleges two incidents of sexual misconduct by the applicant towards JF. On the first occasion, JF was at the applicant's office smoking cigarettes with him. The applicant exposed his penis to him and then placed JF's hands on it. He then pushed him down to his knees and forced his penis into JF's mouth where he ejaculated. After the semen was cleaned up and JF was allowed to grab a handful of cigarettes he was allowed to leave.
	
	
	The second incident is alleged to have been committed in similar circumstances. It involved JF complying with the applicant's desire that he masturbate the applicant's penis to the point of ejaculation.
	
	
	JF hated the school and ran away on numerous occasions. He finally left on 8 February 1988.
	


Evidence of the complainants concerning identification

The complainant MW (counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4A)


	
	MW did not know the applicant by surname, only as ""Brother John"", whilst he was at the school. Some years later he happened upon the applicant when the latter was engaged as a youth worker at the ""Come in Centre"" (a drop in centre for homeless youth) at Paddington. It was at this time that MW came to know the applicant by his surname. He described Brother John as “of a medium height” and “beefy” when he was at the school.
	
	
	MW was shown a series of photographs on 9 February 2012, the day he completed his first police statement. He had been shown 1 photograph during the course of completing the statement and 18 photographs afterwards. In relation to each of them he was asked a question like ""Can you tell me anything about that photograph?""
	
	
	When MW was shown photograph number 14 and asked, ""Can you tell me anything about that photograph?"" he replied, ""That's Brother John Clegg there"". He was asked and clarified that he was referring to the person on the right hand side of the photograph of two male adults with a male child in the middle.
	


The complainant JJ (counts 6 to 13)


	
	JJ did not know the applicant's surname whilst he was at the school either; he simply knew him as Brother John. He said in his police statement that ""there was no one else called Brother John except this man""; in fact ""there were no other persons working at the school named John whilst I was there either"". He provided a description of Brother John as being white, in his early 40's, tall, of medium build with a big stomach, grey hair, clean shaven, and ""used to smoke a lot"".
	
	
	JJ was interviewed by Michael Eccleston, a Catholic Church appointed investigator, in 2007. He was asked about his claims of having been sexually assaulted by brothers at the school, including the applicant. He confirmed that he only knew the applicant as Brother John. (AB 2 at 278) He was later sent a transcript of the interview that concerned the applicant and it had a Post-It note attached to it with the name ""Brother John Clegg"" written on it. JJ inferred that the Brother John who had assaulted him was of that name.
	
	
	On 9 December 2010, JJ was shown the same 19 photographs as those that had been shown to MW. He was also asked open questions about whether he could say anything about what was depicted in them. When photograph number 14 was shown he said the person on the right-hand side of the adult males with an adult child in between was ""Brother John Clegg. He's the one what um, sexually abused me down at [the school].” JJ volunteered that he did not know his surname until he received paperwork from Michael Eccleston; he had just known him as Brother John. He confirmed that there was no other person named Brother John whilst he was at the school.
	


The complainant JF (counts 14 to 17)


	
	JF described the applicant as his ""year adviser"", a person to whom students could speak if they had problems. His physical description of the applicant included that he was fat, or of large build; he was tall; and he had whitish-grey hair that was not very long but ""he had a lot of it"". He wore a pair of pants with a button up shirt with a pocket on either side of the chest that was never tucked in. He always kept a pack of cigarettes of a particular brand in one of the pockets.
	
	
	JF says he left the school in 1988 when he was around 15 years old. He lived on the streets in Kings Cross for the next 12 years. Sometime after he left the school he met the applicant by chance at Centrelink in Haymarket. The applicant gave him the phone number of the Come in Centre at Paddington. JF used the facilities at this centre. He said that the applicant had a cubicle there. On two occasions the applicant took JF into a store room and had JF masturbate the applicant's penis. JF said the last occasion was the day he left the Come in Centre and returned home to live with his mother and he had not seen the applicant since; this was when he was about 15 or 16 years old.
	
	
	JF was shown photographs on 16 September 2011, the day he signed his statement. As with the other complainants, he was asked open questions as to whether he could say anything about them. He identified the applicant in photograph number 14. He said, ""That's John Clegg, before I knew him, I think that's John Clegg. … But I knew him with silver hair, he had silver hair when I knew him, but I'm sure that's him. … This photo was taken years before I knew him though, he had silver hair when I knew him, he's got dark hair in the photo, but that's him."" He confirmed that this was the man who had sexually assaulted him. He drew an arrow pointing to the man on the right hand side of the photograph and wrote against it: ""I believe the man on the right is John Clegg. He has darker hair than when I knew him. It was silver grey in colour.”
	


The asserted tendency evidence


	
	By way of a tendency notice dated 6 August 2014 (as amended), the Crown contended that the tendency sought to be proved was the applicant's:
	


""tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, namely:

●   To have a sexual interest in 11 to 14 year old boys who were students at [the school]

●   To engage in sexual activities with 11 to 14 year old boys who were students at [the school]

●   To use his position of authority at [the school] to obtain access to 11 to 14 year old boys so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.""

Submissions in the District Court


	
	Mr Skinner, counsel for the applicant, made the following submissions opposing the admissibility of the tendency evidence.
	
	
	First, he accepted that evidence that the applicant committed any of the offences, as a brother in a religious order in breach of his vows, in breach of his duties as a citizen, and in breach of his role as a teacher in respect of children in his care, had significant probative value. That acknowledgement was maintained in this Court. The focus of the submissions then (and now) was upon an asserted high risk of prejudice.
	
	
	Prejudice was said to arise in two ways: one, the jury would not be able to avoid ""circular reasoning"" and two, the case was based upon weak identification of the applicant primarily based upon name.
	
	
	The ""circular reasoning"" argument was based upon the practical requirement in this case that before a jury could take into account evidence as establishing a tendency it would need to be satisfied that a charged offence had been established beyond reasonable doubt: DJV v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206. It was contended that the case in relation to each individual complainant was weak. It was ""almost impossible"" for a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt looking at the evidence directly pertaining to an individual complainant. The risk was that the jury would take into account the evidence alleging offences against other complainants in the course of finding that offences relating to a particular complainant were established to the criminal standard, and before being satisfied that the tendency had been established to that standard. It was submitted the directions to the jury would not be able to overcome this prejudice.
	
	
	The ""weak identification based upon name"" submission was really a foundation for the ""circular reasoning"" submission that the cases concerning individual complainants were weak. It was submitted that there was a risk (the ""prejudicial effect"" for the purposes of s 101) that a ""fragile"" identification of one complainant would be strengthened by the identification by another complainant. Another weakness in the identification evidence was said to arise because two of the complainants had contact with the applicant in Sydney after having left the school: the ""displacement effect"".
	
	
	A further aspect of ""weakness"" in the individual cases was that ""the complaint evidence in relation to each complainant is pretty thin"".
	
	
	All of this, it was asserted, was that ""inherently weak cases with inherently [weak] identification, all possibly being strapped up by a jury, misusing tendency evidence, tendency evidence in itself that isn't that probative and runs the substantial risk of creating a really unfair prejudice"". (Emphasis added.)
	
	
	Counsel disavowed any claim that concoction or contamination between complainants was being contended for.
	


Judgment in the District Court


	
	Huggett DCJ first outlined the nature of the applications with which she was dealing: objection to admissibility of tendency evidence and the related issue of joint/separate trials in respect of each complainant. Her Honour referred to the assertions in the tendency notice and the Crown's claim that there are similarities in the evidence of the various witnesses that established a pattern of behaviour on the part of the applicant revealing the tendencies alleged. She listed the following matters the Crown asserted in this respect (omitting reference to matters relating to DJ and another witness):
	


1.   Each of the complainants attended the school because of troubled family backgrounds and/or behavioural and learning difficulties.

2.   Each of the complainants were in the same age range, namely early teenage.

3.   The accused was aware of the types of troubles and issues each boy had by virtue of his role at the school.

4.   (This became irrelevant with the separation of trial concerning DJ.)

5.   The accused established a relationship of emotional intimacy with JJ and JF through acts such as offering them cigarettes and inviting them into his private residence and/or his office.

6.   The acts relied upon are similar. He masturbated the penises of MW, JJ and JF; he performed fellatio upon MW and JJ; he encouraged or forced each of MW, JJ and JF to touch his own penis and to masturbate him; he had anal intercourse with JJ and JF; and he squeezed and rubbed the penises of MW and JJ before escalating his sexual behaviour.

7.   The accused told MW and JJ not to say anything because ""no-one will believe you"" (MW) and ""we would both get into trouble"" (JJ).

8.   Assaults upon MW and JF occurred in public or semi-public locations such as a shower block, a toilet on a train station, the change room of a gym, or on a bus outside a factory.


	
	Her Honour recognised the fundamental requirement for admissibility, namely relevance (s 56 of the Evidence Act). She then turned to the statutory provisions relating to tendency evidence (ss 97 and 101). She noted that the probative value of the evidence had to be assessed by reference to the facts in issue in the proceedings and the importance the evidence may have in establishing those facts. It was noted that in this case the facts in issue were whether the activity alleged by the complainants occurred and whether it was the applicant who was the perpetrator (her Honour acknowledged the ""identification issue"" to which she would return).
	
	
	Her Honour referred to authorities in this Court concerned with the meaning and assessment of ""significant probative value"" (s 97(1)(b)) and the weighing of any prejudicial effect (s 101(2)): R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228; R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75; DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451; and BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 537.
	
	
	At this point in the judgment her Honour commenced to refer in detail to the nature of the alleged conduct described by the complainants. However she briefly referred to whether there was any ""reasonable possibility of concoction and/or contamination"". This had been disavowed by counsel for the applicant, as I have previously noted, but her Honour's consideration of this issue included a conclusion she drew concerning the identification issue relating to the complainant JJ. Her Honour referred to the evidence that JJ was provided with the surname of the applicant by Michael Eccleston but she was not of the view that this had any bearing upon his selection of the applicant in photograph 14 as the man who had sexually assaulted him.
	
	
	Her Honour then provided a summary of the evidence. First she referred to the evidence about the school and to the history of the investigation. One of the documents the police acquired during their investigation was a list of brothers by full name and (mostly but not always with) a ""religious name"" (a single male name, not the same as their own) who had been appointed to the school. Her Honour referred to those who were there in the period 1983 to 1988. Another document acquired by police was a list for each year of brothers appointed to the school. On its face, her Honour said, the only brother with the applicant's first name was the applicant himself. Her Honour then provided a summary of the evidence of each of the complainants.
	
	
	Huggett DCJ then referred to the submissions made by the applicant's counsel. She first noted his concession as to ""significant probative value"". Her Honour was satisfied of this for herself. The concession did not extend to a witness identified as ""GH"" and her Honour agreed with counsel's submission that such evidence was ""too general and vague"" to have sufficient probative value. Her Honour concluded that the evidence of GH would not be allowed on matters the Crown had relied upon in support of tendency reasoning. He would, however, be permitted to give evidence on general matters.
	
	
	It was at this point that her Honour turned to counsel's submissions as to the weighing exercise required by s 101. She correctly identified that it was contended that there was a risk of prejudice on two bases: the jury being unable to avoid circular reasoning and using the tendency evidence to impermissibly ""strap up or bolster … weak identification cases, each with their own credibility problems"".
	
	
	In relation to the ""circular reasoning"" argument, her Honour considered that it disregarded the directions a jury must be given regarding the separate steps they must follow before tendency reasoning can be employed. That is, the jury must first conclude beyond reasonable doubt that at least one of the charged offences occurred, starting with whichever charge the jury choose to commence with. The jury would look at all of the evidence relating to that charge, including for example, evidence relevant to the complainant's credibility and any complaint evidence. Her Honour identified that the second step was for the jury to ask itself whether it could then be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had the tendency the Crown alleged. If the answer to that question was in the negative, any suggestion that the applicant had such a tendency would have to be put aside.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the submission that circular reasoning would be used by the jury was ""untenable"". She observed that in Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4 such an argument (or at least a very similar one) had been put and rejected.
	
	
	As to the argument contending that there would be a bolstering of individually weak identification cases, her Honour considered that identification was involved ""in very general terms"". But it was not identification of a stranger but ""more properly described as recognition"".
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the submission that JJ's identification of the applicant in photograph 14 was influenced by him having been told the full name of the applicant by Michael Eccleston. She reiterated her earlier observation that this had no bearing upon JJ's identification of the applicant, noting as well the evidence of JJ that there was only one man to his knowledge referred to by the applicant's first name with the title ""Brother"". Reference was made to other evidence supporting the identification: others had said that the person in photograph 14 was the applicant; there was evidence placing the applicant at the school at the relevant time; the applicant appeared on the student file for JJ; and according to the school records, no other brother had the applicant's first name with the title ""Brother"".
	
	
	Her Honour then referred to the submission that the identification of MW and JF was tainted by the ""displacement effect"" in that they had independently happened upon the applicant after they had left the school. She considered that the fact that these complainants came across him some time later when he was older and ""presumably a little greyer or of a different build"" did not affect their recognition of the features of the male selected in photograph 14.
	
	
	As to the submissions concerned with the credibility and reliability of the complainants, her Honour observed that this was a matter for the jury, subject to the directions that would be given, including a Markuleski direction: R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded her reasoning as follows:
	


""I return, finally, to the determinations I must make before tendency reasoning can be admissible.

The Crown, in arguing that the evidence has significant probative value, does not rely on a case of striking similarities but rather on a pattern or system of behaviour or modus operandi in the accused's behaviour. As I have already referred, for the evidence to be admissible the authorities have made clear there do not have to be striking similarities or even closely similar behaviour under s 97.

I am of the view that the evidence of the four complainants does establish a pattern of conduct by the accused and that the existence of such a pattern could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the facts in issue that I have identified earlier. I am of the view that there are a number of features of the alleged conduct and of the events surrounding the conduct described by each complainant which do involve closely similar conduct on the part of the accused. The decision to admit the evidence which evinces a tendency to act in a particular way and with a particular state of mind is not dependent on a finding of striking similarities.

The fact the alleged sexual acts are not identical does not deplete the evidence of its probative value. [To] determine the matter by isolating only identical acts would focus too narrowly upon a tendency to engage in a sexual act in a particular fashion. In my view, whilst there are differences in the complainants' accounts as to the nature of the conduct undertaken and the circumstances in which that conduct occurred the evidence is capable of establishing a sexual interest by the accused in boys who were students at [the school]. In my view, the probative value of the evidence is significant.

The issue in the trial that the tendency evidence will bear upon is whether the acts alleged occurred and whether the accused was the person who conducted himself as alleged in respect of each count.

I am required to assess the capacity of the evidence to effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of these facts in issue. In my view, the proposed evidence is capable of demonstrating that the accused was a person who was sexually attracted to boys who were students at the school and that he acted upon that attraction at various times in the particular way the Crown relies upon in support of each individual count. The evidence is capable of revealing a tendency to act in a particular way and with a particular state of mind as asserted by the Crown in its tendency notice.

I have referred to the proposed evidence of each complainant in some detail and, in my view, by doing so the pattern of behaviour relied upon by the Crown is manifest and requires little further to be said.

I am of the view that the proposed evidence of the complainants establishes that the accused had a tendency to act in the following particular ways:

1.   that the accused took advantage of his position of authority at the school to facilitate access to male children in their early teenage years so he could engage in sexual activities with them;

2.   that the accused engaged in sexual conduct with male students by

a.   touching them in an inappropriate sexual way,

b.    exposing his naked penis to them and having them come into contact with his penis, and

c.    by carrying out sexual acts upon them.

In relation to s 101, does the probative value of the evidence substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused? [O]f its nature, tendency evidence will have a prejudicial effect.

In considering prejudicial effect, there is, in relation to DJ, a matter that does cause me considerable concern regarding prejudice. As I have raised with the parties, in my view, the admission of the evidence of DJ as tendency evidence in the trials of MW, JJ and JF would be to introduce evidence of alleged brutality and violence towards DJ in a trial of the other three complainants of a sort that forms no part of the allegations each of those three complainants make and, simply put, would be incapable of being cured by directions. In saying that, I am cognisant of the fact that similarity in events and circumstances is not a pre-condition for the admissibility of tendency evidence. For that reason, it will be my order that there be a separate trial of Count 5, but in that trial I would allow tendency evidence from either or all of MW, JJ and JF, because the prejudice I have identified does not arise in those circumstances.

In relation to MW, JJ and JF, I am of the opinion that, there being no real risk of contamination or concoction, the tendency reasoning sought to be relied upon does have significant probative value, which probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have upon the jury. I am not of the view there is a real risk that a jury properly instructed would be unable to properly consider the basis upon which the tendency evidence would be admitted. The jury must be directed that they can only take tendency reasoning into account if they are satisfied the particular tendency or tendencies relied upon by the Crown have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Having considered the operation of s 101, I am not of the view that the tendency evidence should be excluded, as the tendency evidence of MW, JJ and JF upon which the Crown relies is admissible in relation to each count on the indictment. It is not appropriate to order that Counts 1 to 4A and 6 to 17 be separated, and I order that the trials of those counts be heard together.

As I have stated, I order a separate trial for Count 5 but rule that tendency evidence of MW, JJ, and JF is admissible in relation to the trial of Count 5."" (Emphasis added.)

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in law


	
	Written submissions for the applicant make clear that this ground involves a contention that her Honour erred in her application of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The written submissions discussed at some length an asserted difference between ""prejudicial effect"" in s 101(2) and ""unfair prejudice"" in s 137. Although her Honour did not use the term ""unfair prejudice"", nor refer to s 137, it was submitted that a passage of her ex tempore judgment indicated that she ""misdirected herself into the application of a different balancing exercise than that required by s 101(2)"" in that she ""did not consider 'any prejudicial effect' the cross-admissibility of evidence of offences in the trial of other offences 'may have on the defendant', but rather the 'danger of unfair prejudice' to the defendant"".
	
	
	The passage of the judgment upon which these submissions were based is only a part of her Honour's reference to principles relating to the application of s 101(2). It is necessary to quote the complete passage was:
	


""Section 101 provides important restrictions on the admission of tendency evidence adduced by the Crown in a criminal trial. It, in combination with section 97, means that tendency evidence, even if relevant, is inadmissible unless the court considers that the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence to be adduced, has significant probative value. And the probative value must substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect on the accused, PWD at 58.

The focus by the section 101 stage is whether the probative value of the evidence, having already found it to be significant, substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect on upon the accused. In DAO Simpson J noted, ""the prejudicial effect is a reference to evidence being used against an accused for a purpose other than that for which it was admitted"", paragraph [149]. The test under section 101 involves a consideration of the risk of an unfair trial. The probative strength of the evidence must be compared with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted.

Section 101 mandates the exclusion of tendency evidence, even if relevant, if there [is] a danger of improper use of the evidence. It is the risk that the evidence of tendency ‘will be taken by a jury to prove too much, that the law seeks to guard against’ (HML v R (2008) 235 CLR 334 at paragraph 12.)

A proper carrying out of the balancing task in section 101 requires an identification of the type or types of prejudicial effect the evidence may give rise to and why it is that the judge has reached the view that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs, or does not substantially outweigh as the case may be, any such prejudicial effect"" (R v Ford).

'The exercise involves an assessment and prediction of the use the jury may make of the evidence against the real risk, it may make some improper use of it. In carrying out this balancing task, a judge is required to consider the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be necessary or available to reduce the prejudicial effect. That is, to consider whether an appropriate direction can be given to the jury to ensure that the evidence is not misused in any way’ R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161 at paragraph 32."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The applicant was critical of her Honour having relied upon paragraph 32 of the judgment of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) in R v Ngatikaura as her Honour was there discussing the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act, not s 101(2). I understand the submission to be that this supported the contention that her Honour had regard to the wrong statutory provision and therefore applied the wrong test.
	
	
	The final indented paragraph of the passage quoted above has the appearance of being a quotation from the judgment of Beazley JA in R v Ngatikaura. It is not. (I assume some transcription error.) The first sentence draws from R v Fletcher at [48]; the second sentence draws from DAO v R at [172]; and only the third sentence is derived from R v Ngatikaura at [32].
	
	
	In any event, what Beazley JA did say at [32] is of equal application to s 101(2) and s 137; namely that the assessment of potential prejudice should include consideration of directions that may be given to the jury:
	


""[32] A court is required, as part of the assessment of the question whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by any unfair prejudice, to consider whether an appropriate direction can be given to the jury to ensure that the evidence is not misused in any way: see R v Cook at [37]. His Honour did not give any express consideration to that question. The possibility that a direction may be given to the jury is integral to the assessment a trial judge must otherwise make in determining whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the unfair prejudice. Failure to give consideration to that question means that his Honour's consideration whether s 137 should (assuming that was his Honour's ruling) be applied so as to exclude the evidence of the prior offences, miscarried.""


	
	It is uncontroversial that it is appropriate in the application of s 101(2) to the admissibility/exclusion evaluative task posed by s 97 to take into account directions which may be given to the jury. The other cases to which her Honour was referring (R v Fletcher and DAO v R which were both concerned with s 101(2)) make that clear.
	
	
	I am unable to accept that Huggett DCJ erred by considering a ""danger of unfair prejudice"". And it is not correct to say that she ""did not consider 'any prejudicial effect'"". This is made clear by the emphasised words in the second and fourth paragraphs of the extract from the judgment above (at [68]). And later in her judgment when Her Honour expressed her conclusions she again applied the terms of s 101(2) (see emphasised words in the 9th and 11th paragraph of the extract above at [65]).
	
	
	But even if there was the error for which the applicant contended, I cannot see how a consideration of ""unfair prejudice"" was any different from an assessment of ""any prejudicial effect"". There is a real question as to whether there is a difference between the two concepts: R v Ford at [55] (Campbell JA); Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [47] (Hoeben CJ at CL).
	
	
	The applicant supported the elucidation of the meaning of ""prejudicial effect"" by Simpson J in DAO v R at [150]:
	


""'Prejudicial effect' is a reference to evidence being used (against an accused person) for a purpose other than that for which it is admitted.""


	
	Huggett DCJ actually quoted this in the sentence that immediately preceded the passage extracted in the applicant's written submissions.
	
	
	It was also submitted that ""her Honour erred in law"" in her treatment of the applicant's ""circular reasoning"" contention. Submissions were made on this topic in the context of Ground 2 where they are relevant to an assessment of potential prejudicial effect being weighed with probative value. If there be any error it is not one of ""law"" and so this topic adds nothing to the present ground.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 2 - The probative value of the tendency evidence in question does not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect it may have on the applicant


	
	To succeed on this ground the applicant must demonstrate error in the sense identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: DAO v R.
	
	
	The ""circular reasoning"" argument principally focussed upon her Honour's rejection of it on the basis that that submission ignored the directions that a jury would receive as to the correct approach to tendency evidence (see above at [59]).
	
	
	The submissions for the applicant in this Court commenced with reference to the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj v R at [48]-[56] and the proposition that jury directions cannot always be effective in overcoming prejudice. So much may be readily accepted for the reasons his Honour gave. But the converse - jury directions can never be effective in overcoming prejudice - does not follow. Hoeben CJ at CL was not attempting to lay down any universally applicable principle but was dealing with the facts of the case at hand.
	
	
	The applicant was critical of her Honour's reference to Doyle v R; R v Doyle in the context of rejecting the ""circular reasoning"" argument. It was submitted that the factual matrix in that case was different to that in the present case where the evidence said by the Crown to establish tendency is confined to the charged offences.
	
	
	I have earlier summarised the passages of her Honour's judgment dealing with this issue (see above at [59]-[60]). In my view it was open to her to consider that a jury would be well able to apply the directions that would be given about the sequential process of reasoning they must apply in relation to the tendency issue. It is a process that is readily capable of being understood and applied. It may be contrasted with the quite different types of concerns discussed by Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj v R; concerns about evidence being of such a nature that it might divert the jury from a proper consideration of the evidence.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that it was ""not necessarily safe to just assume that things can be cured by jury directions"" and that ""her Honour doesn't really seem to have dealt with that in her judgment"". I am unable to accept that her Honour did not critically consider whether there was prejudice which could not be overcome by jury directions. Her disallowance of the Crown's reliance upon the evidence of DJ in the trial concerning MW, JJ and JF indicates quite the contrary.
	
	
	The applicant's submissions place some store in the fact that the tendency is said to arise only from charged acts. That is not a reason that compels exclusion on the basis of ""circular reasoning"".
	
	
	The second point sought to be made by the applicant under this ground was concerned with ""the possible prejudicial effect of use of the tendency evidence by the jury in considering the strength of each complainant's identification of the applicant as his assailant"". This was put on the basis that the individual complainant's identification of the applicant was ""objectively fragile"" for various reasons.
	
	
	One of the asserted weaknesses was said to be that it was ""identification by name"" and reference was made to matters such as that the investigator, Michael Eccleston, had given the full name of the applicant to JJ some many years later. Reference was also made to the ""displacement effect"" arising from MW and JF having met the applicant some time after having left the school. The photographic identification (described by her Honour as more a matter of recognition) was said to be of no value when a complainant had previously named the applicant as the assailant.
	
	
	Counsel asserted that there would be prejudice arising from the jury assessing the correctness of a complainant naming the applicant as the assailant by reference to the evidence of the other complainants. If the jury followed the trial judge's directions and first determined that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the allegations made by an individual complainant, it was said to be then impossible that they would not then use that finding as supporting the correctness of the identification of the applicant by the other complainants. This, it was submitted, would amount to the use of tendency evidence ""for a purpose other than that for which it was admitted"" (DAO v R at [150]).
	
	
	I set out earlier in considerable detail the reasoning of Huggett DCJ in rejecting the applicant's contention that the probative value of the tendency evidence concerning MW, JJ and JF substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. I did so because it is apparent that her Honour approached her task with considerable care; she attended to the essence of each of the arguments advanced by the applicant; and she arrived at a result which was guided by a correct appreciation of the statutory provisions and the relevant principles as to their application.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there is any error in a House v The King sense in any of these matters relied upon by the applicant. They amount to the remaking of arguments that were made in the District Court with the apparent hope that this Court would arrive at a different conclusion.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 3 - A joint trial as ordered by her Honour would not be a fair trial according to law


	
	No discrete submissions were made in support of this ground. It depended upon success of the earlier grounds. It follows that this ground fails as well.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Extend time for filing Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal until 29 September 2014.

2. Leave to appeal refused.


	
	DAVIES J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2766222,R v Kennedy [2015] NSWSC 327,"SEntence


	
	On 25 December 2010 siblings Mary Tarr and Doug Davies sat down together for Christmas lunch. There was an empty chair at the table that day which, but for the events of 19 November 2010, would have been taken by Stanley Bruce Davies. That Christmas lunch of 2010 was to have marked the 75th anniversary of Christmas lunches celebrated together by Mrs. Tarr and Stanley Bruce Davies, and another anniversary of such celebrations with their younger brothers.
	
	
	That empty chair is symbolic of the loss of the life of Stanley Bruce Davies to his family and to his community, Mr. Davies having been savagely murdered by three young men who entered his home on the evening of 19 November 2010, and beat him so brutally that he died, one week later, on 26 November 2010.
	
	
	Whilst the magnitude of the loss of Mr. Davies to his siblings, family and friends, and the grief and pain suffered by those who mourn him, cannot aggravate the offender’s crime or be relevant to the penalty to be imposed, it goes to illustrate why the community regards the crime of murder as such a serious offence. It is why the Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life for this offence, and specified a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Court recognises however that no sentence can compensate the family of Mr. Davies for their loss and their grief at the horror of his death. All the Court can do is extend its deepest sympathy to Mrs. Tarr, Mr. Davies, Mr. Davies, and their family.
	
	
	The offender, Raymond Anthony Kennedy, appears before the Court today to be sentenced for his part in the terrible crime that brought about Mr. Davies’ death.
	


The History of the Matter


	
	Five Christmases have now passed since Mr. Davies was murdered. As that lapse of time suggests, this matter has some history.
	
	
	A police investigation began after a horribly injured Mr. Davies was found unconscious at his Kempsey home on 20 November 2010. On 8 December 2010 a search warrant was executed by police on premises at Dondingalong. Richard Smith was found there hiding in a cupboard. He was arrested in relation to the murder of Mr. Davies. Also present at the Dondingalong premises that day were Steven Smith and the offender.
	
	
	On 27 June 2012 Steven Smith was arrested and also charged with the murder of Mr. Davies. Five days later, on 2 July 2012, this offender was also arrested. He too was charged with Mr. Davies’ murder.
	
	
	On 1 February 2013 Richard Smith was arraigned upon an indictment charging him with the murder, and he pleaded guilty.
	
	
	On 5 April 2013 Steven Smith and the offender were jointly ordered to stand their trial on 7 June 2013 before the Supreme Court sitting at Port Macquarie. That trial date was later vacated.
	
	
	Steven Smith was re-arraigned on 2 October 2013 and entered a plea of guilty to the indictment charging him with Mr. Davies’ murder. He also pleaded guilty to other unrelated offences.
	
	
	On 6 November 2013 the applicant appeared before Barr AJ in the Supreme Court sitting in Sydney, and was again arraigned upon a charge of murder. On that date the offender entered a plea of guilty to the charge. The sentence proceedings were adjourned for hearing on 15 November 2013.
	
	
	On 15 November 2013 the sentence hearing commenced, but was not finalised due to the need for two witnesses to attend to give evidence relevant to a factual dispute. The matter was further listed for sentence hearing on 28 February 2014.
	
	
	On that date, the two required witnesses did not attend Court and warrants were issued by the Court for the arrest of each. The matter was adjourned to 7 March 2014 for further hearing.
	
	
	On 7 March 2014 the offender withdrew his instructions to his legal representatives and indicated that he wished to withdraw his plea of guilty. The matter was further adjourned.
	
	
	Thereafter, in June 2014, the applicant filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to vacate the plea of guilty he had entered on 6 November 2013.
	
	
	That application was heard before me on 5 December 2014, and refused.
	
	
	On 13 March 2015 the parties tendered their respective cases on sentence, and made submissions to the Court.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	There was no agreement between the parties as to the facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced and so the task of determining the facts of the offender’s involvement in this crime falls to this Court.
	


The Evidence


	
	Relevantly, the Crown tendered a summary of facts, statements from Glenda Button (Ex. F) and Kirsty Roe (Ex. H), and the transcript of a recording of a conversation between Steven Smith and other persons which took place on 5 March 2011 (Ex. E). All of that material was subject to dispute by the offender.
	
	
	The Crown’s summary of the facts, Exhibit A1, is not agreed. Specifically, the offender disputes the matters referred to in paragraphs [4], [6], [7], [9], [22], and [23] of the document. Oral evidence was called from Glenda Button and her evidence before the Court differed substantially from that which was contained in her statement. The statement of Kirsty Roe was tendered by the Crown pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995, and was not subject to cross-examination or any other form of testing. The transcript of the conversation involving Steven Smith was objected to, and admitted provisionally only. Mr. Smith himself was called as a witness, but refused to take an oath or affirmation, and refused to give evidence, even on an unsworn basis. He was subsequently charged with three counts of contempt in the face of this Court, and remains to be dealt with. Finally, the Crown called evidence from Detective Senior Constable Dean Rutledge.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence or call evidence relevant to the factual findings to be made.
	
	
	Glenda Button attended Court in answer to her subpoena on 13 March 2015, although she did not arrive until the early afternoon. When she did appear, her unwillingness to attend Court and to give evidence was palpable. She presented as drug affected, and almost certainly was apprehensive, even fearful. What she may have been apprehensive or frightened of I cannot determine.
	
	
	Ms. Button acknowledged in evidence having made a statement to police on 17 December 2010, but sought to qualify its contents to a degree by stating that she was drug affected when she made the statement.
	
	
	Ms. Button told the Court that “some” of her statement was true. In cross-examination by the Crown, leave to do so having been granted pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, Ms Button pointed to paragraphs 25 and 26 of her statement as those which were not truthful. She confirmed that the rest of her 2010 statement was true.
	
	
	In cross-examination by Mr. Johnston, for the offender, Ms. Button asserted that she made her statement to police because others had told the police she had information about the death of Mr. Davies, and the police “harassed” her to make a statement. She did, however, specifically deny that anyone had placed pressure on her to give a statement, or to say those things that were recorded in it.
	
	
	In answer to a number of Mr. Johnston’s question, Ms. Button claimed not to be able to remember some of the things she had recorded in her statement. She referred to her drug use at the time.
	
	
	Detective Rutledge was the officer who took the statement from Ms. Button, and also that from Ms. Roe. He gave evidence to the Court by videolink. Detective Rutledge, who had been asked to give his evidence without notice and in circumstances where he had not had any opportunity to review contemporaneous records, had at least some reasonable recall of taking the statements from the two women. He impressed me as entirely candid and genuine.
	
	
	He deposed that he had spoken to Ms. Button and Ms. Roe together, and that the two had then attended the Kempsey Police Station to make statements. Neither showed any reluctance to give a statement. At the station, he spoke with each woman separately, and obtained a statement. He knew Ms Button to be a user of heroin and cannabis, but she displayed no signs of affectation from either drug, or other substance, when she gave her statement. As an officer with, at that time, 27 years’ experience in the Police Force, I consider him able to express such an opinion.
	
	
	Although Detective Senior Constable Rutledge did not specifically recall reading Ms Button’s statement to her, he said he believed that he would have gone through the document with her prior to her signing it, as that was his usual practice. It was his practice to read a statement to or with a witness and make any changes that were necessary, prior to the witness signing the statement. I accept that he followed his usual practice in this instance.
	
	
	The same procedure was followed in relation to Ms. Roe, and the officer did not consider her to be unwilling to give a statement, or affected by any drug when she did so.
	
	
	In both instances the statements contain the usual jurat as paragraph one, with each witness acknowledging the obligation to be truthful, the possibility that the evidence contained in the statement could be given in court, and the possibility of criminal charges following any false statement.
	
	
	Whilst Ms. Button presented as a reluctant witness who was unwilling to say anything that might be adverse to the offender, I am satisfied that, when she gave her statement, she gave a truthful account of matters within her knowledge. I have had regard to the evidence of Detective Rutledge in drawing that conclusion, but also to the fact that Ms. Button could only have known about some of those matters that she referred to in her statement from her own observations or from what the offender told her. That conclusion is strengthened to a degree by the correspondence between those matters connected with the home invasion that she referred to, and other independent evidence (such as medical and forensic evidence) of those same things. The fact that Kirsty Roe gave a consistent account in her statement, albeit untested, also provides some further reason to accept as truthful those things Ms. Button said in her statement, and affirmed in most regards in her evidence.
	
	
	Although Ms. Roe’s statement of 17 December 2010 was unsworn, and not subject to testing, I have had regard to its contents insofar as those contents are supported by evidence independent of Ms. Roe (and of Ms. Button). I do so on the basis that Ms. Roe made her statement willingly and at such a time when she was not drug affected, and she acknowledged within it the obligation on her to tell the truth. Where her statement is consistent with forensic evidence, it may be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Steven Smith was called to give evidence on 13 March 2015. His unwillingness to testify was even greater than that of Ms. Button.
	
	
	Mr. Smith, who is presently in custody serving a lengthy sentence which will see him in prison until at least 7 August 2030, refused to take an oath or affirmation, and refused to answer any questions, even to give his own name. In Court he swore extravagantly and threatened physical violence to court staff and Corrective Services officers, actually raising his fists and moving to strike staff on a number of occasions. His conduct was such that he represented a significant risk to the safety of all officials present in the court room, and I had him removed from the Court.
	
	
	If Mr. Smith had done as he was directed to do, and taken an oath or affirmation and given truthful evidence, he might have been expected to give evidence about precisely what had occurred inside Mr. Davies’ home on that terrible evening. The Crown had a legitimate expectation that Steven Smith could give evidence consistent with his recorded comments made on 5 November 2011, thus providing relevant information as to this offender’s role in Mr. Davies’ death. In those recorded comments, Steven Smith asserted that the three offenders went to Mr. Davies’ home intending to “do the safe”. He claimed that the offender and Richard Smith were affected by drugs and, under the influence of drugs, “kept going and going”. From the overall context of those comments, it appears that Steven Smith attributed the violence against Mr. Davies to Richard Smith and the offender, including repeated blows to the head delivered by both.
	
	
	Although the offender did not give evidence and so what he asserts about these events is largely unknown, having regard to evidence before the Court relevant to his application to reverse his plea, it is open to infer that the offender may have expected Steven Smith to resile from the account he gave on 5 November 2011, and support the offender’s claims that he had no prior knowledge of the purpose of attending Mr. Davies’ home, and did not himself ever strike Mr. Davies, touching him only to try to assist him.
	
	
	What Steven Smith’s evidence would have been can now only be the subject of speculation due to the contempt of the witness in the face of the Court. Both parties thereby lost an opportunity that should have been open to them to obtain or test what would have been highly relevant evidence.
	
	
	Steven Smith’s account of the night of 19 November 2010 was given to associates in the drug using milieu in which he moved. It was not subject to any obligation or promise to be truthful, and ordinary human experience would suggest that it was likely to be a significantly diluted account of events, at least in so far as his own conduct was concerned. What these three men did that night was a shameful thing, such that even hardened criminals might feel constrained from acknowledging their involvement. It is likely that Steven Smith felt that shame at least at some level, and minimised his responsibility for what was done to Mr. Davies in his conversation.
	
	
	Certainly having seen the violence to which he almost instantly sought to resort in the environment of a court room, where he was not drug affected, and was subject to the supervision of Corrections officers, I would not readily conclude that Steven Smith was innocent of involvement in the assault upon Mr. Davies, as he asserted on 5 November 2011, and as was accepted when he was sentenced.
	
	
	Accordingly, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the veracity and reliability of his unsworn assertions about the role of the offender.
	
	
	Whilst the transcript of the conversation of 5 November 2011 was admitted provisionally on 13 March 2015, I am not prepared to finally admit the evidence, and such evidence as it contained I have set aside.
	
	
	The offender neither gave evidence nor called any evidence relevant to the facts that the Court should find.
	
	
	There was some evidence adduced by him during the hearing of the application to vacate the plea of guilty in December 2014 that could be relevant to this question, but the offender did not seek to rely upon that evidence for the purposes of these proceedings. Since his evidence was not tested in any real sense during the earlier proceedings, it could have had little weight in any event.
	
	
	The offender has given some limited accounts of the events of 19 November 2010 to others, but such accounts must be treated with considerable circumspection in circumstances where they have not been given on oath: R v Quatami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369.
	
	
	To the author of a pre-sentence report requested by the Court the offender gave an account inconsistent with any liability for this crime. I do not accept that untested hearsay account.
	
	
	To Anthony Diment, a forensic psychologist seen by the offender during the course of the proceedings, the offender acknowledged having a poor memory of the night, but asserted that he did not have any intention of hurting anyone.
	
	
	I am not prepared to accept that hearsay assertion on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	I have had regard to all of the relevant and admissible evidence tendered to the Court in finding the facts to be these.
	


The Facts Found by the Court


	
	Mr. Davies, the deceased, was a man of 75 years who lived alone at his home in Dangar Street at Kempsey. He had lived in the area all of his life.
	
	
	In his home Mr. Davies kept a collection of coins in a safe, and he had guns stored in a secure gun safe.
	
	
	At 6 o’clock on the evening of Friday 19 November 2010 a friend of Mr. Davies called by his home and spoke with him. At the time, Mr. Davies was well and he had no injuries.
	
	
	On that same evening the offender was also in the Kempsey area. He was staying or living with his parents and other family members at an address in South Kempsey.
	
	
	Also living at the South Kempsey address at that time with the offender and his family were Glenda Button and Kirsty Roe.
	
	
	During the late afternoon or early evening of 19 November 2011 the offender told family members and others present, including Glenda Button, that he was going out. Referring to Richard Smith, the offender told those present that “Poochie” had a “house lined up. There is a safe in it and he wants to do it over”. The offender said that someone had told Richard Smith, or “Poochie” as he was known, that there were valuable coins kept in a safe at the house. The offender left his home intending to meet Richard Smith and Steven Smith.
	
	
	When he left the house the offender was wearing a pair of borrowed Nike TN jogging shoes.
	
	
	At about midnight Mr Davies' neighbours heard banging sounds coming from his home. There was a noise similar to that made by a door when slammed, and then more banging sounds.
	
	
	The noises were likely to have been made by the three offenders, who entered Mr Davies' house at around this time, intending to steal the property Richard Smith had been told was inside the premises. How the three gained entry is not clear; it may have been as simple as banging on the door until Mr. Davies opened it, and then pushing into the house. The evidence, however, establishes only that the doors and windows of the home were intact, and there was no sign of a forced entry.
	
	
	Glenda Button recalls the offender saying that, as they were “rushing in the door” Richard Smith tripped and cut himself. This is consistent with forensic evidence. DNA matching that of Smith was recovered from blood stains at the house. It is that evidence that allowed police to arrest and charge Richard Smith in December 2010.
	
	
	Having entered the house the offenders confronted Mr. Davies and demanded property from him. The fact that the offenders left empty handed is a testament to Mr. Davies’ courageous refusal to surrender his possessions to them.
	
	
	The offenders dealt with Mr. Davies brutally. From the injuries that he sustained, and the drip trails left in blood at his home, it is evident that the offenders assaulted Mr. Davies to the point where he was bleeding heavily, and then propelled him in some way around his house, doubtless in an attempt to force him to hand over keys to his safes, or reveal the location of items of value. In some locations in the house blood had pooled; in other places there were areas of heavy bloodstaining.
	
	
	From the evidence of blood deposition it is likely that Mr. Davies was viciously assaulted in the lounge room of his home and, bleeding heavily from his injuries, he was then forced from the lounge room, and along the hallway to one of the bedrooms. In that bedroom, apparently a spare room, there was a considerable amount of blood deposited, including impact blood spatter. The room had been ransacked. Cupboard doors hung open and drawers had been pulled from within. The contents of drawers and cupboards had been dragged out and strewn around the room.
	
	
	A cupboard in that bedroom that was fitted with a deadlock showed signs of having been kicked repeatedly, plainly in an attempt to forcibly open it. The imprint of the shoe worn by the individual who tried to kick his way into the cupboard was left in blood. The blood was that of Mr. Davies. I am satisfied that it was the offender, wearing the Nike TN shoes, who left his bloody shoeprints on the cupboard, and also in the doorway to the kitchen.
	
	
	A gun safe and another key locked safe were in this bedroom. Each showed signs of the application to them of considerable force, applied in an attempt to gain access to the contents. Tool impressions left on timber around the key locked safe showed that a tool had been used in an attempt to force the safe open.
	
	
	The amount of blood in this bedroom was such that it is clear that Mr. Davies was again brutally assaulted in this room, inferentially, to endeavour to force him to open the locked safes, or provide the keys to allow the offenders to do so.
	
	
	The offender said in the presence of Glenda Button, “We got away with nothing, because the bloke wouldn’t give us the code to the safe. That was when Pooch was jumping on him, because he wouldn’t give the code up”.
	
	
	The offenders must have been inside the home for some period of time, since the house had been comprehensively ransacked, and time had clearly been spent as the offenders tried to forcibly open safes and other secured cupboards.
	
	
	When they left, they left Mr. Davies on the floor of the bedroom that contained the safes. He was left injured, wedged between a bed and a cupboard.
	
	
	Glenda Button saw the offender arrive home in the early hours of the morning of 20 November 2010. He went straight to his bedroom without speaking to Ms. Button or Ms. Roe, who were both awake. Ms. Button noticed that the offender appeared to be wearing different clothes to those he had been wearing earlier in the night. It is reasonable to infer that he had changed his clothes, in all likelihood because of blood staining to the clothing he had been wearing earlier.
	
	
	He later told her about the offence, claiming that Richard Smith had hit Mr. Davies with a hammer. He said that he had thrown away the Nike shoes he had been wearing.
	
	
	Mr. Davies was not found until the following afternoon, Saturday 20 November 2010. At about 5.30pm Mrs. Tarr, Mr. Davies’ sister, went to the house to have dinner with Mr. Davies. She saw the morning newspaper uncollected at the front of the house and, on entering the house, she saw immediately that the lounge room had been ransacked. She called out to her brother but there was no response.
	
	
	Mrs. Tarr went to the nearby home of her younger brother and the authorities were contacted.
	
	
	The police went into Mr. Davies’ home and quickly found him on the floor of the spare bedroom. He was unconscious and his head was severely swollen. His clothing was drenched with his blood and his shirt appeared to have been ripped from his body. Mr. Davies was taken immediately by ambulance to Kempsey Hospital, and thereafter evacuated by air to the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle.
	
	
	Mr. Davies had extensive and irretrievable brain injuries consistent with multiple blows from a blunt object. He could not be saved by medical staff. On 26 November 2010, a life support system was turned off. Mr. Davies died from his injuries that evening.
	
	
	Dr. Allan Cala conducted a post-mortem examination of Mr. Davies on 30 November 2010. Dr. Cala concluded that Mr. Davies had died as a result of craniofacial trauma with bleeding to the face and into the brain. He found multiple and severe injuries.
	
	
	Dr. Cala observed evidence of extensive trauma to the head, face and neck, with both zygoma fractured. The hyoid bone was also fractured, suggesting neck compression or blunt trauma to the upper neck. Severe traumatic brain injury had been inflicted with bleeding on and in the brain. Dr. Cala concluded that the overall characteristics of the injuries to the face and head were consistent with a severe, violent, and sustained assault to the head, face, and neck.
	
	
	There were also injuries to the torso and upper limbs, including “patterned” injuries consistent with an assault using an implement such as a tyre lever or golf club shaft. There were multiple bruises and abrasions to the body, including to the fingers and hands.
	
	
	The head and facial injuries seem to be entirely consistent with assault using fists, feet, and implements. The offender told Glenda Button that a hammer had been used to strike Mr. Davies, and the use of such a weapon is suggested by the injuries, as is an offender “jumping on” Mr. Davies.
	
	
	The evidence does not allow me to conclude who of the three offenders inflicted the terrible violence that Mr. Davies suffered. In that this was a joint criminal enterprise to rob Mr. Davies, in some ways the role played by each inside the house is of lesser significance, since each is responsible for the acts carried out in furtherance of the enterprise.
	
	
	Biological material removed from under one of Mr. Davies’ fingernails matches the DNA profile of the offender. It is clear there was physical contact between the two. That the DNA was recovered from underneath the fingernail suggests that Mr. Davies may have scratched the offender, perhaps defensively. That I cannot determine. On all of the evidence, however, I have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the offender applied force to Mr. Davies during this shameful attack, leading to the deposit of DNA.
	
	
	It is likely that Richard Smith was responsible for most of the violence to Mr. Davies.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender was outside the premises for some part of the time during which this crime was carried out. He told Glenda Button that he was in the car outside when he heard smashing. On entering he saw Richard Smith striking Mr. Davies with a hammer. The offender claimed to have taken the hammer away from Smith. I cannot determine, even on the balance of probabilities, whether that last self serving statement has any truth in it.
	
	
	Whether or not the offender acted as lookout for part of the time, I am satisfied that he entered the house with his two co-offenders, and was a party to the ransacking of Mr. Davies’ house in the hunt for items of value, including by forcefully and repeatedly kicking a locked cupboard in an attempt to gain entry. I am satisfied that he applied force to Mr. Davies, and was present whilst his co-offenders did the same. He, like his co-offenders, did nothing to get aid for Mr. Davies.
	
	
	This was a crime of considerable gravity. Three young men joined together to enter the home of an elderly man late in the night with the intention of robbing him. They then assaulted Mr. Davies using fists, feet, and makeshift weapons with such brutal force that he was left terribly and mortally injured. The offenders were all drug users, and the only motivation for this horror was to obtain money or other valuables that could be used to acquire drugs. This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a very much older man who should have been safe inside his home. One elderly man was readily overpowered by three younger men who used both their numbers and their greater strength in an attempt to affect their aim of robbery. Having grievously injured their victim the offender and his co-offenders then callously abandoned him to his fate. Mr. Davies lay horribly injured and alone for many hours until he was eventually found.
	
	
	The evidence is readily capable of establishing the offender’s liability either as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an aggravated robbery during which Mr. Davies was assaulted and killed, or, on the basis that the offender, with his co-offenders, jointly assaulted Mr. Davies intending thereby to do him grievous bodily harm, with the motivation of theft.
	
	
	There is no real distinction in the circumstances of this case; on either approach – constructive murder or intention to do grievous bodily harm – the offender is criminally liable for the murder of Mr. Davies, a murder which is a very grave example of this State’s most serious criminal offence.
	
	
	His moral culpability on either basis is high.
	


The Plea of Guilty


	
	The history of the offender’s entry of and application to withdraw his plea of guilty can be found in R v Raymond Kennedy [2014] NSWSC 1921.
	
	
	A plea of guilty must be taken into account by a sentencing court: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The question is in what way it is here relevant to the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	Ordinarily a plea of guilty is relevant in two ways. It will generally attract a reduction in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed to reflect its utilitarian value to the justice system. Also, a plea of guilty may be considered as indicative of some acceptance of responsibility, and expression of remorse, by the offender for his or her crime.
	
	
	In submission both parties suggested that, by virtue of the application to withdraw the plea, the offender is not entitled to any discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. I do not believe those submissions to reflect the law in that regard. Despite the withdrawal of the plea, there may still be some utilitarian value in its entry, and I have considered the question of any discount on that basis.
	
	
	The plea was a very late one and it was made consonant with a significant factual dispute. The lateness of the plea diminishes any discount to be applied. Additionally, the Court was required to determine a factual dispute which involved evidence being called and tested. In the circumstances of this case, the utilitarian value flowing from the plea is minimal, but should still be recognised by a minimal discount, in the order of five per cent.
	
	
	Having regard to the application to vacate the plea, and the offender’s claims to the author of the pre-sentence report and to Mr. Diment, the plea is not a reflection of remorse or contrition.
	


Proceedings Against the Co-Offenders


	
	By reason of their earlier pleas of guilty Richard Smith and Steven Smith have already been sentenced for the murder of Mr. Davies. The Crown tendered material from those sentence proceedings, and I have had regard to that information, as it is relevant to the proper application of the principle of parity.
	
	
	Richard Smith was sentenced by Schmidt J on 23 August 2013 for the murder of Mr. Davies. The factual basis of the case against him was similar to that established by evidence against the offender. Richard Davies acknowledged in comments to a psychologist that he had struck Mr. Davies, although he blamed the offender and Steven Smith for the worst of the violence. He claimed to have been drug affected at the time, and in need of money to fund his drug use. He expressed remorse to the psychologist for what he had done. He was of limited intellectual capacity.
	
	
	Richard Smith was nine years older than the offender. He also is an Aboriginal man. His childhood years appear to have been unremarkable until his mother formed a new relationship when Richard Smith was about 12 years old. His new step-father was violent and abused alcohol. Smith began truanting and absenting himself from home, and he fell into drug use and crime.
	
	
	Richard Smith had a lengthy criminal history which started when he was about 15 years (although there is conflicting evidence in the tendered material as to his date of birth). There were numerous Children’s Court entries for offences of larceny, steal motor vehicle, and break and enter offences. He had convictions as an adult for like offences and had served periods of imprisonment. He was subject to parole at the time of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Richard Smith received a discount of eighteen per cent on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed upon him, to recognise the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, entered after committal but before trial.
	
	
	But for that discount, the sentence imposed upon Richard Smith would have been 28 years imprisonment. With the discount, her Honour sentenced Smith to a term of 22 years and 11 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 17 years and 2 months imprisonment. His earliest possible release date is 2 January 2029.
	
	
	Steven Smith was sentenced on 14 November 2013 by Barr AJ for the murder of Mr. Davies, and also for two offences of armed robbery. The latter offences were committed in company with Richard Smith and involved the violent robbery of two elderly people.
	
	
	The factual basis of the case before the Court relevant to Steven Smith was a little different to that established by the evidence in the offender’s case, principally because of the admission into evidence of Smith’s conversation of 5 November 2011. In that conversation Smith had minimised his involvement in the brutality against Mr. Davies, and blamed Richard Smith and the offender for the violence. He was sentenced on the basis that he played no physical part in the assault upon Mr. Davies, and tried to give some limited first aid to him.
	
	
	Like the offender, Steven Smith is an Aboriginal man. He is about five years older than the offender. He had a dysfunctional upbringing marred by substance abuse and violence and was himself dependent upon alcohol and drugs. He had attracted a number of entries against him for Children’s Court offences, of a like nature to those of the offender, but additionally had been convicted in the District Court of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence. Smith was subject to parole for that offence at the time of Mr. Davies’ murder, that being an aggravating feature to his crime.
	
	
	A psychological report was in evidence and that established that Steven Smith functioned at a low level intellectually.
	
	
	His Honour was not able to make any positive finding as to the prospects of rehabilitation, although he was satisfied that Smith was remorseful. There was a discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the late plea.
	
	
	Steven Smith was sentenced to a term of 20 imprisonment, with a non-parole period of fourteen years, for the murder of Mr. Davies. His earliest possible release date is 7 August 2030, the sentences having been partially concurrent with the sentences imposed for the robberies. The principle of totality may well have affected the length and structure of the sentence to some degree. Absent the discount, his sentence would have been 22 years and 3 months imprisonment.
	
	
	As the High Court noted in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, the principle of parity “applies to co-offenders whose culpability and antecedents are comparable” (at [117]).
	
	
	Broadly, that is the case here, although the offender’s criminal record is not as extensive as that of either of his co-offenders and, at 18 years of age at the time, he has a greater claim to youth than his co-offenders, although that cannot greatly ameliorate the sentence in the circumstances of this case. The offender was already a parent, living with and supporting his partner and children. His lifestyle was not that of a child, or someone of childlike immaturity. Conversely, the co-offenders were dealt with on the basis that each was remorseful for the crime, and there was a discount applied to sentence of 18 and 10 per cent respectively.
	
	
	I have concluded that the principle of parity applies, subject to those qualifications.
	


Other Relevant Evidence


	
	The offender was aged 18 years and 7 months at the time of the commission of this offence. He is now just short of his 23rd year.
	
	
	His first recorded criminal offences occurred in October 2005 when the offender was 13 years old. Warrants were issued for the offender’s arrest for a string of offences, including multiple counts of aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence. Bonds and cautions in the Children’s Court followed.
	
	
	There were also offences of assault, destroying property, and receiving stolen property.
	
	
	In May 2006 there were further offences of destroying property and of having goods in custody. The offender was made subject to two bonds without conviction by the Cobham Children’s Court.
	
	
	Later that same month a larceny offence was dealt with by a caution in the Children’s Court, and a further such offence the following month saw another bond imposed upon him in the Children’s Court.
	
	
	In April 2007 the offender was dealt with by way of a community service order for an offence of robbery. He also appeared in relation to charges of being carried in a conveyance, and break enter and steal. Probation orders were imposed for those latter offences by the Children’s Court.
	
	
	In 2008 the offender received short control orders for receiving stolen property and two counts of stealing from the person. That appears to have been his first and only experience of a custodial environment, prior to his arrest and remand on 2 July 2012.
	
	
	The only offences the offender has as an adult are driving offences, which are of no relevance to these proceedings.
	
	
	Whilst being held on remand the offender has incurred some disciplinary offences within the prison system, but none of them involve incidents of violence.
	
	
	The evidence tendered on sentence by the offender is very limited, and there is little information to allow the Court to fully understand his background and circumstances.
	
	
	The offender is one of four children to his parents’ union. While his early childhood was uneventful, it appears he became exposed to drugs and alcohol at the age of about nine when his parents turned to illicit drug use after a house fire that claimed the life of a relative. The following eight years were marred by drugs, domestic violence and neglect, resulting in the offender and his siblings being cared for by members of the extended family. However, the offender still enjoys a positive and supportive relationship with his family and siblings. Indeed, family members have been present in Court on each occasion the matter has been listed, to offer support to the offender.
	
	
	The offender has two children to his current partner of four years, and a seven year old child from a previous relationship. While the offender has only sporadic contact with his eldest child, he has a close relationship with his younger children and his partner.
	
	
	The offender has attained primary school education only, having failed to complete Year 7. The years he did complete were characterised by truancy, disruptive behaviour and suspensions. He has never held any form of employment due to the lack of literacy and numeracy skills and has been in receipt of unemployment benefits since his adolescence.
	
	
	He commenced gambling at the age of 17, which had developed into an addiction by early 2010, leading the offender to engage in criminal activities to fund his addiction.
	
	
	The offender commenced drinking alcohol at the age of 11. By the age of 14 he was consuming alcohol on daily basis. He started consuming cannabis at the age of 12, but ceased after experiencing hallucinations and paranoia and a resulting drug induced psychosis. At the age of 16 he turned to amphetamines, quickly escalating to daily use.
	
	
	The offender reported one period of abstinence from drug use in 2009 when he commenced the relationship with his current partner. He participated in a residential rehabilitation program in that same year, but failed to complete it due to arguments with staff. He subsequently returned to illicit drug use in 2010. While the offender expressed some willingness to engage in substance rehabilitation, there is no evidence he has participated in any such programs whilst on remand.
	
	
	Since entering custody in July 2012, the offender has participated in a literacy and numeracy course and engaged in some employment in 2012, receiving positive evaluation and feedback. However, the pre-sentence report of 12 December 2013 notes that he had not engaged in any further employment since 2012 until the preparation of that report. There is no evidence before the court as to his conduct and time in custody since December 2013, other than the offender’s comment to Mr. Diment that he doesn’t “do much at all here now”.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report also notes the offender had received two institutional misconducts and is disruptive and abusive towards the correctional staff. As noted, there were no offences of violence.
	
	
	The offender told Ms. Eastman, the author of the pre-sentence report, that he suffered an episode of drug induced psychosis at the age of 13 when he was admitted to Port Macquarie Hospital. He claimed he has experienced depressive episodes ever since this first onset, leading to further hospitalisation in 2011. He has been prescribed medication over the years, including whilst on remand, but habitually ceases to take it, claiming he does not like to take medication and self-medicates with illicit drugs. According to his partner, the offender has attempted suicide in the past by slashing his wrists and by hanging whilst in custody. There is no objective evidence of suicidal ideation; Mr. Diment expressed the view that there was no suicidal ideation.
	
	
	The offender was seen by Mr. Diment, consultant psychologist on two occasions, in July 2014 and more recently in January of this year. Having administered a number of tests, Mr. Diment opined that the offender was cognitively impaired with intellectual functioning falling in the extremely low range with an IQ of 70. This conclusion is supported by Dr. Susan Pulman, who interviewed the offender on 1 September 2014 for the purposes of assessing his fitness to plead.
	
	
	Mr. Diment expressed a view that the offender met the criteria for a major depressive disorder. He observed that the symptoms of depression were more pronounced in January of this year than on his previous visit and that the offender was being medicated by Avanza, for depressive symptoms. Unsurprisingly, the offender himself attributed his depression to his current inmate status, unsuccessful application to withdraw his plea, and the uncertainty of these sentence proceedings. He remained of a firm view he was not guilty of the offence.
	
	
	The history provided by the offender to Dr. Nielssen differs in some regards to that given to the authors of other reports, but is indicative of an adolescence marred by drug and alcohol abuse. Dr. Nielssen opined that the offender met the criteria for substance abuse disorder and substance induced psychosis in remission. Dr. Nielssen did not elicit any connection between symptoms of mental illness and the commission of the offence, and nor did he conclude that imprisonment would have any detrimental effect on the offender’s mental health, or prove more onerous to the offender than it would to other prisoners.
	
	
	Dr. Nielssen was unable to offer any opinion as to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation or his risks of future offending, and it is impossible for this Court to make any conclusions in that regard. Predicting what may occur years in the future is an inexact science at best, and the evidence available to the Court does not justify the attempt.
	
	
	The offender’s future prospects are simply unable to be guessed at.
	
	
	Whilst the offender argues that there should be a finding of special circumstances in his favour, I am unable to make such a finding. Having regard to the length of sentence required to be imposed upon the offender, the ordinary ratio of sentence should provide a period of parole that is sufficient to offer adequate supervision and assistance to him to aid him in reintegrating into the community. There is no evidence that justifies a conclusion that a longer period than that which will flow in the ordinary course is necessary. There is no evidence that justifies a conclusion that the offender would make good rehabilitative use of such a period to his and the community’s benefit if it were allowed him.
	


Other Considerations


	
	This was a gravely serious offence where three young men viciously preyed upon a much older man in what should have been the safety and comfort of his home, with the sole purpose of extracting valuables from him that could be used to obtain drugs.
	
	
	This Court must have regard to the principles of both specific and general deterrence. Whilst the offender submits that less weight should be given to these principles because of the matters referred to in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571, the reduction can only be small in my view. The evidence relevant to the offender’s background and the impact of it upon him in both his formative years and more recently is very slight, and unsupportive of more.
	
	
	The sentence imposed must be a stern one.
	


ORDErs


	
	Raymond Anthony Kennedy you are convicted of the offence of murder.
	
	
	You are sentenced to imprisonment for 21 years, to date from 2 July 2012 and expiring on 1 July 2033. There will be a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months, expiring on 1 April 2028. The earliest date upon which you will become eligible for release to parole is 1 April 2028.

		27 March 2015",2015-03-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766224,Youkhana v R [2015] NSWCCA 41,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: The applicant, Youbert Youkhana, seeks leave to appeal from his conviction, following a trial before Quirk DCJ, that on 26 September 2012 at Clyde in New South Wales, while in company, he robbed Anthony Joseph of his Apple iPad 2, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	He does so on two grounds. They are:
	


1.   Her Honour erred in her direction to the jury concerning what constituted a joint criminal enterprise.

2.   The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the nature and quality of the evidence.


	
	The applicant’s counsel did not take any objection to her Honour’s directions as to what had to be proved to establish his liability as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to commit the robbery. Therefore, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies and the applicant requires leave to be allowed to rely upon the first of these grounds.
	
	
	It is convenient at the outset to summarise the evidence at trial which was within a narrow compass.
	


The evidence at trial


	
	On 26 September 2012 at around 4.30pm Mr Joseph was a passenger in a train travelling from Wentworthville towards Parramatta station. He was in the upper level of a double-deck carriage in the second last seat, facing in the direction that the train was travelling. That bench provided seating for three passengers and was on the left side of the train as it travelled in the direction of Parramatta. Mr Joseph was seated near the window and was using his iPad to access the internet.
	
	
	The applicant and two others boarded that carriage at Parramatta station. They were Rani Sabri and Aramsin Yousif. Closed circuit television (CCTV) footage at that station showed the applicant leading them through the turnstile, up an escalator and onto the platform. When they boarded the train, the seats in the upper level of Mr Joseph’s carriage, in the area where he was seated, were mostly unoccupied. On entering that upper level, one of the three men sat on the seat bench in front of Mr Joseph which was facing away from the direction in which the train was travelling. That person was sitting opposite Mr Joseph, but closer to the aisle. The other two men sat in the last bench in the carriage, immediately behind Mr Joseph. That seat also could accommodate three persons and was facing in the direction in which the train was travelling.
	
	
	The journey to Clyde station took less than seven minutes and included stops at Harris Park and Granville stations. During that time Mr Joseph heard the three men talking to each other in a language other than English. There was no evidence as to what was said. As the train stopped at Clyde station and the doors opened Mr Joseph was punched in his right eye from behind. At the same time the person sitting facing him snatched his iPad. The three men then ran down the stairs from the upper level and out of the train. The CCTV footage at Clyde station showed them running along the platform and then upstairs, across a small overpass, out of the station and down a longer footbridge leading to the roadway. It showed the applicant leading the other two men at a pace through the various twists and turns involved in that escapade. It also showed that the applicant covered his face as he ran along the platform towards one of the CCTV cameras. Mr Joseph chased the men out of the station. At one stage he saw them ahead of him, walking and talking together. One was laughing. When one of the men turned back and saw Mr Joseph, the three started running again.
	


Ground 1 (error in direction concerning joint criminal enterprise)


	
	The applicant submits that the trial judge’s direction about joint criminal enterprise involved error because it did not make clear that the jury had to be satisfied not only that the applicant was a party to an arrangement with the others to rob Mr Joseph, but also that he had participated in that enterprise by being present and intentionally assisting or encouraging the others to commit the robbery. In support of this last proposition the applicant relies upon the following statement of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-557:
	


(3)   A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in that joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.


	
	In response, the Crown says that in the way the trial was run, the only issue for the jury was whether, accepting that the applicant was present in the train during the commission of the offence charged, he was party to an arrangement with the others to rob Mr Joseph. If he was party to such an arrangement, no further question arose about his participation because it was accepted and established by the evidence that he was present when the crime was committed. In those circumstances it was not necessary for the trial judge to give any specific direction as to what was necessary to establish participation. For the reasons which follow these submissions should be accepted.
	
	
	The task of a trial judge when formulating directions to the jury is described by the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in R v Chai [2002] HCA 12; 76 ALJR 628 at [18]:
	


… First, it is not the function of a trial judge to expound to the jury principles of law going beyond those which the jurors need to understand to resolve the issues that arise for decision in the case. Secondly, the law should be explained to the jury in a manner which relates it to the facts of the particular case and the issues to be decided.


	
	Thus in Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434 whether the trial judge had erred in not directing the jury as to the accused’s alleged participation in a joint enterprise to commit murder turned on whether the fact of participation was or was not an issue at the trial. If it was not, there was no need for the trial judge to direct on that question, because the responsibility of the trial judge was to “direct the jury on only so much of the law as they need to know to guide them to a decision” on the real issues in the case: at [31] – [32]. See generally the observations of this Court as to the duty of a judge in a jury trial in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [36] – [37].
	
	
	The doctrine of “joint enterprise” provides “the means of attaching liability for [a crime that is the subject of an agreement between two or more persons that it be committed] on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution”: Huynh at [37]. It does so by making each of the parties to the understanding or agreement criminally responsible for the act or acts of the others committed in furtherance of it. That liability attaches to “all the parties to the agreement who participate in some way in furthering its execution”: Huynh at [37], citing in support the reasoning in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 113 – 114.
	
	
	It is sufficient to constitute participation that a party to the agreement is present when the crime is committed in accordance with the agreement: Huynh at [38] citing Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 at [27] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ and [73] per McHugh J extracting the statement of the relevant principles of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tangye at 556 – 557. Significantly this extract does not include the balance of the statement in the paragraph numbered three commencing with the words “and (with knowledge…”. The exclusion of the balance of the first sentence is explicable on the basis that it refers to participation that does not require presence whilst the crime is being committed.
	
	
	As Gaudron and Gummow JJ explained in Osland at [27]:
	


More to the point, principle dictates the conclusion that those who form a common purpose to commit a crime together are liable as principals if they are present when the crime, or any other crime within the scope of the common purpose, is committed by one or more of them. The crime having been committed in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all are equally guilty as principals regardless of the part played by each. That result follows from the reasoning in McAuliffe v The Queen. Indeed, that reasoning would appear not to require presence at the scene of all parties to the continuing common purpose if the criteria specified in that reasoning otherwise are satisfied.


	
	The applicant’s reliance upon the statement in R v Tangye is misplaced in the present case because the participation relied upon was the applicant’s presence when the crime the subject of the arrangement was committed. In such a case it is not necessary separately to establish intentional assisting or encouraging because the person present has a continuing understanding with the others present that the crime should be committed.
	
	
	Here there could be no issue on the evidence that three men boarded the train at Parramatta station, that the applicant was one of them and that at least two of them acted together to rob Mr Joseph of his iPad. This was done by the men seating themselves in front of and behind Mr Joseph so that as the train stopped at Clyde station one was able to attack from behind and sufficiently unsettle him to enable the man in front of him to take his iPad. This evidence showed beyond question that two of the men were directly involved in the carrying out of a plan to rob Mr Joseph and that the third was present when that occurred.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, the applicant’s counsel described the issue for the jury in terms which reflected the reality of the evidence the Crown was expected to lead:
	


What you really are going to have to determine is, was he a participant in the robbery that occurred on the train and there’s no question that a robbery did take place and I anticipate that you’ll be told by her Honour there’s really only two ways that you could reason to a conclusion of him being guilty.

One is if you are satisfied there was evidence that he was directly involved, that’s the first way. The second way is if you’re satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was together with the others part of an agreement to carry this out, and lawyers call that joint criminal enterprise. But it’s really an agreement between people to do something criminal. As is alleged here.

So that’s really the issue for you, the accused has pleaded not guilty, and the position is through his plea, he asserts that he is not guilty. He wasn’t involved in a direct way, he wasn’t involved as part of some agreement that this man should be robbed. The question for you is are you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. Is there another explanation for him running from the station?


	
	Thus, at the commencement of the trial, the defence case was that the Crown could not establish beyond reasonable doubt either that the applicant was one of the two men directly involved in the robbery or that he was part of some agreement that the robbery should be committed. That remained the question for the jury at the close of the evidence.
	
	
	In its summing up the Crown described that question as follows:
	


Now the Crown must establish … to this high standard of beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did – was a person that was there either actively participating or was a person who was jointly part of this plan to rob Anthony of the iPad.


	
	The applicant’s counsel focused on the same question. He submitted that there was no evidence that enabled the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was one of the two persons directly involved, either the person who took the iPad or the person who punched Mr Joseph from behind. Counsel continued:
	


The other way as the Crown has said, the other way that you could be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt is if you thought there was an agreement between these three people … but it is not really a complicated thing. It is where there is an agreement between people to commit a crime and if the agreement exists then if they all participate in some way even if it’s just being there ready to assist, then they’re all guilty.


	
	In this context the trial judge’s directions about joint criminal enterprise fall to be considered. They included the following:
	


The Crown must establish both the existence of a joint criminal enterprise and that the accused participated in that. It is not sufficient that the Crown established that there was a plan of some sort to rob Mr Joseph, but it is essential that the Crown proves that the accused was participating, or agreed it would occur.

…

However, it does not matter whether the agreed crime is committed by only one or some of the participants in a joint criminal enterprise, or whether they all played an active part in committing that crime. All of the participants in the enterprise are equally guilty of committing the crime regardless of the actual part played as long as they all agreed to it. Mr Barrow gave you an example of the bank robbery and distinguished it from particular circumstances in this case.

…

As I told you when I directed you on joint criminal enterprise, it is not necessary that the accused was directly involved, but you must be satisfied that he was part of an agreement to rob the complainant. Intention can be seen from the circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence. There is no dispute in this trial, as I said, that the robbery was committed. The only dispute is whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was involved either directly – which is not the Crown case here – or by being part of an agreement to rob the complainant.

…

Members of the jury, in brief, what the defence case is, is that you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was part of any agreement to rob Mr Joseph on the train and you would not find that all the other circumstances point to his involvement, or are of sufficient probative value to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was involved in this robbery. [emphasis added].


	
	These directions focus on the only issue at trial which was whether, accepting that the Crown could not establish that the applicant was one of the two men who were directly involved in the robbery, the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he nevertheless was a party to an agreement with them to rob Mr Joseph. In that context the trial judge’s reference to it being essential that the Crown prove that the “accused was participating, or agreed it would occur” was reasonably to be understood as being to the need for the Crown to prove either, that the accused was one of those who actively participated (from which it followed that he was part of the arrangement to rob Mr Joseph), or that he had agreed with those others that it would be committed. The reference did not, as the applicant submitted, separate the concepts of participation and agreement, as they would apply to a member of the joint criminal enterprise not actively involved in the robbery. Her Honour’s later statement that the only “dispute” for the jury was whether the Crown had established that the accused “was involved either directly – or by being part of an agreement to rob the complainant” describes the same and only question for the jury.
	
	
	That this sufficiently and clearly guided the jury as to the real issue is confirmed by the absence of any application by defence counsel for any further direction as to the need for the Crown to establish any more as to the applicant’s participation in the robbery, over and above his presence when it was committed.
	
	
	Counsel did however seek a specific direction about the element of robbing “in company” with another person. That direction was unnecessary because the robbery, as committed and agreed to be committed, involved more than one person actually threatening or assaulting Mr Joseph. Therefore, it was not necessary for a direction to be given, as the applicant’s counsel suggested and the trial judge accepted, to the effect that a robbery committed with another person present for the purpose of giving assistance was a “robbery in company” for the purposes of s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. More relevantly, as the Crown submitted, it is not likely that this further direction, as given, in any way confused or distracted the jury when addressing the real issue in the case.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out. The directions given were not the subject of any objection at the trial. For those reasons leave permitting the applicant to rely on this ground of appeal should be refused.
	


Ground 2 (unreasonable verdict)


	
	The question raised by this ground is whether, having made an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, this Court thinks that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [25], [55]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11], [14].
	
	
	The evidence at trial is summarised above. It consisted of the CCTV footage and photographs produced from that footage, oral evidence from the investigating police officer proving that footage and identifying the persons shown in it and oral evidence of the victim, Mr Joseph. His evidence included a diagram which showed the layout of the upper level of the train carriage and where he and the three men sat.
	
	
	The applicant pointed to four aspects of the evidence as giving rise to a reasonable doubt concerning his being a party to any arrangement to rob Mr Joseph. First, reference was made to the “paucity” of evidence in the Crown case. There was no CCTV footage from within the train or accounts of any other independent witness as to what happened inside the carriage and no DNA or fingerprint evidence connecting the applicant with the iPad. Secondly, it was said that the CCTV footage was neutral as to the applicant’s involvement in any arrangement to rob. The fact that the three men were friends and boarded the train together could not give rise to an inference that they proposed to commit a robbery. The fact that the applicant had run from the train at Clyde station and attempted to cover his face was equally consistent with his seeking to get away from a situation which was not of his making, prompted by a misguided loyalty to his friends who had committed the offence.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was said that Mr Joseph’s evidence also was equivocal. The fact that the men were communicating in a different language was irrelevant and the way in which they were seated suggested that the applicant was not involved, because he was likely to have been seated near the aisle in the last bench in the carriage. That was said to explain why he was first out of the train. Finally, there was some evidence pointing against his involvement in the robbery. That evidence, of the investigating officer, was that Messrs Sabri and Yousif gave possession of the iPad to a local shopkeeper shortly after the robbery.
	
	
	In response the Crown pointed out that its case was a circumstantial one and that it was necessary for the jury to consider all of the evidence and take account of the extent to which, in various ways, it supported the inference that the applicant was a party to the robbery. Reference was made to what was said by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at [48] about the need, in such a case, to weigh all the circumstances when judging whether there is evidence upon which it was open to the jury to convict.
	
	
	In my view it was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied, on the whole of the evidence, that the applicant was guilty. The evidence showed the three men together before they boarded the train. The jury would have noticed that they were led onto the train (and off it) by the applicant. The three men then sat in a configuration which was consistent with the existence of a plan to rob Mr Joseph in the way that subsequently happened. The jury was entitled to attach significance to the fact that they did not sit together, although they were travelling together and apparently wished to continue to converse with each other. The evidence showed that they could have sat together if that was what they wanted to do. The actions of the three men as the train stopped at Clyde station were consistent with their giving effect to a plan which was put in place when they chose to sit as they did, surrounding Mr Joseph.
	
	
	Finally, the jury would have noted that the applicant was the first out of the train and that he led the other two men for some distance and at pace out of the station and onto the street via the pedestrian footbridge. He did not appear bewildered or shocked by what had occurred. The jury could reasonably have concluded that his doing was much more consistent with his having been involved in what happened on the train. So too was the fact that he was sufficiently conscious of what had occurred and his involvement that at the time he ran along the platform he covered his face from the gaze of the CCTV camera.
	
	
	None of the matters to which the applicant refers justifies a conclusion that the jury must, as distinct from might, reasonably have entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt: per Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing) in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113]. The jury was entitled to discount the possibility that in leading the three men out of the train and from the station the applicant was merely attempting to get away from a situation which was not of his making. The evidence tending strongly against that explanation included that he sat in the train in a position which was consistent with the existence of a plan to rob, led the others in running from the train, covered his face and was seen to run again when Mr Joseph continued his pursuit.
	
	
	This ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Conclusion


	
	The order I would make is that the application for leave to appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Meagher JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Meagher JA.

2766228,Application of FD [2015] NSWSC 285,"___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the Act”), FD (“the applicant”) applies for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon him. The applicant seeks that his case be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: s 79(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The application is opposed by the Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	Sections 78 and 79 of the Act are relevantly in the following terms:
	


“78   Applications to Supreme Court

(1)   An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2)   ...

79 Consideration of applications 

(1)   After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 .

(2)   Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

… and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)   ...

(4)   Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)   ...”

Applicable Principles


	
	In determining this application, the Court is engaged in an administrative task or function. That function is not another avenue of appeal, but is rather a function engaged in when the criminal justice system has run its course: see Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 at [4] ff per Johnson J. That the proceedings are not judicial proceedings is made clear by the legislation: s 79(4) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	The power which the Court is exercising is one limited to the direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The test to be applied is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case. This view may be formed where the material causes “… the person considering the matters unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the sentence to stand”: Holland at [6].
	


Relevant Facts


	
	On 10 December 2004, FD was found guilty of three charges:
	



	
	Armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which was 20 years;
	
	
	Malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty was 25 years. There was a standard non-parole period of 7 years; and
	
	
	Murder, for which the maximum penalty was life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period 20 years.
	



	
	The convictions followed not guilty pleas to each of the offences, and a trial lasting some weeks.
	
	
	Levine J sentenced FD on 25 February 2005. It is with respect to that sentence that FD seeks a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to Pt 7 of the Act. The sentencing remarks of Levine J are to be found in R v FD; R v JD [2005] NSWSC 128.
	
	
	His Honour described the facts in the following way:
	


“23   Mrs Rosalie Taylor put an advertisement in the “Trading Post” on 11 March 2003 to sell a diamond engagement ring for $15,000. The ring had been given to her by her son, Simon Taylor, to look after upon the break-up of his engagement. At about 11 o'clock on Friday, 21 March 2003, she received a call on her mobile from a man named ""John"", who was [FD], who gave her his mobile phone number. Arrangements were ultimately made for her to go to Glebe between 7.30pm and 8.00pm at the address of 1D Wigram Road. The last telephone call she had with the offender [FD] was whilst she, her husband and her son were driving across the Harbour Bridge at about 7.25pm. The Taylors arrived shortly thereafter at Wigram Road, Glebe. Mrs Taylor had the ring inside her bag and also available to her some documents in an envelope relating to valuation. [FD] was standing outside 1D Wigram Road. They introduced themselves. Mrs Taylor walked back to the car and obtained the valuation papers. Outside 1D Wigram Road, [FD] feigned a telephone conversation with his girlfriend and explained that her being away required them to get access to the house via the backyard. That is where [FD] led the party of the three Taylors.

24   Once in the backyard, there was a very brief exchange of conversation, which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt did not amount to an argument and did not amount to shouting or screaming. This is important with respect to the intrusion into the events of JD. In any event, JD burst into the backyard carrying a replica pistol. Thereupon, not surprisingly, there are confused accounts.

25   After what must have been a very short time, the bag had been snatched from Mrs Taylor and there was a pursuit down the lane. JD was tackled by Simon Taylor and whilst he had JD down, Simon was stabbed four times by [FD], two of the wounds being fatal. Prior to that, Mr Robert Taylor had been stabbed in the chest. That [FD] was the stabber has been established beyond reasonable doubt. After the stabbing of Simon Taylor, [FD] and JD ran away. [FD] put the bag under a car and threw the knife in a park where it was found by the police. The bag was also located.”


	
	His Honour drew the following conclusions:
	


“(a)   the events described constituted a pre-planned robbery;

(a)   that FD was not armed with a knife when arrived at the location of the offence;

(b)   that FD was the person who inflicted the fatal wounds to the victim;

(c)   that FD had the knife and used it to extricate his brother, JD, so as not to leave him in the laneway where the events took place, and also did so to prevent his brother’s apprehension which would ultimately lead to his own apprehension.” (sic)

The Sentence


	
	Levine J noted that at the time he committed the offences, FD was on a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	His Honour then noted that it was the Crown’s submission that he would be persuaded that whilst the offence did not fall within the most serious category of murder, it fell within the “more serious category”. His Honour considered the basis upon which the Crown put that submission, and ultimately came to the conclusion that:
	


“The two characteristics to which the Crown refers would place this matter outside the middle range, but still not in the most serious category. That is almost the best one can say. There is no doubt minds would differ as to the ambit of all the categories and ranges within the crime of murder, especially when the intention was not kill but to cause grievous bodily harm.”


	
	His Honour had earlier indicated that he did not accept that the murder was committed by FD with an intention to kill, but rather found that it was committed whilst he had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In the course of discussing the objective seriousness of the murder, Levine J dealt with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, and the standard non-parole period in two passages to which the applicant points as indicating that his Honour fell into error. Those passages are as follows:
	


“52   Traditionally any intention on the part of the legislature that the offence should attract a heavier sentence has been manifested by an increase in the statutory maximum: R v Sha (1988) 38 A Crim R 334; R v Peel [1971] 1 NSWLR 247. The courts are expected to recognise and reflect that intention when sentencing offenders for offences after such amendments are made: R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519 at 524 and R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227.

…

54.   As will be mentioned later in these reasons, this may well result in some change in the established sentencing pattern for these offences, or at least some of them, with an overall increase in the non-parole periods and terms of the sentences.”


	
	His Honour then went on to deal with the offence of malicious wounding, which he regarded as particularly serious and above the mid-range. With respect to the robbery, his Honour described the crime as callous and that FD was the principal planner of the joint enterprise.
	
	
	His Honour then referred to the subjective case of FD. He noted that he could find no evidence of contrition and that he did not regard there to have been any expression of remorse.
	
	
	His Honour then addressed the mitigating and aggravating factors set forth in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and noted that:
	


“FD stands to be sentenced for the most serious of three crimes against three victims and those sentences for those crimes must involve a substantial component for general deterrence and personal deterrence as well as the factors referred to in s 3A of the [Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act].” (sic)


	
	His Honour the concluded in the following terms:
	


“69   I propose to make the sentence for the armed robbery a fixed term to be served concurrently with the sentence for malicious wounding which, as I indicated earlier, must be a sentence made up of a non‑parole period for what I will describe as a parole period. Partially concurrent to those sentences will be served the murder sentence which will be a prescribed sentence made up of a non-parole period and a parole period. In relation to the murder sentence, the parole period will bear the relative statutory proportion to the non-parole period. I see no reason to adjust the parole period for the murder sentence by reducing the non-parole period by what would be no more than about six months, to reflect a non-parole period that bears the statutory ratio to the totality of the sentences imposed for the three offences. This reduction would be tinkering and meaningless in the light of the objective gravity of the offences. I add that nothing has been placed before me that would constitute special circumstances, either by reference to relative youth, subjective considerations or the proposed partial concurrence of the sentences to be imposed.”


	
	Ultimately, he imposed the following sentences:
	


“(a)   for the offence of armed robbery – a fixed term of 6 years to commence on 23 March 2003, and to expire on 22 March 2009;

(b)   for the offence of malicious wounding with intend to cause grievous bodily harm – a non-parole period of 9 years to commence 23 March 2003 and to expire 22 March 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 22 March 2015; and

(c)   for the offence of murder – a non-parole period of 18 years to commence on 23 March 2005 and to expire 22 March 2023 with a balance of term of 6 years expiring on 22 March 2029.”


	
	Putting it simply, the sentences on the first two terms would all expire during the non-parole period for the offence of murder. That non-parole period of 18 years was accumulated by a period of 2 years on the earlier sentences.
	
	
	In total FD was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of 20 years with a balance of term, effectively, of 6 years.
	


Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	In February 2006, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed FD’s appeal against his conviction. It granted him leave to appeal against his sentence, but dismissed the appeal. It also dismissed the Crown appeal against sentence. The reasons are to be found in R v FD [2006] NSWCCA 31; (2006) 160 A Crim R 392
	
	
	In his Application for Leave to Appeal against sentence, the applicant argued that Levine J had erred in three respects, namely:
	



	
	in the accumulation of the sentences for the offences arising from one overall event of criminality;
	
	
	failing to give full and proper consideration to the aspect of special circumstances; and
	
	
	a parity issue with respect to his co-accused, JD.
	



	
	As well, the applicant argued that his sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with each ground of appeal against sentencing were concise. Sully J (with whom Hall J agreed) held, having regard to the facts of each of the offences, and in particular, that the offences were committed against three separate victims, that it was appropriate for the sentencing Judge, Levine J, to reflect in a real way the total criminality of the applicant’s conduct by “… a prudent measure of cumulation”.
	
	
	With respect to the second ground, the Court held that Levine J had made a proper assessment of the relative subjective features of FD’s case, and that there was no remaining basis.
	


“… grounded upon relevant and credible evidence, for reducing by reason of ‘special circumstances’ the statutory proportion as between head sentence and non-parole period”.


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal noted that there had been a concession by counsel at first instance that he could point to no real special circumstances.
	
	
	When dealing with the third ground of appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that there was no parity issue which arose between the cases of FD and JD, because by the time they stood for sentence their respective positions were “so manifestly different in substance that no parity point … could be said to arise at all”.
	
	
	With respect to the final submission of manifest excess of the sentences, Sully J said this at [87]:
	


“I do not see how this ground can possibly succeed. As earlier herein noted, the effective overall sentence for FD is one of imprisonment for 26 years; and the effective time to be served in any event is 20 years. To set out cold-bloodedly to rob a lady of a valuable item of jewellery and that with the use of an offensive weapon; maliciously to wound her husband in course of carrying out that design; and then to stab her son to death in an ensuing confrontation; is in my opinion, behaviour, the total criminality of which amply warrants in law and in fact sentences of the severity passed by Levine J.”


	
	It will be observed that in dealing with the application for leave to appeal against sentence, and the appeal itself, Sully J (with whom Hall J agreed) made no mention at all of the standard non-parole period for any of the offences, and undertook no analysis whatsoever by reference to the standard non-parole period. Of course, in the introduction to the appeal, and the issues with which the Court was confronted, Sully J did set out with respect to each offence, the statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment and, where applicable, the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	However, in the course of considering the Crown appeal against sentence, Sully J made these remarks:
	


“110.   At the proceedings on sentence, the Crown argued that there were certain characteristics of the murder of Mr Simon Taylor that put the crime into what was described as a ‘more serious category of murder’. I infer that what was actually intended by that description was to fix the criminality of the murder at some indeterminate point between the standard non-parole point: that is to say, ‘the middle of the range of objective seriousness’ for murder; and what was described as the ‘most serious category of murder’.

…

113.   In my opinion, Levine J correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the murder as lying somewhere above the notional statutory mid-range and the ‘worst category of murder’ level. That would equate, initially, to a non-parole period of more than 20 years; although just how much more must be, in the nature of things and as Levine J correctly recognised, a matter as to which reasonable minds would differ.

114.   His Honour was then required to consider the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation as enumerated in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act … These considerations were pertinent to an assessment of the justification, if any, for setting a non-parole period of less than 20 years for the murder.

…

116.   In the present case, Levine J was confronted, in making the relevant assessment, by precisely such multi-directional guide posts. In distilling a conclusion from such guideposts, his Honour has to synthesise instinctively, in a way that reflected his own very considerable experiences both at trial and appellate judge in serious criminal cases, all relevant factors; but bearing always in mind that the exercise in hand was to quantify a sentence that was just in all the circumstances, objective and subjective, of the particular case.”


	
	It can be seen that the reference by Sully J in the extract above to the existence of the standard non-parole period was in the context, not of considering whether the sentencing Judge had erred, or fixed a manifestly excessive sentence, but rather in the context of the necessity to determine where the objective seriousness of the offence of murder a finding should be made, so as to deal with a submission (which was unsuccessful) being made by the Crown, that the sentence of FD ought to be increased.
	
	
	Paradoxically, in the circumstances of this application, the complaint made by the Crown on its appeal against sentence, which was ultimately dismissed, was that the sentencing Judge did not say that he was taking a staged approach to the sentence (as was submitted he was required to do). The substance of the Crown appeal on sentence was that his Honour had, without addressing correctly the principles in R v Way, imposed a non-parole period for the offence of murder which was less than the statutory non-parole period.
	
	
	In dealing with these complaints, Sully J said:
	


“118.   It is true that Levine J did not say in so many words that he was taking the staged approach that was approved in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. It is, also, true that, as the Crown submits, the only express explanation given by his Honour for an end result which entailed a non-parole period for the murder of less than 20 years, is that contained in [54] of the Remarks on Sentence.

119.   I would understand [54] to convey a conclusion that after the relevant, requisite assessment had been made, and after a Pearce dissection of discrete sentences had been made, it was appropriate to impose a non-parole period of less than 20 years for the murder, because to do otherwise would offend the principle of totality. On that approach, Levine J did not fall into the error now suggested by the Crown.”


	
	It is convenient to record here the short contents of [54] of Levine J’s Remarks on Sentence, which were in this form:
	


“The upshot is that I will treat the standard non-parole period as a guide and as I propose partially to accumulate the sentences in relation to those offences to attain the requisite totality. The non‑parole period will in the end be less than the standard non‑parole period.”

Discernment


	
	It is submitted by the applicant that Levine J, having found that the offence was above a mid-range offence, must be taken to have used the standard non-parole period of 20 years as the starting point for the assessment of the appropriate sentence, and that the only reason the sentence fell below the standard non-parole period was because of totality.
	
	
	This, it was submitted, is an error of law having regard to the way in which the High Court has in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 expressed the correct principles for sentencing.
	
	
	I am quite unable to see that Levine J made any error of law in imposing the sentence on the applicant.
	
	
	Muldrock establishes the proposition that a sentencing Judge is required, amongst other things, to have regard to the maximum penalty for an offence, and any standard non-parole period which has been fixed for that offence, as “legislative guideposts” with respect to the appropriate sentence. Those guideposts are to be considered together with all other relevant factors, not including characteristics of an offender, in a process of instinctive synthesis to arrive at the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	It seems to me that a careful reading of the Sentencing Remarks of Levine J does not enable a conclusion that his Honour engaged in an impermissible approach to the sentencing of FD. On the contrary, he undertook the process of instructive synthesis, recognising that the standard non-parole period was a guidepost. Notwithstanding his conclusion about the objective seriousness of FD’s conduct, Levine J in fact imposed a sentence for the offence of murder which was less than the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	I am unable to conclude with respect to Levine J’s sentence, that there has been any error of a kind that would require a court to intervene. I do not have a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case of FD considering the sentence imposed. There is no basis for any referral under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act with respect to Levine J’s sentence.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal did not impose a sentence. Accordingly, it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary to consider whether there has been any doubt or question of the kind necessary to cause an order under the legislation with respect to the sentence.
	
	
	However, having carefully read the remarks of Sully J (with whom Hall J agreed), I am not left with any doubt or question of the way in which the applicant’s appeal against sentence was dealt with.
	
	
	In particular, when dismissing the applicant’s submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive, it is clear that his Honour’s remarks centred upon the nature of the conduct involved in the offence, the fact that the conduct involved three different victims and that the offences were serious. The dominating principle was one of aggregate totality for all three of the convictions.
	


Conclusion


	
	It follows that the applicant’s application under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	Application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, dismissed.

2766236,R v Colin Maxwell FARROW (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 323,"Judgment

Remarks on Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Colin Maxwell Farrow pleaded not guilty to the murder of Linda Jane Stevens (the deceased) on the grounds of mental illness and was tried by the Court, sitting as a judge alone and found guilty on 27 February 2015: R v Colin Maxwell Farrow (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 109 (the earlier judgment).
	
	
	These Remarks on Sentence need to be understood in conjunction with the finding of guilt and the reasons given therefor. The Court must now sentence Mr Farrow (the offender).
	
	
	There are some aspects of the process of sentencing, particularly to those unfamiliar with it, that may seem difficult to comprehend. A court, when sentencing, needs to assess the objective seriousness of an offence within the range of conduct with which offences of that kind are concerned. Therefore, somewhat counter-intuitively to the uninitiated, when dealing with a sentence for the offence of murder, a crime that would universally be considered the most serious of offences, the Court must assess the objective culpability of the offender and must determine where, in the range of seriousness of offences within this category, this particular offence fits.
	
	
	The maximum sentence fixed by Parliament is imposed only in the worst category of offences. In the case of murder, the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Parliament has set a further guidepost in the imposition of a sentence for murder, being a standard non-parole period said to be applicable to a “mid-range” offence. The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In order to ascertain whether a murder is in the worst category, one does not rule out such a possibility simply because one can imagine worse conduct. Unfortunately, one can always imagine worse conduct.
	
	
	Instead, the Court must assess the features of the offence and the circumstances of its commission in an objective manner and, in so doing, determine which category in the scale of seriousness this offence fits in the notional range between the lowest level of culpability and the worst category of case.
	
	
	Once the moral culpability associated with the offence is determined, one imposes a sentence for purposes which are established by the legislature and these legislative purposes reflect purposes hitherto established by the common law. The objectives are: to ensure that that offender is adequately punished for the offence committed; general deterrence, being the prevention of the crime of others by an appropriate sentence; specific deterrence, being the prevention of this or other crimes by the offender; protection of the community from the offender; to promote the rehabilitation of the offender; to make the offender accountable for his actions; denunciation of the conduct; and recognition of the harm done to the victim of the crime, her family and the community: see s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.
	
	
	Each of those purposes is, like the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period, a guidepost to the appropriate sentence. Unfortunately, as recited by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2), they sometimes, if not often, point in different directions.
	
	
	The gravity of the circumstances of an offence such as this points most obviously to the need to protect society, personal and public deterrence, and punishment. On the other hand, promotion of the opportunity for rehabilitation depends significantly on the subjective circumstances of the offender and his capacity to be rehabilitated. The process of sentencing requires that the objective circumstances of the offence and each of the subjective circumstances of the offender, to the extent relevant to the exercise of sentencing, must be considered and synthesised to achieve, to the greatest extent possible, all of the purposes of sentencing described above.
	
	
	Every murder is serious. Every murder involves the taking of human life by a person who has a state of mind that elevates the seriousness of the offence to that which is the most serious of crimes in the criminal calendar. The fact, and it is the fact, that the deceased was a drug dealer does not bear on the moral culpability associated with the seriousness of this crime. The fact of drug dealing by the deceased, and drug use by the offender and the deceased, is irrelevant to the guilt or sentencing of the offender. It is mere conjecture to suggest that the murder was at least in part caused by the effect of “ice”. Yet every judge is aware of the horrific effects of “ice” on its users and the risks to society by its distribution. Nothing in this or the earlier judgment ought be taken as qualifying that horror.
	
	
	At the same time, a sentence is not increased because the victim was a mother and family member. Nevertheless, this murder deprived a child of the care, love and upbringing of a mother and deprived the deceased’s family members of the enjoyment of a person and the relationship with a person whom they loved.
	
	
	Even though the facts of this murder have been set out fully in the judgment on guilt, it is necessary to summarise briefly the circumstances of the murder.
	
	
	The offender is a drug addict. He was introduced to the deceased by a mutual friend who, at first, would attend at the deceased’s premises with the accused. Each of them bought and used drugs, often at the deceased’s premises.
	
	
	In or about February 2013, the offender attended the deceased’s premises with another person. Each of them attempted to buy drugs from the deceased, but the deceased would sell drugs only to the other person seemingly because the deceased would no longer provide the offender drugs on credit.
	
	
	In the meantime, the person who had introduced the offender to the deceased had a falling out with the offender and communicated to him that if he were going to continue to behave as he was, then “don’t come back”.
	
	
	In or about this time, the offender compiled a note relating to the three people described in the note as “K”, “Le” and “Ly”. There is an undeniable inference that the note was written in this manner so as to hide the true identity of each of the persons. In the course of the judgment on guilt, I took the view that the reference to “Ly” was a reference to the deceased, even though she spelt her first name “Linda”. The description of the circumstance of that person, including the availability of drugs and money and the limitations on time available in which to effect a robbery, made the reference to “Ly” likely a reference to the deceased. In any event, the notes suggest that the offender intended and planned a robbery.
	
	
	Whatever were his motives, the offender caught the train to the deceased’s unit, gained entry to the unit and killed the deceased. He stole drugs, money and jewellery from the deceased.
	
	
	The murder was violent. Most murders are. The offender inflicted a number of knife wounds, three of which were particularly significant and any one of those three could have and would have caused death to the deceased.
	
	
	The injuries are described in the earlier judgment. There were significant injuries to each side of the neck and a stabbing wound that pierced the breast bone, went through the heart and into the lungs behind. There were also blunt force injuries, one in particular to the back of the head.
	
	
	The stabbing occurred on the deceased’s bed and, with the exception of the pool of blood on the mattress and bed covering and a blood smear on the lounge, the deceased’s unit was clear of blood, finger prints and DNA that would incriminate the offender.
	
	
	The offender had destroyed the deceased’s clothing. He also destroyed his own. He bound the deceased’s body with duct tape and rope and wrapped her body in the bed linen, bundling the bed linen and the deceased’s body into the boot of the deceased’s car and drove it to a park. In the meantime, he had purchased a shovel and other equipment and, it seems, was intending to bury the deceased.
	
	
	The erratic nature of the offender’s driving alerted a number of persons who reported the driving and the state of the car to the police.
	
	
	Ultimately, as a result of suspicions gained by the discovery of blood in the registered owner’s premises, the deceased’s body was discovered in the boot of her car by police. When discovered, the deceased was naked and wrapped in the bed linen, bound at the arms and legs with duct tape and rope.
	
	
	It is convenient to quote a passage from the earlier judgment at [129], in the following terms:
	


“[129]    The accused then went into hiding. He did not return to his own home but lived on the street. When he was at a friend’s place, he did not want the friend watching the news in his presence; he sought to escape from the police when chased and to resist arrest when caught…”


	
	Stripped of the mental condition of the offender, a somewhat artificial approach, the murder was violent (above that involved in the commission of the offence itself), involved the use of a weapon, was committed in the deceased’s home and was, again leaving aside the mental illness factors, an offence above the mid-range of offences of murder covered by the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	I do not accept that the murder was part of a planned or organised criminal activity so as to use that circumstance as an aggravating feature. At the same time, I do not accept that the murder was not planned, so as to take it into account for the benefit of the offender. While this may again seem inconsistent to the uninitiated, in making a finding of fact on sentence, a court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those matters to be used against the offender and otherwise on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	This is consistent with my earlier judgment in which I found that while the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was planned, it was more likely to have been planned than not. The finding that the murder was likely to have been planned undermined the defence case that the accused was acting irrationally around the time of the offence. As a consequence of that and other evidence, or the lack of it, the offender did not satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities that the defence of mental illness was available.
	
	
	There are a number of aspects otherwise that I take into account in dealing with this offender. First, even though the offender maintains that he has no or limited memory of the events in question, he has disclosed in his evidence before the Court on Sentence, which evidence was not challenged, significant remorse for the effect of his conduct on the victim and the victim’s family, including her son.
	
	
	The major issue is the effect of the drug abuse of the offender and his mental condition. Those issues affect his moral culpability, even though they do not afford him a defence. I point out that drug abuse, of itself, does not ameliorate criminal offending. In this case, however, there is a long history of dysfunctional activity and, on the evidence before the Court, psychoses involving delusional paranoia, arising, amongst other things, from continued drug abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder. These matters affect not only the culpability of the offender in the offence in question but also the difficulties of his incarceration, rendering any period of imprisonment more difficult for him than the ordinary prisoner.
	
	
	It is necessary to deal at slightly greater length with the offender’s mental condition. Psychiatric evidence was adduced for the purpose of the proceedings determining guilt, but the psychiatric evidence was analysed there on the basis of whether the offender’s mental condition satisfied the M’Naghten Rules (a reference to the test summarised in R v M’Naghten (1842) 8 ER 718) under which an offender may prove that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity should be returned. Such a verdict, technically a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, involves the offender satisfying the Court, as was stated in the earlier judgment, that the offender did not know the quality and nature of the act being performed or did not know that the act was wrong by the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons.
	
	
	The issue for sentencing is significantly different. The mere fact that the defence of mental illness has not, on the balance of probabilities, been proved does not render the mental state of the offender irrelevant to the sentencing question: Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61. The principles were summarised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. The summary in DPP v De La Rosa, above, is not exhaustive, but is relevant to the current circumstances and, notwithstanding my findings that the offender understood the nature and quality of the act performed and that it was wrong, I take the view that the offender’s mental health has contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way.
	
	
	The offender is partially delusional and his judgment was affected, albeit not to the extent necessary to succeed on the mental illness defence. In my view, the offender’s moral culpability has been reduced and the factor relating to denunciation, namely, the denouncing of the crime to the individual offender, does not carry the same weight that it might in the case of a person who had committed this crime otherwise than under the influence of psychoses.
	
	
	Further, because the offender is suffering from significant psychoses, he is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Ordinarily, a crime such as this would involve general deterrence as a significant factor in the fixing of a sentence to deter others from committing such crimes. However, in the case of a person suffering from significant mental illness, such a person is less appropriately the vehicle for fixing general deterrence in the community as a whole.
	
	
	Further, as mentioned above, a full-time custodial sentence, which is the appropriate sentence to impose on the offender, will weigh more heavily on this offender than it will on the ordinary body of prisoners.
	
	
	In dealing with a person with a mental illness, care must be paid to the effect of that mental illness. Some persons suffering mental illness will, as a result, present a greater danger to the community than if they were not suffering such an illness. In that sense, the suffering of a mental illness may not always ameliorate the sentence that should be imposed and, in certain instances, will lead to greater weight being given to the protection of society in the sentence that is required.
	
	
	To some extent, these issues may depend upon the capacity to treat the mental illness and the level and effect of genuine remorse, which together are matters to be considered in determining whether rehabilitation is a significant prospect.
	
	
	The events since the offence in question point to the ability of the offender to successfully complete rehabilitation. Those events are confirmed by the psychiatric assessments of each of the forensic psychiatrists who gave evidence during the course of the trial.
	
	
	Overall, the subjective circumstances of the offender, including those circumstances that relate directly to the commission of the offence itself, require a degree of leniency and a more prolonged period of supervision in the community to ensure that any rehabilitation that may occur in prison is given effect.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to repeat the findings of the psychiatrists to which reference has been made in the earlier judgment. As earlier stated, I am satisfied that the offender suffers psychoses including paranoia, schizophrenia and drug induced psychoses.
	
	
	I also accept that the offender suffers from an Antisocial Personality Disorder, although not one which, as most would, discloses a greater danger to the community associated with his disorder.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I find that there are special circumstances warranting a departure from the prescribed ratio between the non-parole period and the remainder of the term.
	
	
	Lastly, some account has been taken of the manner in which the offender has conducted the proceedings. Even though the offender had no memory of the commission of the offence, the offender, almost immediately, accepted that he caused the deceased’s death and conducted the proceedings accordingly. This was a significant saving to the administration of justice, showed a degree of remorse and had a utilitarian value. I do not quantify such value, but take it into account in the process that is the determination of an appropriate sentence, albeit only slightly. Whatever be the subjective circumstances, a sentence must be imposed that reflects the seriousness of the offence and is appropriate in all of the circumstances.
	
	
	The offence occurred on 11 April 2013 and the offender was arrested on 17 April 2013. The offender has remained in custody since that time, solely on account of the offence for which he is now to be sentenced and the sentence that I impose will date from 17 April 2013. I have paid little attention to the criminal history of the offender as that history relates to offences of a significantly different nature than the offence of murder for which I now sentence the offender, but the offender is not entitled to any leniency on account of being a first offender.
	
	
	I dismiss the back-up offences, involving use of a weapon to prevent arrest, resist/hinder police (2 counts), assault police (2 counts), and recklessly deal with proceeds of crime, each of which relate to the arrest for this murder or the disposal of the deceased’s property.
	


Sentence


	
	Colin Maxwell FARROW, you are convicted that on 11 April 2013 at Wollongong in the State of New South Wales, you did murder Linda Jane Stevens.
	
	
	I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 years, commencing 17 April 2013 and concluding 16 April 2028, the balance of term being a further 7 years’ imprisonment, expiring on 16 April 2035.
	
	
	You are first eligible for release on parole on 17 April 2028.

2766256,R v Scott (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 461,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HER HONOUR: The accused makes application for a discharge of the jury this morning, it being the 12th day of trial. The events of the trial have been a little unusual. That is not to say things of this nature do not occur, but they do not occur frequently. The history of the matter is that counsel who was formerly acting, Mr Cavanagh, on Wednesday afternoon, sought some indulgence so that he could obtain the advice of senior counsel as to his own ethical position. As is customary in such cases counsel was fairly guarded in what he told the Court, and the basis upon which he needed such advice, and it is difficult to understand fully what has happened.
	
	
	It would appear from what Mr Cavanagh has said, that at some point during the course of Wednesday at a time at which Ms Houston, a witness who it seems is personally favourably disposed to the accused, was giving her evidence, something changed in the accused’s instructions to counsel which meant that counsel felt he could not ethically continue to act in the case. In that opaque way that is usual Mr. Cavanagh referred to a change of instructions and being placed in a position where he might be obliged to either fail to fully and properly put the accused’s case, or to fulfil his obligations to this Court of never misleading the Court. The Court could not require Mr. Cavanagh to be placed in that position and so I granted him leave to withdraw.
	
	
	Mr Flynn of counsel now appears in the matter. He came into the matter on 26 March 2015. He has had, I think, the balance of Thursday 26 March 2015 and Friday 27 March 2015 and the weekend to prepare the trial. Whilst that is not an overly generous period in which to pick up and prepare a trial, it is in my judgment, adequate.
	
	
	It is not a conceptually difficult trial. There are not conceptually difficult issues in it. It is really an affray which has led to the death of one of the participants in the affray. Whilst the period of time in which to come into the matter late and be in a position to proceed is short, it is, it seems to me, adequate.
	
	
	Mr Flynn has this morning raised an additional concern which he says means that the proper course of action is the discharge of the jury. Mr Flynn submits that this is a case where the credit of individual witnesses who give an account of the incident leading to the stabbing of Mr Dehn will be critical to the jury’s assessment of the evidence and what to make of it. He submits that he is not in a position to make any submissions to the jury as to witnesses who have so far testified in terms of the credit, the presentation, the demeanour of those witnesses because he has not had the opportunity to observe it.
	
	
	Mr Flynn submits that it is particularly critical here because there are so many different accounts of the affray and it will be a matter of, as I understand it, pointing to a particular account which is consistent with the accused’s instructions and highlighting that as the more credible version to the jury. Mr Flynn says he is disadvantaged because he does not have personal observations of the witness with which to underline his submissions to the jury in that regard. He also points to the forensic disadvantage in that he is not able to seek to have particular witnesses recalled so that necessary additional propositions can be put to them having regard to the instructions he has, because he has not had an opportunity to observe the jury’s response to particular witnesses, and is therefore not able to assess whether the jury viewed particular witnesses favourably or otherwise. That incapacity, he submits, leads to an inevitable forensic disadvantage to him and thus the accused in the ongoing conduct of the case.
	
	
	The Crown opposes the discharge and points to the interests of the community not just in seeing an accused receive a fair trial but also in the timely disposition of serious criminal trials.
	
	
	That is an underlying consideration of all such applications. It has some particular weight here because we are at day 12. There have been a large number of witnesses already called to give evidence. A jury has sat now into the fourth week at considerable expense to them and to the community. There is a very strong community interest in seeing such matters as this dealt with expeditiously by the courts and brought to finalisation quickly. That is an interest of not just the community but also plainly of all of those personally involved. The accused has an interest in the speedy disposition of the matter so that he knows what his future is. The family of the deceased, plainly, wish to see the matter resolved. All of those involved as witnesses who have had some concern in the case would have the same wish. There is also, though, the fundamental issue of whether the accused person can receive a fair trial.
	
	
	I accept here that there must be some disadvantage in that Mr Flynn did not make the observations that he would have made had he been here throughout the course of the trial and observed the various witnesses and observed the response of the jury to various witnesses. However, it seems to me that disadvantage is capable of being addressed. Firstly, the accused was here. He has a perfect view of witnesses and the jury from where he sits in this courtroom and he is in a position to discuss those matters and his observations of those matters with counsel and give counsel the benefit of his observations of the proceedings.
	
	
	Secondly, from the material that Mr Cavanagh raised with the Court last week, it does not seem to me to be a situation where Mr Cavanagh would be prevented from speaking with counsel and discussing at least his impressions of witnesses and of the jury. That would not infringe upon any issue of instructions or any information that might have come in a privileged sense from the accused, and it could place neither Mr Flynn nor Mr Cavanagh in any ethical difficulty, it seems to me. So that is an option.
	
	
	In all of those circumstances, the very considerable community interest and the interests of the accused in seeing so speedily heard, must outweigh the potential forensic disadvantages that exist. Accordingly, I refuse the application to discharge the jury.

		23 April 2015",2015-03-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766258,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v AB [2015] NSWLC 29,"Judgment


	
	The accused AB has been charged with one count of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years. The charge is brought pursuant to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. A plea of not guilty was entered to the charge and the matter proceeded before me for hearing in the Coffs Harbour Local Court over 6 days being 8, 9 and 10 October 2014 and 4, 5 and 6 February 2015. Mr Barrack Solicitor appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Smith Solicitor appeared for the accused. Following the completion of the evidence on 6 February 2015 I made directions for the preparation of written submissions and adjourned my decision until today. Written submissions have been received by me from both parties both in the first instance and in reply and they have been carefully considered.
	
	
	As in any criminal hearing it is for the prosecution to prove each and every element of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. Unless and until the prosecution has discharged that heavy onus the accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence. The words “beyond reasonable doubt” are ordinary English words and are to be given their ordinary English meaning. No further elaboration is required or desirable. It is however to be borne in mind that suspicion, and even grave suspicion, cannot be a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As in any matter it is necessary for me to assess the evidence that has been given by the various witnesses along with the documentary material that has been tendered. I am expected to use my life experience, my understanding of the community and my common sense in undertaking an assessment of the evidence, and I have of course done so.
	
	
	In my assessment of the witnesses I have considered carefully and taken the approach set out by O’Loughlin J in Cubillo v The Commonwealth (2000) 174 ALR 97. In that case, his Honour said at [118]:
	


… I desire, in the first instance, to make clear the approach that I have taken to the evidence of a witness where I have found some, but not all, aspects of the evidence of that witness to be unreliable. Simply because I find against a party or a witness on one issue and reject some part of the evidence of that person, it does not mean that what remains is tainted, or otherwise lacks probative force, with the consequence that I should dismiss all the evidence of that person. The principles enunciated in the cases indicate that the trial judge is entitled to believe part of the evidence given by a witness and to reject the rest. After making an assessment of the evidence, after utilising the advantage of having seen and heard all the witnesses, and after forming an impression of each, the confidence that the judge reposes in a particular witness is assessed accordingly. Where evidence has a logical probative value, a judge will rely on it; where it contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force, the judge will, in all probability reject it or, at least, not rely on it.

Later in the judgment (at [121]) his Honour remarked:

A trial judge is not restricted in his or her assessment of a witness. By this I mean that if, on peripheral issues, the trial judge reaches conclusions adverse to the credibility of a party, it does not necessarily follow, consistently with such conclusions, that these must be findings adverse to that party on the issues that are central to the determination of the matter. There is no rule of law or practice that states that an adverse finding on any aspect in the evidence of a witness means that the whole of that witness’ evidence must be rejected.


	
	To prove the offence of indecent assault the prosecution must firstly prove that there was an assault. That element can be satisfied by proof of either physical contact or the threat to a victim involving a reasonable apprehension of immediate and unlawful physical violence. The act relied upon by the prosecution must be deliberate, that is, it must be the non-accidental and voluntary act of the accused, and further, the conduct must be unlawful. For an assault to be indecent it must have a sexual connotation. It will have that connotation where the touching or threat is on or to a portion of the complainant’s body, or by the use of a part of the assailant’s body, which gives rise to that connotation. The Crown must establish that the accused “at the time of, or immediately before or after the assault” committed an act of indecency “on or in the presence of” the complainant. The same act may and frequently will constitute both the assault and the act of indecency. That is the case in this matter.
	


Background – agreed facts


	
	The alleged victim is a young girl who I shall refer to as Kylie. She resides in Macksville, a town on the mid north coast of New South Wales. In early January 2014 she was close friends with another young girl from Macksville who I shall refer to as Taylah, who is the putative step daughter of the accused. I will refer to Taylah’s mother as Ms B. She (Ms B) and the accused have been in a domestic relationship for many years. There is one child of their relationship, a young boy who I shall refer to as Jack. He was aged almost seven years in early January 2014.
	
	
	Prior to and at the relevant time Kylie and Taylah spent a good deal of time together. They went to school together, played sport together and the evidence indicates that Kylie spent a very considerable amount of time at the house of AB and Ms B. She regularly stayed there overnight.
	
	
	On 4 January 2014 the alleged victim and the accused along with Ms B and the children Taylah and Jack travelled from Macksville to Grafton by motor vehicle. Their intention was to attend a display of some type involving what were referred to in the evidence as “Monster Trucks.” This was to take place at Grafton Showground.
	
	
	The group checked into the Hilldrop Motor Inn at Grafton prior to attending the show. They occupied Room 7. The motel room, which is depicted in a series of photographs that were tendered to the court and became Exhibit 2 is if I might say respectfully a typical country motel. It comprised a single bed, a queen size bed and a three seater couch that could also be used for sleeping. There were also the usual bathroom facilities that one would expect. In addition, the accused and Ms B took with them a blue camping stretcher which was to be set up within the room for the child Jack to sleep upon. That stretcher occupied a space between the couch and the queen bed.
	
	
	In any event after being at the motel for some time during the afternoon the group attended at the showground to watch the Monster Truck show. They watched the show and after it had concluded returned to the motel at or about 9.30 or 10pm. After leaving the showground the accused stopped at a nearby bottle shop and purchased two long necks of Toohey’s New beer. The evidence is that on return to the room he consumed about one and a half bottles of this beer.
	
	
	It is not disputed that Ms B was sleeping in the single bed, Taylah and Kylie were sleeping in the queen bed, Jack was sleeping on the blue camping stretcher and the accused was sleeping on the couch. Taylah was positioned in the queen bed closest to where her mother was sleeping, and Kylie was on the other side of that bed and in a position closest to the stretcher bed occupied by Jack and the couch occupied by the accused.
	
	
	In due course and after watching television for some time the occupants of the room fell, or sought to fall asleep. It is the events that are alleged to have occurred thereafter in the early hours of the following morning that give rise to the charge before the court.
	


The alleged victim’s version


	
	Kylie’s evidence like that of the other young people who provided evidence, came before the Court through the playing of her electronically recorded interview. Kylie says that after the other occupants of the room had fallen asleep it transpired that she and the accused were awake. She alleges that the accused spoke to her and said words to the effect “You’re hot, I want to fuck you”. Kylie says that this caused her to shake. Her evidence is that she got out of bed to go to the toilet walked to the bathroom but was unable to “go” because she was shaking and distressed (apparently as a consequence of what had been said to her) although she did finally manage to do so. She says that she then walked back to the bed and pretended that the room air conditioning was cold. She says that the accused then got up from the couch to go to the toilet. She said that he shortly returned, and that when he did he sat on the bed that she was sharing with Taylah. At that point Kylie says that she turned the air conditioning in the room off. She says that the accused then said to her “Well done” and that he grabbed her arm and pulled her to him and started to kiss her forehead. She says that she said to him “No, go away” and that he then went back to the couch where he had previously laid. Kylie alleges that the accused then said to her “There’s a hole in this couch you should come and fill it up”, and that later said something to the effect of “I want to fuck you”.
	
	
	Kylie says that the accused continued speaking but that she was unable to clearly understand what he was saying. She says that he then said to her “Come here”, whereupon she leaned the top half of her body towards him at which time he pulled her to him and started kissing her on the cheek. It was at this point that she again said “No”. Kylie’s evidence is that she then leaned back and moved completely onto the bed, and turned around so as to ignore what the accused was saying. She says that the accused then got up from the couch and again sat on the bed, when she says that she felt him touch the top of her shorts and “go to touch her arse”. She says that she straightened her legs and that the accused returned to the couch.
	
	
	Her evidence is that sometime later the accused again got up from the couch and went to the toilet. When he returned she alleges that he again, for the third time, sat on the bed and started to grab her breasts and commence to kiss them. She says that she was in shock and froze. She says that she “finally got out” and “turned around”. Kylie says that the accused then resumed his position on the couch and that he was speaking. She could not understand what he was saying but she thought he said words to the effect “We should do that again”.
	
	
	It is then alleged that some five minutes later the accused approached her on the bed and while straddling the stretcher that Jack was asleep on, commenced again to kiss and touch her breasts in the same way as he had done previously. Her evidence is that she again said “No” after she had “frozen in shock”. Thereafter the accused returned to the couch where he fell asleep. Kylie’s evidence is that not long after the young child Jack awoke following a nightmare. His waking roused all of the occupants of the room. After some little time Jack was calmed down by the accused and put back to bed, whereupon she says that the accused again went to the toilet. It was at this point that Kylie says that she spoke to Taylah, who was now awake and lying next to her in the bed, and said “I have something to tell you in the morning”.
	
	
	The following morning all of the group attended at a mall in Grafton. They ate breakfast at a McDonalds Restaurant, and whilst at the mall Kylie complained to Taylah about what had happened to her on the previous evening. The group of five then returned by motor vehicle to Macksville.
	
	
	Kylie later made further complaints to others and the terms and nature of those complaints are matters to be considered later in these reasons.
	
	
	Kylie alleges that the conduct of the accused caused a bruise to her left breast. On the car journey home to Macksville a photograph of that bruise was taken from a camera located on Taylah’s iPod.
	


What the accused says


	
	The accused denies the allegations in their entirety. He gave evidence in the proceedings and had also participated in an electronically recorded interview with police on 14 January 2014, some 10 days after the offence is alleged to have been committed. It is to be borne in mind that he had no obligation to do either of these things. He has at all times denied any deliberate or inappropriate touching of Kylie whether in the way alleged or at all.
	
	
	There is no dispute from the accused as to the general sleeping arrangements within the motel room. He does say, contrary to Kylie, that he slept with his head to the door of the motel room, rather than with his head to the wall in a way similar to the other people in the room. He says that at the time he went to sleep the air conditioning within the motel room was on and that Taylah and Kylie were in the queen bed with the bed clothes pulled up over them. He gave evidence that at one point he got up from the couch and went to the toilet. When he returned he says that Kylie spoke to him saying words to the effect that “I’m cold” and that she “was going to turn the air conditioning in the room off.” It is not disputed that the switch for the motel room’s air conditioning unit was situated on a wooden bedhead adjacent to where Kylie’s head was placed on a pillow in the queen bed. He says that Kylie then switched the air conditioning off. While he did not see this happen due to the darkness in the room, he quickly became aware that the air conditioning had ceased to operate. He says that after Kylie turned the air conditioning off he said “Well done” to her. That the words “Well done” were spoken by him to Kylie at the time that the air conditioning was turned off is not disputed.
	
	
	He says that sometime later he again went to the toilet and then returned to his sleeping position on the couch. His evidence is that Kylie said something to him on his return to the couch, the exact nature of which he could not recall. He says he then asked her if she was awake and that she replied that she “Could not sleep in a strange bed.” His evidence is that he then said to her words to the effect “Shut your eyes and go to sleep”.
	
	
	The accused says that at some time thereafter the room became hot and that he again got up from the couch this time with the intention of turning the air conditioning back on. He says that he stood between the couch and the stretcher where Jack was sleeping at a point about midway along the couch and then, in the dark and half asleep, moved towards where the air conditioning switch was located. In doing so, he says that he stumbled and “half went, fell” whilst still standing in the area between the stretcher and the couch. It is clear on the evidence that this is a very tight and limited space. In doing so he placed his right hand on the chest of drawers that were adjacent to the queen bed (and which are clearly visible within the photographs taken by police of the motel room) and turned off the air conditioning switch with his left hand. In cross examination he agreed that his left hand might have touched the bed in the area of the pillow that Kylie was sleeping on, while he was in the process of keeping his balance and turning off the air conditioning.
	
	
	After turning the air conditioning off the accused says that he returned to the couch and fell asleep until woken by Jack’s nightmare some time later. He says that he settled Jack and then returned to sleep. Both in his electronically recorded interview and in his sworn evidence the accused says that the only time he could possibly have touched Kylie at all was during the process of his seeking to turn off the air conditioning at the time that he stumbled. He says that if there was any touching of Kylie at that time then it was entirely accidental. The version of events put by the accused is broadly consistent in both his electronically recorded interview and his sworn evidence.
	


The issue


	
	The question to be determined in this case is whether or not I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the victim’s version is to be accepted. The question is in reality a factual one. There is no issue that if the events transpired in the way that the victim says then she has been subjected to an indecent assault.
	
	
	This is a case where the evidence is substantially oath against oath. On the one hand there is the evidence of the child complainant as to what she said occurred, and on the other there is the evidence of the accused who denies entirely that which is suggested. Typical of cases involving allegations of indecent assault it is only the victim who gives evidence of the improper and illegal conduct alleged. It is necessary for me to give myself a direction consistent with what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 to the effect that whilst it is not necessary for the evidence of the complainant to be corroborated, because the prosecution relies on that evidence alone it will be necessary for me to scrutinise it with the greatest of care before I am able to arrive at the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, it would be necessary for me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt both as to the truthfulness and accuracy of the evidence of the complainant before I could find the offence proven. The giving of this direction does not of itself involve any implication that the complainant’s evidence is unreliable, nor does it mean that I could not find the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt relying solely on her evidence. That being said I must use great care in assessing the evidence and must expose the evidence to very careful scrutiny.
	
	
	It is also necessary that I direct myself to the effect that if I am left unable to reject the evidence of the accused even though I do not positively accept it then I could not find his guilt established beyond reasonable doubt. It would not be enough if I were to have a preference for the evidence of the complainant. This direction is consistent with what the High Court said in Liberato v R (1985) 159 CLR 507. Further, and in accordance with s 165A of the Evidence Act 1995, I must not warn myself that children as a class are unreliable or inherently less credible. That is not to say that I may not direct myself that the evidence of a particular child witness may not be reliable and warn myself in respect of that evidence in circumstances where, as is the case here, one of the parties (the accused) has by inference, requested such a warning in the written submission provided.
	
	
	A careful analysis of the evidence and of the parties’ written submissions seems to me to identify the following broad matters of evidence that require consideration in determination of the issue in the case:
	



	
	The complaint evidence
	
	
	The bruise to Kylie’s breast
	
	
	The context evidence
	
	
	The demeanour of Kylie and the accused and their credit generally
	
	
	The physical surroundings and the circumstances of the alleged offence
	


I now turn to deal with each of these issues.

The complaint evidence


	
	The prosecutor says that evidence of the complaint made by the victim to others once admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act (as it was here) can be considered by the court as a matter going to the truth of the contents of that complaint. This is, it seems to me, a relatively uncontroversial statement of the law as held by the High Court in Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297 and to the extent that the accused’s solicitor submits to the contrary then his submission is rejected. The prosecution places some considerable store on the complaint evidence of the victim and accordingly this evidence must be considered very carefully. It is submitted for the prosecution that the complaint evidence was almost immediate and in very similar terms and that this means considerable weight ought be attached to it.
	
	
	On my analysis there appear to be 6 items of evidence touching upon the issue of the victim’s complaint and I will deal with each of those chronologically.
	
	
	Firstly, there is the complaint that is alleged to have been made by the victim to Taylah in the early hours of 5 January 2014 after Jack had awoken with his nightmare. Kylie says that she said to Taylah “I have to tell you something in the morning”. As I was reminded in the defence submissions, this conversation is denied by Taylah and is not corroborated by the other persons within the motel room who could possibly have heard such words spoken and who gave evidence, being Ms B and the accused. So far as Taylah’s evidence generally is concerned the prosecutor urges me to have regard to the clear falling out which had occurred between the two girls since the allegations were made, and to take this into account in assessing Taylah’s credit and the general reliability of her evidence. I note that no such submission is made in respect of the evidence of Ms B, either on the question of this initial complaint or in a general sense.
	
	
	Secondly, there is the complaint made by the victim to Taylah on the following morning whilst the girls were in a shopping mall in Grafton. Taylah described Kylie as “kind of weird” at the time of this conversation. The evidence as to the terms of this complaint comes from both Kylie and Taylah and is broadly consistent as between the two girls. In question 301 of her recorded interview of 13 January 2014, Kylie was asked:
	


Q.301: So tell me more about what you said, what you talked to [Taylah] about.

A: Um, I’m, like, to her, um, “know how I had to tell you somethin’ last night?” She’s like, “Yeah. What was it?” I’m, like, um, “Last night your, [AB] was touchin’ my boobs and kissing them and everything, saying that I was hot and he wanted to fuck me”. An um, her first words were um, … and laughed. Then she said something about ah that I should tell [Ms B] from, I said ah, “I think I’m alright” and that was about it.


	
	Taylah was questioned in her recorded interview of 14 January 2014, about this conversation. At question 418 of that interview she was asked:
	


Q418: Ok. Can you remember, I know it’s hard, um, can you remember exactly what she said?

A: Um, that he was trying to make out with her. Um, he was grabbing her boobs, that he was, like, Come and fill a hole in the lounge. And then she said, No. And then she went to the toilet for a bit and she came back apparently.


	
	Taylah was then asked a further series of questions touching upon the more precise detail of this complaint. Those questions and her answers are as follows:
	


Q419: Right. So I’ll just go back to what [Kylie] was saying. So she said, um, you, in your words you said he was trying to make out with her.

A: Yeah

Q420: So do you know how she said it in her words?

A: That, like he tried to make out with me and kiss me and all that.

Q421: OK. Did she say your dad or…

A: [A]

Q422: …. did she call him by his name. [A]. So she said, [A]…..

A: Yeah

Q423: …was trying to. OK. And so she said, to, trying to make out with her?

A: Uh-huh

Q424: And trying to kiss her. Is that, OK. And that he said, Come fill a hole in the lounge.

A: Yeah

Q425: OK and she said, No. And then she said she got up and went to the toilet.

A: Yeah

Q426: OK. Did she say when this happened?

A: Um, about in the morning, like, that night but, yeah.


	
	Thirdly, there is the complaint that was made by Kylie to her friend, who I shall refer to as Skye, in a telephone conversation on the afternoon of 5 January 2014. Kylie was said to be crying at the time. The terms of the complaint to Skye are contained in the transcript of Skye’s interview with police on 9 January 2014 (which became her evidence in chief) and are set out in answer to questions 43-45 of the interview as follows:
	


Q43: And when you say what happened, can you tell me what happened?

A: Well, Kylie called me and told me that when she was in Grafton with Taylah’s family, that about 2 o’clock in the morning, [AB] was sitting on her bed grabbing and feeling her boobs, and was making out with her face.

Q44: Yeah

A: And she also told me that he was trying, or was kissing her boobs.

Q45: What happened next?

A: And then he just went on the lounge again and Kylie was shaking and then she was, she went to the toilet. That’s all Kylie told me had happened.


	
	The fourth item of complaint evidence relied on by the prosecution comes from a witness who I will refer to as Ashley. She is the elder sister of Skye and her evidence was given to the court in person. Shortly after Skye had spoken with Kylie and received details of her complaint, Ashley had a telephone conversation with Kylie when she also received particulars of the complaint. The evidence pertaining to this issue is contained on pages 13 and 14 of the transcript of proceedings on 9 October 2014. Most particularly, on page 14 the following questions were asked and answers given:
	


Q: Can you recall what she told you?

A: She said when she stated ….. (not transcribable)….. with [Taylah’s] family throughout the night she woke up to [Taylah’s] father touching her breasts.

Q: And doing the best you can did she tell you anything else about what happened on that night?

A: Yes and he tongue kissed her as she said it she said “He tongue kissed me all over the face”.

Q: Was that the end or did she tell you more about what happened on that night.

A: She told me more. She said – I said: “Like how did it happen” and she said that she was pretty much laying there asleep and she had awoken to having that being done to her.

Q: Go on?

A: And she – and I said, “well what did you do” and she said: “I just laid there”.


	
	As Mr Smith has observed in his submissions, the recent complaint evidence of Ashley in the terms set out above was not included in her original statement to police made on 9 January 2014. In her evidence she attempted to explain this omission as an error, and in re-examination said “I got it mixed up” (Pages 19-22, Transcript 9/10/14). The fact of this omission from Ashley’s evidence must impact upon its reliability, the weight, to be attached to it and more especially to her recollection of the terms of the complaint made by Kylie.
	
	
	The fifth item of complaint evidence derives from the evidence given to the court by Kylie’s father, who I will refer to as Mr D. His evidence also touches upon the reaction of the accused when first confronted with the allegation. His evidence is that when his daughter came home from being in Grafton with the family she did not really speak to him and she looked sad, had tears welling up and her eyes were red. He said that she had a shower and then went to her friend Skye’s house. Kylie returned to the family home at about 9.30pm in the company of Skye and her father, following which he attended at the home of AB and Ms B and confronted the accused. He was asked what words were spoken during this confrontation and at page 31, 7ff of the transcript of 8 October 2014, the following evidence was given;
	


Q: Can you remember what he said?

A: He said “I got up to touch the air conditioner”, and as he got up, somehow he touched her breast.


	
	Mr D was cross examined regarding the alleged admission by the accused, and in cross examination he asserted that the accused had in fact said “I slipped and touched her breast” (page 39, L 45). He confirmed that he was quite clear about those words being spoken. This in circumstances where it was also clear from the evidence that when he made his statement to police on 9 January 2014, he made no mention of the word breast or of the accused making any admission as to the touching of Kylie’s breast at any time. Mr Barrack sought in re-examination to clarify the issue, but the fact remains that there was no mention in Mr D’s relatively contemporaneous statement to police, of the use by the accused of the words “touched her breast”. Given the nature of the allegation and the short space of time between the words allegedly being spoken by the accused and the taking of the statement, I am of the view that those words would reasonably be expected to appear in the statement had they in fact been spoken.
	
	
	The evidence does not indicate the terms of any complaint made by Kylie to her father on 5 January 2014, however Mr D says that on the following day while driving Kylie to the Macksville Police Station he spoke with her regarding the allegation. His evidence as to what she said was as follows; (page 33, 31ff, Transcript 8/10/14):
	


That he grabbed her breast, he was saying he wanted to fuck her, I think he was kissing her.


	
	The sixth and final piece of complaint evidence available to the court concerns the complaint made by Kylie to the Macksville Police at the time of her initial attendance there on 6 January 2014. A COPS Event entry was made by officers from Macksville Police shortly after that complaint was received by them. I accept that the narrative in the COPS Event was recorded accurately and reflects what it is that police were told. It came before the court by it being tendered in the prosecution case and became Exhibit 12 in the proceedings. The author of that document Detective Senior Constable Justin Welsh gave evidence to the effect that the COPS event was prepared by him from information he had received from Sergeant Dalzell, who unfortunately did not give evidence, and from information that he had himself obtained whilst Kylie was in his presence. His evidence was that he had access to Sergeant Dalzell’s notebook at the time he prepared the COPS entry. He is an experienced criminal investigator who certainly understood the importance of accurately recording the terms of a complaint involving sexual misbehaviour. The contents of that COPS event are significant. It was prepared at a point shortly after the first occasion that Kylie had the opportunity to make a formal complaint to a person in authority. It describes what it is that she said had taken place in the Hilldrop Motel at Grafton. The content of that COPS Event so far as relevant is set out below;
	


She has disclosed certain things to police indicating she has been indecently assaulted. They attend the Monster Truck Show at the Grafton Racecourse. Later in the night they attended the Hilldrop Motel to retire for the night. The victim told police that she was in the bed with the POI, [Taylah] and [Jack]. The claims that once they were in bed [AB] reached over other children in the bed and touched her on the breasts. She claims that he put his hand under her clothing and touched her skin. She stated that he also climbed over the other children and kissed her on the breasts and also tried to kiss her on the mouth. She informed police that he attempted to touch her on the vagina a number of times but she turned away so he couldn’t. At one stage he was apparently sitting on the bed.

She told police that she was very scared. At one stage she said she was cold and got out of the bed to turn the air conditioner off just to get away from the POI. It stopped after about half an hour. The following day she told [Taylah] what happened. She said that her mother would kick him out if that happened or she found out. She also told another close friend [Skye]. She told police that as a result she had a bruise on her chest near her breasts from where he was fondling her. She later told her father what happened and he attended Macksville Police Station with her to report the matter.


	
	What is absolutely clear from Exhibit 12 is that the version of events described by Kylie to police on 6 January 2014 is significantly at odds with the complaints made by her to other persons in the period shortly after the incident is said to have occurred. Mr Barrack submits that given what he describes as the consistency of the complainants earlier version(s), that I would give little weight to the content of Exhibit 12. Mr Smith not surprisingly takes a different approach and has submitted in considerable detail that I ought examine in a very careful manner the content of Exhibit 12 and compare it to the remaining complaint evidence. I have done so and have concluded that the version of events set out within Exhibit 12 is of such significant inconsistency that it cannot sit comfortably or at all with the earlier versions of the incident provided by Kylie. Those inconsistencies are:
	



	
	that Kylie was in bed with the accused, Taylah and Jack,
	
	
	that while so positioned the accused reached over Taylah and Jack and touched her breasts,
	
	
	that while so positioned the accused climbed over both Taylah and Jack and then kissed her on the breasts and also tried to kiss her on the mouth,
	
	
	that the accused attempted to touch her on the vagina a number of times.
	


Such a vast discrepancy in the terms of the complaint, must necessarily impact upon my assessment of the overall reliability of Kylie’s evidence. I must also have regard to the evidence given by Kylie in cross-examination where she denied at any stage informing police of the matters contained within Exhibit 12. I have some difficulty in accepting her evidence in this regard and this is a factor to be taken into account in an overall sense.

Evidence regarding the bruise to Kylie’s breast


	
	It is not disputed that on the day following the overnight stay in the Hilldrop Motel, two photographs were taken of a bruise to Kylie’s left breast. It would appear clear on the evidence that both photos were taken within 18 hours of the alleged offence occurring. The first photo (Exhibit 19) was taken in the car outside Dan Murphy’s in Coffs Harbour at or about 12 noon on 5 January 2014, approximately ten hours after the incident is said to have occurred. The second photo was taken by Ashley in the early hours of that same evening. Kylie’s clear and certain evidence was that the bruise was not on her chest when she went to bed on 4 January 2014 and that it was occasioned to her as a result of the defendants handling and kissing her breasts in the manner complained of. In answer to Q318 of her interview of 13 January 2014, Kylie says “It was from him grabbing”. The evidence is that a complaint of bruising as a consequence of the accused’s behaviour towards her was made by Kylie to each of Taylah, Skye and Ashley and the police to whom she initially spoke at Macksville.
	
	
	The two photographs that were taken came into evidence as Exhibits 9 and 19 respectively and I was able to observe them. If the evidence of Kylie is to be regarded as reliable on this issue I must accept that within less than one day of the alleged assault occurring a bruise would appear on Kylie’s left breast of the type depicted in the two photographs. I have observed the photographs carefully and note that the bruise said to have been caused by the defendant’s conduct is yellow in colour. Indeed this is the colour description given to the bruise by Kylie herself in her answer to Question 312 of her first interview. It was also the description given by both Ashley and Skye. Skye described the bruise in answer to Q.232 of her recorded interview as follows;
	


It was yellowish, like a day or two old bruise.

My life experience and common sense inform me that bruises do not typically become yellow in colour until some time has elapsed between the observation being made and the impact occasioning the discolouration having occurred.


	
	On this issue the court was assisted by the calling of expert medical evidence in the defence case. Dr Winston Edgell gave evidence by telephone on the final day of the hearing. Dr Edgell has been practicing medicine since 1966 (a period of 49 years) and has practiced as a general practitioner in Macksville for some 37 years. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and obtained post graduate qualifications through the Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom. He remains a member of that organisation. His evidence was that in the course of practicing medicine he has obtained extensive experience in diagnosing and treating bruises. Given the length of his experience this is in my view unremarkable. His evidence was that he had been provided with both of the photographs of the bruising to Kylie’s left breast that came before the court as exhibits. His evidence was that when he viewed those photographs he observed what he described as a significant yellow tinge in both. He told the court that yellowing signifies age and that yellowing does not occur until the trauma to the area of the bruise has been present for a few days. He was asked to assume, consistent with the evidence, that both photographs were taken on the same day and was then asked to hypothesize as to the age of the bruise. His evidence was that the bruise was “days old”. He was asked if he meant more than one day and his answer was “definitely”. He said that the bruise was probably three days old but that this was “a bit of a guess” but that in any event the bruise was certainly not a fresh one.
	
	
	He was cross examined by Mr Barrack and conceded that he had not physically examined the bruise and agreed that his failing to do so affected his ability to estimate its age. He accepted that estimating the age of bruises was somewhat inexact. It was put to him by Mr Barrack that any estimate of the age of a bruise must be approached with caution. Dr Edgell answered with words to the effect that he approached the assessment of the age of the bruise from his experience, which as has already been observed is both lengthy and extensive. Mr Barrack has submitted that the photos display red/purple as well as yellow discolouration and that given the inexact nature of estimating bruise age, that Dr Edgell’s evidence does not adversely affect that of Kylie. While it is possible that there is some red/purple discolouration present in the photos, that is not clear, and further, the evidence makes plain that the bruising described by Kylie, Skye and Ashley as being caused by the accused was the bruising that was yellow in colour.
	
	
	Dr Edgell’s evidence is important. While I accept that the issue of the assessment of the age of bruising must always be approached with some caution, Dr Edgell’s evidence (given from his lengthy experience as a medical practitioner in general practice), and my own life experience, do not allow me to conclude to the requisite standard that the bruising evidenced in the photos was occasioned in the way suggested by Kylie. Given the certain and almost strident nature of her evidence on this question, my conclusion must inevitably raise concerns as to the reliability of Kylie’s evidence on this crucial aspect, and consequently, on the reliability of her evidence in an overall sense.
	


The context evidence


	
	The prosecution led evidence over objection of alleged prior sexual misconduct by the accused that was not the subject of any specific charge. The evidence was to the effect that on prior occasions when Kylie had visited the home in Macksville, the accused had touched her bottom and breasts inappropriately. Those allegations were denied by the accused. Further, evidence was given by both Ms B and Taylah that no such event had occurred. Part of this context evidence involved evidence given by Kylie during her cross examination that not only had the accused inappropriately touched her, but that he had also inappropriately touched another girl in her presence, at a time when she and that other girl (a young person who I will refer to as Emma) had both been at the home for an overnight stay. Emma gave evidence in the accused’s case. She denied that the accused had ever touched her inappropriately or at all, and further denied that she had ever stayed overnight at the home at the same time as Kylie. She said that she was aware of the fact that she had not stayed overnight with Kylie as had been suggested because she and Kylie had never got on and were not friends. She said they had never really talked and did not like one another.
	
	
	It is necessary that I direct myself to the affect that there is a very limited use to which this context evidence can be put. I must exercise great care in ensuring that the evidence is not used for any impermissible purpose. Context evidence is led so as to put matters that are specifically charged into their proper context. That is, the version given by a complainant may be more capable of belief when seen in the context of what it is said was her prior relationship with an accused person. It may explain why an accused person and a complainant acted as they did, in circumstances where without the context of the relationship being clear, those acts might appear inexplicable. See generally ES v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 197 at [41]. Context evidence when led does not make a complainant’s account more reliable than it would otherwise be in the absence of that evidence, nor does it make it more likely that an accused has committed the specific offence with which he has been charged. The prosecution submissions note that the allegation the subject of the charge occurred in a motel room in which members of the accused’s family were present. It is contended that the context evidence explains why the accused felt emboldened to indecently assault Kylie in the way that he did and “why he felt confident that she would not raise the alarm”.
	
	
	I must also ensure that I do not substitute the evidence of any other improper activity for the specific activity which is the subject of the charge before the court. I must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong on some other occasion that he must have done so on the occasion that is the subject of the charge to be determined. Further, I must not use context evidence as proof of any propensity on the part of the accused to behave in the way complained of.
	
	
	Given the lack of corroboration provided by any other witnesses in respect of the alleged context evidence, the denial of such conduct by the accused in his evidence and the fact that he was unshaken in cross examination, the conflict in the evidence given by Kylie with that of Emma, Taylah and Ms B, and the very great caution that I must exercise in the use of this evidence generally, I have concluded that the context evidence is not evidence that can properly impact upon my determination of the issue that arises in these proceedings.
	


The demeanour of Kylie and the accused, and their credit generally


	
	Mr Barrack submits that I would form a favourable impression in respect of Kylie as a witness. The prosecutor says that I would consider, in reaching this conclusion the following matters:
	



	
	the detailed nature of her observations and of her evidence,
	
	
	what are described as the detailed and specific nature of the allegations she has made,
	
	
	the fact that, in the prosecutions submission her evidence has the “ring of truth”,
	
	
	the unrehearsed and spontaneous way in which her evidence was given, and
	
	
	the consistency of her version under cross examination.
	



	
	Mr Smith submits that when considered overall I would harbour concerns regarding Kylies demeanour and behaviour both during and after the alleged incident and her general reliability. This is of course of great significance because as I have already noted, and both parties acknowledge, this case is essentially one of oath against oath. Mr Smith points me to Kylie’s movement within the motel room in circumstances where she alleges she was frozen with fear, to her cheerful behaviour in the motor vehicle on the return journey from Grafton to Macksville and to what he describes as inappropriate grinning by Kylie during her first interview with police. I have already made some comments concerning certain important aspects of Kylie’s evidence and her reliability and I do not propose to repeat those. That having been said, I would note that I did not form an adverse view of Kylie personally or in any general sense. Of course the absence of such a view is not the test by which the accused’s guilt or innocence is to be determined. The issue remains at all times the reliability of the prosecution evidence and whether it has been able to discharge the heavy onus that is required.
	
	
	The accused gave evidence, and was cross examined. Having carefully observed that process, and similarly to Kylie, I did not form an adverse view of him. He maintained his version of events during cross examination and was not shaken. While I found his evidence concerning Kylie possibly having some attraction to him – “Unless she’s got a thing for me” – curious to say the least, such a spontaneous response during his oral evidence, while unusual, is not of such moment as to cause me to depart from the non-adverse view of him that I had formed. Mr Barrack submitted that this remark was an admission that was consistent with the context evidence that had been led as to previous inappropriate sexual contact between the accused and Kylie. I do not believe that these words spoken by the accused allow me, having considered all of the evidence to draw the conclusion urged upon me by the prosecution. My concluded view as to his credit has regard to the totality of both his oral evidence and his ERISP.
	
	
	Demeanour findings are important for any tribunal of fact. It has long been the case that in contested hearings the impression left upon the court by seeing and hearing a witness can affect the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This is what McHugh J referred to as the “subtle influence of demeanour” in Jones v Hyde (1989) 85 ALR 23. Demeanour findings must however be approached cautiously. As the High Court noted in State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (1999) 160 ALR 588, there is a need to keep the appearance and demeanour of a witness in perspective, and to weigh that aspect in the light of other more objective consideration.
	


The physical surroundings and the circumstances of the alleged offence


	
	What is clear on any view of the evidence is that the incident complained of took place in a single motel room in a somewhat cramped and confined space. All of the evidence points to the lighting being at the very least compromised to a degree. Mr Smith in his submissions places considerable emphasis on these matters and points to;
	



	
	the fact that there were five people occupying the room,
	
	
	the fact that Jack was sleeping on a stretcher between where Kylie was sleeping and the accused was sleeping,
	
	
	that all of the occupants of the room were in close physical proximity to one another,
	
	
	that no other person heard any words spoken between Kylie and the accused despite the extended nature of that dialogue,
	
	
	that no other person observed the conduct alleged of the accused,
	
	
	that the distance between the couch where the accused slept and the side of the bed where Kylie slept was approximately 1,100 mm and that there was a stretcher occupied by Jack in between them,
	
	
	the evidence given by Kylie that during the incident the accused was straddling Jack’s stretcher with one leg on either side of it, that is one leg closer to the couch and one leg closer to the bed. As I comprehend it, this is said to be implausible given the physical layout of the room and the narrow distance between each of the couch and the stretcher, and the stretcher and the queen bed.
	



	
	Mr Smith submits that given the number of people in the room and the possibility that one or other of them would wake up and either hear what the accused was saying or observe what it is he is said to have been doing, along with the physical layout of the room and the sleeping arrangements, that it is unlikely that the version of events proffered by Kylie is reliable.
	
	
	The prosecution submits that little weight ought be given to the “straddling submissions”. Mr Barrack notes that there was a gap of approximately 30 cms between the stretcher and the couch and queen bed respectively. In my assessment that distance is very limited. It seems to me that there would inevitably be a degree of physical difficulty in an adult male such as the accused, straddling a stretcher on which a child was asleep and the performing the acts complained of with such dexterity that no other individual within the room was awoken. This is particularly so within a darkened and unfamiliar room. The accused would have required an agility and flexibility that my observations of him in the courtroom do not allow me to conclude he possessed. Of course I mean no offence to the accused in drawing this conclusion as to his physical prowess. On the issue of others in the room not hearing anything the prosecution submits that little weight ought be given this as the evidence allows me to infer that the other persons in the room were asleep throughout the incident. In a sense, that observation begs the question, how is it that the others in the room remained asleep if the events described by Kylie including significant physical movement within the room including at and around the queen bed, and extended dialogue described were taking place?
	


Conclusion


	
	As I remarked earlier in these reasons, the prosecution bears a heavy onus in a criminal hearing of proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the event that there is a doubt in the mind of the tribunal of fact then it must be exercised in favour of the accused. No matter how suspicious an event may be, unless all of the elements of the offence charged are proved beyond reasonable doubt then the accused is entitled to acquittal. I have given very considerable thought to this matter over an extended period of time and have finally determined that for the following reasons, all of which are to be viewed in combination with one another, that the prosecution have not met their burden. Those reasons are:
	



	
	My concern regarding the inconsistency in part of the complaint evidence,
	
	
	My concern regarding the evidence touching upon the bruising to the area of Kylie’s left breast,
	
	
	My concern as to evidence touching upon the physical circumstances existing at the time and place of the alleged incident,
	
	
	My inability to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and accuracy of Kylie’s evidence in critical respects, and
	
	
	My inability to reject the evidence of the accused even though I do not positively accept it in all respects.
	



	
	The Order of the Court will be that the charge is dismissed. A copy of these Reasons will be forthwith made available to the parties from the Registrar of the Coffs Harbour Local Court. I remind the parties and any other interested person or persons of the statutory prohibition upon the publication of any detail of this matter that might identify any child witness.

		16 May 2016",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2766260,R v Kevin Pocknell [2015] NSWDC 333,"Judgment: - Admissibility of record of interview

Introduction


	
	The accused Mr Pocknell is being tried in respect of allegations of sexual assault allegedly committed by him on 10 or 11 May 2011 at Woolloomooloo against CS. Count 1 is an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent, with an alternative count of indecent assault, count 2 is an allegation of indecent assault. The Crown case in proof of guilt in relation to the allegation of sexual intercourse without consent is dependent almost entirely upon admissions made by the accused in the course of an interview conducted with him from 4.34 pm onwards on 4 March 2013 at Kings Cross Police Station.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused, on his behalf, objects to the admissibility of the contents of the electronic interview (Exhibit 1 on the voir dire). The bases of the objection are either that the electronically recorded interview had been obtained improperly and thus ought be excluded in exercise of the powers pursuant to s 138 Evidence Act 1995 (the ‘Act’). Alternatively, the Court should exclude the interview with the accused because the circumstances in which the admission(s) was made was such as to adversely affect the truth of any admission(s) that were made and thus the prosecution cannot discharge the burden upon it created by s 85(2) of the Act. 
	
	
	Alternatively, the Court should use its discretion pursuant to s 90 of the Act to refuse to admit the contents of the interview involving any admission(s) because having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence. Nothing turned upon any judicial consideration of the width or operation of the relevant sections of relevant legislation.
	


Provisions of the Evidence Act 1995

S 85 Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants

(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:

(a) to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or

(b) as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

(2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:

(a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and

(b) if the admission was made in response to questioning:

(i) the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and

(ii) the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.

S 90 Discretion to exclude admissions


	
	In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:
	


(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and

(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.

S 138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1) Evidence that was obtained:

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

(a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a) the probative value of the evidence, and

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and

(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.

The voir dire examination


	
	Evidence on the voir dire was given by the two arresting police officers, Detective Senior Constable Arnold and Detective Senior Constable Duckworth, who conducted the interview with the accused the subject of objection, the Custody Manager at Kings Cross Police Station on the afternoon of 4 March 2013, Leading Senior Constable Simon Fitzhenry, and the accused. Various documents were tendered on the voir dire, or otherwise admitted in the trial (the voir dire proceedings providing some evidence not objected to that is evidence in the trial) including the “Caution and Summary of Part 9” (the ‘Part 9 document’: Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 or ‘LEPRA’ ) said to be read to the accused but which he refused to sign, the Custody Management Record, naturally the electronic recording of the interview and transcript as an aide memoire, parts of various statements made by the police officers and hospital records of St Vincent’s Hospital relating to the treatment of the accused on 1 March, 2 March and 4-5 March 2013 at its Emergency Department, including shortly before the accused was arrested.
	


Brief outline of relevant basic “facts” established on the voir dire examination


	
	The complainant reported matters to police that lead to an investigation of an alleged sexual assault upon her on 11 May 2012. Ultimately, DNA testing of the swabs taken from the complainant lead to the identification of a DNA profile of the accused associated with a swab taken of the breast of the complainant. No DNA profile of the accused was developed from swabs taken of the vagina of the complainant nor was any semen detected on scientific examination.
	
	
	The accused was treated at St Vincent’s Hospital on 1 and 2 March 2013, the details of which I will refer to later, and was also treated on 4 March 2013, in the sense that he attended upon the hospital Emergency Department at about 11.44am.
	
	
	He was spoken to by Detectives Duckworth and Arnold shortly after leaving the Hospital’s Emergency Department at about 12.30pm on 4 March 2013 and was arrested. He was “highly intoxicated”, “swaying on his feet and slurring his words”. He had “some red marks around his left eye” which police took to be a recent injury.
	
	
	From the Custody Management Record, prepared largely by Leading Senior Constable Fitzhenry, he was detained at 12.41pm, arrived at Kings Cross Police Station at 1.08pm, had his Part 9 “rights” read to him at 1.30pm, given “recovery time” from 1.30pm until 4pm, during which time at 2.30pm he was given lunch, which was a “Big Mac Meal” and had two cigarettes with his meal. In the assessment of him by the Custody Manager, he noted “intoxication” the accused did not complain or “show” any obvious pain, injury or illness, “admitted to alcohol consumption”, showed no other signs of disturbance or possession of drugs. He provided information that he took medication in the form of “Epilim, Risperidone” (sic), suffered from “epilepsy” and had the mental problem of “schizophrenia”.
	
	
	He presented no management difficulties whilst in custody. After his “recovery time” was completed the interview commenced at 4.34pm and concluded shortly before 6pm. During the interview after question 265, there was a 10 minute break and the interview was suspended whilst the accused had a cigarette.
	
	
	The arresting police did not enquire of the hospital as to the reason for his attendance or the nature of any treatment he had sought or whether he was taking any medication. The hospital records of 1 March reflect a history of a fear by the accused that his “alcohol abuse is going to kill him”, admitting to consuming “copious amounts of white wine this am”, intoxicated with a Glasgow Coma Scale of ‘14’. He complained of chest pain, requested detoxification and treatment for alcohol abuse and withdraw seizures, and was described as a “poor historian”, with another Glasgow Coma Scale assessment of ‘13’. He was an uncooperative patient, who left the Emergency Department to go to the hotel to have a beer, and was seen “standing close to (staff) in an inappropriate fashion”.
	
	
	On 2 March 2013 he returned to the Emergency Department after being found “slumped on stairs” by police. He admitted alcohol consumption and claimed chest pains, appeared angry that he was not taken to RPA and became quite abusive when asked about his history. He was described as agitated, intoxicated, denied use of “recreation drugs (sic)”, refused various treatments and claimed not to have slept for 24 plus hours.
	
	
	On 4 March 2013 when admitted to hospital he gave a history of being ejected from Foster House, stated he had had a “cask of wine today”, was “drowsy at triage” and stated he had “ice on weekend”. He was noted as leaving the building at 12.35, security unable to deal with him because he was not “scheduled”. He told staff he wanted to walk out to have a cigarette. This was when he was arrested. He gave a history of not having had his “meds” in four days, including epilim and risperadone (sic). He gave a presentation of being a difficult, perhaps reluctant, patient
	
	
	After the interview the subject of objection was completed he was returned to custody, another Custody Manager came on duty, and the accused was taken to hospital by ambulance, leaving Kings Cross Police Station at 20.28 (8.28pm), the ambulance having been dispatched at 7.47pm and was left at the hospital by 9pm where he remained until the following day. The presenting “problem” was described as “tremors”, the “diagnosis” was “drug and alcohol – Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome”. He was scanned for his facial injuries and no fractures were found. His “main issues” were described as “alcoholism, seizure disorder and homelessness”. He was provided with some medication and discharged back into custody where he has remained since.
	


Consideration of the issues raised


	
	I approach the objection from the perspective of the submissions made by learned counsel for the accused as addressed by the learned Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	With regard to s 138 of the Act, the relevant impropriety is said to be a failure to comply with s 122 of LEPRA (in the context of Part 9 of that Act).
	
	
	That section states:
	


(1) As soon as practicable after a person who is detained under this Part (a ""detained person"") comes into custody at a police station or other place of detention, the custody manager for the person must orally and in writing:

(a) caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence, and

(b) give the person a summary of the provisions of this Part that is to include reference to the fact that the maximum investigation period may be extended beyond 4 hours by application made to an authorised officer and that the person, or the person’s legal representative, may make representations to the authorised officer about the application.

(2) The giving of a caution does not affect a requirement of any law that a person answer questions put by, or do things required by, a police officer.

(3) After being given the information referred to in subsection (1) orally and in writing, the person is to be requested to sign an acknowledgment that the information has been so given.


	
	It is submitted in that the accused was too intoxicated to understand what was read to him by the Custody Manager, Leading Sen. Constable Fitzhenry, and was denied his mandatory rights under the Act to understand his entitlement to medical treatment, legal advice or the presence of a legal practitioner or a ‘friend’, his right to silence as provided for in Part 9 LEPRA. In this regard to process involved pursuant to s 122 of this Act is submitted to be vital and must be given more that ‘lip service’, to use my words, with which I agree at the outset.
	
	
	There is no issue, having regard to the evidence of the Custody Manager and the evidence of the accused and his recollection or lack of recollection of relevant events, that the Custody Manager after the accused was placed under his control read to the accused ‘the Part 9 document’, asked the accused if he understood what had been read to him to which the accused replied “Yeap”. He then invited him to sign the documents acknowledging that the ‘Form’, as it is described, had been read, and that here had been information he had been given. This he refused to do saying, “I’m not signing that shit”.
	
	
	I satisfied that the accused was intoxicated at the time, that the Custody Manager knew this to be so, having regard to the Custody Management Record and the state of the accused as assessed just less than an hour before. I am also satisfied, however, that the accused was belligerent as he demonstrated himself to be at times during the course of the subsequent recorded interview, and had no hesitation in asserting himself if needs be.
	
	
	I accept that s 122 LEPRA cast upon the officer, with the care of the accused, a mandatory obligation to which lip service should not be given. Whilst the accused in the later interview said that he had little recollection of the questions asked of him at the time of his arrest, I do not regard his claim in his evidence on the voir dire that he had no memory of the Custody Manager reading to him the “Caution and Part 9” document as decisive. Ultimately, nothing turns upon this because the judgment of what is appropriate conduct does not turn solely upon the accused’s recollection. I bear in mind that the Custody Manager was seen by Detective Duckworth, as reported by her in her statement made 10 days after the event, physically in the possession of the document that the accused declined to sign at a time soon before the Custody Manager spoke to him on his arrival at the Police Station.
	
	
	The critical issue is whether the accused did understand the document and/or whether, having regard to his condition, the Custody Manager ought to have delayed reading the document to him or re-read the document, given his refusal to sign the document and the fact that the Custody Manager gave him a recovery time in any event to become less intoxicated.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the fact that the accused said he understood the document, although he refused to sign it acknowledging that he understood it, given the fact that I accept the accused was intoxicated when spoken to by the Custody Manager, the failure to ensure that the accused was in a condition to be able to understand all the document was relevantly an impropriety on the part of the Custody Manager at that time. I bear in mind that the Custody Manager gave the accused ‘recovery time’, fed him and allowed him to have some cigarettes and allowed him further rest until 4 pm, demonstrating that there was no deliberate mistreatment of the accused by him. As for the detectives, Detective Duckworth said that she told the accused that the interview of him would be delayed until he was “ not so drunk”, which is of course a recognition of his intoxication at that earlier time, but also a recognition of the need to interview him when he was in a condition to be interviewed.
	
	
	Thus, the interview commenced at 4:34pm, at which time the accused does not give the appearance in the course of the interview of being so intoxicated as to not be able to understand what is happening or what questions are being asked of him or not to be able to provide considered direct answers to the questions that were asked. I accept that with his tolerance of alcohol he could give an impression of understanding what was going on or show less signs of intoxication. He could well be the “functioning alcoholic” that counsel for the accused spoke of in submission. But there were many indicia that he was not just “barely functioning”.
	
	
	With regard to the Custody Manager he was directly asked why he read the Part 9 document to the accused, even though he knew that the accused was not then fit to be interviewed. He said that the reading of the Part 9 document was a different process and that there was nothing inconsistent about this approach, a matter about which he was not asked any further questions to clarify his position.
	
	
	I accept that whilst it is consistent with the “Objects” of Part 9 (s 109(c) LEPRA) that the accused must understand the process required pursuant to s 122 of that Act, the requirement to understand the advice concerning the rights provided for in that section of the Act does involve some different considerations than the considerations to be had as to whether a person is in a condition to be interviewed about allegations which may elicit responses that could be used in evidence against the suspect. That having been said, clearly it would have been more prudent, given the fact the accused refused to sign the document, to re-read the document when he was deemed ready to be interviewed.
	
	
	In considering this aspect of the matter, I note that when the interview, the subject of objection, was conducted the interviewing police officers, whilst cautioning the accused, reminding him that he did not have to participate in the interview, that it would be recorded (etc) (Q9 – 17 of Exhibit 2), did not reiterate matters that are “recommended” to be raised at the outset of the interview such as confirming that he had been advised of his “Part 9 rights”: the right to contact a legal advisor, receive advice, have someone present if practicable, receive medical treatment etc. There was nothing sinister about this as the interviewing police were entitled to believe that the accused had been provided with that information, albeit at a time that he was considered to be, at least, “intoxicated”, even “heavily intoxicated”. In fact he had been provided with that information.
	
	
	The accused gave evidence that if advised of his rights to seek legal advice (at least) he would have exercised that right. I do not accept that evidence as evidencing his state of mind on 4 March 2013. That evidence is in my judgment an ex post facto reconstruction given that the accused claims no memory of being told his “rights” and thus must have no memory of what his thought processes were at the relevant time and having regard to what clearly was his clearly belligerent attitude to signing the “Caution and Part 9” document to which earlier reference was made.
	
	
	Further, when interviewed after 4.34pm he was asked what he remembered of the questioning that occurred at the time of his arrest he said … “Not really” …”I was a bit drunk” … (Q Do you remember parts of it, any of it) “That you said I raped or something, some shit to this bloody CS sheila”. This reflects memory of key details of that preliminary conversation which is not consistent with necessarily having no memory of what Leading Constable Fitzhenry had read about the “Part 9” document.
	
	
	It was apparent to Fitzhenry that the accused was an experienced drinker, no stranger to consuming large amounts of alcohol on a daily basis, sleeping rough with a rough and ready presentation. That the accused refused to sign the document and described it as, “that shit”, having agreed that he understood it, would have more reasonably reflected to the Custody Manager that the accused appreciated its import rather than not.
	
	
	Is so far as the quantity of alcohol claimed by the accused to have drunk in the 36 hours before in the course of the record of interview, 6-8 litres of “wine”, although, this is not inconsistent with histories contained within the medical records of the hospital for his admission on 4 March, the accused’s evidence on the voir dire was somewhat at odds with this detail from that period surrounding his arrest. His evidence on the voir dire was that he drank ‘port’ in casks, which I take to be fortified wine as it is sometimes described. Some of the medical records from early March refer to a history of drinking casks of “white wine”, although this may be a misunderstanding by the note taker. However, in his evidence he went into a great deal of detail about his pattern of drinking before his arrest, suggesting that on a typical day he would drink between 15 or 20 beers, being schooners of Victoria Bitter, and that he would buy ‘port’ to drink at night-time, drinking a schooner glass of port at night, usually if he was “going into the shakes”. Although he agreed he told the hospital that he had drunk between 6 to 8 litres of wine before his admission in early March 2013, he disputed that he said it was wine.
	
	
	Whether it be the history that he gave the hospital or the evidence he gave in court, I regard him as an unreliable historian, as was contemporaneously noted in the hospital notes, albeit I take it more directed at his capacity to give a history about medical matters. The problem is that the accused, who I accept at the relevant time was a heavy drinker, even an “alcoholic” as he was described by his counsel, was by definition an unreliable historian. As I pointed out to counsel in the course of submissions, one of the difficulties with his evidence now is that he is endeavouring to remember events that occurred in a blur of alcohol consumption, sporadic head injuries, homelessness and the like, which are highly unsatisfactory circumstances for generating accurate or reliable memories, as opposed to being able to recount things that he may have believed to be true or accurate or reliable, but which were in fact not. These last matters ultimately will be relevant to assessing the weight to be given to any admissions made by the accused on 4 March 2013, but are not relevant to the assessment of the probative value of that evidence (R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112, R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121).
	
	
	Although it is more relevant to the other grounds advanced on behalf the accused for seeking the exclusion of the record of interview, the issue of the accused demonstrating the “shakes”, or “Joe Blakes” as he perceptively described them, whilst consistent with him being a heavy drinker, is also consistent, given what he said in the interview and what he said in his evidence, with the accused withdrawing from the effects of alcohol, rather than directly from intoxication caused by the consumption of alcohol. In other words, on his own account his shakes were a manifestation of his condition after some hours of not drinking alcohol. He suggested in his evidence that he could get the shakes, sometimes up to 12 hours after cessation of the drinking of alcohol. I do not regard evidence of him having the shakes during the course of the interview or the observations of the police in that way as reflecting upon the extent of his intoxication at that time.
	
	
	This leads me to two other issues that were ventilated on behalf the accused. His counsel in the written submissions and in oral submissions gave the court a ‘lecture’ on absorption rates and elimination rates for alcohol, particularly after cessation of drinking. I am well aware of the literature and the expert opinions of pharmacologists and medical practitioners as to the fact that alcohol is absorbed into the blood and then eliminated respectively over periods of time, the peak rate sometimes occurring hours after the cessation of drinking. This is a common feature in PCA matters and dangerous driving causing death, or grievous bodily harm, matters and often a trap for drivers who go to bed have a sleep and then drive their cars still with alcohol in their bloodstream. The problem here is I do not have a reliable history from the accused as to the amount of alcohol he drank before he came into police custody, the rate of drinking, when he actually finished drinking, his body weight at the relevant time or other data that may lead to some comfortable conclusion as to the estimated range, as it must be, of absorption, and elimination of alcohol from the bloodstream based upon expert opinion. Not my calculation or that of counsel for the accused. The speculation by counsel about this matter is not supported by any expert evidence and even taking judicial notice, as I do, of the general topics discussed by counsel I could draw no conclusion that is of any assistance in this matter. Further, there is the issue of the accused’s tolerance of alcohol and whether the accused was a “functioning alcoholic”, not able to do justice to himself at any relevant time, or not. I referred to this earlier. That matter has to be assessed by reference to what is demonstrated by the most reliable evidence in the voir dire as to his condition and his state of mind, that is the contents of interview. This is a matter I will come back to shortly in dealing with the other grounds of objection.
	
	
	Ultimately, in relation to the first round of objection, taking into account the warnings given to the accused at the commencement of the interview, the evidence of Leading Senior Constable Fitzhenry and the contemporaneous documentation, including the Part 9 document, whilst I accept that there was impropriety in failing to revisit the issue and re-reading of that document, I am not satisfied that the evidence the subject of objection, that is the interview conducted from 4:34pm onwards on 4 March 2013 was relevantly “obtained” by that impropriety, or in consequence of it. It is possible that the accused may have sought legal advice, or taken heed of other matters, that may have delayed the interview or even prevented interview from occurring, but I am not satisfied that probably would have happened. It would involve drawing a speculative inference in the face of the attitude of the accused throughout the interview of confidence and willingness to speak.
	
	
	Even if the relevant causal relationship between the impropriety and the obtaining of the evidence was established in my view the prosecution has established that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence that was obtained in the way in which that evidence was obtained.
	
	
	In this regard I have taken into account the probative value of the evidence, the importance of the evidence, the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, the fact that the contravention of was reckless, the difficulty of obtaining the evidence without the impropriety, amongst other matters. In this regard the impropriety has to be assessed in the context of the fact that the accused had the rights read to him and he deliberately chose not to sign the Part 9 document, reflecting a presence of mind, notwithstanding his intoxication. The probative value of the evidence is significant, and of course it is important in the proceedings. Although I accept that the importance of the evidence may emphasis the significance of the impropriety complained of being a particular case. The rights of the accused will in my view be of paramount importance if they have been deliberately sublimated in order to obtain evidence that could not be obtained without cavalier action on the part of the investigators. This is not the case here, as the presentation of the accused in the interview and the character of the complaint made on his behalf in this trial clearly shows.
	
	
	No issue has been raised on behalf of the accused as to the significance of a claimed history of ‘mental illness’ and his use of medication to treat its symptoms. There is, I hasten to say, no evidence of “psychosis” or paranoia in his presentation during the interview.
	
	
	As to the other grounds advanced on behalf the accused concerning ss 85, 90 of the Act, to which I earlier referred, I take into account all that has been put by the accused in the written submissions and oral submissions. The resolution of these matters, in the context of earlier findings to which I have referred, is largely determined by the presentation of the accused in the course of the interview and what actually happened in the interview. I made some reference to these matters to the counsel for the Crown in her submissions on this topic.
	
	
	I refer to some of those matters now. At an early stage of the interview, even before he was cautioned again, he referred to “black fellas … standing behind me”. He then quickly said, “I’m mucking around” (Q, 5 and 6). This is one of many instances of a sharp presence of mind. He provided a number of such instances of presence of mind, volunteering information that showed an awareness of what the interview was about, such as his answer at Q 48, his lengthy explanation of his contact with the complainant in a number of questions and answers, the information he provided that accorded with aspects of the Crown case as I understand it, his construction of events in a deliberate fashion, which he now says in his evidence on the voir dire are not true (such as his claims of consumption of ice, Q 180) and his description of the effect upon him of ice (Q 177, smiling at the same time). Sometimes he repeated questions that have been put to him, such as his in answer to Q 88, showing a clear awareness of the detail in the question and showed his capacity to assert that he remembered in the course of having sex with the complainant biting her on the “tits”, but not biting her “to bite her nipples off” (Q156 – 160). This last matter is a matter of small detail from 10 months before which is confirmed, potentially, by the DNA investigations undertaken.
	
	
	The written and oral submissions of the accused suggested that his memory of the relevant events being “a couple” or “over two” years before speak of his “unreliability”, not in the probative value sense, but reflecting upon his state of mind at the time of the interview. The fact that he, in some respects, is a poor historian as a general rule, both then and now, must be taken into account as a contextual matter. But vagueness as to timing of events has to be weighed against some of the precision of detail provided by the accused reflecting a presence of mind that demonstrates his capacity to understand the questions asked and to give a coherent relevant answer. Furthermore, his misuse of language the subject of submission on occasions is outweighed in its significance and incidence by the accuracy of his language. In any event, one such example relied upon by the defence (Q 37), his use of the word “sobrietly” (sic), does not to my mind reflect so much his intoxication, but more his inherent capacity for articulation. The question he was answering was, “Are you able to have this conversation with us?”. His answer was, “Yes, I am able to have this sobrietly with youse”. The misuse of the word in this context speaks more of his lack of education than his level of intoxication, having regard to his manner of expression throughout the interview and the context in which the words were used.
	
	
	That answer is relevant to other parts of the interview where the police officers were checking as to his capacity to be interviewed given that he was highly intoxicated four hours before. After being cautioned and told that there would be a recorded interview, denying there was any threat, promise or offer of advantage offered to him, agreeing that he had told the police that he had had a lot of alcohol, telling them that he did not want the DVD of the interview, telling the police that they had not done anything wrong relating to the injuries to his face, in fact, laughing about the matter when it was suggested by the police that they had not done anything to contribute to his injuries, that had “happen(ed) outside the police station” (Q 33 – 34) and telling the police that he needed to have a drink in due course to stop “the Joe Blakes” (Q 35); he told the police that he was “a bit drunk” earlier in the day when they had spoken to him, but remembered the essence of what they had spoken about, that is, “That you said I raped or something, some shit to this bloody CS shiela”. This was in fact the essence of what he was spoken to at the hospital. He went on to say “she’s a slut” (Q 42). When asked if he was going to remember the conversation, “You are having with us now” (Q 43), he said, “Yeah. I’m sober now”. He also said that he didn’t want the DVD because, “I’ve got no implement to use it on” (Q 44). He then supplied the answers to Q 46 – 48, volunteering information particularly pertinent to what he understood be the police investigation.
	
	
	When asked if he was in a “decent frame of mind” for talking to the police, at Q 51, he said, “I’m losing the plot now, I’m starting to get the shits”. It is clear that what he was referring to is not a state of mind, but the fact that he is annoyed at being held in custody and is anxious to get out and have another drink or have a cigarette and not be detained by the police. In fact, later in the interview he again showed his frustration at being detained as he was. It is clear that police were concerned that they establish that he was in a state to be interviewed (Q 55 – 56). In answer to the latter question. He said inter alia, “… I feel quite capable of being interviewed”. The police officer observed, as can be seen in the video interview as well, “You seem quite lucid now and your responses are quite clear, so if you are happy to continue (emphasis added), to which the accused responded ... ”I’m not, I’m not babblin’ on or crapping on”(Q 57).
	
	
	Thus, the interview continued for another 200 questions with various details provided by the accused with considerable precision, making it abundantly clear that anything that happened was consensual and part of the deal he had with the complainant of ‘sex for ice’. Now, this assertion can be completely untrue or “unreliable”, but it is not so because the accused was intoxicated, suffering from a mental illness or a physical injury which adversely affected him, such as to affect the truth of what he said. If his admissions are untruthful and or unreliable it was because he endeavoured to create a scenario that was exculpatory, even if he was endeavouring to recount events that he could not remember. Not because of his then current state at the time of interview, but because of his lifestyle in the intervening months.
	
	
	That he initially asserted the relevant events took place at a different park than that which the evidence reveals was the location of the alleged sexual assaults, that there is independent evidence to establish that the complainant did not walk back to the King’s Cross area with him after any sexual activity and finished or that he gave other incorrect details concerning the timing of the event do not appear to be causally related to his condition, physically or mentally, at the time of the interview, having regard to the manner in which he provided these details and the relationship of those details he volunteered to the questions that were asked of him. The prosecution has all things considered satisfied the Court that the circumstances in which the representations were made by the accused during the interview was such as to make it unlikely that the truth of any admissions was a adversely affected. If admissions made by the accused were untrue and there was a reasonable possibility that was because the accused was spinning a story to exculpate himself from the allegations being made of sexual assault of the complainant this would be a matter to be considered in assessing what weight could be given to any relevant admission and whether in fact a relevant admission proved a particular matter for which the prosecution bears the onus.
	
	
	I have further concluded that it is not unfair to the accused to admit the evidence of the representations he made during the interview, particularly having regard to the checks made by the interviewing police during the early part of the interview to ascertain whether the accused felt he was able continue (s90 of the Act: cf Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46, at [56] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. It was the accused who persuaded the police to continue the interview as his answers to many of the questions up until Q57 show. However, when the interview got to the point where a 10 minute break was taken for the accused to have a cigarette the accused clearly indicated that he had had enough of the questioning and he did not wish to be question any further. After the break no attempt was made to ascertain the genuinely wish to continue, to remind him that he need not answer any questions unless he wished or even to re-cap on what had happened during the break. I hasten to say there is absolutely no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the police during that break, but Detective Duckworth conceded that it would have been “prudent” to ask particular questions of the accused after the break to ascertain that it was proper to continue with questions concerning the subject matter of the investigation.
	
	
	As it turned out there were further questions, many of which were repetitive of earlier questioning with elements of attempting to draw the accused into supplying more information when it was clear by his body language and he spoken word that he was reluctant to continue to be interview. He asserted his unhappiness at how the interview had been dragged out and it is apparent on viewing the recording of the interview that he was becoming more or frustrated and showing more physical symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol. I note in this regard, of course, that two hours after the interview concluded an ambulance was in attendance at the police station. Ultimately to take the accused to hospital for treatment for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Thus, I propose to exercise the discretion available pursuant to s. 90 of the Act to exclude the second part of the interview conducted after the 10 minute break, that is from the resumption of the interview at Q. 266 onwards, with the exception of the questions asked of the accused at the conclusion of the interview by Leading Senior Constable Fitzhenry and any questions and answers after Q266 to be admitted by consent. This I indicated last Friday, 27 March at 2 pm

		20 January 2016",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766262,LJS v R [2015] NSWCCA 47,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: On 23 February 2012, Conlon DCJ sentenced the Applicant in respect of 12 sexual offences to which he had pleaded guilty. The effective sentence imposed was one of 10 years including a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months concluding on 13 July 2018.
	
	
	On 22 November 2012, his Honour sentenced the Applicant in respect of a further eight sexual offences to imprisonment for an effective period of 14 years including a non-parole period of 10 years both such periods commencing on 13 July 2018.
	
	
	The effective overall sentence was thus one of 21 years and 3 months including an effective non parole period of 17 years and 3 months.
	
	
	Annexed to these reasons is a summary of the offences with which his Honour was concerned and of the individual sentences imposed. The victims had a variety of relationships with the Applicant.
	
	
	The 12 offences dealt with by the decision of February 2012 were committed against eight victims and, with one exception, between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. One offence was committed in 2002. LB and SB were two children whose father had died. The Applicant boarded with the children and their mother for a number of months.
	
	
	SN and MN and RN were daughters of a friend of the Applicant. Their parents separated and the Applicant then moved into their home. KB and PB were children of a cousin of the Applicant. Their parents also separated and the Applicant would visit their home.
	
	
	DM (who was the subject of the offence committed in December 2002) commenced to live with her boyfriend at age 14. The boyfriend’s mother did not approve of this arrangement and DM went to live with the Applicant. On one occasion whilst she was staying with the Applicant, she awoke to him touching her breasts and inner thighs underneath her clothing.
	
	
	The eight offences dealt with in November 2012 involved four children, D, R, H and K, of a woman with whom the Applicant had a relationship and, prior to the fifth offence in the second indictment, to whom the Applicant was married. During the time during which the Applicant was abusing these children he made threats to them not to tell anyone what he was doing or he would cause them harm. The third and fourth offences on the second indictment, were committed in the presence of the children’s mother who masturbated the Applicant in the course of the third offence.
	
	
	The circumstances referred to in the immediately referred to paragraphs gave the Applicant access to the complainants mentioned. Some of the offences happened in their homes and some when the Applicant, who from time to time drove the children around, had access to them. The charges were representative. The Applicant was a regular offender against most, if not all of the above complainants. It was not suggested during the appeal that his Honour had taken into account the fact of uncharged acts inappropriately.
	
	
	The ground on which the Applicant seeks leave to appeal is that “the overall sentence and effective non-parole period are unreasonable or plainly unjust”. More specific complaints made on behalf of the Applicant in argument were that his Honour had wholly accumulated the effective later sentence on the earlier one, that the effective total non-parole period was approximately 81% of the effective total sentence and that, despite recognising that he should take into account sentencing patterns at the time of the offences, in the aggregate sentences he imposed, his Honour did not do so. There was no attack on the individual sentences.
	
	
	In his written submissions, counsel for the Applicant also pointed out that Conlon DCJ had imposed no non-parole period during the period 12 April 2019 (when that for offence 7 on the second indictment ended) and 13 July 2019 (when the sentence for count 8 on the second indictment commenced).
	
	
	In written submissions, counsel for the Crown asserted that Conlon DCJ had imposed no sentence with a non-parole period covering the period between 13 April 2018 and 12 July 2019 and went to observe that the sentences imposed by his Honour should be adjusted to rectify this.
	
	
	In fact, for counts 1 and 2 on the first indictment, Conlon DCJ imposed sentences of 3 years and 3 months including non-parole periods of 6 months from 14 January 2018 and in respect of count 7 on the second indictment his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of 9 months from 13 July 2018. The next commencing date – for the sentence imposed on count 8 on the second indictment – was 13 July 2019. Thus counsel for the Applicant was correct and counsel for the Crown wrong.
	
	
	There is no doubt that sentencing law and practices at the time of the Applicant’s offences were different from the present position and the Applicant was entitled to have taken into account the sentencing practice at the time of his offending – R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368; PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84; Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50
	
	
	That observation is subject to the proviso that the sentencing court is made aware of the previous sentencing practice and furthermore that since Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623, it has been clear that a non-parole period represents the minimum period of imprisonment required to be served by an offender having regard to all of the purposes of justice.
	
	
	Only limited material was put before Conlon DCJ as to the practice prevailing at the time of the Applicant’s offending. However, it is clear as Button J pointed out in Magnuson v R at [143] that the courts’ approach to questions of accumulation and concurrence was “more lax” prior to the High Court’s decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and that in about 1982 non-parole periods were commonly fixed at between a third and a half of total sentences. See AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 (2007); 169 A Crim R 32 at [39]; RWB v R [2008] NSWCCA 93; 184 A Crim R 453 at [36]; Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [9].
	
	
	The effective sentence imposed in November 2012 was fully accumulated on the effective non-parole period imposed in February of that year. It is unusual for that to occur without some adjustment of the ratio between non-parole periods and head sentences and his Honour gave no reason for doing what he did in that regard. The effect was to make a balance of term calculated in the course of setting one set of offences “do the work” for the totality of non-parole periods. On the other hand, the balance of term of 4 years as set is by no means a short period although again, his Honour gave no reason for adopting it.
	
	
	However, it is proper also to have regard to the fact that within each effective sentence there had already been a substantial degree of concurrency. Thus the simple aggregates of the non-parole periods and full terms imposed in February 2012 were respectively 15 years 3 months and 26 years 6 months, ie more than double the effective sentence imposed.
	
	
	The corresponding figures for the offences dealt with in November are 19 years 9 months and 32 years 3 months. As has been said, the effective sentence imposed in November was 14 years including a non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Against this complicated background the application of the sentencing practices of the past is by no means easy. Having regard to the number of victims and the magnitude of his criminality otherwise, it would not be appropriate to simply reduce the Applicant’s non-parole period to one-third to one-half of the 21 years and 3 months total sentence. On the other hand, the 81% of the effective total sentence that the effective non-parole period represents is so high that it argues for some reduction, particularly as Conlon DCJ gave no reasons for the result.
	
	
	The magnitude of the Applicant’s criminality argues against any reduction in his sentence and certainly if his offences had occurred in the recent past, I would not be disposed to make any reduction. However, to reflect in some measure the more lenient sentencing regime that prevailed at the time of the Applicant’s offending, I think that there should be some reduction in the effective non-parole period. Arguing in the same direction is the fact that the Applicant was prosecuted many years after his offending, notwithstanding that a number of his offences were reported to the Department of Community Services and police as long ago as 1979.
	
	
	The reduction should not be great otherwise the non-parole period would not adequately reflect his offending and accordingly, I would propose that the non-parole period be reduced to 15 years. The accumulation of sentences amounts to special circumstances sufficient to justify the proportion between 15 years and the length of the total sentence.
	
	
	So does the age of the Applicant – he was born in December 1947 - and the fact that he suffers health issues and that this is his first time in custody.
	
	
	I appreciate that to the victims, any reduction might seem inappropriate but it must be borne in mind that the severity of a jail sentence is not simply proportionate to its length. As Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306, “a sentence of 5 years is more than 5 times as severe as a sentence of 1 year.” See also R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159: [2006] NSWCCA 381; Gore v R [2010] NSWCCA 330.
	
	
	While the delay in his charging and conviction was likely to have been of benefit to the Applicant, he presently has to face the very real prospect of never being released from custody.
	
	
	The Court should also remedy Conlon DCJ’s error in leaving a gap in the non-parole periods he imposed. The orders proposed below will achieve both of these purposes. In formulating them I acknowledge that there is a greater degree of concurrency of some sentences than is usual. However, the complexity of the sentencing exercise makes that course, rather than an alternate one that would have the same result, permissible.
	
	
	The result will be that the Applicant will be serving non-parole periods that in combination extend from 14 April 2011 to 13 April 2026 and a balance of term that extends to 13 April 2032.
	
	
	Accordingly I propose:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Conlon DCJ on 23 February 2012.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed by Conlon DCJ on 23 February 2012.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed for counts 3, 5, 6 and 7 by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012.
	
	
	Allow the appeal against the sentences imposed for counts 1, 2, 4, and 8 by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012 and quash those sentences.
	
	
	In respect of count 8 dealt with by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012, sentence the Applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 13 April 2019 together with an additional term of 18 months commencing on 13 April 2021.
	
	
	In respect of count 4 dealt with by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012, sentence the Applicant to a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 13 April 2022 together with an additional term of 2 years commencing on 13 April 2026.
	
	
	In respect of count 1 dealt with by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012, sentence the Applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 13 April 2024 together with an additional term of 12 months commencing on 13 April 2026.
	
	
	In respect of count 2 dealt with by Conlon DCJ on 22 November 2012 sentence the Applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 13 April 2024 together with an additional term of 6 years commencing on 13 April 2026.
	
	
	Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant shall be eligible for parole, 13 April 2026.
	


Addendum


	
	Subsequent to the publication of the above reasons, the Corrective Services Department drew to the Court's attention that after Conlon DCJ sentenced the Applicant on 22 November 2012, his Honour changed the sentence he had imposed in respect of count 7 on the second indictment by changing the term of imprisonment to one of 12 months, thus eliminating the gap in the non-parole period referred to in [13] above.
	
	
	Order 4 of this Court's orders of 31 March 2015 deals with the sentence his Honour imposed for that count 7 and in terms which make it irrelevant whether the term of imprisonment ordered by Conlon DCJ was 9 or 12 months.  Order 6 made by this Court sentences the Applicant to imprisonment for a period that encompasses the time immediately following the term, whether it be 9 or 12 months of the sentence Conlon DCJ imposed for that count 7.
	
	
	Accordingly, none of the orders made by this Court needs adjustment in consequence of the information recently provided.

		15 May 2015",2015-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766286,R v ROBLERO [2015] NSWDC 310,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Nestor Sanchez Roblero, appears today for sentence in relation to a charge to which he pleaded guilty in this Court, that alleged that he on 2 January 2014 at Sydney, imported a substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, the quantity imported being a commercial quantity, contrary to subs 307.1(1) Criminal Code (Commonwealth).
	
	
	The offence to which he pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine if $825,000. The prisoner has been in custody since his arrest on 2 January 2014 at Sydney Airport. All time served in custody will be taken into account in the sentence that I have foreshadowed to the prisoner.
	
	
	The bald facts in relation to this matter are relatively straightforward. The prisoner, who is a United States’ citizen, flew to Australia from Los Angeles. He was in possession of two bags, a small black luggage bag and a black backpack. These bags he carried with him onto the plane and had with him on his arrival in Australia.
	
	
	The statement of facts prepared by the officers of the learned Director of Public Prosecutions set out a lot of detail about the filling in of the incoming passenger card and other matters which I need not dilate upon, save for just pointing out several matters that were disclosed by him. Naturally, he marked the box which gave him an opportunity to declare his possession of illegal drugs and other illegal substances, “no”. I have never heard of a person bringing drugs into the country ticking the incoming passenger card and indicating that he or she was in fact carrying illicit substances. Be that as it may, he disclosed in the course of the matter, that he had bought his ticket to travel to Australia the day before and he indicated that he was planning to stay in Australia for eight days for a “holiday”, staying in Sydney.
	
	
	His two bags were the subject of x-ray examination and items were identified as being concealed within the bags. Tests were undertaken and those tests produced results that were indicative of the presence of either cocaine and/or methamphetamine, in the bag. Physical examination of the bag ultimately revealed, as I understand it, four packages in each piece of hand luggage, making eight packages in all, wrapped in layers of carbon paper, plastic and sealed with what was described as silver “gaffa” tape. The items so enclosed, contained methamphetamine.
	
	
	Customs officers contacted the Australian Federal Police. The prisoner was interviewed. Various items were seized from him. Again, they are listed in great detail on the facts, but these items included relevantly, some cameras, a hotel booking confirmation document, two visa debit cards, a driver’s licence in his name, a laptop, a mobile phone and approximately $1,270 in US currency. The prisoner had a booking at a hotel near Sydney Airport which had been made on 30 December 2014, local time, and was booked into that hotel for five days, the booking ending on 7 January 2014.
	
	
	The prisoner was interviewed in a record of interview, apparently, as I understand it, with the aid of an interpreter, who interpreted what was said over the telephone. The prisoner is originally from Mexico and I will deal with the circumstances of his travel to the United States to become a citizen, shortly. His primary language is Spanish although he is functional in English, as I understand it. He said, amongst other things, in the course of this interview, that he was to be paid between $3 - $4,000 for bringing the items within the bags into Australia. He was asked by a person called Jorge to import the bags and this person had once been his, “best friend”. This person was the person who had made the relevant reservations and the prisoner indicated, in the course of this interview, that he was given three days’ notice of the trip and he referred to being given $600 for expenses, to assist him to keep Jorge advised of what was going on.
	
	
	The packages were obviously subject to proper scientific examination and the total net weight of pure amphetamine was 3.571 kilograms with an average purity of between 79.1 and 80.3%. The total weight of the substance, I am advised, with add mixtures, was 4.476 kilograms. The wholesale value of the net weight of the drug at that purity is estimated to range from between 895,000 to $1.119 million. The approximate street value is estimated to be between $3.133 million and $3.58 million.
	
	
	The facts reveal the fact that there were checks being made to chase up the prisoner from overseas but no success has been obtained in identifying the source of those enquiries, the owner of the relevant phone service and the like. In any event, it would seem that the phone numbers, that can be identified are registered under false names as would be expected.
	
	
	The prisoner, having been arrested on that day, offered, as I understand it, on that day, to assist the Australian Federal Police undertake a controlled operation. He used an Australian Federal Police mobile phone to contact people who he believed were concerned with the importation and made numerous phone calls in an endeavour to identify the intended recipients of the border controlled drugs. Ultimately, nobody was contacted and no controlled operation could be undertaken. He was, however, through his assistance, timely as it was in the endeavours that he made, able to provide information, at least from, I would understand it, Australian Federal Police enquiries, of the names of persons of interest involved in drug importation overseas and an Australian mobile phone number that linked another person of interest to the importation. He formulated a response so as not to alert other people of the interests of the Australian Federal Police and provided what was described as, “limited information”, about his role/recruitment. He also provided other information in respect of contacts in the United States, that I need not dilate upon.
	
	
	He made admissions against interest although they were not described as, “full admissions”. He sought to provide, it was said, an honest account of how he was procured and his actions leading up to the importation. As it transpired, his evidence in this Court which I will refer to in a moment, departed somewhat from the accounts that are set out in the recorded interviews he gave the Australian Federal Police. I do not have a precise record of any other information he gave the Australian Federal Police. The level of assistance was assessed at a medium level but ultimately, its value was assessed as a, “low” level, presumably on the basis that the information did not lead to any arrests. The trail of relevant people has gone cold.
	
	
	The Australian Federal Police advised through the learned Director of Public Prosecution officers that the prisoner has no prior convictions in the United States or Australia at this point and he was self-employed in the United States as a machine operator and handyman in San Diego, California, a major city of the West Coast, not too far from the Mexican border. He has a wife and son living with him in San Diego.
	
	
	In relation to the evidence he gave in this Court, relevant to the facts as I am required to find them, he gave a body of evidence in respect of the circumstances of his recruitment. It is worthwhile recapping on some aspects of that evidence. Some might be seen as concerned with subjective matters but in a sense, it provides a context for my fact finding.
	
	
	The prisoner told the Court that the details he gave the psychologist about his background, in the report, were true and I will come back to some of those matters shortly. He himself is not a drug user. He said his recruitment to import these drugs arose from an approach from a childhood friend who had initially requested him to provide building plans for houses and buildings in earthquake and tsunami zones for Australian clients. He said, in his evidence, that he undertook various designs on the basis that initially he understood he was being asked to travel to Australia to meet with builders and engineers and the like.
	
	
	When he got to Los Angeles however, he was told that he was not going to Australia for this purpose. He was going for another purpose. A purpose that, on his account, was not made entirely clear to him. He had brought his own suitcase to the airport but he was required to transfer his clothing, or such that he could fit, into two other apparently smaller cases - the two bags that he was arrested with - and was presented with these bags at the airport.
	
	
	These bags apparently contained the secreted drugs that were ultimately imported. He said he was told at Los Angeles Airport, the booking having been made for his flight and the like, that if he did not cooperate, his family would be killed and he was told that his family were being watched. He said he felt afraid and he had no option to go and he said, although I will allow for some looseness of translation, that he, “might be paid 3,000 to $4,000”, for his involvement in this matter. He claimed he had no financial difficulties at the time by reference to some bank records that were produced. He expressed his regret for what he had done and said he felt sad, realising the damage that was done to people by the use of drugs. I accept that expression of contrition on his part, although I do not accept all of the evidence that he gave.
	
	
	He said that whilst he was in custody, he had been in regular “employment”, such as it is offered in custody. He also gave evidence that in the United States he did volunteer work for the last five or six years helping Mexican immigrants and others trying to enter the United States or perhaps crossing the border, illegally as I would understand it, and finding themselves in difficulty in dessert and otherwise unoccupied areas of southern California and Arizona. He would go out regularly at 7pm on a Friday evening, to work on weekends, on his own time, to provide material assistance to others less fortunate than him and there is documentary evidence to support that fact. He also produced some photographic evidence which confirmed this activity on his part, in my view.
	
	
	The Crown cross examined him and took him to a number of questions and answers that he gave in the interview to the police that was produced to me, particularly between question 77 and 86. In that section of the interview, he gave an account which in my view, is materially different from the account given in the history to the psychologist and in his evidence in this Court. In that interview, he made no mention of being approached about bringing designs of buildings to Australia, initially, and in fact he gave an account of being approached to import the drugs, two or three days before left. Or, it would appear to me, that that was the interpretation open on the basis of what he said in the interview. He also gave a different account, in his evidence in this Court, as to how he came into possession of the bags and how they packed. I refer particularly to questions 110 to 115. The answers he gave to questions 162 to 164 of the interview, upon which he was cross examined, were fundamentally at odds with the account he gave in this Court of becoming aware of the importation of the drugs, or the possibility or probability of that, on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport.
	
	
	During the course of the interview with police he did reveal the fact that he had been threatened and had fears for his family. Although in cross examination he was unable to articulate specific threat that had been made, in my view. His account in his evidence was he thought that he was bringing something into Australia that was illegal, that he knew that it was “something like” drugs and he knew that it was a, “very serious offence”. He was questioned also by the learned Crown Prosecutor about questions 106 to 109, concerning the threats that he disclosed in the interview on 2 January that had been made to him, giving what would seem at first blush, to be contradictory answers about the nature of his relationship with Jorge despite Jorge allegedly threatening his family.
	
	
	It is very difficult to accept the account given by the prisoner concerning the circumstances in which he became aware that he was coming to Australia to do an illegal act. The account he gave in the history to the psychologist and in this evidence does not accord in fundamental ways with the account he gave when interviewed at the airport. That account would suggest he was aware that he was doing something illegal several days before he left the United States and he provided no particular details of the full circumstances that he now claims.
	
	
	To some extent this is a little baffling. He had asserted from the outset that he had been threatened and feared for his family when first arrested and there could well be an element of truth in this. But he gave an account in Court which in its terms seems inherently unlikely. That is, that he was initially approached to come to Australia, a country without earthquakes and tsunamis as a general rule, and provide plans for building earthquake and tsunami-proof housing or buildings. On the other hand, he appears to be a man of industry and honesty with a social conscience. Ironically, it seems to me, if his account on sentence remained as asserted on his arrest, the fact of threatening him may have been more inherently believable. I cannot accept it on balance in the detail that has been provided in these proceedings.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that at the time he was interviewed at the airport he had obviously been awake a long period of time. It is a very lengthy flight from the United States, he said it was about 18 hours. I am mindful of the fact that in the initial interview, the recording of his conversations with Customs officers there was no interpreter present although he does appear to speak English to them. But I appreciate there could be things lost in translation.
	
	
	I am also very mindful of the difficulties of an interpreter providing interpretative services by telephone. The prisoner himself said he was confused when he was being interviewed in the more formal interview after his arrest. I appreciate in those circumstances some element of confess and avoid would be a natural instinct by someone such as the prisoner, caught out as he was. Ultimately I cannot be satisfied relevantly that elements of non-exculpatory duress, as it was urged for the Court to conclude in this matter, arise as were discussed in the decision of Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215, particularly at [30]-[54] per Johnson J.
	
	
	I do not propose to analyse that decision. The decision speaks for itself. But it is fairly said that Johnson J properly pointed out that such claims of non-exculpatory duress must be approached by courts with some degree of circumspection. He confirmed in that judgment the availability of this matter as a mitigating factor. However, he also made observations about the fact that in sentencing persons who succumb to non-exculpatory duress the issue of general deterrence are still significant, or play a “very substantial role” in such matters. He said:
	


“The grooming and pressuring of persons to become involved in drug importation offences have been said to be ‘unremarkable features of many importation cases’....at times, the persons targeted by those recruiting them are said to have submissive or compliant personalities.”


	
	The assessment of the various considerations that he cites from high English authority and Victorian Court of Appeal authority “pull in different directions”, as is often the case in sentencing.
	
	
	If I may deal with the issue of non-exculpatory duress in the context of the submissions that were made, whilst it was submitted that the accused was influenced by non-exculpatory duress, it was submitted that his financial records suggested that he had no financial problems and thus it might be more readily found by the Court that there must have been some external pressure other than the usual one of financial need.
	
	
	One of the difficulties with that submission is that the financial records produced by the prisoner, which I will come back to later, do not speak convincingly of the prisoner being in a very solid or solid financial position at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	Another matter that arose from the evidence that I have summarised is the issue of his cooperation with the authorities. His counsel submitted in oral and written submissions that the cooperation was timely, which is true, in fact very timely, and that he should be entitled to a substantial discount for his past cooperation although it was not successful. It was submitted in relation to the plea of guilty and the cooperation, as I understood the submission, that I could afford the accused a discount in the range of 25%, 12.5% for the facilitation of the course of justice by the plea of guilty and 12.5% for the past cooperation of the prisoner.
	
	
	I pause for a moment in relation to that aspect of the matter to note, and it was hardly the subject of challenge, that in relation to the issue of the plea of guilty the prisoner was committed for trial. Although he waived a committal, the trial was listed on 13 June 2014, the Crown was granted an extension of time to file an indictment on 25 July 2014 and on 24 November 2014 there was an indication of a plea of guilty. The matter was adjourned for a statement of facts and the plea of guilty ultimately entered on 28 November with the matter listed for trial on 24 November. I pause for a moment to note I appreciate the way in which trials are listed in this complex that trials may be listed on a Monday but it may take some time for appropriate negotiation to take place and I draw no conclusion adverse to the prisoner from the fact that the plea of guilty was entered four days after the trial was fixed to start.
	
	
	It seems to me, with respect, in relation to the plea of guilty, taking into account everything said by counsel, bearing in mind that it is a discretionary matter and there is some authority that suggests that the Court need not necessarily grant a plea of guilty discount to reflect the facilitation of the course of justice. In accordance with general sentencing practice that can be imported into the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders and having regard to the range of discounts that are available in various circumstances such as were discussed in the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton from 1999 which is strictly only applicable to ‘State’ sentencing I should accord the prisoner a discount of 10% for the plea of guilty on the basis I have outlined.
	
	
	As is acknowledged in the detailed written submissions which I will come to at a later time in respect of other matters, pursuant to s 16A(2) Crimes Act 1914 the Court is required to have regard, in subpara (h), the degree to which a person has cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or other offences. This particular matter is of course the subject of particular submission by the Crown who would have anticipated matters being raised in respect of the prisoner’s cooperation and this is a matter specifically addressed in the written submissions of the defence.
	
	
	The Crown concedes that a discrete quantifiable discount may be provided for cooperation where it is appropriate to do so and cites a number of authorities with which I am well familiar that deal with this matter. They include, Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, one of the early judgments relating to discounts for cooperation, and more recently decisions such as El Hani, in which the late Paul Byrne SC appeared ([2004] NSWCCA 162), particularly in the judgment of Beazley P, and of course the decision of R v Joseph Sukkar (2006) 172 A Crim R 151. Another judgment cited in the Crown submissions includes the decision of R v SZ (2007) 168 A Crim R 249.
	
	
	In relation to the matter I am very mindful of the decision of Sukkar because I was the judge at first instance whose discount to Mr Sukkar was reduced, properly so I hasten to say, on the grounds that I was somewhat over generous in quantifying it. He gave evidence in relation to overseas offenders but one of the features of the matter that was relevant in the consideration of his discount, as I calculated, it was the absence of evidence of any hardships in custody arising out of that cooperation.
	
	
	The Crown in its submissions at pp 12 - 13 and the top of 14 set out a number of general principles in regard to this issue. But one matter that is relevant, aside from assessing the practical value of the assistance, its timeliness and the like, is the issue of the impact upon the offender required to serve a term of imprisonment having provided relevant cooperation or offering to provide cooperation in the future. There is no evidence here of any hardships in custody for the prisoner. In fact, what I have said about this matter is probably not otherwise in the public domain. I trust it would not further be extended to the public domain. I propose should this judgment find its way into the electronic recording of the Court’s judgments, not all of our judgments of course are so recorded, to excise any reference to the matters set out in the letter I received from the AFP.
	
	
	Ultimately, I have concluded that there should be some discount to reflect the timeliness of the cooperation. I accept that it was genuine cooperation which is to be taken into account as an additional matter relevant to the assessment of the contrition and remorse of the prisoner which, as I said, I also accept as genuine. It could be said, although there was not a well-developed argument in relation to this matter, that his cooperation at the time of his arrest may be supportive evidence of his claims of coercion. But, as I said, one of the difficulties with his claims of coercion or duress was the conflict between the initial account he gave and the account he has given subsequently.
	
	
	I have concluded in all the circumstances notwithstanding that the ultimate value of his cooperation was “low” the timeliness of it and the “medium” assessment of it requires a discount of 5% in combination with the discount for the plea of guilty.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the prisoner being a United States citizen with no ties to Australia and the difficulties arising from the tyranny of distance, even with electronic means of communication, the prisoner’s legal advisers have produced an interesting and very strong subjective case in the context of the prisoner being a person without criminal convictions at the age of 56. I appreciate, of course, that people who are recruited to bring drugs into the country are usually recruited because they do not have prior criminal convictions. There is no point turning up at Sydney Airport with drugs in your bag if you have got prior convictions for supplying or importing drugs somewhere else in the world that can easily be researched here in Australia.
	
	
	Be that as it may, and allowing for that line of authority that says that good character may have lesser weight in offences of this seriousness and of this character, given the types of people that commit them, I acknowledge that there is some considerable strength in the subjective case as a relevant matter.
	
	
	I have referred to his voluntary work with a non-profit organisation assisting Mexican people particularly who have either entered the United States illegally or are otherwise in straightened circumstances. He also has a reference from a church group which indicates his support for Mexican people providing gifts and distributing gifts to Mexican people in Mexico over the Christmas period for some period of time.
	
	
	All this evidence demonstrates, as I said earlier, that the prisoner is a community-minded person. I am satisfied ultimately that he is not involved in criminal activity in the United States, even “beneath the radar”. He has generally lived a blameless life until this unfortunate involvement for him in the commission of this most serious crime. He has produced a number of references from professional and business people as to his work as a builder handyman and he is variously described as being industrious, reliable, hardworking and ethical, conducting his business in a very satisfactory manner.
	
	
	His clients highly recommend him to others. His reported involvement in what one referee called “unauthorised activities” in Australia is described as “a real shock” and “completely out of character” in the view of that person. That would appear on balance to be the truth.
	
	
	In assessing the account that he gave to this Court of how he was recruited as I said a moment ago it must be said that a person of his character with his background of community service and his selflessness is a somewhat surprising candidate to be involved in conduct of this type. In one way the explanation he gave of his arrival in Australia, that is being subjected to pressure being put upon him, would seem to be the only reason that he would agree to do this. I cannot be satisfied of non-exculpatory duress on balance, but I accept that the pressure upon him or pressure being placed upon him at some stage remains a real possibility. One does not have to have too much worldly experience to understand that for one reason or another if someone falls in with organised crime groups that are responsible for these importations that one must appreciate that there are risks involved for one’s personal safety if one is unsuccessful.
	
	
	Many years ago I appeared for a man called Lara Gomez, a Columbian citizen who had Australian citizenship who came from Colombia to warehouse 100 kilograms of cocaine, then the largest single shipment of cocaine. He was arrested in Australia, a man with no prior criminal convictions. He was a very gifted artist. On the day that he was arrested, or a day later, in Colombia the man that recruited him was shot dead in his restaurant. Retribution and revenge can be swift for those who fail to perform their duty properly. I bear that in mind. Whether the prisoner faces retribution on his return to the United States is something however I cannot confidently speculate about; I would trust not.
	
	
	There is a psychologist’s report which sets out his history, which I referred to earlier. Some of it I will reflect upon. He adopted it in his evidence and it was not challenged. He was one of six children born in Mexico and his parents grew up in a rural area and were obviously quite poor people. He had a very good childhood however. His parents did their best to provide for him although he had limited education. He worked with his family on a family farm and initially moved to the city at about the age of 14 or 15 to try and find work ultimately finding opportunities to learn about building and carpentry and working machinery, which gave him the expertise to move into the construction industry and home maintenance which he has been involved in in the United States.
	
	
	He moved to California in 1991. He has been married twice. His second wife and he have an 18 year old son. He is a religious man. I accept that he is a hard worker and seeks to provide for his family. He had a serious motor vehicle accident in 1998 but ultimately there appear to be no major residual effects. He has no drug dependency, although that is not a matter in mitigation, one must say, when a person is responsible for bringing a substantial sum of drugs into the country which can damage those who use the drugs. There is no indication of any antisocial personality. He has no history of mental illness or psychological distress. Since he was arrested he has regarded the event as “shocking” but is resigned to his fate, saying as I quote the psychologist report, “whatever God wants I accept”. He is making the very best of a very difficult situation for him and largely keeps to himself in custody.
	
	
	The cognitive testing, a significant or important part of a psychological report, achieved a score that placed him in the low average range of ability, but the result was seen as probably affected by his limited schooling. He had used his cognitive abilities well, it was said, given his strong employment history. The psychologist viewed the prisoner as not presenting any particular risk factors for recidivism, which I accept. He has a pro social lifestyle, has stability in his own community, or certainly did so until involved in this event, and explains his involvement in the offence by coercion and fear of harm to his family. He is occupied in the custodial setting. He has functional English, as I said, which will assist him; his English no doubt will improve in the next few years. There are no particular concerns expressed by the psychologist in terms of his future management.
	
	
	The prisoner produced some financial records, to which I earlier referred, relating to his financial circumstances, as I understand it, immediately before his arrest in relation to the current matter. It was suggested that those figures represented a picture that suggested there was no financial motive at work or financial pressure at the time the prisoner committed the offence.
	
	
	I accept the prisoner was not destitute based on the evidence of his background and I accept that the picture emerging from the bank records confirms that too, but it must be said that his financial circumstances at the time of his arrest, judging from these bank records, were very modest. He had a balance in his checking account just short of $2,000 and had about $18,000 odd in some form of superannuation or investment fund.
	
	
	I remark on the fact that the prisoner is 56 years of age. He lives in a rental property, according to the history he has given, with his wife and children. Of course I do not have any evidence of what chattels he owns. I assume he owns a motor vehicle and he has other property in the form of chattels but there is no evidence of any other major assets. Whilst the financial picture presented to the Court does not suggest any major debts it must be said of course banking records would not represent any record of any particular debt unless there was some deposits or withdrawals relevant to a mortgage or some banking loan. I cannot exclude the existence of debts being a motivation for this offending and certainly on his own version he was to receive a modest amount of money for the trouble he went to here. He was also provided with a trip to Australia and provided with money to meet some of his expenses, which has to be taken into account as a benefit for him.
	
	
	I earlier indicated by reference to the conclusions in respect of the matters concerning non exculpatory duress that I did not discount the background of the possibility of some fear the prisoner had arising out of his involvement in the current matter. As I have pointed out, the price of failure can be terrible on occasions, as these courts know. As much as I found the prisoner’s account baffling, perhaps troubling in some respects although not necessarily in criticism of the prisoner, it is to be fairly said that it is also baffling for a person with this man’s background to find himself in this situation. To a large extent his real purpose of his involvement in this matter remains essentially unexplained. I accept on balance that there is the risk of some ramifications for the prisoner on his return to the United States but not necessarily arising out of matters I have taken into account.
	
	
	Of course I accept that the prisoner had no control over what was going to happen to the drugs that he imported into the country. It is obvious to me that he had no say in operational matters relating to the drugs. I am very mindful of the authorities that deal with the assessment of the person’s role and one is cautioned against rushing to judgment in relation to these matters. I particularly have regard of course to the leading authority on this matter, the decision of R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54.
	
	
	I have concluded, and it would not appear to be substantially disputed by the Crown, that the prisoner was effectively a “courier” who brought into the country a substantial quantity of drugs within the range of quantities that are commercial quantities although of course at a lower end of the scale. The scale of offending in this regard is extensive by reference to quantity of drugs. The prisoner was a courier who would be paid money for his involvement in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The submissions of the defence related to the matters that leapt from the way in which the case was conducted on the evidence. Although in the written submissions of learned counsel for the accused there were many other submissions about technical matters and legal issues, factual issues, that I have taken into account.
	
	
	The Crown also provided, as the Director of Public Prosecutions always does, extensive written submissions reflecting upon many principles that are not in dispute although matters of degree of course are always to be considered. The Crown’s oral submissions were that if the prisoner did not know that it was a border controlled drug there was a high degree of recklessness, with which I agree. It is submitted that the account given by the prisoner of threats made to him was not credible. I have already dealt with that matter. It was also submitted that the circumstances of his custody were not such as to create any particular hardship, it being submitted that there was hardship to third parties, a matter I will come back to in a moment.
	
	
	I was referred to a Victorian Court of Appeal decision, a judgment of Justice Neave, in Lau v R [2011] VSCA 324, at [24]-[27], that whilst recklessness was not a mitigating factor the presence of knowledge or intention is “an aggravating factor”. I find that something of a startling assertion. I would have thought for myself that the issue of knowledge and/or recklessness was part of the factual matrix one took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. Whether these matters can be categorised as “mitigating” or “aggravating” matters may be a matter of semantics. Certainly in this matter, on the evidence available to me, I agree there was a high degree of recklessness but, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew the actual drug that he was bringing into the country or knew the precise quantity. It was obviously secreted and he did not secrete it. I accept that aspect of the version that he gave to the Court.
	
	
	The Crown, in its oral submissions, pointed out it was in the context of a courier coming through airport barriers, a large importation with very high value and the prisoner had been entrusted with valuable “cargo”. It must be said in relation to that submission that it is a general circumstance in these matters that whilst the courier takes the risks, the people that organise these importations take a risk too that the courier will not disclose the importation out of fear or concern for the consequences when the courier comes into the country; so there is a matter of mutual trust to be considered.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Crown particularly that the making of threats to the prisoner might have been counterproductive because it might prompt someone to more readily disclose to the authorities in the United States or Australia that he was carrying an illegal substance, so as to minimise the ultimate punishment that would need to be imposed. To my mind that argument is an argument of some power.
	
	
	With regard to the sentencing of the prisoner I note particular matters that the Crown has referred to and seem to me are not in dispute from the defence. I take into account the entire time spent in custody. I note the formulation of Justice Adams in R v Karan [2013] NSWCCA 53, having regard to the assessment of the objective facts. I must sentence the prisoner in accordance with Pt 1 B Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I note of course that whilst there is no specific reference to general deterrence, it is a matter that is to be considered, having regard to the terms of s 16A as a relevant matter, and this was held long ago in decisions from the early part of the 1990s, in fact in 1990, of El Karhani and another decision of Paull, both decisions of Justice Hunt. I note what the Crown has put about the significance of the maximum penalty as a yardstick and a basis for comparison between the case at court and worst cases, which will bring me back finally to some consideration of supposed comparative cases.
	
	
	I am required to determine the nature and circumstances of the offence, and I have already recited the facts as I have found them, and assessed the prisoner’s “role” as best I can. By reference to s 16A(2) the relevant matters to consider are of course the nature and circumstances of the offence, the degree whether any loss, damage or injury has been resulted from the offence, whether there is a victim of the offence and the personal circumstances of that victim. In the latter two instances of course no such loss or damage has directly resulted although that is not through any action on the part of the prisoner. Of course, there could have been victims by the importation of these drugs if it had been successful.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to the fact that there are no other offences that represent a course of conduct. This is a one-off offence, so to speak. Bearing in mind of course that what s 16A(2) prescribed are relevant matters to take into account, some in a positive way.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to the degree to which the prisoner has shown contrition, and I accept that he has expressed his contrition in a range of ways. I cannot understand the delay in his plea of guilty, but his cooperation with the authorities, which was very timely as I said, and of course his statements of regret in his evidence and to the psychologist are genuine statements of contrition. The fact that he has pleaded guilty is a relevant matter. I have referred to the degree of cooperation with the law enforcement authorities.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to the deterrent effect that any sentence will have upon him and to see that he is adequately punished. I am required to have regard to his character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means, physical and mental condition, which I do. The evidence in relation to that matter I have summarised.
	
	
	I am required to consider the prospects of his rehabilitation. I have considered that he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation. As I say, his involvement in this matter is somewhat baffling. He is a person, it seems to me, with a social conscience. I was somewhat surprised that he indicated that he did not have a full understanding of the effects of drugs upon people until he saw people in prison here in Australia. One might have thought in Southern California there would be widespread knowledge of the effects of the use of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	I am also required to take into account the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on his family and dependents. In this regard there were some submissions made in relation to his family. That the fact that the prisoner will be incarcerated here in Australia, his family will be a long way away in America without his financial support, is a matter that I should take into account as a relevant matter. I take it into account as a relevant matter as part of the subjective mix, but it certainly is not a matter of “exceptional hardship”, a matter conceded in the submissions of counsel for the prisoner and the subject of specific submission by the learned Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are that people from foreign countries who come here to commit crimes should expect that they will be serving their sentences away from their family. It is part of the risk of being involved in this particular type of crime and it is an inevitable consequence of being involved in this particular crime. I accept that the prisoner was involved in the commission of this offence for financial gain which is a relevant matter in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences the Crown has correctly posited in its written submissions and so far as the matters concerning adequate punishment I accept what has been put by the Crown in that regard.
	
	
	I am mindful, of course, in due course of the technical requirements, I can only sentence the prisoner to a term of imprisonment if that is the only appropriate sentencing option and clearly. That is the case here having regard to s 17A Commonwealth Crimes Act, if I impose a sentence of more than three years imprisonment I must impose a non-parole period. I will fix a non-parole period in accordance with the High Court decision of Hili and Jones v R to which reference is made in the written submissions. I do wish the Commonwealth in its written submissions, many of which seem to come off a word processor, would cease to refer to what used to happen in cases such as Bernier and Behar. I appeared in Behar in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Frankly it is really a matter of telling the Court nowadays of what the current law is not, but rather what it used to be. In any event I approach the matter as the High Court has indicated in Hili and Jones.
	
	
	This brings me to the issue of supposedly comparative cases. There are a number of authorities of the Court of Criminal Appeal recently, RCW (No.2) [2014] NSWCCA 190 is one, which caution against Judges at first instance becoming fixated by comparison with a particular case. No two cases are alike and we do not have a ‘Code of Hammurabi’, we do not have a grid sentencing. We are required to exercise our sentencing discretion judicially. But having said that the decisions of the superior courts are obviously in their outcomes subject to the relevant principles. The facts of the particular case at bar decided to assist in structuring the exercise of discretion by lower courts such as my court will always differ. I have endeavoured always to try and fix a sentence that properly reflects the range of appropriate exercise of discretion making allowance, of course, for the special cases that sometimes arise in special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown provided the court with a range of cases and copies of the cases, not only from New South Wales on appeal and at first instance, but from Western Australia. I have taken those cases into account, some of which I have read before. I have also had regard to the case of Lauder which I earlier referred. Counsel for the accused provided some statistics which provide some indication of the range of penalties. Statistics, of course, are to be viewed cautiously as, shortly after his appointment at Chief Justice in 1998, Spigelman CJ pointed out in the decision of Bloomfield. I have had regard to those statistics.
	
	
	Part of the submissions of counsel for the accused concentrated, however, on a very important decision, in my view, in this area of sentencing, that is, the decision of De La Rosa, a decision of the full bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with matters both constitutional, legal and factual arising out of the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders convicted of importing commercial quantities of border control drugs. De La Rosa, of course, was concerned with the importation of cocaine as my memory of the facts are concerned, but particularly the then Chief Judge at Common Law McClellan J went through an analysis of many authorities both in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and elsewhere to come to the conclusion about the range of sentences that have been fixed, particularly, by courts of high authority for offending of the type with which I am concerned in its various forms, categorising the range of sentences by reference to not just the quantity of the drugs but the role of the offender.
	
	
	I am mindful, of course, of the Crown’s written submissions, following upon from the High Court decision of Wong v R when the guideline judgment handed down in New South Wales in relation to Commonwealth sentencing was struck down, that quantity is not the sole determinative of seriousness. But remains a relevant matter to be taken into account. Ultimately, it was submitted by learned counsel for the accused that in the various groups or four groups as they were described by McClellan J in his judgment at [207] - [215] that a person acting as a courier, as this prisoner clearly was, might be considered to fall within the range of sentencing that he described at [215]. Of course, his Honour’s analysis does have some gaps in it. There are mixtures of role and quantity that are not altogether contemplated by his categories, if I may be so bold to say so from my sentencing experience.
	
	
	It is also fair to say that as with the statistics the exact discount that has been provided particularly for the plea of guilty is not readily available for consideration. It seems to me though that what has been categorised in the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner by reference to what his Honour described as “the fourth category”, reflected further in his table at [224], is a fair assessment of the situation.
	
	
	It should be pointed out anecdotally I hasten to say, my experience is that those that perform the role of couriers such as this prisoner usually plead guilty and usually plead guilty at an early stage, because the truth of the matter to use a colloquialism is they are caught “cold” as this prisoner was. Thus the range of sentences would include a very high proportion of sentences for those types of offenders, as opposed to principals who may plead ‘not guilty’ more frequently. On a pro rata sense this would include a high degree of discounts of up to 25% where the discounts are given.
	
	
	I have concluded in relation to this prisoner that the starting point of any sentence that should be imposed upon him, having regard to the objective facts including an assessment of his role, the subjective circumstances and the relevant legislative and case considerations should be eight years and six months imprisonment. With a discount of 15% I calculate that the term of imprisonment thus should be seven years two months and some weeks, I have rounded it down to seven years and two months. It could be rounded up to seven years and three months on my calculation.
	
	
	I have determined that there are matters that are relevant as pointed out in the submissions of counsel to fixing a non-parole period that would provide the prisoner notwithstanding his inevitable deportation with a basis for an extended period of supervision. I am mindful of the fact, of course that people that do not have issues that require professional assistance on release may not need an extensive period of supervision but, in my view, this prisoner is entitled to a finding that would permit him to have a non-parole period somewhat less than might generally be imposed for a head sentence of this type, particularly having regard to his prospects of rehabilitation which I assess as good and also his other capacities as reflected in the subject case that has been conducted for him.
	
	
	Thus, having had regard to all these matters I have determined that the prisoner should be convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment as I foreshadow. Could you stand up please, Mr Roblero?
	
	
	In relation to the matter to which you pleaded guilty, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment on my calculation of seven years and two months which will date from 2 January 2014 and will expire on 1 March 2021. In respect of that sentence, I fix a non-parole period of four years and two months, again, commencing on 2 January 2014 and expiring on my calculation on 1 March 2018. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to whether you are released to parole. You will be probably deported I would imagine shortly after your release to parole. But you will be required whilst subject to parole to comply with the conditions of your parole that are fixed by the Parole Authority. You should understand that if you breach your parole in circumstances where you are amenable to the jurisdiction of the parole authority, your parole can be revoked and you can be returned to custody.
	
	
	Mr Crown, are there any technical matters from you?
	
	
	WHITEMAN: No, I have nothing to raise, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Anything from you, ma’am?
	
	
	COOK: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you want to speak to your client with the interpreter present or not?
	
	
	COOK: We’ve booked the interpreter, your Honour, so I can take him downstairs.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Probably be best to speak to your client in private. Yes, thank you, sir, you’re excused, thank you.
	
	
	ADJOURNED

	The total effective sentence was one of imprisonment for 4 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to date from 6 May 2013. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal on 8 grounds which are discussed below.
	


THE FACTS


	
	A separate statement of facts in respect of each instance of offending was tendered before the sentencing judge.
	


Count 1


	
	The agreed facts in respect of count 1 were in the following terms:
	


“About 1:34am on Wednesday 29th December 2010 the accused Daniel Avery along with two other Aboriginal males attended the Casino Golf Club, Casino. All three males had shirts over their heads to hide their identity. The (applicant) who was wearing black and white tracksuit pants with white sneakers, picked up a brick and ran at the rear door throwing the brick at the rear entrance.

The second male who was wearing a rear (sic) shirt also through (sic) a brick at the rear doors. The young person proceeded to run at the doors kicking out at the doors before trying to force the glass back by using his hands.

It’s believed that while (the applicant) was forcing his way to (sic) into the licence (sic) premises using his hands, (the applicant) has cut himself on some of the broken glass on the rear door.

(The applicant) was able to break the glass resulting in all three males entering the licence (sic) premises.

As the two males ran towards the front bar (the applicant) picked up a clear container near the front entrance before running to the front bar area.

(The applicant) along with the third Aboriginal male proceeded to smash the front fridge doors where (the applicant) and the third Aboriginal male proceeded to take various bottles of alcohol.

After (the applicant) has filled his container with bottles of alcohol, (the applicant) along with the two Aboriginal males have fled the licence (sic) premises through the rear doors, towards the golf course. Within minutes security was on scene followed by staff.”

Count 2


	
	The agreed facts in respect of count 2 were in the following terms:
	


“Between 1:30am and 5:15am on Sunday 23rd January 2011 vehicle BF95JH a 1991 White Holden Commodore Wagon, registered to Stevie COX was stolen From (sic) the carpark at the Mallanganee Hotel, Mallanganee. The vehicle was locked and secured by the victim having the only key.

About 10:30am on Wednesday 26th January 2011 Tabulam and Casino Police attended the Tabulam Aboriginal Reserve as a result of information supplied by the community, involving two stolen motor vehicles being driven around the community.

After patrolling the Tabulam Aboriginal Reserve, police located the Nissan Patrol abandoned on Jubullum Street prior to Walker Street, while the commander (sic) wagon was located south on Walker Street, again abandoned.

Police secured both vehicles and as a result of both still being driveable, both where (sic) conveyed to Tabulam Police Station where a rostered tow was arranged.

The vehicle was towed from the location and preserved for fingerprinting and DNA gathering. Crime Scene Police attended and conducted a forensic examination of both vehicles. As a result of the examination DNA belonging to the accused was located on a can VB Beer inside the White Holden Commodore registration BF95JF (sic) (NSW).”

Count 3


	
	The agreed facts in respect of count 3 were in the following terms:
	


“…MA and her son, MK, reside at 13 Shores Drive Yamba and have done so for approximately 4 years. About 5:30am on Saturday 22 December 2012 MK and MA were at home asleep. MK awoke after hearing a loud knocking at the front door. The front door is situated to the left hand side of the house and leads straight into the room where MK sleeps. The knocking was loud and consistent and as a result woke MK, who got up and opened the front wooden door.

As he opened the he was confronted by four male Offender’s (sic) who he described as aboriginal in appearance and they were not wearing any disguises on their face. One of the male offenders punched MK to the face which caused MK’s right front tooth to break. The punch also caused MK to be knocked backwards as two of the Offender’s (sic) entered the home.

On entering these premises one of the Offender’s (sic) was yelling “where’s the money, where’s the money?” (MK) yelled out to his mother MA, who had been asleep in her bedroom, which is adjacent to the lounge room, “we’re being robbed”. MK began to run towards his mother’s bedroom up three stairs into the lounge room and as he did so was assaulted from behind which resulted in him being knocked unconscious and was then left lying on the lounge room floor.

MA got out of bed and dressed, as she was in her underwear and put on a loose fitting dress. When MA came out of her bedroom she saw Daniel Avery, TL and two other offences (sic) in the house and her son (MK) lying conscious on the lounge floor with two of the offender’s (sic) over the top of MK punching him. As she looked out of her room MA saw TL coming towards her, she immediately returned to her room to find something with which to defend herself and closed her bedroom door. Once in the bedroom she heard the door coming off its track and turned back and saw the door had been broken by TL. She tried to push the door back but TL pushed the door and it came down over the top of MA. The door was on top of her only momentarily before TL grabbed the door and threw it to one side. He then grabbed hold of MA’s arms and pulled her up. MA screamed and TL punched her to the left temple. This caused great distress to MA causing her to wet herself. TL punched MA a number of times knocking her over, breaking her nose and cheek bone. Her lip was split, her teeth became loose and she lost some of her fillings as a result of these punches. TL was yelling “I want the money, I want the money”. MA was badly injured and fought back kicking and punching TL.

When TL eventually stopped punching her, he pulled her dress off, up over her head and pushed MA (sic) face first down onto the bed. MA was able to turn over and continued to fight back by punching and kicking him. TL grabbed one of her legs to stop her from kicking him and came over the top of her, pushing her dress over her face so she was unable to see his face. TL held her down by placing his elbow on her collar bone. She then felt his other hand around her crotch and move inside her underwear. TL then felt around her vagina in a rubbing motion and she felt him insert 2 fingers inside her vagina. He then forcefully moved his fingers in and out of her vagina for at least at minute. Whilst this was occurring MA continued to fight TL and believed she may have kicked him in the testicles which caused him to stop his assault on her.

TL then walked out of the room followed by MA to the Lounge room where he went to a coffee table and grabbed the keys to MA’s car. MK was up by this time and made an attempt to stop this male but MA said “No, let him go.”

All four Offender’s (sic) then ran out of the house. MA then heard her car start up and drive away.”


	
	The facts were summarised by her Honour (at ROS 1-3), following which her Honour made reference to the contents of an interview in which the applicant had participated with police. In particular her Honour said:
	
	
	“A month late (sic) in January 2013 this offender was arrested in relation to another matter. He made admissions to the Yamba offence. He said that he had been drinking with others and they went to a house around daybreak to get some cannabis. He says that one of the offenders hit MK in the head hard. He was knocked out when the offender entered.
	
	
	The offender searched around the lounge-room and took a pack of cigarettes. He saw TL hit MA. He did not see or participate in offences with her in the bedroom. He did see that once she came out of the bedroom her face was badly injured and black from bruising. At that stage, believing that TL had gone too far, he encouraged them to leave. Apparently they all later took part in burning her car, though he is not subject of a charge in relation to that.
	
	
	He told the police that he believed that they were going there to buy cannabis and admits that he fully participated in taking some property that was taken, namely $1500 cash, an iPhone and a car from the house. He received, he says, $50 and a packet of cigarettes.”
	


GROUND 1 – The sentencing judge erred by finding a fact adverse to the applicant which it was not open to her to find, namely that the applicant took part in the violent assault upon MK on 22 December 2012

Her Honour’s findings


	
	The assault on MK was committed in the course of carrying out the joint criminal enterprise which was the subject of count 3. Having summarised the facts along with aspects of the applicant’s interview with police, her Honour said (at ROS 3):
	


“Lately it is a well worn excuse advanced often by a number of young menthat the reason they go to another citizen's house is because they wanted toobtain or purchase cannabis. This excuse for what is a home invasion hasbeen advanced all too regularly before the courts. There is no alternativeevidence before the Court, other than in the agreed facts, to explain why theywent there. However that (sic ) the offender immediately seemed prepared and didtake part in a vicious and cowardly assault upon the occupants of the house. Although he did not assault MA he was certainly aware that she was being assaulted and he was a part of the group that burst into the house on that particular night. MK received a broken tooth, as noted. MA received bruising around both eyes, a swollen left eye, a 2 centimetre laceration to the lip, bruising and abrasions over the right clavicle and bruising to both feet, arms and back” (emphasis added).


	
	In the context of considering the objective seriousness of the offending her Honour then said (at ROS 4):
	


“There were four people involved, four young men, including this offender, who is clearly a fit strong young man. They entered a residence where people should expect to feel safe and secure at around 5.30am. This would have caused considerable alarm to the occupants of the house. There was a flurry of extreme violence in which this offender was involved” (emphasis added).


	
	Finally, her Honour said (at ROS 5):
	


“Whilst, as part of the agreed facts, it must be accepted that the offenders went there to get drugs, this offender joined in this serious offence with a great deal of enthusiasm” (emphasis added).

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the extracts of the remarks on sentence set out at [13]-[15] above, and particularly the italicised parts within those extracts, supported a conclusion that her Honour erroneously found that the applicant was involved in assaulting MK. It was submitted that there was nothing in either the agreed facts or in the applicant’s record of interview which provided a proper basis for such a finding.
	
	
	Particular reliance was placed on the fact that in the passage of her Honour’s remarks set out in [13] above, her Honour expressly stated that the applicant was not responsible for the assault on MA but made no similar statement in the following sentence when making reference to the assault on MK. It was submitted that this, combined with her Honour’s references to the applicant being involved in a “a flurry of extreme violence” (at [14] above) and to the applicant having “joined in this serious offence with a great deal of enthusiasm” (at [15] above) supported the conclusion that her Honour had erroneously found that the applicant had taken part in the assault upon MK. It was submitted that this finding was significant in her Honour’s determination of the objective seriousness of the offending and caused the sentencing discretion to miscarry.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown accepted that on the facts before the sentencing judge the applicant did not inflict any violence upon either MA or MK. However it was submitted that on a fair reading of the entirety of the material before the sentencing judge there was no doubt that the applicant was in the midst of the violence which was taking place, and that he played a pivotal role in what had occurred. It was submitted that the presence of the applicant in the premises generally, and at the front door and the lounge room in particular, provided encouragement to the co-offenders and necessarily engendered additional fear in the victims.
	
	
	Viewed in this way, it was submitted by the Crown that her Honour’s observations were supported by the evidence before her.
	


Consideration


	
	In considering this ground a number of matters must be emphasised at the outset.
	
	
	Firstly, the sentencing judge did not make any finding that the applicant had actually played any direct part in the assault upon MK. Her Honour’s observations must be viewed in the context of the Crown case against the applicant in respect of count 3 being based upon a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Secondly, there was a lengthy statement of facts tendered on sentence in respect of count 3. Her Honour can be assumed to have been familiar with those facts which she summarised in her sentencing remarks. Those facts made it clear that it was no part of the Crown case against the applicant that he participated in any direct way in the assault upon MK.
	
	
	Thirdly, her Honour summarised aspects of the applicant’s interview with police (at [12] above). In doing so, her Honour made express reference to the fact that the applicant had told police that “one of the offenders” (in other words, someone other than the applicant himself) had assaulted MK.
	
	
	In my view, there is no room for the suggestion that her Honour was under some misapprehension about the precise role played by the applicant in the joint criminal enterprise which formed the basis of count 3. In particular, her Honour could not possibly have been under the misapprehension that the applicant was directly involved in the assault upon MK.
	
	
	The various extracts from the sentencing remarks upon which the applicant relied in support of this ground can only be sensibly construed as references to the applicant’s participation in the broader joint criminal enterprise in which he had admitted, by his plea of guilty, to having taken part. There is no basis upon which to conclude that her Honour was either not aware of the facts, or that she had somehow misconstrued them.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out.
	


GROUND 2 – The applicant was denied procedural fairness because the sentencing judge found a fact which was adverse to the applicant, contrary to the agreed facts and which had not been the subject of any cross-examination or submissions, namely that the applicant took part in the violent assault upon MK on 22 December 2012 without giving the applicant the opportunity to adduce further evidence or make further submissions.


	
	Ground 2 is inextricably linked to Ground 1.
	
	
	In light of the conclusion I have reached in respect of Ground 1, Ground 2 is not made out.
	


GROUND 3 – The sentencing judge erred by taking into account, in assessing the objective seriousness of the applicant’s conduct, the circumstance that MA had been sexually assaulted by one of the co-offenders on 22 December 2012.

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The agreed facts which were before the sentencing judge made reference to the sexual assault on MA. That assault fell outside the ambit of the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Crown. There was no suggestion at all that the applicant participated in it. It is not clear why there was a reference to it in the statement of facts tendered in respect of count 3 but there was no ambiguity in the Crown’s position as evidenced by the following statement made to her Honour by the Crown during the sentence proceedings (at T16 L16):
	


“The Crown is saying that’s not within this offender’s contemplation at the time that’s all.”


	
	Against that background her Honour said, in reference to the sexual assault (at ROS 2):
	
	
	“That aspect of the offence is not a matter for which this offender faces a charge, nor is he to be held responsible because it falls outside the plan that was embarked upon. Nevertheless it is a significant matter in the circumstances of these young men entering someone's house as they did that night.”
	
	
	Subsequently, when referring to the applicant’s interview (at ROS 3) her Honour said:
	
	
	“He saw TL hit MA. He did not see or participate in offences with her in the bedroom”.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted that notwithstanding her Honour’s express statement that the applicant was not to be held responsible for the sexual assault, an error arose as a consequence of her Honour’s reference (in the passage set out in [30] above) to the fact that it was “nevertheless…a significant matter.” Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sexual assault of MA was not a matter which her Honour was entitled to even consider, let alone a matter to which she was entitled to attach significance.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was clear from her Honour’s remarks that the sexual assault was not taken into account on the applicant’s sentence. It was submitted that her Honour had clearly indicated that the applicant was not to be held responsible for that offence, and had also indicated the reasons why that was so.
	


Consideration


	
	The reference to the “significance” of the matter was preceded by the sentencing judge expressly acknowledging that the sexual assault:
	



	
	fell outside the scope of the joint criminal enterprise;
	
	
	was not a matter which was the subject of a charge against the applicant; and
	
	
	was not a matter for which he was responsible.
	



	
	Such statements make it clear that her Honour was obviously well aware of the fact that the sexual assault was not something which could be taken into account in sentencing the applicant. In the face of such statements, I am not able to accept the proposition that her Honour somehow took the sexual assault into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending in count 3.
	
	
	Ground 3 is not made out.
	


GROUND 4 - The sentencing judge failed to give any or any significant effect to her finding of special circumstances in relation to the offence of 29 December 2010.

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	This ground was limited to the sentence imposed in respect of count 1.
	
	
	Having dealt with the applicant’s subjective circumstances, her Honour said (at ROS 8):
	


“Special circumstances are found given that this has been his first time in custody in adult prisons and that he will also need an extended period under supervision once he is released from prison to assist with his prospects of rehabilitation.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 reflected a variation of only 3 weeks from the statutory ratio and failed to reflect her Honour’s finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that such a variation was not sufficient to give any real effect to that finding.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 was a modest one and that in all of the circumstances the variation at which her Honour arrived was appropriate. The Crown also relied upon the overall sentence which, it was submitted, properly reflected her Honour’s findings.
	


Consideration


	
	Her Honour imposed a total effective sentence of 4 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. That non-parole period represented 57 per cent of the total sentence. That, on any view, was a substantial variation of the statutory ratio.
	
	
	The submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground fail to have regard to the total effective sentence which was imposed. That sentence clearly gave effect to her Honour’s finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Ground 4 is not made out.
	


GROUND 5 - The sentencing judge failed to properly apply principles of totality, in particular when considering the degree of accumulation upon the existing sentences.

Her Honour’s findings


	
	Immediately prior to pronouncing sentence, her Honour said the following:
	


“He has spent a long time now in custody. When regard is had only tothese matters he has been on remand for a short period. In addition he has served a lengthy period of imprisonment in relation to the matters for which he was on bail at the time of the Yamba offence. Accordingly the principles of totality are taken into account in that had he been sentenced all of these offences at once the Court would have imposed a sentence that took into account the offence that fell in between these two offences in time” (emphasis added).

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that there was no indication in the remarks on sentence that her Honour had considered the significance of the total effective sentence which she imposed.
	
	
	It was further submitted that her Honour should have considered such sentence in the light of the extent of the discount for the applicant’s assistance to the authorities so as to ensure that the discount was not eroded by any accumulation.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was essential that any sentence have appropriate regard to the totality of the applicant’s offending behaviour, and that such a requirement had been met in the present case. The Crown also emphasised that considerations of totality and accumulation were matters within the discretion of the sentencing judge who should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that her Honour’s express reference to principles of totality made it clear that those principles were in fact applied when determining sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	Considerations of concurrence, accumulation and totality are matters within the discretion of a sentencing judge: R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 per Hall J at [52] citing R v Cahyadi [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007] 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] and following per Howie J. Nothing said by her Honour suggests that her discretion in this regard miscarried. On the contrary, the proposition that her Honour failed to apply principles of totality ignores her Honour’s express reference to those principles in the italicised portion of those parts of her remarks set out at [44] above.
	
	
	The submissions of the applicant also ignore the substantial adjustment to the statutory ratio which is reflected in the overall sentence, and which resulted from her Honour’s finding of special circumstances. In light of that adjustment her Honour must necessarily have been aware of the effect of the accumulation which she had determined was appropriate.
	
	
	Ground 5 is not made out.
	


GROUND 6 – The sentencing judge erred in relation to the discounts for assistance to authorities

The evidence


	
	When interviewed on 22 January 2013, the applicant was asked to identify those in whose company he committed the offending in count 3. He said, in answer to question 289:
	


“Um, me, TL, um, Ed Walker and Robbie Williams.

Q 290: You’ve known then (sic) all for a long time.

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Robert Williams I now (sic) him he’s my uncle.

Q 291: Yeah.

A: Yeah.

Q 292: And Eddie Walker where’s Eddie from?

A: He’s from Tumbulgum.

…

Q 298: Yeah. And you said on the earlier recording that it was TL’s idea throughout.

A: Yeah.”


	
	Following the interview, the applicant signed an undertaking to give evidence at any proceedings against the co-offender TL for offences arising out of the offending in count 3.
	
	
	When giving evidence on sentence, the applicant said in cross-examination (commencing at T10 L13):
	


“Q: In relation to you giving evidence you know TL (sic) has been arrested?

A: Yeah.

Q: He’s been charged?

A: Yeah.

Q: You’ve nominated Ed Walker and Robert Williams as also being co-accused, is that correct?

A: Yeah.

Q: Pardon?

A: Yes.

Q: They are the people that you’ve nominated, are you willing to give evidence in relation to those two if they are arrested at a future later date as well?

A: Yeah.

Q: I beg your pardon?

A: Yes.”

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	At ROS 6 her Honour said:
	


“He has pleaded at the earliest possible opportunity in relation to each ofthese offences and that will merit a twenty five per cent discount against thesentence that would otherwise have applied. In addition he has undertaken togive evidence. When arrested in January 2013 he made admissions to thepolice indicating one of the other people who was involved. The assistancethat he has given will be in relation to this serious offence. It does not relate toany other offences. He has identified only one of the co-offenders who waspresent. The assistance that he proposed to give was timely occurring whenhe was arrested by police and when he was questioned about this offence.Although there is no evidence before the Court he will probably suffer harshercustodial conditions and there is a risk of injury to him should he giveevidence. In all I have determined that the assistance should merit a further twenty per cent discount so that the total discount that will apply will be one of forty five per cent in total.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that there were three errors arising out of the manner in which her Honour dealt with the issue of assistance. It was submitted that her Honour had:
	



	
	erroneously found that the applicant had only identified one of his three co-offenders;
	
	
	failed to specify the sentences which would have been imposed but for the assistance and, in particular, failed to specify the proportion of the discount referable to each of past and future assistance; and
	
	
	failed, in relation to the offending in count 2, to ensure that the discount effectively applied to the non-parole period.
	



	
	As to the first of those matters, it was submitted that the applicant had in fact identified his three co-offenders in respect of the offence in count 3, both in his interview with police and when giving evidence. It was also pointed out that when giving evidence the applicant had expressly undertaken to give evidence against the co-offenders Walker and Williams in the event that either of them was apprehended in the future. It was submitted that her Honour’s error in this regard was significant and that a proper understanding of the level of the applicant’s past and future assistance may have led her Honour to allow a greater discount than she did.
	
	
	As to the second matter, it was submitted that it had been incumbent upon the sentencing judge to quantify the amount by which the sentences had been reduced for each of past and future assistance in accordance with s. 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW (“the Sentencing Act”). It was submitted that her Honour had erred in failing to do so and that although, in light of s.23(6) of the Sentencing Act, that error did not invalidate the sentence, it was indicative of the fact that her Honour may not have given proper consideration to the value of the applicant’s past assistance.
	
	
	Finally, counsel for the applicant pointed out that the sentencing judge had imposed a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment in respect of the offending in count 2 but had given no reason for doing so. It was submitted that in view of her Honour’s failure to comply with s. 23(4)(b) of the Sentencing Act, this Court was left to speculate as to her Honour’s intentions in setting a fixed term.
	
	
	In oral argument before this Court, counsel for the applicant conceded that the discount which was applied was “not ungenerous” but stressed the importance of correctly identifying the level of assistance. Counsel then submitted that the considerations discussed in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 should operate in the applicant’s favour to increase the discount to one of 50 per cent. No such submission was put to the sentencing judge.  
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that although the applicant nominated the persons Walker and Williams as his other co-offenders in respect of the offending in count 3, there was no independent corroboration of their involvement and they had not been arrested. The Crown also pointed out that the offending in counts 1 and 2 involved others who were not named or otherwise identified by the applicant. It was submitted that in these circumstances there was in fact no error in her Honour’s findings.
	
	
	The Crown appeared to accept that the sentencing judge had failed to comply with s. 23(4) of the Sentencing Act. However, it was submitted that her Honour’s failure to do so was not a ground upon which the present appeal ought be allowed.
	


Consideration


	
	This Court has previously emphasised that where a discount is to be applied to reflect a plea of guilty along with past and future assistance, the relevant apportionment should be indicated: Hutchinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 317 per Fullerton J at [31] citing LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 and R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415. Her Honour did not approach the matter in accordance with those authorities and in doing so failed to comply with s. 23(4) of the Sentencing Act. However, given the provisions of s. 23(6), her Honour’s failure in that regard does not invalidate the sentence she imposed.
	
	
	The terms of the applicant’s signed undertaking to give evidence were limited to giving evidence against the co-offender TL in respect of the offending in count 3. Although the applicant identified the other two co-offenders by name, there was no evidence before her Honour that such identification was in fact correct. Neither person, it seems, has ever been arrested. In these circumstances, her Honour’s observation (in the passage set out in [55] above) that the applicant had identified only one of his co-offenders in respect of count 3 was, strictly speaking, correct. Moreover, there was no assistance rendered by the applicant in terms of identifying, or agreeing to give evidence against, any of those involved with him in the offending which was the subject of count 1 or count 2.
	
	
	The real issue which arises in respect of this ground is whether the discount applied by her Honour was appropriate in all of the circumstances. This Court has previously observed that it would be exceptional for a discount of more than 40 per cent to be given in respect of a plea of guilty and assistance absent evidence that the offender will serve the sentence in more difficult conditions than other prisoners because of the assistance given: R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151. It has also been observed by this Court that a combined discount for plea and assistance should not normally exceed 50 per cent and that a discount exceeding that amount should normally be reserved for cases which are regarded as exceptional: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249. In SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30 Davies J, having cited the decisions in Sukkar and SZ observed (at [44]) that it is not exceptional for an applicant simply to provide information on the identity of a co-accused or even to give evidence against a co-accused. His Honour observed that such assistance often results in an offender requiring protective custody but that such hardship is inherent in the offer and the discount that results. In any event, as I have observed, there was no evidence in the present case that the applicant’s conditions of custody were rendered more harsh as a consequence of his assistance. These authorities recognise that the discount for plea and assistance must not be such as to result in the imposition of a sentence which is unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: Hutchinson (supra).
	
	
	In the present case her Honour found that there was no evidence that the applicant’s conditions of custody would be rendered harsher as a consequence of his assistance. Notwithstanding that, the discount applied by her Honour was in excess of the 40% referred to in Sukkar. Viewed in that light, the discount is a generous one. So much was conceded by counsel for the applicant in oral argument.
	
	
	To the extent that the applicant’s submissions relied upon the application of the principles in Ellis, no such submission was ever put to the sentencing judge. It is not open for a party to come to this Court and assert error on the part of a sentencing judge based upon a failure to take a particular course which the judge was never asked to take. Generally speaking, a party is bound by the manner in which the case is conducted at first instance: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80] and [82] per Johnson J.
	
	
	The applicant’s assistance, whilst obviously valuable, was limited. There was, as I have indicated, no evidence which suggested that his conditions of custody were rendered more onerous as a result. In my view, given these circumstances, the discount applied by her Honour was, to say the least, generous.
	
	
	Ground 6 is not made out.
	


GROUND 7 – The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the applicant’s intoxication

The evidence


	
	When interviewed by police on 22 January 2013, the applicant was asked:
	


“Q 122: Or, did you hear anything going on inside the house when you went in?

A: No I didn’t hear shit man ‘cause I was drunk bro, nothing, nothing…take, well I went in there and that’s when I looked and old bud was there and Eddie Walker was, you know trying, ask him where the money and the sticks and that were.”


	
	In a second interview conducted on the same day the applicant was asked the following questions about what he did in the period leading up to the offending:
	


“Q 21: Can you tell me again what happened once you arrived in Yamba and then throughout that evening?

A: Just, you know just, we just rocked up and yeah just seen TL and that there at his house and just jumped out you know.

Q 22: Yeah,

A: Shook his hand and cuddled like - -

Q 23: Yeah.

A: - - and just, you know, had a drink.

Q 24: And you’ve known TL for a long time.

A: Yeah I knew him for a long time yeah.

Q 25: Yeah what happened then?

A: And just you know just got pissed.

Q 26: Through the night.

A: Yeah through the night.

Q 27: Yeah was it a bit of a party then yeah.

A: Yeah I reckon there was…there.

Q 28: How many do you reckon?

A: I reckon there was about forty of us.”

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	In the course of the sentence proceedings, the applicant’s solicitor submitted that the principles in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 were directly applicable. In the course of doing so, and in the context of the applicant’s upbringing, her Honour noted (at T19 L 15) that “there was alcohol”. The applicant’s solicitor then continued:
	


“Alcohol in the community where he grew up and certainly that alcohol is attributed to both parents”.


	
	The applicant’s solicitor then addressed further matters in the course of which her Honour said (T19 L27):
	


“All right, I accept Fernando applies”.


	
	It was not put to her Honour that the applicant’s intoxication at the time of his offending was of any significance on sentence. It was also not put to her Honour that she should take such intoxication into account on sentence, or make a particular finding about it. As outlined above, the submissions made to her Honour were restricted to pointing out that the applicant was brought up in an environment where alcohol was regularly (and excessively) consumed by members of his family.
	
	
	Having outlined the circumstances of the offending in count 3, and having made reference to the fact that the applicant had made admissions in relation to that offending, her Honour said (at ROS 3):
	


“He said that he had been drinking with others and they went to a house around daybreak to get some cannabis”.


	
	Further, at ROS 6, her Honour said:
	


“In this case the principles enunciated in Fernando clearly apply given his Aboriginal heritage and the deprived circumstances in which he was brought up both within his family and within the community where he grew up. He has clearly had contact with the abuse of alcohol and drugs for most of his life and has so engaged from a youngish age.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted that the statements made by the applicant when he was interviewed constituted evidence that at the time of his offending he was intoxicated to a degree which was far greater than that for which her Honour allowed. It was submitted that the sentencing judge did not, at any stage, make any finding about the applicant’s intoxication, nor did she state that she had considered whether or not it was a factor that ought be taken into account. It was submitted by failing to take that factor into account, the sentencing judge had failed to properly consider the principles in Fernando and that as a consequence, her sentencing discretion had miscarried.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that even when the evidence was taken at its highest, the references to the applicant’s intoxication were “passing at best” and were equivocal as to his actual state of intoxication at the time of the offending. It was submitted that the applicant’s level of intoxication could be properly gauged by the fact that he was able to sufficiently recall them when interviewed some weeks later. It was submitted that this, along with his apparent capacity to be able to drive the vehicle away from the scene of the offending in count 3, tended against the conclusion that he was intoxicated to any significant degree.
	
	
	Counsel for the Crown also pointed out that the issue of intoxication was not the subject of any submission on sentence, other than in the context of the judgment in Fernando to which her Honour referred. In these circumstances, it was submitted that there was no error in the way in which her Honour dealt with the matter.
	


Consideration


	
	The submissions advanced in support of this ground complained that her Honour failed to make a finding about the applicant’s intoxication at the time of the offending, and failed to find that such intoxication was relevant on sentence. The sentencing judge was not asked to make either finding. The observations of Johnson J in Zreika are again applicable.
	
	
	What was put to her Honour on sentence was that the principles in Fernando applied. Her Honour accepted that submission and expressly stated that such principles applied. There is no reason to conclude that her Honour did not approach sentence in accordance with these statements.
	
	
	Ground 7 is not made out.
	


GROUND 8 – The sentences are manifestly excessive

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	Having dealt with the facts of the matter, her Honour turned to consider the issue of objective seriousness (commencing at ROS 4):
	


“In relation to the objective seriousness, the Casino matter it is accepted, falls below the midrange and towards the lower end of objective seriousness. Though it is not by any means at the lowest end. It is a very serious offence. There was an element of planning, albeit not sophisticated given the attempt at disguises worn by the offenders. It did occur during a week day and at a time of night when no one was likely to be present. It was a business premises and not a residence which means that it is less serious. There was damage done to this small club that can ill afford the cost of offences such as this occurring there, in particular to pay for repairs. Not a lot of property was taken but the damage to this small club was considerable and would have cost a significant amount. The offenders ran away on foot. The circumstance of aggravation is that they were in company, which also is one of the less serious circumstances of aggravation available for offences of this kind.

In relation to the Yamba matter, it is clearly a much more serious matterand falls at the midrange or slightly above. There were four people involved,four young men, including this offender, who is clearly a fit strong young man.They entered a residence where people should expect to feel safe and secureat around 5.30am. This would have caused considerable alarm to theoccupants of the house. There was a flurry of extreme violence in which thisoffender was involved. The injuries though do not fall at the more serious end of the scale. The property taken, though substantial for the complainants, is not at the more serious end for offences of this kind.

Whilst, as part of the agreed facts, it must be accepted that the offenders went there to get drugs, this offender joined in this serious offence with a great deal of enthusiasm. On the other hand in his favour he did at a later point encourage the others to desist and leave. In all it caused a great deal of trouble for everyone, most particularly the complainants, but also for this offender and for very little return at all. According to the facts, at the moment they knocked on the door there was no attempt to buy drugs both on the version of the complainant and the accused. Their plan obviously changed very quickly indeed.”


	
	Her Honour then proceeded to deal with the applicant’s subjective case. At the time of the offending in counts 1 and 2 the applicant had just turned 18 years and by the time of the offending in count 3 he had just turned 20. Her Honour noted his criminal history and the fact that it contained a number of offences of a similar kind before stating (at ROS 5):
	


“He has a record that indicates that he is, in terms of break and enter offences, a one man crime wave. At the time of the Yamba offence he was on bail for other break and enter offences which was the one for which he has just completed serving a sentence.”


	
	Tendered to the court on sentence was a report of Allan Anderson, a Psychologist who had assessed the applicant. He reported that the applicant had provided a history of his mother having left his family when he was a baby and that he remained along with “about nine siblings” with his father. The applicant did not report being subjected to “much” physical abuse whilst growing up. He left school in Year 9 and had not worked since that time. Thus, the applicant had been unemployed from about the age of 15 to the age of 21. The applicant reported that he had started to drink alcohol at about the age of 15, and also stated that he started using cannabis at that time. Those matters were described as “usual in that family and in that local area”.
	
	
	Testing administered by Mr Anderson indicated that the applicant showed no inclination on the part of the applicant towards violent behaviour, and no evidence of anxiety or stress. Mr Anderson said (at p. 3 of his report):
	


“Daniel impresses as a young man of average intelligence. He has not used any illicit substances whilst in jail and presents as a pleasant and polite young man who has, in my opinion, been the victim of circumstances and could not have had any other lifestyle other than the one in which he is being caught up.

Daniel has told me that when he is able to leave gaol this time he wanted to return to live with his father who, according to Daniel, has “lined up” some kind of work for him under the “work for the dole” program.

…

I would hope that when Daniel leaves jail on this occasion he may voluntarily decide to enter a rehabilitation centre such as Balunda, where he has previous experience, and probably try to complete a six month program there. I believe this would be very good for him if he were to have the patience and tolerance to do so.

Daniel has convinced me that when he leaves detention he does not want to use cannabis and he does not want to drink alcohol. I think this will be very difficult unless he undertakes a period of rehabilitation in a suitable centre. It would be very difficult, in my opinion, for Daniel to return to his home, live with his siblings and his father without being susceptible to alcohol and drug use again.

Daniel would certainly have been under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs when these offences were committed. He would certainly have been suffering from deep depression at the time of the said offences”.


	
	It must be noted that nowhere in Mr Anderson’s report is there a reference to any history provided by the applicant as to his use of alcohol or drugs at the time of any of the offending. Moreover, Mr Anderson did not diagnose depression. His references to the applicant having been under the influence and in a “deep depression” at the time of his offending were apparently based solely upon the history provided by the applicant. They are deserving of little weight in the circumstances.
	
	
	Having summarised Mr Anderson’s report, her Honour concluded (as previously noted) that the principles enunciated in Fernando clearly applied in light of the applicant’s Aboriginal heritage and the deprived circumstances in which he was brought up, both within his immediate family and within the broader community group.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the offending, and particularly the offending in count 3, attracted application of principles of general and specific deterrence. She concluded (at ROS 7):
	


“As indicated he has been for some time now something of a one man crime wave, his offending has been rather unrelenting. As he is still, and was certainly at the time of the offences, a young man, rehabilitation remains a significant factor. On the one hand his remorse is indicated by his admissions to the police when arrested, by the early indication of a plea and by his willingness to assist the authorities. On the other hand his behaviour in committing these types of offences on an ongoing basis and the fact that he left Balunda, a program that would have assisted him greatly, means that his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded at this stage.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	In submitting that the sentences, both individually and overall, were manifestly excessive, counsel for the applicant turned firstly to the objective seriousness of the offending. He submitted that such objective seriousness was properly summarised as follows:
	



	
	the serious indictable offence in respect of count 1 was stealing from unoccupied commercial premises at night;
	
	
	the offending in count 2 amounted to the applicant being a passenger in a stolen car driven around an Aboriginal Mission;
	
	
	the offending in count 3 was constituted by the applicant’s encouragement to, and support of, others but significantly did not involve directly participating in the assaults upon the two victims.
	



	
	Counsel for the applicant also relied on the following additional matters in support of the conclusion that the sentences were manifestly excessive:
	



	
	the early pleas of guilty;
	
	
	what was said to be the “very significant” assistance to authorities;
	
	
	the applicant’s age;
	
	
	his deprived background;
	
	
	his intoxication at the time of the offending in count 3; and
	
	
	the existence of special circumstances.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that in order to establish this ground it was incumbent upon the applicant to establish the sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust. It was submitted that the unreasonableness or the unjustness of the sentence must be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and where judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle: Kendall v R [2015] NSWCCA 13 at [47].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed on the applicant were not manifestly excessive having regard to the following factors:
	



	
	the maximum penalties and, in respect of counts 1 and 3, the prescribed standard non-parole period;
	
	
	the overall criminality involved;
	
	
	the level of objective seriousness of the offending as found by the sentencing judge;
	
	
	the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending in count 3; and
	
	
	the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted upon the two victims of the offending in count 3.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, the submissions of counsel for the applicant tend to understate the seriousness of the applicant’s offending.
	
	
	The offending in count 1 reflected steps having been taken by the applicant and his co-offenders to hide their identity. That was a clear indication of some degree of planning. The applicant was responsible for breaking into the premises by engaging in the violent act of throwing a brick through the rear entrance. Thankfully, because of the time at which the offending took place, no member of the public was placed in any danger. Once inside, the applicant proceeded to engage in further violence by smashing the front refrigerator door for the purposes of stealing quantities of alcohol.
	
	
	The gravamen of the offending in count 2 was that that the applicant allowed himself to be carried in a stolen conveyance, knowing that it had been stolen. The fact that the use of the stolen conveyance may have been limited to use within the confines of an Aboriginal mission does not, in my view, significantly mitigate the offending.
	
	
	The offending in count 3 was in the nature of what is generally described a home invasion. Its seriousness is self-evident, as is the fear which would have been engendered in the two occupants of the home.
	
	
	Quite apart from the objective seriousness of the offending, the complaint of manifest excess also tends to overlook the fact that the applicant’s offending was committed against a background of a substantial criminal history for offending of this nature. Notwithstanding the applicant’s relative youth and his background, both of which her Honour took into account, considerations of general and personal deterrence were of obvious significance in determining an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was the beneficiary of a generous discount for his plea and assistance. He was also the beneficiary of a finding of special circumstances which resulted in a substantial variation being made to the length of the non-parole period.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances I am unpersuaded that the sentences are manifestly excessive, in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.

		13 May 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766292,Lismore City Council v Ihalainen (No 3) [2015] NSWLEC 53,"Judgment


	
	In these criminal proceedings, the successful defendant, Mr Ihalainen, seeks costs orders against the prosecutor relating to:
	



	
	the withdrawal by the prosecutor at the beginning of the trial of a water pollution charge – charge 18;
	
	
	the dismissal by the Court at the end of the trial of another water pollution charge – charge 17;
	
	
	an interlocutory application made by the defendant determined on 12 July 2014 by Sheahan J.
	



	
	The charges at trial were that Mr Ihalainen breached a development consent that authorised the construction of a dwelling on rural land by not complying with certain requirements of the consent during the construction phase, and that he breached s 120 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act) by polluting a creek on the land, by introducing soil into the creek from construction of a fire trail required by the development consent.
	
	
	At the beginning of the trial there were two water pollution charges – referred to in the summons as charges 17 and 18. At the beginning of the trial, by consent, the prosecutor withdrew charge 18 and costs were reserved. At the end of the trial, I dismissed the remaining charges and reserved costs: Lismore City Council v Ihalainen (No 2) [2014] NSWLEC 198.
	
	
	Charges 17 and 18 each pleaded that the defendant polluted the waters of the creek on or about 27 June 2012, contrary to s 120 of the POEO Act, by the introduction into those waters of sediment-laden runoff from the fire trail. The only difference was that charge 17 alleged “water pollution” within the meaning of subparagraph (a) of the POEO Act definition of “water pollution”, whereas charge 18 alleged “water pollution” within the meaning of subparagraph (b):
	


water pollution or pollution of waters means:

(a)   placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, so that the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed, or

(b)   placing in or on, or otherwise introducing into or onto, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any refuse, litter, debris or other matter, whether solid or liquid or gaseous, so that the change in the condition of the waters or the refuse, litter, debris or other matter, either alone or together with any other refuse, litter, debris or matter present in the waters makes, or is likely to make, the waters unclean, noxious, poisonous or impure, detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property of persons, undrinkable for farm animals, poisonous or harmful to aquatic life, animals, birds or fish in or around the waters or unsuitable for use in irrigation, or obstructs or interferes with, or is likely to obstruct or interfere with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of any right in relation to the waters,

….


	
	I held that there was reasonable doubt whether the flow of water to the creek included sediment-laden water from the fire trail and what the concentration of any sediment was. Even if that conclusion was wrong, there was reasonable doubt as to whether the physical condition of the creek was changed by any runoff from the fire trail.
	


THE COSTS LEGISLATION


	
	Section 257C(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 empowers a court to order costs against a prosecutor at the end of proceedings, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn:
	


A court may at the end of proceedings under this Part order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.


	
	Reflecting the fact that a prosecutor acts in a public capacity in prosecuting charges, this power to award costs is heavily constrained by s 257D(1) which prohibits an award of costs against a prosecutor unless the defendant satisfies the Court as to one or more of four specified matters (Wollongong City Council v Ensile Pty Ltd (No 9) [2008] NSWLEC 248 at [6]; Environment Protection Authority v Bulga Coal Management Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWLEC 70, 202 LGERA 203 at [6]):
	


Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in proceedings under this Part unless the court is satisfied as to one or more of the following:

(a)   that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b)   that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c)   that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d)   that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.


	
	The defendant relies on a number of these subsections. The defendant relies upon findings made in the principal judgment, on certain parts of the evidence and transcript, and on certain documents tendered on the costs application.
	
	
	The prosecutor submits that costs should not be ordered as the defendant cannot satisfy the legal and factual burden justifying a costs order.
	


The withdrawn charge 18


	
	Long before trial, the defendant contended in writing that charges 17 and 18 were two charges in respect of one offence, differing only in particulars, and offended the principle of double jeopardy; and indicated that the defendant proposed to require the prosecution to elect as between charges 17 and 18 and would seek his costs in relation to the application and any proceedings discontinued or discussed.
	
	
	The double jeopardy contention appears to have been well founded: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57, 194 CLR 610 at [9]-[33].
	
	
	In a letter of reply, the prosecution contended that the defendant could be convicted of both charges.
	
	
	In withdrawing charge 18 at the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor said he had taken a pragmatic view and had considered legal argument put by the defendant.
	
	
	The defendant submits that therefore the Court should be satisfied that charge 18 constitutes proceeding initiated without reasonable cause within s 257D(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	The prosecutor submits, and I accept, that: first, charges 17 and 18 were pressed as alternatives and with no intention by the prosecutor of seeking a conviction in relation to both charges, as was made plain in the prosecutor’s opening written submissions filed and served shortly before trial; secondly, the prosecutor’s evidence addressed both subclause (a) and (b) of the definition; and thirdly, the ultimate decision to withdraw charge 18 was to confine the issues in dispute and save Court time, and no evidence prepared up to that time was wasted as a result of the withdrawal.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that because of an assertion in the earlier letter from the prosecutor that the defendant could be convicted on both charges, the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause. Alternatively, I am not satisfied that in the circumstances the discretion to order costs should be exercised.
	


THE DISMISSED Charge 17

s 257D(1)(a): charge 17


	
	The defendant submits, first, that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner within the meaning of s 257D(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	An investigation which fails to meet optimum standards is not necessarily unreasonable. The test is objective and does not necessarily impugn the general competence or integrity of those responsible for the investigation: J D v DPP [2000] NSWSC 1092 at [30]-[31]; Pittwater Council v A1 Professional Tree Recycling Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] NSWLEC 21, 165 LGERA 6 at [7], [15(d)].
	
	
	The defendant submits that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner because of gross deficiencies in the conduct of the inspection and sampling undertaken on 27 June 2012, references to which punctuate the findings in the principal judgment at [136]-[169].
	
	
	I entertained reasonable doubt about the evidence of onsite unusual observations. Mr Bailey’s observation was that he saw sediment-laden water enter the creek, on which he was not directly cross-examined. That evidence does not suggest an unreasonable or improper investigation. There was no bad faith nor any impropriety on the part of Mr Bailey, who was simply doing his job as a Council compliance officer. The fact that there was no photograph of the sediment-laden water at its alleged confluence with creek does not mean that his investigation was unreasonable. The water sampling by Mr Bailey found to be unreliable was put forward by the prosecution as a backup to his visual observations; the latter comprised the principal basis of the prosecution case. Mr Bailey could have done a better job by taking further water samples and documenting his observations as he took the samples, but I do not think that sufficient to attract an adverse costs order. The defendant’s no case submission at the end of the prosecutor’s case did not extend to the water pollution case. In the circumstance, I am not satisfied that for the submitted reason the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner or, alternatively, that the discretion to order costs should be exercised.
	
	
	The defendant then submits that the investigations were conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner within the meaning of s 257D(1)(a) because the investigators failed to take any contemporaneous notes and, in the case of Mr Bailey, he prepared a memorandum to file some months after the date that it bore, which he subsequently amended.
	
	
	It would have been better if Mr Bailey had made contemporaneous file notes, however he did take photographs to record his on-site observations. The fact that he prepared a file note a few months after the event was not “improper” not “unreasonable”. I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	
	
	The defendant then submits that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or an improper manner within the meaning of s 257D(1)(a) because, as I found at trial, the POEO Act record of interview of the defendant on 26 September 2012 was obtained improperly.
	
	
	At the start of the trial the defendant made two challenges to the prosecutor’s evidence. The first challenge was that Mr Bailey was not an expert for the purposes of the Evidence Act 1995. The second challenge was that the record of interview with the defendant was conducted improperly under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The first challenge was determined in favour of the prosecutor. The second challenge was determined in favour of the defendant. It seems appropriate that both parties should bear their own costs of the voir dire. Further, the record of interview was not admitted into evidence on the basis of a failure to adequately caution the defendant under s 138 of the Evidence Act. However, Mr Bailey did attempt the caution required by law. The interview was conducted in good faith and for a proper purpose and did not involve any element of bad faith. The failure to properly caution falls short of the conduct required to trigger the threshold in s 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act. For these reasons I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	


s 257D(1)(b): charge 17


	
	The defendant submits that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause within the meaning of s 257D(1)(b).
	
	
	Failure of proceedings does not, of itself, mean they were initiated without reasonable cause: A1 Professional Tree Recycling at [10], [14] and [15(a)]. One way of testing whether they were initiated without reasonable cause is to ask whether, objectively assessed on the facts apparent to the prosecutor at the time of initiating the proceedings they had no substantial prospect of success or were doomed to failure. The question may be answered by reference to the quality of the evidence gathered, with an eye to the enquiries made and not made: A1 Professional Tree Recycling at [13] and [15(e)]; J D v DPP at [28].
	
	
	The defendant submits that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause because the investigation was substandard for the reasons that I have earlier addressed, such that they had no substantial prospect of success. This is said to be because the investigation failed to procure reliable evidence of change to the physical condition of the creek waters by runoff from the fire trail, and the investigators took no contemporaneous notes and gave inconsistent versions of events.
	
	
	Detailed cross-examination by senior counsel for the defendant was instrumental in my entertaining a reasonable doubt about the standard of the investigation. I accepted Mr Bailey’s evidence of water overtopping the fence and heading towards the creek. However, I found that his evidence was compromised by the absence of, inter alia, photographs and contemporaneous notes. In the circumstances, I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	
	
	The defendant then submits that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause because, even assuming water pollution had been established, it was principally as a result of Mr Bailey’s stop-work notice of 1 June 2012 and his subsequent refusal to lift it, and it should be inferred that Council did not consider the causal significance of the stop-work notice when initiating the proceedings.
	
	
	The charge was based in part on the premise that the defendant caused the pollution as the occupier of the premises. I found that he was not an occupier within the statutory concept because his management and control of the premises was taken away from him by the stop-work notice. On the other hand, sediment control fences were not the subject of the stop-work notice. Photographs showed sediment fences that had fallen down, with sediment build-up and sediment-laden water flowing over them. I made no finding that the work that the defendant was prevented from undertaking would have resulted in no pollution at all. In the circumstances, I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	
	
	The defendant then submits that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause because Council initiated the proceedings without properly considering the matters identified in its own Corporate Enforcement Policy. The defendant relies on the fact that the prosecutor has not produced any document showing any consideration of the circumstances which that policy calls for consideration, other than a document entitled “Courses of Actions Available for Road Constructions” created by Mr Bailey, which does not mention POEO Act charges and (the defendant submits) consideration of matters which should have been taken into account before initiating those charges.
	
	
	The policy does not compel the creation of a written document to demonstrate that the policy has been considered. It states that its aim is to establish key guidelines for the exercise of discretion in dealing with actions, requests or complains about unlawful activity. There is no case authority which attaches significance for consideration of such a policy prior to the commencement of Class 5 criminal proceedings in this Court. Mr Bailey was not cross-examined about his decision to take such proceedings. In all the circumstances, I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	


s 257D(1)(b): charge 17


	
	The defendant submits that the proceedings were conducted in an improper manner within the meaning of s 257D(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act by reason of failure to disclose nine relevant affidavits sworn by prosecution witnesses until the third day of the trial.
	
	
	The affidavits should have been disclosed. The prosecutor’s submissions record the unreserved apology of the Council’s solicitor for the late disclosure of the affidavits. Given the principle that costs are compensatory and not punitive, the failure to disclose does not, in my opinion, sound in any adverse costs consequences.
	


s 257D(1)(c): charge 17


	
	The defendant submits that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to properly investigate relevant matters of which it was aware which suggested the defendant might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought within the meaning of s 257D(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The defendant relies on the fact that it served on the prosecutor six months before the trial statements of evidence of experts raising matters which, the defendant submits, seriously called into question the viability of the prosecution case and whether the charges should have been brought. The defendant contends that the prosecutor failed to properly investigate those matters and, in its statutory response, rejected the positions put by the experts. The defendant says that it is to be inferred that the prosecutor failed to properly investigate those matters.
	
	
	In my view it was reasonable for the prosecutor to advance a case relying on its expert evidence. The defendant, as he was entitled to do, declined to agree to a suggestion that the experts participate in joint conferencing. There can be no criticism of the defendant for this but it does demonstrate the different nature of criminal proceedings compared with civil proceedings in this Court where joint conferencing routinely identifies matters upon which the experts agree and disagree and the reasons for disagreement. I am not satisfied that it has been established that the prosecutor failed to reasonably investigate as alleged by the defendant.
	


s 257D(1)(d): charge 17


	
	In the alternative, the defendant submits that the issuing of the stop-work notice and the breach of the duty of disclosure (referred to earlier) each constitutes an exceptional circumstance relating to the conduct of the prosecution which justifies an order for costs pursuant to s 257D(1)(d). If these matters have not already been disposed of earlier, then substantially for the reasons given earlier when considering them on other statutory bases, I decline to order costs on this basis.
	


INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION RESERVED BY SHEAHAN J 12 JULY 2013


	
	On 12 July 2013 the defendants successfully applied to the Court an order that the prosecutor provide a hard copy of its enforcement file to the defendant.
	
	
	The prosecutor had agreed to provide a soft copy of the file to the defendant. Sheahan J makes no adverse finding about the manner in which the prosecutor proposed to provide access to its enforcement file. The prosecutor was simply ordered to provide a hard copy. It might be thought that the prosecutor’s position was not unreasonable having regard to what is now an accepted practice of providing discovery in electronic form. In my opinion, no provision of s 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act is enlivened. I do not accept the defendant’s submission.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	There will be no order as to costs.

		13 April 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Land and Environment Court
2766293,R v Kassis [2015] NSWDC 178,"SENTENCE


	
	Mark Kassis pleaded guilty on 12 December 2014 to two offences in an indictment. Those offences are as follows:
	


One, between 5 March 2013 and 19 April 2013, at Putney in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the manufacture of an amount of a prohibited drug, namely, 7,008.63 grams of 4 Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.

Two, on 19 April 2013, at Putney in the State of New South Wales, did supply an amount of a prohibited drug, namely, 426.5 grams of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, being an amount which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.


	
	The first offence is contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The amount being not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug, the maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is imprisonment for life and/or 5,000 penalty units, pursuant to s 33(3) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	
	
	The large commercial quantity prescribed for the drug known as Nexus is 100 grams or 0.1 kilogram. Accordingly, the amount here was in the order of 70 times the large commercial quantity.
	
	
	The maximum penalty available for this offence, as already noted, is life, which means actual life imprisonment: s 33A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Although s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) does not apply in this case.
	
	
	The section attracts a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	The maximum penalty prescribed for count two, it being an offence contrary to s 25(2)/29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, is imprisonment for 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units. This offence attracts a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The commercial quantity prescribed for the drug known as Ecstasy is 125 grams. The amount here is in excess of three times the commercial quantity.
	
	
	I convict Mr Kassis of both of these offences.
	
	
	There is also an offence of supply prohibited drug, being 6.05 grams of amphetamine, on 19 April 2014 at Merrylands. This offence is to be taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of count one. The amount, 6.05 grams, is twice the trafficable quantity, the trafficable quantity prescribed, being in the Schedule, being three grams. The indictable quantity is five grams.
	


PLEA OF GUILTY


	
	The plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, he is entitled to a reduction of 25 percent for utilitarian considerations only. The indictment was presented only because there was a defect in the Court Attendance Notice.
	
	
	I am of the view that 25 percent is appropriate even though evidence had to be given in respect of disputed facts: R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [27].
	
	
	The mitigating factor found in s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:
	


“the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”.


	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty. This is a case though where I reject his account of his involvement in relation to all three offences. Put another way, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities his account is truthful. I will return to that shortly.
	
	
	Further, even on his account, he has not acknowledged the injury, loss or damage caused by his actions.
	
	
	He has nowhere acknowledged the very considerable harm to others resulting from the dissemination of drugs into the community. He said in his evidence he did not consider himself responsible for the consequences to the community. The prisoner in his evidence effectively took no responsibility for what was going on (see cross-examination, transcript 16/12/2014 p 37 lines 44-46 and p 38 line 44 through to p 40 line 15).
	
	
	In his letter to the Court dated 27 August 2014, he says, “I’ve let my family down and the community.” There is no acknowledgement of the damage occasioned by his offending behaviour. In a number of the testimonials there is reference to his remorse. The comments are made though in the context of the effect on his family or with no specific reference made in respect of damage to the community.
	
	
	I am not satisfied, even on the balance of probabilities, he is entitled to this mitigating feature. I am in fact satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he is not.
	


FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE


	
	The agreed facts form part of Exhibit A and are as follows:
	


""In November 2012, a strike force was established as a joint investigation between the New South Wales Police Force and the New South Wales Crime Commission of police investigations to investigate the drug related activities of Mark Kassis (the offender) and associates. Throughout the course of this investigation, police monitored as well as made observations of his activities and recorded intercepted information which involved his physical surveillance and telephone interception.

During November until his arrest on 19 April 2013, the offender resided at a rented property at 27 Patten Avenue, Merrylands. He owned the property at 2 Riverside Avenue, Putney, which consists of a front house and a freestanding granny flat at the rear. The front house has an automatic security lock-up gate that opens from the Riverside Avenue road.

The granny flat at the rear is separated from the front house by a white colorbond fence with no interconnecting door or access between the two premises. The granny flat can be accessed from outside through a remote roller garage door built into the side fence of it. There is no other entry/exit way to it.

About 20 February 2013, police commenced a recorded surveillance on the property at 2 Riverside Avenue, Putney, which continued intermittently on a few days. The offender was observed to access only the granny flat through the roller garage door entry from the side street.

SEARCH WARRANT AT 2 RIVERSIDE AVENUE, PUTNEY

Following regular but non-continuous recorded surveillance conducted on the property since about 5 March 2013, on 18 April 2013, police conducted a recorded covert search at the granny flat. During the covert search, police relevantly located in the kitchen a quantity of powder located in a tub on kitchen bench, a tablet with CK logo in top drawer, a tablet with Superman logo in top drawer, a large number of white tablets in a “Glad” plastic bag in top drawer, 150 tablets in a resealable “Glad” plastic bag in top drawer. Main room, one pill in a rimmed tub, 7,000 to 8,000 tablets with CK logo in plastic containers on a chair. Second bedroom, a large quantity of tablets (about 7,000 to 8,000) in a blue sports bag on a table, a large quantity of powder located in 15 containers on a table, a large quantity of brown powder in a clear plastic container on a table, a number of plastic and yellow gloves, bottles of water, one Superman metal punch near a pill press on a white plastic tray, a number of metal punches with CK , Superman and Mitsubishi brand logos.

Police seized a number of items including a large quantity of tablets and Mount Franklin bottles but the remaining items were left in situ. On 18 April 2013, police installed listening device/s and commenced a 24 hour surveillance on both 2 Riverside Avenue, Putney, and the offender’s residence at 27 Patten Avenue, Merrylands.

About 8am on 19 April 2013, the offender was observed to drive into Riverside Avenue, Putney, and enter the granny flat. A short time later, as he left the granny flat and was walking on Church Street, police arrested him.

Police returned him to the granny flat confines and he was informed of his arrest on video camera. Police conducted a frisk search on him with nothing of relevance located and conveyed him to Ryde Police Station where he was entered into custody. He declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview with a suspected person but consented to a forensic procedure. The offender was charged with the offence of manufacturing prohibited drugs.

On the same date, a recorded crime scene warrant was executed at the subject granny flat and further exhibit items were seized from there.

On 23 July 2013, upon analysis, the tablets and powder were found to contain 7,008.57 grams of 4 Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, with an estimated purity of 1.5 percent (commonly known as Nexus), and 426.5 grams of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, with an estimated purity of 8 percent.""


	
	I interrupt to note the Crown, with no objection from the defence, have now tendered all of the Analyst’s Certificates and in fact the total of “Nexus” in tablet and powder form is 7,008.63 grams. Nothing turns on this minute difference. I do note that in the indictment the amount charged in respect of count one is in fact 7,008.63 grams.
	
	
	As noted in the certificates, the total weight of the “Nexus” tablets was 6,919.3 grams.
	
	
	Returning then to the agreed facts:
	


""SEARCH WARRANT AT 27 PATTEN AVENUE, MERRYLANDS

Later on 19 April 2013, a recorded search warrant was executed at the offender’s residence at 27 Patten Avenue, Merrylands. Police located two plastic bags containing orange crystals in the garage. Police located a set of scales and a sum of cash in the laundry. Police located food saver bags, a number of plastic resealable bags and a number of gloves from the kitchen.

On 26 July 2013, upon analysis, the crystalline substances were found to contain 6.05 grams of amphetamine (Form 1 matter).

DNA / FINGERPRINT

On 12 August 2013, the profile found on the three handles of the blue sports bag that contained tablets and the mouthpiece of one Mount Franklin bottle that was found in the garbage box from within the granny flat was found to match with the offender’s DNA. No fingerprints were found.

Police obtained CCTV footage and a receipt of purchase from a shop dated 7 April 2013. The footage depicts the offender in the vicinity of the store at the time the bags were purchased. This bag is similar to the blue sports bag which was found to contain a large quantity of tablets at the granny flat at 2 Riverside Avenue, Putney, and which returned a positive DNA match with him.

During police surveillance, the offender was the only person seen to enter and remain at the granny flat, other than on one occasion, on 26 March 2013, when another person was seen to leave the granny flat with the offender.

It is agreed by the parties that the offender’s role was a little more than merely providing the premises for the purpose of manufacturing the prohibited drugs.""


	
	In the defence written submissions and the psychological report of Dr Milic, dated 22 August 2014, and in the sworn evidence of the prisoner, he gave an account of his involvement. In a summary way, he said he only allowed this person to have a pill press in the flat. He did not agree to any manufacture taking place.
	


“A few days later I walked into the granny flat to discover that there was actually a process of manufacturing taking course in the granny flat and this is when I panicked and I went and saw the gentleman that I had an agreement with, a friend and I asked him to remove everything from the granny flat. He asked for a two to three week period to be able to remove everything that he had put in there.” (Examination-in-chief, transcript 16/12/14, p 9 line 46 to p 10 line 1)

He explained the bags in his sworn evidence in the following way:

“Q.   We’ve also heard evidence that pills were stored in certain blue bags, what can you tell us about those blue bags?

A.   Well when I saw what I saw and I gave the person the time he requested to remove all the stuff in the granny flat, things weren’t moving quickly so I went and purchased some bags and put them in there to decide what to do, whether I should pick up the stuff and move them elsewhere to one of his associates or just keep them in there and give a little bit more time and wait and see if they can move them themselves.

Q.   So how did the blue bags come into it?

A.   To help them pack stuff and get them out of there asap.

Q.   And you indicated to him that you were prepared to move them yourself, is that what you’re saying?

A.   Well at the time I said to him you’ve got to be out of there within two, three week period as he insisted first because at the time I was panicking about the whole situation and so to help the situation I purchased those bags and I left them there.

Q.   And you offered to take them to another one of his associates?

A.   Anywhere, just to get them out of my way.” (Examination-in-chief, transcript 16/12/14, p 10 line 32 to p 11 line 5)

In cross-examination, he said at p 39 lines 16-26:

“Q.   And you are saying it is not your responsibility as to what happens with it?

A.   No, I just needed to get it out of there.

HER HONOUR

Q.   But you didn’t?

A.   But my intentions were, that’s why I got the bags to get everything out of there, but when he said, ‘Give me those few weeks’, I was sitting there tippy-toeing, don’t know what to do till I had to make that decision myself. ‘Take it and dump it anywhere, I need you to get it out of my way and out of there.’”

This is the supply. And he explained the Form 1 in the following way:

“Q.   You’ve also entered a plea in relation to - sorry, you’ve asked her Honour to take into account the possession of a certain amount of amphetamine that was located in the garage of the premises where you live?

A. Yes.

Q.   What can you tell us about that?

A.   Well the amphetamine, I have a chronic back injury that I normally take medication for but at times I use those amphetamine just to get me through the day when medication doesn’t help. I’ve had it for a long time so I use some of that and at times when I’m at home playing, I do play a little bit of poker games, private games, I use some of that when games go on for 24 to 48 hours, I use some of that and I also give to my friends that are there just to help assist us in prolonging the game.

Q.   Do you still use amphetamines or were you still using amphetamines before you went into custody?

A.   From time to time, sparingly according to what I’m doing.

Q.   When was the last time you had amphetamines?

A.   Maybe six months ago, before my arrest.” (Examination-in-chief, transcript 16/12/14, p 11 lines 7 to 26.)


	
	By way of comparison, in relation to this, in the psychological report it is said “shortly before he began a supportive relationship with his wife in his early thirties, he gave up recreational drugs.”
	
	
	I find his account inherently implausible. The account is in my view tailored to the Crown case. Put another way, it explains the evidence against him in an exculpatory way and he concedes to no more.
	
	
	I am aware his account, being in his favour, it is sufficient it be proved on the balance of probabilities. I do not accept his account, even on the balance of probabilities, in relation to any of the offences.
	
	
	I reject his account beyond reasonable doubt, in addition to what I have noted, for the following reasons:
	



	
	Only one other person was seen to enter the flat, even though there was surveillance. The Crown said in the written submissions:
	


“During 60.12 hours of police active surveillance since November 2012 until up to his arrest on 19 March 2013, there was only one occasion when one other male person was observed to leave the granny flat with him on 26 March 2013. Except for that one occasion, it was only the offender who was seen to attend regularly and remain at the granny flat, on occasions over a number of hours.”


	
	The granny flat was his. He owned the whole property.
	
	
	On his account, what the police had implicating him, or the independent evidence against him, just happened to disclose his exact participation. This coincidence is just not believable.
	
	
	Again in relation to the supply, he says he bought the bags to get the “stuff” out. Defence counsel phrased it in this way at transcript p 53 of 16 December 2014, lines 31 to 41:
	


“MARTIN: My understanding is that he is in effect saying that he’s prepared to take this stuff and take it from one person’s possession and deliver it to another. He’s making that offer to the manufacturer. He is agreeing to supply and agreeing to supply is supply.

HER HONOUR: To supply to a cohort or a confidant of the--

MARTIN: Or accomplice or something but it’s another person, it’s a person other than the manufacturer. That, in my submission, is enough for a supply.

HER HONOUR: So it’s actually an agreement to supply.”

As noted in the cross-examination above, he varied this somewhat in his evidence.

This is inherently unbelievable. I fail to see how a person, if indeed the other “real” offender exists, as Mr Kassis would have it, could not have obtained his own bags. The bags would have been of no use clearly in relation to the pill press.


	
	In the written submissions, the account concerning the blue bag is different. At [9] it is said:
	


“It is noted that about 7,000 to 8,000 of the pills were found in a blue sports bag on a table in the second bedroom and that the offender’s DNA was found on the handles of the sports bag. It is submitted this does not demonstrate that he purchased the bag and/or handled it for that purpose. Rather it is our instructions that he purchased it for tools associated with his business in strata building maintenance and renovation work. He was also in the process of renovating the granny flat and associated house. The bag was thereafter just opportunistically used by the principal to store his/her pills.”


	
	As to the supply amphetamine on the Form 1, because of the nature of his evidence generally, I assessed him as a person completely lacking in credit and again I reject his exculpatory account of the supply of the amphetamine.
	



	
	On the other hand, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the facts the Crown contends for adverse to the prisoner.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will sentence the prisoner on the basis of the agreed facts, including:
	


“16 It is agreed by the parties that the accused’s role was a little more than merely providing the premises for the purpose of manufacturing the prohibited drugs.”


	
	There is a lack of particularity concerning the supply, being count two, in the agreed facts. I will sentence the prisoner on the basis that he was in possession of the 426.5 grams for the purposes of supply. I make no finding as to the exact circumstances beyond the essential elements of the offence, except to say the MDMA, known as Ecstasy, was part of the enterprise being undertaken in the granny flat in respect of which the prisoner’s role “was a little more than merely providing the premises for the purpose of manufacturing the prohibited drugs.” He is not though of course charged with manufacturing in relation to the Ecstasy.
	
	
	The Analyst’s Certificates disclose the MDMA tablets weighed 39.0 grams and 360.4 grams, a total of 399.4 grams in tablet form. The MDMA powder weighed 27.1 grams, the total being 426.5 grams.
	
	
	In relation to the supply on the Form, I will take that into account on the basis he had all of the drugs for the purposes of supply, the essential elements of the offence.
	
	
	In relation to the seriousness of the offence, each of the offences in the indictment are objectively serious. They are given the amounts involved and the basis upon which I am sentencing the prisoner: Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [25] to [27] (Hoeben CJ at CL). Put another way, each is a serious example of the behaviour made criminal by each of the sections: R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27]-[33] (Simpson J).
	
	
	The maximum penalties and standard non parole periods specified in respect of each count, life and 15 years in respect of count one and 20 years and 10 years in respect of count two, are not “mere formality, but a yardstick created by the legislature to guide sentencing courts”: R v Li [2014] NSWCCA 327 at [55], also at [51] (Fullerton J).
	
	
	Weight must be given to the offence on the Form.
	


DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS AND SUBJECTIVE FEATURES


	
	In the defence written submissions, the following is found at [12]:
	


“It is also important to note the Nexus pills only had a purity of 1.5 percent, the powder only 8 percent, there were no cutting agents found and their value would have been at the lowest end of the range.”


	
	No expert evidence concerning purity was tendered: Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141.
	
	
	Further, the Crown in the written submissions, in relation to the pills, says at [14]:
	


“In relation to the defence submission in respect of the purity of the prohibited drug Nexus in this matter, Crown refer to the case of Wu v R [2010] NSWCCA 286 at [30], in which the Court stated:

‘There is no doubt that in some cases purity is important but that is particularly so when the drugs are of a nature such that the purity can be reduced so as to provide more doses and commonly greater profit. Drugs in powder form such as heroin and cocaine commonly fall into this category. However, when the drug is of a nature that it is commonly sold in tablet form, of sufficient strength to be of merchantable quality, and with a view to being consumed without further dilution the purity does not seem to me to be of such great significance. It is by no means unlikely that when Parliament enacted Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, it was aware of the forms in which various drugs were commonly sold and that the specification of quantities reflected to some extent these sorts of considerations. It is clear from the extent of the Applicant’s activities that what he was selling was regarded by his customers as of merchantable quality, and in those circumstances, I do not regard the purity of the drugs in this case of significant materiality.’”

See also Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 at [43] and Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 at [63]. The Court in those cases held prohibited drugs in tablet form are ordinarily designed for supply in that form to end users without further processing so that the issue of purity is of less importance in such a case.


	
	I turn now to the emphasis placed in the written and oral submissions by the defence on R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; 221 A Crim R 63. The relevance of this case is greatly diminished and indeed misplaced if it is relevant at all, as the case did not consider an offence with a standard non-parole period in respect of the drug offence (see oral defence submissions, transcript 19/12/14, page 8 lines 14 to 17). The offence charged is conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug (amphetamine) in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity. Conspiracy does not attract a standard non-parole period: Li at [2]:
	


“The sentencing judge mistakenly assumed that the conspiracy count also attracted a standard non-parole period of 15 years (R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; 221 A Crim R 64 at [38]).”


	
	The standard non-parole period does apply to the offence of knowingly take part: Hosseini v R [2009] NSWCCA 52; 193 A Crim R 444 at [53]:
	


“For the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, the standard non-parole period provisions apply to an offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of the large commercial quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The standard non-parole period prescribed is fifteen years: Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and Table item 17.”

See also Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326 at [53].


	
	The case of R v El-Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455 also did not consider an offence with a standard non-parole period. The offending took place between 1995 and 1996, well before 1 February 2003. Standard non-parole periods, when first enacted, applied and still apply to offences committed after 1 February 2003: Act 90 of 2002, being the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 (NSW) (compare increase in penalty in relation to s 61M(2) offences, 1 January 2008).
	
	
	The case of Hill v R [2012] NSWCCA 265 did consider a standard non-parole period offence of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The case was recently considered in Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264.
	
	
	In Hill, there was only one offence and nothing on a Form. There were very favourable subjective features. A reduction of 50 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea and past and future assistance was applied. A finding was made favourable to him as to why he participated in the offending.
	
	
	In Briouzguine, the following is found at [76]:
	


“Most recently in MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41] to [44], Bellew J (Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreeing) commented upon the difficulties which are prone to arise from comparative exercises based on a limited number of cases presented to the Court as demonstrating some established sentencing range for particular offences. His Honour’s observations bear repeating.

’41   Firstly, consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence. What is sought is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles: Hili v R at [48] to [49].

42   Secondly, in seeking consistency, other cases may establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But the sentences imposed in other cases do not mark the outer bounds of the permissible sentencing discretion. They stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important are the unifying principles which such sentences reveal and reflect: Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2, 305 ALR 323 at [41].

43   Thirdly, the presentation of sentences passed in the form of numerical tables and graphs is of limited use: Hili (supra) at [48]. This is because reference to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why the sentences were fixed as they were.

44   Consistent with such statements of principle, this Court has emphasised the need to adopt a careful approach when asked to utilise statistics: R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Johnson J agreeing. A similarly careful approach is required when the Court is asked to compare a sentence imposed in one case with a sentence imposed in another: RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [132] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing. The need to take care in each instance arises, in part, from the fundamental fact that there will inevitably be differences, both in terms of the objective circumstances of offending and the subjective circumstances of the offender, between one case and another.’”


	
	Accepting the law is the amount involved is not determinative however it remains a relevant consideration, here the manufacture concerned in excess of seven kilograms, 70 times the large commercial quantity. The MDMA was in excess of three times the commercial quantity.
	
	
	There was no evidence of any dissemination of these drugs into the community. The defence, at [25] of the written submissions, rely on the judgment of R S Hulme J in DW in support of the proposition this feature lessens the criminality. This was not a case though involving an undercover operative. Further, in the case of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [172], a different view of this matter was taken. Also R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103, R v Gao; R v Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343, R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 at [88]-[97], and Aoun at [65]. These cases speak of the limited relevance of non-dissemination of drugs into the community. I only give little weight to this consideration in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	I have taken into account all of the material tendered in the defence case.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 11 July 1970. He is now aged 44 and about nine months. He was aged 42 when the offences were committed.
	
	
	He is a person with no prior convictions. He is previously a person of good character. I consider his prospects for rehabilitation are only reasonable given my findings concerning his honesty and his failure to take responsibility for the potential damage to others as a result of his offending behaviour.
	
	
	It is to his credit that he has been working hard whilst in custody.
	
	
	It is extremely difficult to assess whether a person will or will not offend again. I make no finding one way or another.
	
	
	I have read and taken into account the content of the psychological report. He had a difficult background. He has worked hard. He has abused drugs and gambled to excess.
	
	
	I take into account the testimonials. Each speak highly of him. He is supported by his wife and his in-laws.
	
	
	He has health issues. I am of the view though, the two reports from Justice Health, dated 26 August 2014 and 1 December 2014, disclose his concerns are being investigated and he is receiving treatment whilst in custody. These two reports form part of the material tendered by the Crown.
	
	
	His wife has health concerns. In the psychological report of Dr Mark Milic, dated 11 December 2014, about the prisoner’s wife, item 21 in the defence sentence material, there is reference to reports of Dr Andrew Pesce, not tendered, being 1 August 2013 and a medical certificate dated 7 November 2014 saying major surgery was planned for 15 December 2014 regarding severe endometriosis and she would be unfit for work until the end of January 2015. In the report at p 4, it says the surgery was postponed to 5 January 2015 from 15 December 2014.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to whether this surgery took place or not. What is clear though is she has been able to maintain, at least as at 11 December 2014, full-time employment in a responsible position for nearly five years and she runs a part-time business.
	
	
	In my view, this case is far removed from being exceptional. In Mokhaiber v R [2011] NSWCCA 10, Price J said at [30]:
	


“It is settled principle that hardship to members of an offender’s family is generally irrelevant as it can be assumed that imprisonment will cause hardship to others in the offender’s family. Hardship to family members caused by a prison term can only be taken into account in ‘highly exceptional circumstances’: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516-517 per Gleeson CJ.”


	
	It is a subjective circumstance: R v X [2004] NSWCCA 93, R v Girard; R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21] and [22]. One though, in the circumstances of this case, I give minimal weight to. Unfortunately, the wives and children of prisoners are almost inevitably affected by the incarceration of the husband and/or father. See also Winter v R [2011] NSWCCA 59.
	
	
	I do accept the prisoner is concerned about his wife.
	


CROWN SUBMISSIONS


	
	I have taken into account the Crown written submissions, in particular the submissions concerning hardship to family.
	
	
	The Crown noted at [20]:
	


“In the case of R v Reardon (1996) 89 A Crim R 180 at 194, the Court stated that ‘the manufacture of drugs is a serious offence, involving a high degree of criminality which calls for condign punishment.’”

At [25]:

“Crown submits that the need for personal and general deterrence remains of paramount importance in this type of matters.”


	
	Clearly, general deterrence must be a significant feature of this sentencing exercise. Also, some weight needs to be given to specific deterrence.
	
	
	The defence submitted the sentences should be served concurrently. The Crown submitted there should be partial accumulation. I accept the Crown submission. The partial accumulation should be very modest.
	
	
	In relation to special circumstances, Mr Martin submitted at transcript 19/12/14, p 8 line 36 ff there were a number of features giving rise to special circumstances. There has recently been an amount of authority in the Court of Criminal Appeal as to what special circumstances are not. I am of the view the following in combination are special circumstances: this is his first custodial sentence, a need for assistance to integrate back into the community after a lengthy period in custody, and his reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Also, his background of depression and excessive gambling can be better treated in the community. In relation to count one, the partial accumulation.
	
	
	The effective non-parole period imposed in this case is the one which in my view appropriately reflects the objective seriousness of the offending, the requirement for general deterrence and the subjective matters.
	
	
	I have given careful consideration to the principle of totality.
	


SENTENCES


	
	Count two: The sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction for utilitarian considerations of 25 percent is 5 years. That reduced by 25 percent is 3 years, 9 months. The non-parole period I impose is one of 2 years, 3 months, commencing on 19 April 2013 and expiring on 18 July 2015. The total term is 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 19 April 2013 and expiring on 18 January 2017.
	
	
	Count one and the offence on the Form: Taking into account the offence on the Form, the sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction for utilitarian considerations of 25 percent is 10 years and 3 months. That reduced by 25 percent is 7 years, 8 months, 1 week, rounded to 7 years and 8 months. The non-parole period I impose is one of 4 years and 10 months, commencing on 19 June 2013 and expiring on 18 April 2018. The total term is 7 years and 8 months, commencing on 19 June 2013 and expiring on 18 February 2021.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total effective sentence is 7 years and 10 months, and the total effective custodial component is 5 years.
	
	
	The allowance for special circumstances in relation to the total sentence is 10.5 months. If released on parole on the consideration date, the prisoner will still be supervised in the community for 2 years and 10 months. This is ample, in my view, in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The special circumstances are those noted in my remarks on sentence.
	
	
	You will be eligible for consideration for consideration for release to parole on 18 April 2018.
	
	
	I make an order that the drugs be destroyed and any equipment, including the pill press, be forfeited to the State.

2766294,R v Simmons (No 5) (Non-Publication Orders) [2015] NSWSC 333,"Judgment


	
	According to Wikipedia, “Mr Big” is a police procedure and investigative technique first developed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia in the early 1990’s for the purpose of investigating cold case homicides: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Big_%28police_procedure%29. It is also referred to as “the Canadian technique” and the “scenario technique”.
	
	
	Various police forces around Australia have used the technique: L Struesser, “Mr Big comes to Australia”, Bond University Publications, [2008] The National Legal Eagle 14(1).
	
	
	The technique was used in June 2002 by Victoria Police to entrap a man (Shane Hill) into a confession to murder. Victorian Police also used it in 3 other cases in the early 2000’s. Those four Victorian cases were subject to an appeal to the High Court: Tofilau v The Queen [2007] HCA 39; 231 CLR 396.
	
	
	There are other examples of the use of the technique. For example the technique was deployed successfully in a case called R v Cowan [2013] QSC 337. That case, involving the abduction and murder of a little boy, attracted extensive publicity in the print and electronic media.
	
	
	In New South Wales a variation of the technique was successfully used in Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 9 and R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952.
	
	
	The technique was also employed between September 2012 and January 2013 in the investigation into the disappearance of Andrew Russell. Mr Russell was a resident of Bathurst who was, on the prosecution case, last seen alive on 2 June 2009. The case was initially treated as a missing persons investigation. By 2012 it was treated as a cold case homicide. Investigators targeted the accused man (Tony Simmons) by employing the “Canadian” or “Mr Big” style of covert investigation. Admissions were made in the course of that investigation and I have made a ruling in the trial that those admissions are admissible against Mr Simmons: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143. Mr Simmons is now on trial for the murder of Mr Russell.
	
	
	The NSW Commissioner of Police (“the Commissioner”) seeks non-publication orders in relation to the investigative technique used in this case as well as suppression, non-publication and pseudonym orders to protect the identities of the undercover officers who carried out the covert investigation. The orders are sought pursuant to the Law Enforcement & National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010 (NSW) (“LENS Act”) and the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (“Suppression Act”).
	
	
	The application was brought by notice of motion dated 16 February 2015 which was the first day of the trial of Mr Simmons and his (then) co-accused Mr Moore. There were a series of pre-trial applications and the trial itself (which is being conducted by judge alone) commenced on 25 March 2015 and is continuing.
	
	
	Neither the Crown nor the defence in the trial have taken any position in relation to the application by the Commissioner of Police although Mr Young of Senior Counsel did share some helpful observations and insights into its merit. No media organisation or other interested party has played a role and so the application has to be considered in the absence of a “contradictor”.
	
	
	On 16 February 2015 the Commissioner, ably represented by Mr Bhalla instructed by the NSW Crown Solicitor, read an open affidavit, a confidential affidavit and number of confidential exhibits. Written submissions were made in support of the 24 specific orders sought by the notice of motion. On 16 February 2015, I granted leave to file the notice of motion in Court and ordered that the motion be returnable immediately. I made orders that 11 witnesses nominated in the notice of motion be referred to by their assumed names in the course of the hearing of the notice of motion. Having considered the evidence and submissions, I made the following orders:
	


“1. The 11 witnesses referred to in orders 3 to 13 be allowed to appear before the Court at the hearing of these proceedings under their respective assumed names. For clarity, those witnesses are referred to in their statements as [REDACTED].

2. The witnesses be otherwise referred to by their assumed names during the course of the hearing, during the course of any other or further interlocutory proceedings conducted in connection with these proceedings and for all purposes in these proceedings.

3. There be no publication or other disclosure of the real identity of the witnesses or of any document, evidence or other disclosure that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the real identities of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.

4. There be no publication or other disclosure of the assumed identities or assumed names of the witnesses or of any document or evidence that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the assumed names of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.

5. Without limiting the generality of orders 3 and 4, there be no publication or other disclosure of any visual or other description or depiction of the physical appearances or any other identifying features of the witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.

6. That the Court be closed for the duration of the evidence given by the witnesses, subject to the following being permitted to be present in court while they give their evidence:

(a) the accused and their legal representatives;

(b) the legal representatives of the prosecution;

(c) officers of the New South Wales Police Force involved in investigating the offences before the Court and officers of the New South Wales Police Force attached to the New South Wales Police Force Undercover Program so long as they are not themselves required to give evidence after any of the witnesses;

(d) legal representatives for the Commissioner of Police;

(e) staff of the Department of Corrective Services;

(f) court staff; and

(g) any person sworn or affirmed as a member of a jury in the trial.

7. Orders 3 through to 5 are to apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia pursuant to s 11 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act.

8. Those orders are to apply until any further order of the Court pursuant to s 12 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act.

9. There be no publication of any evidence or submissions given or made in the course of the pre-trial voir dire, such order to remain in effect until any further order of the Court and to apply throughout the Commonwealth.”


	
	See R v Simmons; R v Moore [2015] NSWSC 73 at [6].
	
	
	The purpose of those orders, made pursuant to the LENS Act and the Court Suppression Act, was to protect the identity and safety of the witnesses. My reasons are disclosed in the brief ex tempore judgment published on 16 February 2015.
	
	
	At that stage, I did not resolve the question of the Commissioner’s application for non-publication orders in relation to the methodology and details of the investigation. Rather, as a practical solution, I ordered that there be no publication of any of the evidence led or submissions made on the voir dire until the end of the trial or until further order. It was anticipated that the trial would be by jury and the purpose of the order was to protect the integrity of that process although it also had the effect of protecting the interests of the Commissioner.
	
	
	I have since handed down three judgments in the trial: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143, R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189; R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259. To protect the Commissioner’s position, I ordered that there be no publication of those judgments until the end of the trial or until further order. Once an order was made for a trial by judge alone in R v Simmons (No 4), the parties in the trial proceedings agreed that there was no need for the non-publication orders over the judgments and evidence adduced on the voir dire to continue. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s legal representatives were notified and invited to make submissions in relation to the matter.
	
	
	Further submissions and evidence were received on Friday 20 March and Tuesday 24 March 2015. A further confidential affidavit was read. The Commissioner indicated that there was no application for any restriction on the publication of the judgment known as R v Simmons (No 3). I received a copy of the judgments know as R v Simmons (No 2) and R v Simmons (No 4) with certain passages highlighted in yellow. These indicated the passages that the Commissioner sought to be redacted if the judgment was to be published on legal web-sites or otherwise. The Commissioner pressed for an order that there be no publication in relation to undercover police operation and sought the opportunity to provide further evidence. I indicated that I would redact or modify the judgments so that the assumed names of the undercover police officers were anonymised and make redactions in relation to some quite specific details of the investigation that were referred to in the judgment.
	
	
	On 24 March 2015 I made interim orders pursuant to s 10 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) in the following terms (T 504):
	


“1.   In relation to the application by the Commissioner for non‑publication orders and suppression orders that are relevant pursuant to both the Law Enforcement and National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010, and the Court Suppression and Non‑Publication Orders Act 2010, I confirm the orders made on 16 February 2015.

2.   Pursuant to section 10 of the Court Suppression and Non‑Publication Orders Act, I make an interim order that there be no publication of:    

(a) Details of the police operation that resulted in the defendant's confession including by reference to other cases where the technique has been used; or

(b) Submissions made in relation to the Commissioner's application.

I note that order (a) does not prohibit publication of the confession itself.

3.   I order that the preceding order is to apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia pursuant to section 11 of the Court Suppression and Non‑Publication Orders Act. That order will remain in effect until the Commissioner's application is determined. I note for the purpose of section 10(2) that the hearing of the application will resume this Friday 27 March 2015.

4.   In relation to the non‑publication order made in respect of the judgment known as R v Simmons (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143, R v Simmons (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259, those non‑publication orders will continue until further order and will be further addressed on Friday.

5.   In respect of the non‑publication order made in relation to the judgment known as R v Simmons (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189, the non‑publication order is hereby revoked.”


	
	The non-publications orders with respect to the judgments have been varied on four occasions, once on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, twice on the application of barristers in chambers at the Public Defenders’ Office and once on the application of the Crown Solicitor’s Office. Those variations were made to enable the parties in four different cases to have access to the judgment for use in the proceedings.
	
	
	On Friday 27 March 2015 the Commissioner read a further confidential affidavit. Exhibited to that affidavit were three confidential exhibits. This included copies of the judgments in Simmons (No 2) and Simmons (No 4) highlighted in yellow. The highlighted indicated those portions of the judgment that the Commissioner sought to be redacted from any version published on legal websites such as Caselaw NSW, Judicial Information Research System (JIRS), Jade Barnet, Butterworths unreported cases and the like. This was in the same form as the highlighted judgments with which I had previously been provided.
	
	
	In the course of the argument I raised the possible use of the restricted judgment section of JIRS. After taking instructions, Mr Bhalla indicated that there would be no submission against an exception for publication in that place. However, the Commissioner maintained his opposition to the judgment being published on legal web-sites other than in the redacted form.
	
	
	It is unnecessary, and perhaps undesirable, to set out in detail the material contained in the confidential affidavits. In short, the Commissioner’s position is that the technique is a matter that should remain confidential in the public interests. To allow publication of the nature and specific application of the technique would be to disclose operational secrets and methodology of the New South Wales Police Force.
	
	
	At first blush, this is a surprising submission in view of the extensive publicity surrounding some of the cases in which the technique has been employed over the last 10 to 15 years. Indeed in Tofilau v The Queen, Gleeson CJ said at [5]:
	


“5. Secondly the use by the police of deception in the hope of eliciting admissions is not new. The particular technique of deception adopted in the present cases seems to have been imported into Australia from Canada. Since these trials, it has been reported in the media, presumably, unless Australians suspected of serious crimes are unaware of what is contained in the newspapers, it has a limited life expectancy.”


	
	In view of the successful use of the technique in a number of cases that are reported on court and legal websites around Australia, it seems that the Chief Justice’s observations were devoid of his Honour’s usual prescience. Given the number of cases where the technique has been successfully deployed, it appears that the readership of the Commonwealth Law Reports does not extend to a number of people suspected of having been involved in cold case homicides.
	
	
	The starting point in considering an application seeking orders such as the closure of the Court to the public and suppression or non-publication of evidence, arguments and judgments, is the requirement for the courts to be open and accessible to the public and to the media: see JJ Spigelman, “Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice – Part 1”, 74 ALJ 290 at 292-295. The principle of open justice is recognised under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 14 relevantly provides:
	


“1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.”


	
	It also finds expression in s 6 of the Court Suppression Act:
	


“6 Safeguarding public interest in open justice 

In deciding whether to make a suppression order or non-publication order, a court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.”


	
	In Commissioner of Police v Nationwide News [2007] NSWCA 366; 70 NSWLR 643 Basten JA explained:
	


“86 The underlying principle is one of transparency in the judicial process. That principle itself has a number of facets. As between the parties to litigation, it requires that cases be determined on the basis of evidence adduced in court and argument presented in court, so that each party will know what the other has presented and each will know the totality of the material presented to the judge. Although the decision-making process takes place in private, the results are intended to be transparent through the provision of reasons.

87 The principle of transparency in the administration of justice also operates at the public level. Generally speaking, cases are to be run in open court, allowing the attendance of members of the public who wish to watch and hear the proceedings and with an expectation that the media may publish reports of the proceedings: see, eg, John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court (NSW) [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [18] (Spigelman CJ).


	
	However, his Honour went on to point out:
	


“89 Like all broad principles based on public policy, the principle of transparency has its limits. Critically for present purposes, it should not be allowed to operate in a manner which is self-defeating. Thus, it should not operate where the likely consequences are to diminish rather than enhance the operation of the judicial process and public confidence therein. The point at which that limit is reached in a particular case is beyond precise definition and is a matter of evaluative judgment.”


	
	In recognition of the importance of open justice, the common law developed a strict test for when a party applied for closure of a court or for suppression or non-publication of evidence. That was a test of “necessity”. In Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Waller (1985) 1 NSWLR 1 Hunt J said:
	


“As in relation to the decision to close the ordinary courts of justice, however, the question should turn upon the issue of whether an order in necessary in order to secure justice, not upon whether it is simply more convenient that it be made. The onus should remain upon the party who seeks to prohibit publication. And the circumstances in which an order will be justified should still be wholly exceptional or special circumstances”


	
	The test of necessity is also at the centre of each of the grounds upon which the powers under the Court Suppression Act may be exercised. Section 8 provides:
	


“8 Grounds for making an order 

(1) A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:

(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,

(b) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security,

(c) the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,

(d) the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency),

(e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

(2) A suppression order or non-publication order must specify the ground or grounds on which the order is made.


	
	In the present case, the Commissioner relies on paragraphs (a), (c) and (e). The ground upon which I made the orders at the outset of the trial was that the order was necessary to protect the safety of the undercover officers. The orders were also based on the provisions of the LENS Act.
	
	
	The Court Suppression Act distinguishes between “suppression” orders and “non-publication” orders. Those terms are defined in s 3:
	


""non-publication order"" means an order that prohibits or restricts the publication of information (but that does not otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure of information).

""suppression order"" means an order that prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information (by publication or otherwise).


	
	The Commissioner does not seek a suppression order in relation to the judgments known as R v Simmons (No 2) and R v Simmons (No 4) or the evidence concerning the police operation. The order sought under the notice of motion is in the following terms:
	


“22. Pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010, upon the grounds referred to in s 8(1)(a), (c) and (e) of that Act, and upon the ground of public interest immunity until further order there is to be no publication of:

a. details of the police operation that resulted in the defendant’s confession, including by reference to the other cases where the technique has been used; or

b. submissions made in relation to the Commissioner’s application.”


	
	The Commissioner asks that the order apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia and until further order of the Court: see ss 11-12 Court Suppression Act.
	
	
	The Commissioner accepts that there might be an exception to the non-publication order to permit publication of the judgment as a restricted judgment by JIRS and more general publication of a redacted version of the judgment. The version that would be published as a JIRS restricted judgment is a slightly modified version of the judgment as originally published in that it anonymises the undercover officers and redacts the use of some code words that are central to the technique. The version that would be published on other legal web-sites is heavily redacted.
	
	
	In Commissioner of Police v Nationwide News Basten JA explained at [85] that an application of this kind “involves the application of ill-defined and imprecise conflicting principles, on the basis of speculation as to future consequences”. However, as I have said, Basten JA went on to explain that the underlying principle of transparency has its limits. Ultimately, an evaluative judgment must be made.
	
	
	The meaning of “necessary” (as it is used in the Court Suppression Act) was considered in Fairfax Digital v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125. Bathurst CJ said at [8]:
	


“8. In par [46] of his judgment, Basten JA has expressed the view that the meaning of ""necessary"" depends on the context in which it is used. I agree that what is necessary in any given case will depend on that context. It will depend on the particular grounds in s 8 of the Suppression Orders Act relied upon and the factual circumstances said to give rise to the order. I agree that the variables that Basten JA refers to in par [46] are all relevant to what will be necessary in a particular context. Although it is not sufficient, in my opinion, that the orders are merely reasonable or sensible, I agree that the word ""necessary"" should not be given a narrow construction. What was said by Hodgson JA in R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; (2005) 64 NSWLR 335 at [13] adopting the remarks of Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed) v Local Court (NSW) (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 are equally applicable to the legislation in question.

‘However, the requirement of necessity is not to be given an unduly narrow construction. I respectfully adopt what was said by Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed v. Local Court (NSW) (at 161B):

This leads to the consideration of what is meant by 'necessary to secure the proper administration of justice' in this context. The phrase does not mean that if the relevant order is not made, the proceedings will not be able to continue. Plainly they can. If the name of an informer is not hidden under a pseudonym, the proceeding will go on: at least, the instant proceeding will. And if the name of a security officer is revealed, the administration of justice or of the country will not collapse. The basis of the implication is that if the kind of order proposed is not made, the result will be - or at least will be assumed to be - that particular consequences will flow, that those consequences are unacceptable, and that therefore the power to make orders which will prevent them is to be implied as necessary to the proper function of the court. The kinds of consequences that, in this sense, will be seen as unacceptable may be gauged by those involved in the cases in which statutory courts have been accepted as having restrictive powers. Thus, there will be hardship on the informer or the security officer or the blackmail victim; the future supply of information from such persons will end or will be impeded; and it will be more difficult to obtain from such persons the evidence necessary to bring offenders before the courts and deal with them. It is not necessary to attempt to state exhaustively the considerations relevant in this regard: it is to considerations of this kind or of an analogous kind on which the principle stated by McHugh JA is based.’""


	
	Basten JA at [45] said:
	


“45. The word ""necessary"" can have shades of meaning; it is not of ""a fixed character, peculiar to itself"" but rather ""admits of all degrees of comparison"", in the language of the United States Supreme Court in McCulloch v Maryland 17 US [1819] USSC 5; (4 Wheat) 316 at 414 (1819) cited by Gummow and Crennan JJ in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 at [101]. The Court in McCulloch, in the same passage, noted at 413:

‘If reference be had to its use, in the common affairs of the world, or in approved authors, we find that it frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another.’

46. The meaning of ""necessary"" depends on the context in which it is used. In s 8(1), it is used in relation to an order of the court, or, in practical terms, a proposed order, because it identifies a standard as to which the court must be satisfied before making an order. In each paragraph of that provision, the word ""necessary"" is used to describe the connection between the proposed order and an identified purpose. It may not take the same place on the variable scale of meaning in each case. In paragraph (a), the purpose of the order will be ""to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice"". That language will, in its turn, have a colour which will depend upon the circumstances. The prejudice may be a possibility or a certainty; its effect, if it eventuates, may be minor or it may cause a trial to miscarry. Similarly, prevention will involve matters of degree: the proposed order may diminish a risk of prejudice or it may obviate the risk entirely. All of these variables may affect what is considered ""necessary"" in particular circumstances.”


	
	The material before me shows that [REDACTED]. The material gives rise to an inference that [REDACTED].
	
	
	In assessing the question of whether orders in the nature of suppression or non-publication are necessary, one has to take into account not only the risk that an investigation will fail or be suspended if a suspect becomes aware that the people with whom he is dealing are undercover police officers. A more urgent concern is the safety of those police officers. It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a person suspected of having committed a homicide and whose desire is to become a member of a criminal organisation, might respond in an extreme and violent way to the suspicion or knowledge that the person they are dealing with is a police officer investigating them for a crime carrying life imprisonment.
	
	
	For those reasons, I have decided to make orders under the provisions of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW). The grounds upon which I consider the orders should be made are set out in s 8(1)(a), (c) and (e):
	


(a) The order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,

(c) The order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,

(e) It is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.”


	
	Having reached that conclusion, it is necessary to consider the content of those orders. Since the publication of the judgments in relation to which this application is largely directed, I have received no less than 4 requests from lawyers seeking to use the judgments in other cases. The Commissioner did not object to exceptions being made in those cases and to orders excluding those lawyers and their opponents were made. There is a significant difference between making orders stopping the mass media publication of the technique and the suppression, non-publication or redaction of a judge’s reasons for decision. The nature of the orders available under the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act are flexible and allow for “such exceptions and conditions as the court thinks fit and specifies in the order”: s 9(4).
	
	
	Having read the judgments in the form urged by the Commissioner, I reached the opinion that the rationale of the decisions is difficult to comprehend in the absence of the factual material upon which it is based. By way of example, if Simmons (No 4) was being used in support of a similar application, the lack of detail concerning the nature and extent of the prejudicial material involved in this case would make the reasons for decision very difficult to understand, let alone to apply. This might be contrasted with the situation in D1 v P1 (No 2) [2012] NSWCA 440 where Bathurst CJ was satisfied that the critical matters of principle remained intelligible after significant redaction (see [7]).
	
	
	I struggled with the Commissioner’s submission that restriction on publication on legal web-sites is “necessary”. As has been observed directly and implicitly throughout this judgment, the nature of the technique employed in this case has been published on Australian legal web-sites and in law reports and journals on a number of occasions. It has been subject to mass media attention and has its own Wikipedia entry. The problems that arose following [REDACTED] had to do with publication in the print and electronic media. There is nothing to suggest that the problems were caused by the publication on the [REDACTED], Austlii or other legal websites. As interesting as some may consider them to be, the law reports and legal websites are not commonly read by members of the criminal milieu. This is shown by the events that have transpired following the High Court’s decision in Tofilou v The Queen.
	
	
	However, I was ultimately persuaded by a number of Mr Bhalla’s submissions. I accept that the detail provided in the R v Simmons (No 2) is unusual and that the specific scenarios described in the judgment [REDACTED]. I accept that the capacity of technology today is far advanced and that the advent of smart ‘phones and other devices increase the capacity of material being re-published broadly and quickly. While I do not share Mr Bhalla’s concern that the judgments may “go viral”, I accept the premise behind that submission. Fashioning orders to prevent “links” between web-sites and public and private users is difficult, if not impossible. He made a good point concerning “push” notifications and the possibility of publication on overseas legal blogs, Facebook and the Twitter. I accept from Mr Bhalla that two other Judges of this Court have suppressed (or restricted publication) of similar material and that the use of the technique in this state, or at least the detail of that use, has not previously been published, in such detail.
	
	
	Finally, I accept that the limited publication as a JIRS restricted judgment means that the judgment will be available to practitioners and judicial officers for the use in legal proceedings. The redacted version published on other legal web-sites will carry a notation that the fuller version is available through JIRS.
	
	
	To ensure that the orders for closure of the court and the suppression and non-publication orders are readily comprehensible and located in one place, I will revoke and re-state my earlier orders and make the final orders to which this judgment relates. The orders are these:
	



	
	Revoke all previous orders for non-publication and suppression pursuant to the Law Enforcement & National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010 (NSW) and Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) and in their place make the following orders pursuant to those statutes.
	
	
	The 11 witnesses known under assumed names as [REDACTED] (“the 11 witnesses”) are permitted to appear before the Court at the trial and any related or interlocutory proceedings under their assumed names.
	
	
	The 11 witnesses are to be referred to by their assumed names during the course of the trial and in any related or interlocutory proceedings.
	
	
	There is to be no publication or other disclosure of the real identity of the 11 witnesses or of any document, evidence or other disclosure that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the real identities of the 11 witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	There is to be no publication or other disclosure of the assumed identities or assumed names of the 11 witnesses or of any document or evidence that identifies or might facilitate the identification of the assumed names of the 11 witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	Without limiting the generality of orders (4) and (5), there is to be no publication or other disclosure of any visual or other description or depiction of the physical appearances or any other identifying features of the 11 witnesses except as is necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Court will be closed for the duration of the evidence given by the 11 witnesses, subject to the following people being permitted to be present in court while they give their evidence:
	



	
	The accused and his legal representatives;
	
	
	The legal representatives of the prosecution;
	
	
	Officers of the New South Wales Police Force involved in investigating the offences before the Court and officers of the New South Wales Police Force attached to the New South Wales Police Force Undercover Program so long as they are not themselves required to give evidence after any of the witnesses;
	
	
	Legal representatives for the Commissioner of Police;
	
	
	Staff of the Department of Corrective Services;
	
	
	Court staff.
	



	
	There is no restriction on publication of the judgment known as R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010, and upon the grounds referred to in s 8(1)(a), (c) and (e) of that Act there is to be no publication of:
	


(a)    Details of the police operation that resulted in the defendant’s confession, including by reference to the other cases where the technique has been used; or

(b)    Submissions made in relation to the Commissioner’s application

This order does not prohibit publication of the words used by Tony Simmons that are said by the Crown to amount to a confession.


	
	Pursuant to s 9(4) the following exceptions will apply to order (9):

		10 April 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766298,WC v R [2015] NSWCCA 52,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA:   On 8 November 2012, WC was convicted of three offences of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Each offence was committed on P, the daughter of his de facto partner, who was 12 years of age at the time those offences were committed in August 2011. The trial at which WC was convicted was the fourth trial commenced in relation to those charges.
	
	
	The second of those trials commenced on 17 October 2012. P and her younger sister, S, gave evidence at that trial which came to an end on 26 October 2012 when the jury was discharged following a comment made by defence counsel in her address. The Crown indicated that on the retrial it would tender a record of evidence given in the second trial, and said that “the regulations require that 21 days’ notice is to be given and I would be asking your Honour to abridge that time”. In answer to a question as to what the evidence referred to was, the Crown responded that it was “the complainant’s evidence as well as [S’s] evidence.” The Crown then handed up a notice purporting to be given under s 306I(3)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and cl 24 of Criminal Procedural Regulation 2010, in respect of the audio visual recording of the evidence given by the complainant and S in the second trial. That notice described each of those witnesses as a “complainant” in the proceedings.
	
	
	Partly at the urging of counsel, the third trial commenced on 29 October 2012. The jury empanelled in that trial was discharged on 31 October 2012 due to the complainant’s mother giving inadmissible context evidence. The fourth trial commenced on 1 November 2012 and proceeded to WC’s conviction on each count on 8 November 2012. In the course of that trial the recording of the evidence of P and S was tendered in the Crown case and without objection. In relation to each, that evidence included the witness’ evidence in chief, cross-examination and re-examination and the witness’ joint investigation response team (JIRT) interview.
	
	
	Following that trial, on 15 April 2013 Letherbarrow DCJ sentenced WC to a total effective sentence of five years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months.
	
	
	WC appeals against the three convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the aggregate sentence imposed.
	
	
	WC’s notice of appeal and of application for leave to appeal is dated 11 August 2014, and was not filed within three months after the conviction or sentence. For that reason he requires and seeks an extension of the time in which to give notice of his appeal and application for leave to appeal.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	


Ground 1:   His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the DVD evidence of S.

Ground 2:   The admission into evidence of the DVD evidence of S by consent resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice.

Ground 3:   The sentences are manifestly excessive or some other sentence should be imposed by reason of error in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences.


	
	The DVD of S’s evidence included the JIRT interview conducted by an investigating authority which, because S was a child and accordingly a “vulnerable person”, was admissible under s 306U(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). In argument WC’s counsel accepted that evidence of the interview was admissible and focused on the recording of S’s oral evidence which was undoubtedly hearsay evidence when tendered at the fourth trial.
	
	
	Because each of grounds 1 and 2 is concerned with a decision of the trial judge as to the admission of evidence and no objection was taken on behalf of WC to that decision, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Accordingly leave is required to raise those grounds. Generally speaking, that leave should not be granted unless there is shown to have been a miscarriage of justice or an irregularity in the conduct of the trial which involved such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: per R A Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing) in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [69] – [73] citing Picken v R; R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21] and R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191.
	
	
	Before addressing these grounds and the question of leave (which in the case of the sentencing appeal is required by s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)), it is necessary to refer briefly to the nature of the three offences charged and the significance of S’s evidence in relation to the second of those offences.
	


The circumstances of offending


	
	The three offences were committed in August 2011 at the residence in which WC was then living with his de facto partner and her children, P and S.
	
	
	Count 1. On the morning of 18 August 2011 WC was lying on the lounge in the lounge room with one of his arms protruding out from the arm of the lounge. P, who was dressed in her school uniform, walked past the applicant who used his protruding hand to grab hold of her on the outside of her clothing in the area of her vagina. P said that WC’s fingers were “wiggling or moving like when someone tickles you”. This touching took some seconds. P then walked away.
	
	
	Count 2. This offence was said to have been witnessed by S, then aged 10 years. It occurred on the afternoon of the same day as the first count and after WC had picked up P and her sister from their respective schools and whilst their mother was not at home.
	
	
	P’s evidence was that she, her sister and WC were playing a Wii computer game in the lounge room when WC started to tickle her. At this point she said she was lying on the floor on her stomach and WC then pulled down her pants and underpants, kissed her on the bottom, pulled down his own pants and then placed his penis between the cheeks of her bottom. P said WC then “humped” her by moving his penis backwards and forwards on her bottom until he ejaculated. Before this event P said WC also placed one hand on the outside of her vagina and the other inside her clothing and squeezed her breast area. P said that by the time her pants had been pulled down her younger sister had left the room.
	
	
	S’s evidence given at the second trial differed in several respects from that of P. In particular, she gave no account of WC touching her sister’s vagina or breasts or kissing her buttocks. S’s evidence was that she remained in the room after P suggested that she had left. S described that she then saw WC masturbating while kneeling behind P.
	
	
	Count 3. This offence (which was the first in time) occurred on a weekend early in August 2011, whilst WC was at home with P and her sister was in the shower. P was lying on her stomach on a lounge in the lounge room. WC came into the room and laid on top of her and commenced to “dry hump” her before rolling her on to her back and pulling her pants down. WC then pulled his own pants down and placed his penis on top of P’s vagina and continued to “hump” her until he ejaculated on her stomach.
	


Ground 1: Error admitting DVD evidence of S

Ground 2: Admission of DVD evidence of S by consent resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice


	
	These two grounds may be considered together. The following submissions were made in support of them.
	
	
	First, it is said that S’s evidence (excluding the JIRT interview) was hearsay and not made admissible by the provisions of Pt 5, Div 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act because S was not the or a complainant in the relevant proceedings. All of that is correct. Section 306I provides that the hearsay rule does not prevent the admission of a record of the original evidence of a complainant, such as P, in a new trial proceeding, such as was the fourth trial. It did not, however, apply to the admission of S’s evidence in that trial.
	
	
	Secondly, and for the reason that it was hearsay, it was submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting that record of S’s evidence. It is acknowledged that this evidence was not objected to. That is fatal to WC’s argument that its admission involved any error on the part of the trial judge.
	
	
	The hearsay rule (Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 59) is a rule that excludes evidence of an out-of-court statement or representation as proof of the existence of a fact asserted by that statement or representation. In its terms, s 59(1) provides that such evidence “is not admissible”. As Giles JA observed in Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 at [24], those words (which are also used in ss 76, 97, 98, 102 and 114 as well as other provisions of that Act) “are to be contrasted with “is not to be adduced” in ss 118 and 119 and similar directory words in other provisions”. In Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262 Spigelman CJ said at [149] that ordinarily “not admissible” in the Evidence Act means “not admissible over objection”. That construction of those words is now well accepted. See the cases cited by Giles JA in Gonzales v R at [26] as well as R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 (McClellan CJ at CL, Grove and Howie JJ) and Lazaris v R [2014] NSWCCA 163 (Bellew J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreeing).
	
	
	In Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 at [20], Gleeson CJ and Hayne J note that evidence declared by the Evidence Act to be not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled, is often not the subject of objection for various reasons:
	


Counsel for an accused person may have any one of a number of reasons for not objecting. A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire. Counsel might decide not to object simply because he or she knows that that accused, upon giving evidence, will admit that the identification evidence is correct. The Evidence Act applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection.


	
	The trial judge did not err in admitting the record of S’s evidence in chief, cross-examination and re-examination at the second trial in circumstances where there was no objection to it.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was contended that in admitting that evidence, the trial judge did not comply with s 190 of the Evidence Act. Subsections 190(1) and (2) are relied upon:
	


(1)   The court may, if the parties consent, by order dispense with the application of any one or more of the provisions of:

…

(c)   Parts 3.2 - 3.8,

in relation to particular evidence or generally.

(2)   In a criminal proceeding, a defendant’s consent is not effective for the purposes of subsection (1) unless:

(a)   the defendant has been advised to do so by his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel, or

(b)   the court is satisfied that the defendant understands the consequences of giving the consent.


	
	It was submitted that by not rejecting the record of S’s evidence as excluded by the hearsay rule the trial judge was to be taken to have dispensed with the application of s 59 in Pt 3.2 in relation to that evidence in circumstances where WC’s consent to the making of such an order was not effective because neither of the conditions in subs 190(2)(a) and (b) was satisfied.
	
	
	This argument must be rejected simply because in admitting the relevant evidence the trial judge made no order under subs 190(1). Nor was it necessary for him to do so. The hearsay evidence was not admissible over objection and no objection was taken. It was not necessary to dispense with the application of s 59 in order to admit the evidence.
	
	
	The analysis so far addresses the respects in which it was argued that there was error on the part of the trial judge.
	
	
	Finally, it is submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice involved in the admission of S’s evidence in circumstances where it was not admissible if objected to and WC’s counsel and the Crown apparently proceeded upon the wrong assumption that s 306I applied to the admission of the record of S’s evidence given in the earlier trial. In support of that submission the applicant relies upon the notice given by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 26 October 2012. That notice described the evidence of both P and S as having been given by “the complainant” in the second trial. That description, to be understood as referring to the complainant in the fourth trial, was incorrect in relation to S.
	
	
	A defence counsel’s conduct of a trial may bring about a miscarriage of justice entitling the accused to a new trial. It will do so if by that conduct the accused has been deprived of a fair trial according to law. That might occur if, for no valid reason, defence counsel fails to cross-examine material witnesses or to address the jury, per McHugh J in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [76]; or gives wrong advice as to the accused’s entitlement to give evidence: per Gleeson CJ in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [17].
	
	
	In cases where that is said to have occurred the question whether there was a miscarriage of justice involves the following considerations (per McHugh J in TKWJ at [79]):
	


First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? Whether a material irregularity occurred must be considered in light of the wide discretion that counsel has to conduct the trial as he or she thinks best and the fact that ordinarily the client is bound by the decisions of counsel. Accordingly, ""it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence"". The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.


	
	It is argued on behalf of the applicant that his counsel’s conduct in not objecting to the tender of the record of S’s evidence resulted in an unfair trial because S was a material witness and that failure meant that S was not cross-examined.
	
	
	There are several difficulties for this submission. The first is that the admission of the evidence did not carry with it the consequence that the opportunity to cross-examine S in the fourth trial was lost. The transcript indicates (esp tcpt 31/10/12, p 57) that defence counsel proceeded on the basis that she was able to apply to cross-examine P or S in the fourth trial. That was consistent with the provisions of s 306J which make the “complainant” compellable to give further evidence if that is necessary “in the interests of justice”. The second is that the record of S’s evidence included her earlier cross-examination. That evidence, as was conceded in oral argument, was in some respects inconsistent with P’s evidence, and to that extent was relied upon by the applicant.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant does not point to any particular matters which could or should have been put to S by way of further cross-examination in the fourth trial. On the contrary, it was conceded that whether any answers elicited in a further cross-examination of S would have assisted the applicant’s defence in any material respect was “speculative”. Fourthly, Div 4 of Pt 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act permitted S, as a vulnerable person, to give evidence by means of a closed-circuit television facility. Accordingly had she given evidence in the fourth trial, that evidence was still likely to have been seen by the jury via a closed-circuit television facility. Finally, the transcript of the trial (tcpt 26/10/12, p 18) also indicates that defence counsel carefully considered the evidence of S before it was tendered in the third trial. In the circumstances, defence counsel no doubt made a forensic choice to rely upon the earlier cross-examination as admitted in the fourth trial. That choice is not shown to have been ill advised let alone to have been inconsistent with the competent conduct of the defence case.
	
	
	The applicant has not established that there was a material irregularity in the conduct of the trial or that there is any significant possibility that the conduct complained of affected the outcome of the trial.
	
	
	For these reasons the basis upon which leave might be granted under r 4 to raise grounds 1 and 2 has not been made out.
	


Ground 3: Sentence manifestly excessive or involved error in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences


	
	The broad question raised by this ground of appeal is whether the applicant has demonstrated that the total effective sentence and non-parole period were, in the circumstances, unreasonable or plainly unjust. However, by his written and oral submissions, the applicant focused on a narrower question, submitting that he had been “double punished” because the sentencing judge took into account as aggravating factors that the offences involved a gross breach of trust and that the complainant was under his authority. In support of that submission, the applicant referred to the decision in this Court in MRW v R [2011] NSWCCA 260 at [77] – [79].
	
	
	Section 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires that the aggravating factors to be taken into account in sentencing include, if relevant, that the “offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”. In MRW v R Bathurst CJ noted that abuse of trust and abuse of authority are distinct concepts, although commonly arising out of the same facts: at [77]. The applicant submits that the sentencing judge must be taken to have considered both to be aggravating factors and erred in doing so.
	
	
	That submission is made relying upon particular passages from the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence. In particular, in relation to count 1, the sentencing judge noted that the Complainant was “under the offender’s authority at the time and the offence involved a gross breach of trust” (ROS 15/04/13, p 12). In relation to each of the second and third counts the sentencing judge considered each also to have “involved a gross breach of trust” (ROS 15/04/13, p 13).
	
	
	In my view a fair reading of these remarks indicates that the sentencing judge took into account, in relation to each offence, that it involved a gross breach of trust. In relation to the first offence, his Honour observed that the gross breach of trust arose because P was, at the time it was committed, under the offender’s authority. This did not involve taking the same underlying conduct into account in two ways. That argument cannot be made in relation to the second and third counts because of the different language used and the remarks confirm that in relation to each offence the relevant conduct has been considered to involve an aggravating factor only because of the gross breach of trust involved.
	
	
	The applicant does not submit that there are any other bases upon which a total effective sentence of five years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months was manifestly excessive when regard is had to all of the circumstances referred to by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	For these reasons leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence should be refused.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose that the following orders be made:
	


1.   Extend to 11 August 2014 the time for the applicant to give notice of appeal and of application for leave to appeal.

2.   Refuse the applicant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise grounds of appeal 1 and 2.

3.   Refuse the applicant leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed on 15 April 2013.


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Meagher JA.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with Meagher JA.

		02 April 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766299,Pound v R [2015] NSWCCA 54,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J:   I agree with Davies J.   
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 9 April 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences as follows:
	


Count 1:   Recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of four years.

Count 2:   Carry firearm with disregard for the safety of himself and another. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment.


	
	On 13 November 2013 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Norrish QC in the District Court for these offences. He asked that in relation to Count 1 there be taken into account one offence on a Form 1 being cultivate a prohibited plant, namely, cannabis. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units, or where the matter is disposed of summarily, two years imprisonment and/or a fine of 100 penalty units.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by Judge Norrish QC were as follows:
	


Count 2:   A fixed term of imprisonment of three years six months commencing 26 October 2012 and expiring 25 April 2016.

Count 1, taking into account the Form 1:      A non-parole period of three years six months commencing 26 April 2014 and expiring 25 October 2017 with an additional term of two years six months expiring 25 April 2020. The overall sentence was a non-parole period of five years with an additional term of two years and six months.


	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1:   The Sentencing Judge erred in determining that the conduct of the Applicant at the time of the offence revealed a high degree of recklessness.

Ground 2:   The Sentencing Judge erred in partially accumulating the sentences.

Ground 3:   In the alternative, the Sentencing Judge erred in the extent to which the sentences were partially accumulated.

Ground 4:   The sentences for each offence, and the total effective sentence, are manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	The following facts are summarised from the Crown’s Statement of Facts tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Sentencing Judge noted from hearing the evidence of the Applicant at the sentencing hearing that the facts were effectively an agreed Statement of Facts.
	
	
	The Applicant resided at a Department of Housing unit in Alice Street, Newtown. The victim of the offences was Daniel Marino. Mr Marino’s father resided in the same block of flats as the Applicant.
	
	
	On 19 October 2012 the victim and three associates attended King Cross for a social night. They consumed alcohol and two of the group consumed an ecstasy tablet at around 10:00pm.
	
	
	At about 3:00am the following morning the victim and his friends left Kings Cross intending to return to the victim's father's unit to sleep. They expected the unit to be vacant. The victim's father was home so the group decided to leave. As they were leaving the Applicant heard them. He knew the victim previously. The Applicant invited the victim and his three friends to his unit.
	
	
	The victim and his three friends walked into the unit and sat down. One of the group, Ben Mcarthy, went to the toilet. While he was in the toilet the Applicant produced a .22 calibre Harrington & Richardson 7 shot revolver. He began to spin the handgun around his finger using what is suspected to be the trigger guard. This appears not to have been done to threaten the group. After a brief period the Applicant stopped spinning the firearm and he put the gun in his pants.
	
	
	The victim at some point sat on the lounge occupied by the Applicant. The Applicant told him to move. The two began to taunt one another in a jovial fashion. At this point, the Applicant produced the gun and held it with his finger on the trigger. The victim said ""don't point that thing at me"" and he tapped the barrel with his two fingers. At this point, the firearm discharged with the projectile striking the victim in the left eye and continuing its path until it stopped in behind the right eye.
	
	
	It is not alleged that the Applicant deliberately shot the victim. Panicking, the group along with the Applicant left the unit and made their way outside to the main building entrance.
	
	
	Once outside the unit complex the Applicant using his own mobile phone contacted '000' at 03:43 am and requested an ambulance indicating “I've shot my friend in the eye with a gun"". Awoken by the commotion the father of the victim left his unit and joined the group. The victim's friends identified the Applicant as having shot his son.
	
	
	The victim was walked down the stairs by the group and out onto Alice Street awaiting the ambulance. He was later conveyed to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. His injuries resulted in a loss of sight in his left eye and partial blindness in his right eye. The firearm's projectile entered the victim slightly above his left eye, leaving parts of the projectile behind both eyes as it fragmented.
	
	
	A police search of the crime scene revealed blood spatter on the far side of the lounge room on the coffee table, lounge, floor and window. Blood spatter was also located upon two of the three witnesses’ T-shirts. No firearm or firearm related items were located inside or in the vicinity of the unit.
	
	
	Also located within the spare bedroom were six cannabis plants in the spare bedroom. Evidence of cultivation was identified in the form of fluorescent lighting, potting, watering, concealment and manual aids. The Applicant resides at the address alone and exclusive possession of the cannabis was not in dispute. This was the basis of the Form 1 offence.
	
	
	The police continued to investigate the location of the weapon involved in this offence. The Applicant told them that one of the other members of the group, Goncalves, had the gun. Although he initially denied knowing where the gun was, Goncalves subsequently informed police that he had possession of the pistol which he produced to them. He provided an additional statement that day alleging that, after shooting the victim, the Applicant dropped the gun. Goncalves then picked up the gun, ran down the stairs and out of the unit complex. He ran to a large tree and buried the gun underneath a pile of leaves.
	
	
	On 26 October 2012 the Applicant presented himself to the Newtown Police. He was placed under arrest and taken into custody. The Applicant declined to participate in an ERISP. He was then charged with the matters for which he was sentenced.
	
	
	In his evidence the Applicant accepted that he was intoxicated at the time of the shooting, having drunk three to four long necks of beer from about 11pm. He said everyone present was drunk and had taken “a lot of drugs as well”.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he had found the gun some years before, in about 2007, when in the course of his job with the Local Council he was cleaning up an area near the Cooks River in Tempe. He put it in a tool box and re-found it about five years later in June 2012. He agreed that he had put a bullet in it two days before the incident but he said he did not realise it was still in there. He thought he had taken it out. He thought he had loaded it because he was going to try to use the gun. He said he had some bullets for about ten years.
	
	
	It was accepted that he did not have a licence to possess the gun.
	
	
	The victim underwent an operation on 20 October 2012 on his eyes. He is permanently blind in the left eye. The eye is wasted, sunken and deviated downwards with restricted movements. He has a droopy left eyelid. The bullet remains near the optic nerve behind his right eye and cannot be removed because of danger to the brain and vision in the right eye. The victim has suffered nasal problems and has been badly psychologically affected. All of these matters have meant he could not continue with his apprenticeship including his studies at TAFE.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant was aged almost 32 at the time of the incident. He had a criminal record which commenced when he was 12 years of age. The offences were largely property offences and offences of a reasonably low level nature although there were offences before his 18th birthday of possessing an unauthorised firearm and possessing ammunition without a licence. He had been imprisoned once as an adult in 2006 for nine months for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	His father left the family suddenly when the Applicant was four years of age. This occurred because his mother discovered that the father had been assaulting her daughter from a previous marriage for some years with the Applicant as a witness to those assaults. His mother said that the Applicant only found out the truth of those matters when he was aged about 13 years. It was at that time that his behaviour deteriorated and he developed drug, alcohol and anger management issues. He blamed himself for not being able to stop the abuse.
	
	
	He left school after completing Year 6 at the age of 12 years. He had employment history of short term casual positions in the area of gardening and bar work. It was during that period that many of the petty offences were committed. He eventually secured a casual full-time position with the Local Council doing landscaping and lawn mowing work but was made redundant after two years. It seems likely that it was during that time that he found the weapon in 2007.
	
	
	He was granted a disability support pension in 2010 for mental health issues.
	
	
	He started drinking alcohol at the age of 14 or 15 years and soon became a heavy drinker consuming alcohol on five or six days of the week. He told the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report that he would drink up to 20 beers or a bottle of bourbon at a session.
	
	
	He started using cannabis at the age of 15 years and continued to do so up until his arrest. He said he was a heavy user with the drug costing him about $300 per week. He said he also smoked heroin and ecstasy in the past. He started using ice in recent years and until a month before his arrest. He said he could not really afford the drug so he did not become a heavy user.
	
	
	He said that the cannabis plants were being grown for his personal use. He told the Community Corrections Officer that he had been drinking and using cannabis on the day of the incident.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge had a lengthy report from Dr John Jacmon, a consultant psychologist. Dr Jacmon said that the Applicant’s day to day functioning was being impaired by clinically significant Bipolar Disorder Type II, and anxiety. Dr Jacmon said that at the time surrounding the incident the Applicant appeared to be undergoing a depressive episode. As the Sentencing Judge noted, there was no psychiatric report providing a diagnosis of the Applicant’s mental problems.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge also had a report from another organisation disclosing that the Applicant had a potentially serious health problem which required medication and monitoring.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Sentencing Judge dealt first with the facts and then the Applicant’s subjective matters. He summarised the submissions made and then noted that he was required to consider the totality of the criminality, bearing in mind the matter on the Form 1, and to consider appropriate degrees of concurrency and accumulation.
	
	
	His Honour then said this:
	


In the context of the submissions that have been made and of course the evidence in this case, including importantly the statement of facts prepared by the prosecution and accepted by the accused, it is clear that the offence of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm is a very serious offence of this type.

Firstly, in dealing with the recklessness revealed in the facts and the offender's own evidence, that was a high degree. The offender, of course, did not intend to cause harm to the victim, nor wish harm to him. However, at the time he acted oblivious to the presence of a projectile in the firearm that he had placed there, the handling of the gun in circumstances where he was intoxicated, reveals a high degree of recklessness.

The prior loading of the firearm, obviously, for no understandable reason, and then forgetting that the firearm was loaded also represents a high degree of recklessness on the part of the offender.

This was not a case of inadvertence or negligence or mere oversight. He produced the firearm, he had loaded the firearm, albeit some period of time before, it was pointed at the victim and it was obviously inappropriately handled, with his hand in the vicinity of the trigger mechanism.

…

… It is quite clear though that the recklessness, as I have said, was a very high degree.

Obviously the grievous bodily harm is also of a very high degree. The victim has been permanently disfigured. He has lost the sight of one eye with the risk of potential further damage to his other eye, in the circumstances outlined in the facts.

…

Ultimately, I have concluded that the principal offence is not the worst case committed by the worst offender but it is a very serious offence of its type given the character of the recklessness and the catastrophic effects and consequences of that recklessness.


	
	His Honour also found that there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Applicant’s production of the firearm at risk to the victim and others including himself was in the course of an act of self-destruction or a manic state or related in any way to a depressive condition.
	
	
	His Honour held that it might be that his excessive drinking was related to the matters and it might be that there was, in that way, an indirect connection with the events in question but there was no direct causal connection.
	
	
	His Honour held that although his criminal history did not entitle him to any leniency he could not find that it was an aggravating factor. His Honour said he could not conclude that the Applicant was unlikely to re-offend or that he had good prospects for rehabilitation. His Honour was satisfied, however, that the Applicant had shown remorse by accepting responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	His Honour afforded him a 25% discount for the early plea and determined that there were special circumstances being the need for the Applicant to have professional assistance to adjust to community living so that an extended period of supervision was needed to address the matters in the Pre-Sentence Report and in Dr Jacmon's report.
	


Ground 1:   Determining that the conduct revealed a high degree of recklessness


	
	The Applicant submitted that the mental element of the offence required at a minimum the contemplation by the offender of the possibility of actual bodily harm and proceeding to do the relevant act nevertheless. The Applicant pointed to the passage in the Sentencing Judge’s Remarks set out at [33] above and submitted that the fact that the Sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant “acted oblivious to the presence of a projectile in the firearm” and had forgotten that the “firearm was loaded” can only be consistent with the proposition that at the time of the production, handling and discharge of the gun the Applicant did not know it was loaded. The Applicant submitted that as a result he could not have contemplated as a possible incident the discharge of that firearm and, consequently, grievous bodily harm being occasioned to anyone including the victim.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Applicant submitted, the plea of guilty and the acceptance by the Judge of the Applicant’s evidence that he did not know the gun was loaded meant that the only finding available was that the Applicant had contemplated actual bodily harm by the production and handling of the gun. In that way the recklessness was not of a high degree.
	
	
	I do not accept these submissions of the Applicant.
	
	
	Reliance on references to being “oblivious” and “forgetting that the firearm was loaded” is a failure to read the Remarks as a whole. The observation that the Applicant was oblivious is not an exculpatory statement. The Sentencing Judge made clear that part of the high degree of recklessness was the prior loading of the firearm and the forgetting that it was loaded. That, coupled with his intoxication and the way he behaved with the gun in the presence of the victim, together constitute the high degree of recklessness.
	
	
	This was emphasised when the Sentencing Judge was detailing the Crown’s submissions. He said:
	


Further, the offender had put a bullet in the firearm and forgotten about it, on his version, and was handling a firearm when he was intoxicated, which was an extremely dangerous situation. That is clearly correct in this case.


	
	The finding by the Sentencing Judge of a high degree of recklessness is a factual matter for the Sentencing Judge’s determination: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] and [46]. The Applicant would need to show that the finding was not reasonably open to his Honour on the facts. In my opinion, no error is shown because the finding was open to him for the reasons given above. In circumstances where the Applicant knew that he had loaded the gun some days before but carried out the acts of pointing the gun at the victim with his finger on the trigger whilst intoxicated without checking first whether the gun remained loaded only highlights the degree of recklessness involved.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Grounds 2 and 3:   The accumulation of the sentences


	
	The Sentencing Judge accumulated the sentence for the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm by a period of 18 months on the sentence for the firearm offence. The Applicant submitted that the two sentences should not have been accumulated at all or at least that the accumulation was too great. Whilst the Applicant accepted that the elements of each offence were different to a degree, the Applicant said that in the present case the essential offending was the same for both offences. The Applicant submitted that the possession of the gun for a period of time before the commission of the offence was not relevant to the decision whether or not to accumulate the sentences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no error of a House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 type had been identified. Further, the Crown submitted that the total effective sentence was consistent with the application of the principle of totality.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the acts associated with each offence were not entirely the same. The Crown submitted that his Honour was conscious of the distinct criminality of the two offences because he said:
	


Of course, it is to be borne in mind that the use of the weapon is, in a general sense an element of the related offence for which a sentence must be imposed which will be partly concurrent and accumulative of the principal offence.


	
	In the Crown’s written submissions reliance was placed on the possession of the firearm illegally for five years, and the Sentencing Judge’s remarks that the offence was the culmination of continuing criminality. In oral submissions, however, the Crown accepted that the only relevant period prior to the day of the shooting was the period from the day the Applicant put the bullet into the gun.
	
	
	As noted earlier, his Honour said that he was required to consider the totality of the criminality and matters of concurrency and accumulation if appropriate. His Honour did not address directly the issue of the overlap of the elements of each of the offences in the circumstances of this case. However, in the course of considering aggravating factors for the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm his Honour said:
	


Of course, it is to be borne in mind that the use of the weapon is in a general sense an element of the related offence for which a sentence must be imposed which will be partly concurrent and accumulative of the principal offence as the pleadings of that matter made clear.

A further aggravating factor in relation to the offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm was that it was an offence committed without regard for public safety.


	
	His Honour was correct to say that the use of the weapon was an element of the firearm offence but so, too, was the fact that the grievous bodily harm offence was committed without regard for public safety. Whilst the use of a gun is not an element of the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, that was the way the grievous bodily harm was in fact inflicted in the present case. Further, the firearm offence could be proved by showing that the Applicant had a reckless disregard for the safety of himself or any other person.
	
	
	Although it was a relevant matter that the Applicant had placed a bullet into the gun two days previously and had forgotten that he had done so, the recklessness that was involved in his behaviour generally could be demonstrated by showing that he pointed the gun at the victim with his finger on the trigger whilst he was intoxicated and without ensuring at the least that the gun was not loaded regardless of what had occurred two days previously.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm wholly comprehended the elements of the firearm offence.
	
	
	In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 Howie J (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed) said:
	


[27]   In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.


	
	In those circumstances and bearing in mind that questions of concurrency or accumulation are discretionary matters (R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] and Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]) error is demonstrated because an accumulation of 18 months was plainly unreasonable and unjust: House v The King.
	
	
	I would uphold these grounds.
	


Section 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act (1912) NSW


	
	Since error has been demonstrated it is the duty of this Court to re-exercise the discretion to sentence the applicant bearing in mind the provisions of s 6(3) of the Act: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947 at [42]. Because the error in the present case concerned accumulation it is necessary also to consider s 7(1A) of the Act. In that way it becomes unnecessary to consider Ground 4 of the appeal, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Nevertheless, the submissions made in relation to Ground 4 are relevant to the resentencing process and will be referred to in the terms in which they were made in that context.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the individual sentences and the total effective sentence were manifestly excessive bearing in mind the Applicant's subjective case including his health issues, the overlap of the offences, the discount for the plea, and both the assistance he provided and his remorse. The Applicant said that the notional starting point for each of the offences was 8 years and for the total effective sentence was 10 years.
	
	
	The Applicant read an affidavit detailing his progress whilst in custody. He has completed the SMART Recovery program in July 2014 which has helped him to deal with his drug and alcohol problems. His mood swings from the Bipolar condition have been stabilised with medication. He completed a food hygiene course and has learnt some skills in hospitality from his work in custody which he will be able to use in future employment on release.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge had taken into account the Applicant's health issues although noting that no psychiatric evidence had been placed before him. His Honour doubted any causal connection between the mental illness and the offending. The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge gave the Applicant a full discount for the plea and acknowledged his remorse.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was misconceived and contrary to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 to base a manifest excess submission on the notional starting point: Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8 at [91]; SZ v R [2007] NSWCAA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [40].
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the serious injuries sustained by the victim, the high degree of recklessness found by the Sentencing Judge, his Honour's inability to find the Applicant was unlikely to reoffend or had good prospects of rehabilitation, and to the fact that his Honour found special circumstances to reduce the ratio to 66%.
	
	
	The matters raised by the Crown in relation to Ground 4 should be accepted as far as the individual sentences are concerned although only insofar as they are relevant to this Court's exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	It is appropriate to give due weight to the various subjective matters identified in the submissions for the Applicant and the further material provided in his affidavit. Nevertheless, the grievous bodily harm offence was rightly characterised by the Sentencing Judge as ""a very serious offence of its type"". The assessment of this Court should be that a sentence less than 6 years was not warranted. I propose that the sentence on that count be a non-parole period of 4 years with an additional term of 2 years so as to maintain the same proportions of non-parole and parole periods as provided for in the Court below and as counsel in this Court implicitly conceded was appropriate. The firearm offence was also of such significant seriousness that it cannot be said that a sentence less than 3 years and 6 months was warranted.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Allow the appeal.

(3)   Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court.

(4)   Sentence the appellant as follows:

   (a)   Count 2 – a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months       commencing 26 October 2012 and expiring 25 April 2016;

   (b)   Count 1 and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 – a       non parole period of 4 years commencing 26 October 2012 and       expiring 25 October 2016 with an additional term of 2 years          expiring 25 October 2018.


	
	BELLEW J:   I agree with Davies J.

2766304,R v Cahill [2015] NSWCCA 53,"___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Johnson J, for the reasons his Honour gives, that the Crown appeal should be dismissed, not because of any absence of error by the sentencing judge, but as a matter of discretion, having regard to the evidence now before this Court. I also agree with Schmidt J’s reasons.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing, counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that “the offending behaviour that Mr Cahill has pleaded to is incredibly serious”. In this she was correct. The conduct included three charges of supplying commercial quantities of a prohibited drug, each of which attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years’ imprisonment. In addition, there were 13 offences of supplying a prohibited drug, each carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, and four other offences on a Form 1. The offending conduct took place over more than three months, on nine separate occasions.
	
	
	True it is that there were aspects of the offending conduct which reduced its objective criminality. Foremost amongst these were the facts that the quantities in each case were only just sufficient to amount to a commercial quantity, and that in each of those cases the Respondent himself made no direct financial gain.
	
	
	However, the standard non-parole period in each case of 10 years remained a mandatory matter to be taken into account under s.54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Her Honour mentioned the period at the outset of her remarks but it is difficult to conclude that her Honour gave any meaningful regard to it. Her Honour’s failure to indicate what non-parole period would have been imposed for each of the three commercial supply offences, as was required by s.54B(4), is confirmatory of this.
	
	
	This was a case where, as Johnson J has observed, a sentence of two years imprisonment, and the non-custodial options available as a consequence, were not realistically open, despite the Respondent’s very strong subjective case.
	
	
	The system of criminal sentencing requires the sentencing judge to undertake an intuitive synthesis having identified all relevant considerations. When that occurs, it will be accorded deference in any appeal. That is a consequence of the responsibility given to sentencing judges - the difficulty of whose task is not to be understated.
	
	
	In the multitude of matters that come before sentencing judges, there will be a small number which can properly be described as “wholly exceptional”. If the circumstances are wholly exceptional, they may justify a sentence which is lenient to a wholly exceptional degree. An example may be seen in R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326, to which the Court was referred, where it was said at [104] by Button J (with the agreement of other members of the Court) that:
	


“The respect which this Court must pay to the role of a sentencing judge (see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282) extends to respecting the discretion of a sentencing judge to impose a wholly exceptional sentence where the circumstances are suitably exceptional. That is what is meant by ‘individualised justice’.”


	
	Any sentencing judge, and particularly an experienced judge like her Honour, will be attuned to the possibility that a particular case is wholly exceptional (as well as to the possibility that it is merely claimed to be, but is not in fact, exceptional). In any such case, it will be essential for the sentencing judge to make appropriate findings of fact (as occurred in R v DH; R v AH). That will involve more than a mere recitation of undisputed facts and the parties’ submissions. It will ordinarily require an express acknowledgement that the case is exceptional, and an explanation of why what would otherwise be a distortion of the ordinary principles of sentencing is in fact an expression of their flexibility.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by her Honour was outside the available range, given the objective criminality of the conduct to which the Respondent had pleaded guilty. However, even if that were not so, much more needed to be done in order to explain the sentence imposed. Her Honour did not even expressly state that she considered the case to be exceptional. More importantly, her Honour did not explain how she reached that implicit conclusion, or on what findings it was based.
	
	
	Finally, especially if the sentencing judge concludes that a particular case warrants an exceptionally lenient sentence, then there should be scrupulous compliance with applicable statutes and established principles. As Johnson J explains, her Honour failed to comply with laws whose purpose is to promote consistency and transparency (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), ss.53A and 54B), and departed without explanation from orthodox approach of backdating a sentence to take into account presentence custody. Her Honour’s remarks on sentence fail to grapple with why the Respondent’s serious and sustained criminality should result in a sentence of two years’ imprisonment, to be served by means of an intensive correction order. In the absence of findings and reasons, I find it difficult to resist the inference that the reasoning process was tailored to reach a conclusion that the sentence should be one which engaged the power to order that it be served by an intensive correction order (which was in substance the submission advanced on his behalf). Such an approach, if that is what occurred, would be contrary to sentencing principle.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown appeals under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to the sentence imposed on the Respondent, Simon William Cahill, by her Honour Judge Flannery SC at the Sydney District Court on 28 July 2014 for a series of drug supply offences.
	
	
	Her Honour fixed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for two years commencing on 8 August 2014 and expiring on 7 August 2016, to be served by way of an intensive correction order (“ICO”) pursuant to s.7(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Notice of Appeal, signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 19 August 2014, was served upon the Respondent on 21 August 2014.

Facts of Offences


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing which revealed the following criminal conduct.
	
	
	In December 2012, police conducted a controlled operation in relation to the supply of drugs by the Respondent and his associates.
	


Offences on 17 January 2013 - Sequences 20 and 27


	
	On 15 January 2013, an undercover police officer named Jimmy sent a text message asking to meet the Respondent. As a result of an exchange of text messages between the Respondent and Jimmy, the two men met at the Respondent’s home at Darlinghurst on the night of 17 January 2013. Jimmy handed a small empty glass vial to the Respondent who used a syringe to draw out a quantity of liquid from a glass jar (4.5 grams of GBL) which he squirted into the vial which was then handed back to Jimmy.
	
	
	Soon after, the Respondent gave a small resealable plastic bag containing a crystal substance (0.17 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 46.5%) to Jimmy. Jimmy gave $200.00 to the Respondent and Jimmy left the premises.
	


Offences on 21 January 2013 - Sequences 3 and 4


	
	On 21 January 2013, Jimmy and the Respondent communicated again by text message and arranged to meet that evening at the Respondent’s home. Again, Jimmy handed an empty glass vial to the Respondent who used a syringe to draw a quantity of liquid from a small bottle (4.7 grams of GBL) which he squirted into the vial and then returned it to Jimmy.
	
	
	The Respondent again gave a small resealable plastic bag containing a crystal substance (0.19 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 68%) to Jimmy. Jimmy gave $200.00 to the Respondent.
	


Offences on 29 January 2013 - Sequences 5 and 6


	
	On 29 January 2013, Jimmy and the Respondent arranged again to meet that evening at the Respondent’s residence. On this occasion, the Respondent took a plastic tray from a cupboard and put it on the bed. In the tray were, amongst other things, a number of resealable plastic bags containing substances and digital scales. The Respondent took out a bag containing a crystal substance and the digital scales and walked with Jimmy to the kitchen. There the Respondent weighed the resealable plastic bag containing the crystal substance (0.38 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 80%).
	
	
	The Respondent took a small bottle from a shelf and used a syringe to draw liquid from the bottle which he squirted into the vial, again provided by Jimmy. The Respondent took a small brown bottle from a cupboard and squirted more liquid from the syringe into the bottle and then handed the vial and the bottle to Jimmy. The liquid was later identified as 9.56 grams of 1, 4-Butanediol. Jimmy paid the Respondent $350.00 for the prohibited drugs and then left the premises.
	


Offences on 25 February 2013 - Sequences 8 and 9


	
	Between 7 and 25 February 2013, Jimmy and the Respondent communicated by text message with a meeting arranged for the evening of 25 February 2013 at the Respondent’s home.
	
	
	Whilst in the unit, the Respondent opened a kitchen cupboard and removed a plastic container (containing resealable plastic bags), a calculator and two plastic bottles. The Respondent wrote some numbers on a piece of paper, calculating the cost of the drugs to be sold. The Respondent and Jimmy discussed the calculations. The Respondent then gave Jimmy a new mobile phone.
	
	
	The Respondent then used a syringe to draw a quantity of liquid out of a glass jar and squirted the liquid into one of the plastic bottles (115.9 grams of GBL). The bottle was handed to Jimmy.
	
	
	The Respondent then took a small resealable plastic bag containing a crystal substance out of the plastic container and gave the bag (containing 0.98 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 80.5%) to Jimmy. Jimmy paid $1,250.00 to the Respondent for these prohibited drugs.
	


Offences on 1 March 2013 - Sequences 10 and 11


	
	In the period leading up to 1 March 2013, Jimmy and the Respondent discussed Jimmy’s purchase of Methylamphetamine and a litre of GBL. Communications ensued concerning the cost of a litre of GBL.
	
	
	On the evening of 1 March 2013, Jimmy met the Respondent at the Respondent’s home. The Respondent made phone calls to try to get the GBL delivered to his home. Whilst waiting, the Respondent and Jimmy counted out the sum of $6,350.00. Shortly before 11.00 pm, a man called Mark Batstra arrived at the unit. Batstra gave a full one litre plastic “Fiji Water” bottle to the Respondent who then gave the bottle to Jimmy. Jimmy handed the sum of $6,350.00 to the Respondent who gave it to Batstra.
	
	
	The Respondent then held out a small resealable plastic bag containing a crystal substance. Batstra asked the Respondent to check the weight of the bag and he did so using the digital scales. The Respondent handed the plastic bag containing the crystal substance to Jimmy who left the premises.
	
	
	The “Fiji Water” bottle contained 1,144 grams of GBL. The plastic bag contained 3.5 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 79%.
	


Offences on 13 March 2013 - Sequence 12


	
	Between 8 and 12 March 2013, Jimmy and the Respondent communicated by text message, with an arrangement being made to meet on 13 March 2013 at the Respondent’s new home at Rushcutters Bay.
	
	
	Jimmy attended the Respondent’s home on the evening of 13 March 2013. The Respondent opened a small safe in a wardrobe and removed a plastic container from the safe. Inside the plastic container were a number of small resealable plastic bags.
	
	
	The Respondent took one of the bags containing a crystal substance (3.31 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 66%) and placed it on a set of digital scales. The bag was handed to Jimmy who gave the Respondent $1,650.00 in return.
	


Offences on 19 March 2013 - Sequences 13 and 14


	
	About 7.00 pm on 19 March 2013, Jimmy and another undercover officer, Jessica, met the Respondent at a bar in Kings Cross. They arranged to meet soon after at the Respondent’s home.
	
	
	Once there, the Respondent placed an amount of liquid into a small plastic container (6.69 grams of GBL) which he gave to Jessica.
	
	
	Soon after, the Respondent gave Jessica a small resealable plastic bag containing the crystal substance (0.2 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 81%). The Respondent gave the liquid and crystal substance to Jessica as “free samples”.
	


Offences on 27 March 2013 - Sequences 15 and 16


	
	Between 24 and 27 March 2013, Jessica and the Respondent communicated by text message, arranging to meet on 27 March 2013 for Jessica to buy a litre of GBL and an ounce of Methylamphetamine.
	
	
	About 7.50 pm on 27 March 2013, Jimmy and Jessica met the Respondent at the Respondent’s unit. There they met a man called Stephen Crosswell. A full one litre plastic “Fiji Water” bottle and a resealable plastic bag containing a crystal substance were on a table in the lounge room. Jessica examined the bottle and the plastic bag.
	
	
	The Respondent weighed the resealable plastic bag on digital scales in the presence of Jessica, Jimmy and Crosswell. Crosswell and Jessica exchanged phone numbers. The Respondent then wrote down some calculations on a piece of paper and showed the calculations to Jessica. The calculations showed a figure of $6,600.00, with that sum then being handed by Jessica to Crosswell, who counted the money and kept it.
	
	
	Jessica took the “Fiji Water” bottle (containing 1,132 grams of GBL) and the resealable plastic bag (containing 3.5 grams of Methylamphetamine with a purity of 72.5%). Crosswell left the unit followed later by Jimmy and Jessica.
	


Offences on 10 April 2013 - Sequence 19 and the Form 1 Offences


	
	About 3.45 pm on 10 April 2013, police executed a search warrant at the Respondent’s home at Rushcutters Bay. During the execution of the search warrant, police located in the Respondent’s bedroom:
	



	
	four plastic bottles containing (in total) a commercial quantity of GBL (1,327.7 grams with the bottles containing 981 grams, 216.5 grams, 109.3 grams and 20.9 grams respectively) (Sequence 19);
	
	
	the sum of $9,705.00 in cash (Sequence 22 - Form 1);
	
	
	17 4-Bromo-2, 5-Dimethoxyphenethylamine tablets (3.43 grams with a five per cent purity based on 14 tablets) (Sequence 24 - Form 1);
	
	
	21 MDA tablets (4.06 grams with 18.5% purity based on six tablets) (Sequence 25 - Form 1);
	
	
	seven resealable plastic bags containing a total of 13.7 grams Methylamphetamine (of which 9.84 grams had a purity of 78.5%) (Sequence 27 - Form 1);
	
	
	syringes, small resealable plastic bags, small glass vials, digital scales and mobile phones.
	



	
	At about 7.05 pm on 10 April 2013, the Respondent and another man arrived at the unit. The Respondent was arrested and conveyed to the King Cross Police Station where he was charged in relation to these matters.
	
	
	The Respondent remained in custody from 10 April 2013 until his release on bail on 27 August 2013. More will be said about this later in the judgment.
	


The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Respondent was 33 years old at the time of the offences and 34 years old at the time of sentence. He has no prior criminal convictions.
	
	
	The Respondent left school during Year 11 and completed an apprenticeship as a hairdresser. He operated his own salon for three years before moving to London where he worked as a hairdresser for two years. The Respondent returned to Sydney in 2008 and was employed with a multinational hairdressing and product styling company until his arrest.
	
	
	The Respondent commenced using illicit drugs (cocaine) whilst living in London when he was around 24 years of age, following a serious snowboarding accident where he received substantial injuries. The Respondent commenced using Methylamphetamine extensively following the breakdown of a turbulent relationship in September 2011. He used GBL with Methylamphetamine, which had a disinhibiting effect, “to turn it into a party” (ROS9).
	
	
	The evidence revealed, and the sentencing Judge found, that the Respondent had been violently raped by three men when he left a club in Sydney whilst intoxicated at the age of 19 years. The Respondent required 52 stitches to repair injuries to his rectum. The Respondent had received no psychological counselling in respect of the sexual assault until his admission to a rehabilitation program in late 2013, when he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from the rape and an adult personality disorder.
	
	
	A psychologist, Dr Peter Ashkar, expressed the opinion that the Respondent’s drug use masked long-standing symptoms of psychological trauma arising from the sexual assault. The psychologist considered that the Respondent committed the offences to support his substance abuse under “powerful conditions of physiological and psychological dependence” (ROS12).
	
	
	The Respondent was remanded in custody from his arrest on 10 April 2013 until his release to bail on 27 August 2013. He sustained facial injuries in a physical assault in Goulburn Correctional Centre in June 2013. The Respondent had been placed in protective custody because of his sexuality without access to programs or work. He was prescribed antidepressant medication in custody, but discontinued it on his release.
	
	
	On being granted bail in August 2013, the Respondent entered the Salvation Army Dooralong Transformation Centre and had almost completed the 10-month residential rehabilitation program at the time of sentence. The Respondent had not used prohibited drugs since his arrest. He was gaunt at the time of the offences but, by the time of sentence, he had gained 25 kilograms and his health was good.
	
	
	The rehabilitation program co-ordinator described the Respondent as an active participant who had engaged well with his case worker to address his many underlying issues. The Respondent was recognised as one of the program’s senior participants, supporting and encouraging new participants and contributing to the community at the Centre. The program co-ordinator considered that the Respondent had acquired the necessary skills for ongoing recovery, but recommended that he remain in their care to consolidate his skills.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar considered that the Respondent had made steady progress with his recovery and that he was highly motivated to continue with treatment, but the Respondent would need continuing treatment for the management of psychological trauma and substance abuse to minimise the risk of his relapse. The psychologist considered that given the Respondent’s sexuality and his history of a violent sexual assault and a physical assault in custody, a return to prison would be “absolutely detrimental to his rehabilitation” (ROS12).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge accepted that the Respondent was remorseful for the offences (ROS16) and noted that his family had “rallied around” him since his arrest. Her Honour noted the opinion of the psychologist that the Respondent presented a low risk of recidivism provided he continued to receive treatment and support (ROS12) and found that the Respondent had excellent prospects of rehabilitation (ROS16).
	


The Crown Appeal


	
	The Notice of Appeal filed by the Crown on 20 August 2014 contended that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. The Crown’s written submissions provided particulars of that contention, asserting that the sentencing Judge:
	



	
	failed to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence;
	
	
	failed to give weight to the principle of general deterrence;
	
	
	erred in failing to account for the pleas of guilty in the specification of the indicative sentences for each count in accordance with s.53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;
	
	
	erred in failing to indicate what non-parole period would have been imposed for the offences attracting a standard non-parole period, in accordance with s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;
	
	
	erred in imposing an intensive correction order.
	


Course of Proceedings in the District Court


	
	Before turning to the Crown appeal, it is appropriate to refer to the course of proceedings in the District Court.
	
	
	Following pleas of guilty in the Local Court, the Respondent appeared before the sentencing Judge for the first time on 15 May 2014. The Crown case on sentence was entirely documentary.
	
	
	The Respondent and his father gave oral evidence at the sentencing hearing. In addition, (as mentioned above (at [49], [53]), a report dated 13 May 2014 of Dr Ashkar, psychologist, was tendered, together with a letter from Dr Julie Kibby and (as mentioned at [52] above) letters dated 14 May 2014 from the Program Director and AOD Case Worker at the Dooralong Transformation Centre. In addition, a presentence report was furnished to the sentencing court.
	
	
	Counsel for the Respondent at first instance submitted that the Court could determine that a sentence of under two years’ imprisonment was appropriate in all the circumstances, so that assessment of the Respondent for the purpose of an intensive correction order ought be undertaken. At all times, the Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the Respondent’s offences was such that a full-time custodial sentence exceeding two years was necessary.
	
	
	Having heard submissions, the sentencing Judge stood the matter down until later in the day for sentence.
	
	
	Upon resumption, her Honour commenced her remarks on sentence with reference to the maximum penalties applicable to the offences and the relevant standard non-parole period, together with an indication that a 25% discount would apply for the utilitarian value of the Respondent’s pleas of guilty (ROS1).
	
	
	Thereafter, a recital of the facts of the offences was given (ROS1-5). Her Honour outlined the submissions of the Crown and the defence concerning the objective gravity of the offences, and referred to a number of decisions, including R v Clark (NSWCCA, unreported, 15 March 1990), R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 and R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 (ROS6).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge found that the Respondent was trafficking to a substantial degree over a three-month period and was “fairly deeply involved at the retail end of the supply chain” in order to fund his own heavy drug use and partying lifestyle (ROS6-7).
	
	
	Her Honour found that towards the end of the transactions, the Respondent was willing to become involved as “a stepping stone” in the supplies involving larger quantities, but had no wish to become directly involved in the supply of drugs in large quantities. Her Honour found that the Respondent received no direct benefit from his involvement in the supply of larger quantities of drugs although he received, or expected to receive, preferential treatment from Crosswell and Batstra (ROS7).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge said that the drugs, particularly the GBL, were of “modest value” and that the Respondent’s role in the supplies of commercial quantities was as a facilitator only, that the quantities were just above the commercial quantity threshold and that the Respondent participated at the request of the undercover operative in the context of what he perceived as a friendship (ROS7).
	
	
	Her Honour assessed the seriousness of the offences as “relatively low level” (ROS7).
	
	
	Her Honour then turned to the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, reciting the matters referred to at [46] to [54] above.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the Respondent “was remorseful and had excellent prospects of rehabilitation” (ROS16).
	
	
	Her Honour observed that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate (ROS17).
	
	
	Having determined to proceed by way of aggregate sentence, her Honour indicated sentences, and her approach to sentence calculation, in the following way (ROS17-18):
	


“I indicate that for counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 and 27, I impose a term of imprisonment of six months.

I indicate in relation to counts 10 and count 15, I impose a term of imprisonment of two years.

I indicate in relation to count 19, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a sentence of two and a half years.

I intend to reflect some partial accumulation because although you were involved in a course of conduct, the offences were separate and distinct.

The aggregate sentence I would have imposed but for the pleas of guilty is one of four years. I would then reduce that to three years.

The offender has spent four months and 17 days in custody, and almost nine months in residential rehabilitation.

Having regard to those periods and to the fact the he was in protection when he was in custody and subject to the limitations he described, I propose to impose an aggregate sentence of two years.”


	
	Her Honour then approached the ICO issue in the following way (ROS18):
	


“Ms Jardim submitted that if I did arrive at an aggregate sentence of two years, I would consider having the offender assessed to see if he would be suitable to serve his sentence by way of an ICO. She submitted that this was an exceptional case, given the offender’s pleas, his honest account, his substantial efforts at rehabilitation, the circumstances in which he came to use drugs, the difficulty he has had in gaol, and as he has separated himself from his drug using peers and now sees his life in a completely different prism.

I do propose to have the offender assessed to see if he is suitable to serve his sentence by way of an intensive corrections order, as I consider that if he is suitable to serve his sentence in that way, dealing with the matter in that way would reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and the manifold purposes of punishment.

It would also ensure that his substantial efforts at rehabilitation will not be undone.”


	
	The sentencing proceedings were stood over until 28 July 2014 for an ICO assessment to be undertaken and the Respondent’s bail was continued.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014, an ICO assessment report was provided to the Court which assessed the Respondent as suitable for an ICO. The Crown, once again, maintained the submission that a full-time custodial sentence ought be imposed “given the number of the offences and the nature of them involving three commercial quantity drug supply [offences]”.
	
	
	In short remarks on sentence on that day, her Honour said (AB23):
	


“HER HONOUR: This matter was before me on 15 May 2014 at which time I indicated that in respect of all of the matters I would impose an aggregate sentence of two years.

I adjourned the proceedings to see if Mr Cahill was suitable to serve that sentence by way of an Intensive Corrections Order. A report is before me today which indicates that he is suitable to serve his sentence in that way.

I note that the Crown submits that fulltime custody is appropriate. However, in the light of the positive assessment, I propose to impose an aggregate sentence of two years imprisonment, to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order.

The formal orders are, sir, you are convicted of each offence. In respect of counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 and 27, I confirm that I indicate a sentence of imprisonment of six months.

In respect of counts 10 and 15, I confirm I indicate a sentence of two years.

In respect of count 19, and taking into account the matters on the form 1, I confirm that I indicate a sentence of two years and six months.

Taking into account the pre-sentence custody and the time spent in a 

rehabilitation centre, the aggregate sentence I impose is one of two years.”


	
	Thereafter, the sentencing Judge expressed satisfaction for the purpose of s.67 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as to the suitability of the Respondent to be sentenced by way of an ICO, with the sentence to commence on 8 August 2014.
	


Submissions on the Appeal

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate in that imprisonment for two years for all the Respondent’s crimes was unreasonable and plainly wrong and that the use of an ICO (which was dependent upon the sentence not exceeding two years) ought be similarly classified.
	
	
	The Crown advanced arguments in support of the particular contentions (set out at [55] above), culminating in the submission that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing Judge did not make a finding of exceptional circumstances in this case so as to avoid imposition of a full-time custodial sentence for substantial drug supply (in accordance with R v Clark) and that, in any event, such a finding could not be made in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there had been a failure to give weight to the principle of general deterrence both expressly and in the sentence imposed.
	
	
	It was submitted that the indicative sentences were erroneous in that there was non-compliance with s.53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as the indicative sentences were total sentences before application of any discount for pleas of guilty. Once the 25% discount was applied to each sentence, the Crown submitted that the manifest inadequacy of the ultimate aggregate sentence was starkly illustrated.
	
	
	The Crown pointed, as well, to the failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to specify a non-parole period for the indicative sentences for the three standard non-parole period offences as required by s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In each case, a standard non-parole period of 10 years applied to the offence. The failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to comply with this statutory requirement, so the Crown submitted, shed light upon the inadequate and erroneous approach adopted on sentence concerning these offences.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that it was erroneous to proceed by way of ICO in sentencing the Respondent for his offences. The Crown submitted that the approach of the sentencing Judge involved reduction of an aggregate starting point of four years by a process leading to the neat jurisdictional limit of two years, in a manner which indicated a desire on the part of the sentencing Judge to reach this figure so as to open the door to the use of an ICO. The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had tailored the sentence inappropriately in order to meet this legislative threshold for an alternative form of custody: R v Begbie [2001] NSWCCA 206; 124 A Crim R 300 at 305 [34], R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26].
	


Submissions of the Respondent


	
	Whilst acknowledging that the sentence in this case involved a considerable degree of leniency, Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the Respondent, submitted that error had not been demonstrated by the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that it should be inferred that the sentencing Judge had made a finding of exceptional circumstances in this case by accepting the submissions made on behalf of the Respondent at first instance. Further, Mr Gartelmann submitted that such a conclusion was open to the sentencing Judge in all the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account general deterrence as an important factor on sentence.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging that the indicative sentences had not complied with s.53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, Mr Gartelmann submitted that this irregularity in specification of the indicative terms did not invalidate the sentence: s.53A(5). He submitted that the sentencing Judge identified the full indicative terms for each offence and stated that an element of accumulation was to be applied. He submitted that no operative error resulted in the calculation of the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	With respect to the failure to specify a non-parole period for the three standard non-parole period indicative terms, Mr Gartelmann noted that this irregularity did not invalidate the sentence: s.54B(7). He submitted that it was necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the irregularity was material in determining the sentence: PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44]. Counsel submitted that the Crown had not so demonstrated in this case.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to take into account the period of presentence custody, and the period of quasi-custody whilst the Respondent was engaged in a residential rehabilitation program, to reduce the aggregate sentence in the manner adopted by her Honour. Whilst acknowledging that the usual approach would be to backdate a sentence of imprisonment to have regard to presentence custody and quasi-custody, even where there is a broken period of custody, Mr Gartelmann submitted that this approach was not mandatory and that it was open to the sentencing Judge in the exercise of discretion to adopt the approach taken in this case.
	
	
	With respect to the use of an ICO, whilst acknowledging that an ICO reflected considerable leniency, counsel pointed to statements of this Court that an ICO is a substantial punishment: R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 84-85 [107], [109], [111].
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that the Crown had not demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was manifestly inadequate.
	


What the Crown Must Establish on a Crown Sentence Appeal


	
	As the High Court of Australia stated recently in CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9 at [33]-[34], [54], [66] in an appeal against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Crown is required to surmount two hurdles. Firstly, it must demonstrate that the sentence turned on one or more specific errors of law or fact or, in the totality of the circumstances, was unreasonable or plainly unjust. Secondly, if error is demonstrated, the Crown must demonstrate that the discretion under s.5D to resentence the offender should be exercised.
	


The First Question - Has Error Been Demonstrated?


	
	The principal question on this appeal is whether a sentence of two years’ imprisonment by way of ICO failed to give effect to the requirement of reasonable proportionality between the gravity of the Respondent’s offences and the sentence imposed: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.
	
	
	The objective gravity of the Respondent’s crimes was substantial.
	
	
	Firstly, the Respondent supplied repeatedly, and was knowingly involved in the supply of small amounts of Methylamphetamine and larger quantities of GBL from his home on several occasions to undercover operatives who had been introduced to him. The transactions were for cash and took place on eight separate occasions between January and March 2013.
	
	
	Secondly, the amounts supplied to the undercover operative escalated as time passed and the Respondent sourced two amounts of GBL from a co-offender which were in excess of the commercial quantity (one kilogram) during March 2013.
	
	
	Thirdly, in April 2013, when police executed a search warrant at his unit, they found another quantity of GBL in excess of the commercial quantity, quantities of other amphetamine-based drugs and more than $9,700.00 in cash.
	
	
	Fourthly, the Methylamphetamine supplied was generally of a high purity.
	
	
	Fifthly, the Respondent had and utilised various indicia of supply such as resealable bags, a set of digital scales, vials and syringes, a small safe and mobile phones. He was able to calculate the cost of the drugs and gave a “free sample” of drugs to a second undercover operative introduced to him. He was in contact with his co-offender to source the larger quantities.
	
	
	The Respondent engaged in substantial drug supply activity over a period of months. Different forms of prohibited drugs were supplied by him. He utilised his home as the base for supply with a range of paraphernalia present in the premises for that very purpose. Although a user himself, he utilised the proceeds as well to fund his partying lifestyle.
	
	
	The Respondent cannot claim the immaturity of youth as being a factor which bears upon his criminal conduct: R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 127 [72](k). He embarked upon the practice of substantial drug supply at the age of 33 years.
	
	
	It may be accepted that sentencing Judges should consider the circumstances of each case individually, including the availability of alternatives to full-time study, in drug supply cases. As Simpson J observed in EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36 at [10], the starting point for this exercise is s.5(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, the requirement for reasonable proportionality to the objective gravity of the crimes meant that a sentence of two years imprisonment, and the non-custodial options available with that ceiling, were not realistically available in this case.
	
	
	It is the case that the sentencing Judge did not make an express finding of exceptional circumstances (in accordance with R v Clark) in this case. That said, it may be accepted that the approach adopted by her Honour, in referring the matter for an ICO assessment, involved an implied finding of exceptional circumstances by way of acceptance of the submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent at first instance. However, a number of difficulties arise with respect to this finding.
	
	
	The factors relied upon - the Respondent’s pleas, his honest account, his substantial efforts at rehabilitation, the circumstances in which he came to use drugs, the difficulty he had in gaol and the fact that he had separated himself from his drug-using peers and now saw his life in a completely different prism - involved an almost complete concentration on subjective factors.
	
	
	This Court has observed that there is a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case. That is what occurred here, resulting in a failure to ensure reasonable proportionality between the gravity of the crimes and the sentence imposed: R v Dodd at 354.
	
	
	It is difficult to see how the “exceptional circumstances” approach, referred to in R v Clark, could have any application to a case such as this where the magnitude of the drug supply activity included three commercial supply offences and repeated offending over an extended period accompanied by use of a range of drug supply paraphernalia.
	
	
	It is difficult to see that the sentencing Judge gave any proper weight to the standard non-parole period for the three offences to which that period applied.
	
	
	The indicative sentences here constituted a series of head sentences. The indicative sentences should have factored in the discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty: s.53A(2)(b); JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39](3).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge did not comply with the requirements of s.53A(2)(b) and s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Compliance with s.53A(2)(b) would have seen indicative sentences assessed by taking into account such matters in Part 3 (ss.21-43) or elsewhere in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as were relevant. These included, amongst other things, the Respondent’s pleas of guilty and any factors under s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which applied.
	
	
	It was erroneous to select an aggregate sentence and then apply a 25% discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty to that sentence. The purpose of s.53A should be kept in mind. In the course of a valuable summary of principles surrounding aggregate sentencing, RA Hulme J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreeing) said in JM v R at [39](1):
	


“Section 53A was introduced in order to ameliorate the difficulties of applying the decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 in sentencing for multiple offences: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [31]. It offers the benefit when sentencing for multiple offences of obviating the need to engage in the laborious and sometimes complicated task of creating a ‘cascading or 'stairway' sentencing structure’ when the principle of totality requires some accumulation of sentences: R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231]; Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [55]-[57].”


	
	It is not consistent with this principle to select the aggregate sentence and then apply the discount to the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	The imposition of an aggregate sentence is not to be used to minimise the offending conduct, or obscure or obliterate the range of offending conduct or its totality: JM v R at [39](5). I am satisfied that the use of an aggregate sentence in this case did offend against this principle.
	
	
	A principal focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest inadequacy will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved: JM v R at [40](13). I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence in this case did not reflect the totality of the Respondent’s criminality.
	
	
	The erroneous nature of the approach in this case is illustrated by the fact that the aggregate sentence imposed was actually less than one of the indicative sentences and was equal to two others.
	
	
	This Court has emphasised the significant degree of leniency involved in the use of an ICO as a sentence. Although statements made in R v Pogson (in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and myself) point to the breadth of the concept of rehabilitation, and the capacity of an ICO to operate as a form of punishment, it is important not to lose sight of the need for an appropriate and proportionate level of punishment, in the form of immediate incarceration, in cases of serious offending. The decision in R v Pogson should not be utilised to pass an entirely inappropriate sentence which sees an offender such as the Respondent, with his magnitude of offending, being dealt with by way of an ICO. Such an approach does not accord with the principle of reasonable proportionality between the offending conduct and sentence and the need for general deterrence with respect to sentencing substantial drug supply offenders.
	
	
	The Respondent was entitled to have his period of presentence custody taken into account (ss.24(a), 47(2)-(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999), together with some allowance for quasi-custody arising from his attendance at a residential rehabilitation program for a period of months. With respect to the latter, it was open to the sentencing Judge to approach the issue by an allowance of approximately 50% of the credit that would be given in respect of presentence custody: Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48; 185 A Crim R 155 at 162 [38]; Truss v R [2008] NSWCCA 325 at [18]-[23].
	
	
	This Court has consistently favoured (but not mandated) the approach of backdating a sentence of imprisonment to take into account presentence custody, even when there is an element of fiction involved in backdating a sentence to a period when the offender was not in custody: R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; 145 A Crim R 361 at 368 [26]-[27], Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 at [3]-[8] (Howie J).
	
	
	However, even if the approach adopted by the sentencing Judge of reducing the sentence to take account of these periods of custody and quasi-custody was open, the fact remains that an effective head sentence of two years’ imprisonment for all of the Respondent’s crimes was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown has demonstrated that the aggregate sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].
	
	
	The Crown has made good this ground of appeal.
	


Should the Discretion to Resentence the Respondent be Exercised?


	
	The Crown has established error. Accordingly, the first hurdle on a Crown appeal has been cleared. It remains incumbent on the Crown to demonstrate that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised: CMB v Attorney General for NSW at [33].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should proceed to resentence the Respondent.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that the Court should decline to resentence the Respondent and should dismiss the Crown appeal.
	
	
	Further evidence was placed before this Court concerning the Respondent’s progress. This evidence included an affidavit of the Respondent dated 19 February 2015 and affidavits of his solicitor, Rebecca McMahon, dated 22 February and 4 March 2015.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that, after graduating from the Bridge Program, the Respondent remained at Dooralong as a graduate mentor in a volunteer capacity supporting others who were undertaking the program with this role ending on 7 January 2015. The Respondent continues to live at Dooralong participating in the program as a volunteer and supporting people undertaking the program. He intends to continue as a volunteer over the next 12 months whilst he completes his TAFE studies.
	
	
	In February 2015, the Respondent enrolled in a Certificate IV Course in Community Service Work at the Hunter TAFE College. He hopes to graduate from this course at the end of this year. He has enrolled in this course to qualify as a case worker or support worker and to devote his career to assisting others to recover from drug addiction.
	
	
	The evidence points powerfully towards strong rehabilitative steps which have been taken by the Respondent since July 2014.
	
	
	A further report of Dr Ashkar, psychologist, dated 5 February 2015 is before this Court. According to Dr Ashkar, the Respondent appears to have made remarkable progress with his rehabilitation since his sentencing. Importantly, the psychologist considers that sentencing to full-time imprisonment will disrupt the Respondent’s rehabilitation and increase his risk of relapse.
	
	
	Also before this Court is a letter dated 29 January 2015 from Lt Matthew Ryan, Mission and Ministry Director at Dooralong Transformation Centre, which emphasises the Respondent’s progress and his development to become a residential full-time leader in the community. In a letter dated 2 February 2015, Mr Bernie Muendel, Program Director at Dooralong Transformation Centre outlines the very substantial progress made by the Respondent and the assistance which he has provided in a volunteer capacity at the Centre.
	
	
	Ms McMahon’s affidavit of 4 March 2015 contains information from Martin McCrea, the Corrections Officer administering the Respondent’s ICO. Mr McCrea reports that the Respondent has followed all directions and has complied with the conditions of his ICO. Mr McCrea states that the Respondent’s response to supervision has been “fantastic” with the Respondent having “done everything he can for his rehabilitation”.
	
	
	In R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175, this Court said at 197 [146]:
	


“From time to time, this Court has declined to resentence an offender on a Crown appeal, despite error having been established, because of solid and substantial evidence of rehabilitative steps taken by the offender between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal: R v Tortell [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [63]; R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29 at [55]. In such circumstances, it may be seen that the offender has taken full advantage of opportunities for rehabilitation which have presented themselves as a result of an erroneous and unduly lenient sentence. Depending upon the circumstances of the case, the residual discretion may be exercised in favour of the offender with the Court dismissing the Crown appeal.”


	
	The Court observed in R v Speechley (at 195 [127], 197 [146]) that, in those circumstances, the judgment of this Court will still serve the primary purpose of Crown appeals to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This limiting purpose of a Crown sentence appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of discretion under s.5D: CMB v Attorney General for NSW at [35].
	
	
	The question whether the discretion to resentence should be exercised falls to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case.
	
	
	It is necessary to have regard to the sentence imposed, the errors which have been demonstrated and the totality of the evidence concerning the Respondent which is placed before this Court.
	
	
	The evidence before this Court reveals the very substantial progress made by the Respondent since sentence was imposed in July 2014. Not only has great progress been made with his own rehabilitation, but he has fulfilled important functions to promote the rehabilitation of others with drug addiction problems. The Respondent is in a position to serve the public interest in this respect, both at the present time and in the future in a manner which bears upon the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	Further, and importantly, there is evidence that the incarceration of the Respondent at this time will cause actual detriment to his prospects of rehabilitation. The Respondent’s experience in custody, and his own personal history, fortify this conclusion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised in this case.
	
	
	Since writing this judgment, I have had an opportunity to consider the judgments of Leeming JA and Schmidt J. I agree with the observations made by their Honours in those judgments.
	
	
	I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Johnson J and with Leeming JA’s reasons.
	
	
	In this case the sentencing judge failed to engage in the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [37]-[39]. That process requires firstly, that account is taken of all of the relevant factors, balancing the many different and conflicting features revealed by the evidence, those arising from the applicable sentencing principles and those which arise under the sentencing legislation, in order that a single result, which takes due account of them all, may be arrived at, which is just in all of the circumstances. Secondly, the judge’s reasoning process must be adequately revealed, so that victims, the parties, appeal courts and the public can understand the result. Here, neither the individual sentences, nor the overall sentence imposed, were the result of adherence to these requirements.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of each of Mr Cahill’s commercial supply offences had to be assessed without reference to matters personal to him (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]). Mr Cahill’s moral culpability for his offending also had to be considered (see Muldrock at [58]). The maximum penalty had to be considered in the case of each offence, as did the standard non-parole periods which applied to some offences. These were both relevant statutory guideposts which had to be taken into account (see Muldrock and s.54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)).
	
	
	In arriving at an overall sentence, the principle of totality did require a downward adjustment, in order that an appropriate relativity was achieved between the totality of Mr Cahill’s criminality and the totality of the sentences imposed upon him (see Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 63). The resulting overall sentence had to be one which was not crushing, so as to induce in Mr Cahill a feeling of hopelessness and to destroy any expectation of a useful life after release (see R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [17]). Questions of accumulation and concurrency of sentences thus also had to be considered (as discussed in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]).
	
	
	But the sentencing exercise had to result in a sentence which included a non-parole period which reflected the minimum period of actual incarceration that Mr Cahill had to spend in full-time custody for his serious offending, having regard to all the elements of punishment (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 628–629).
	
	
	Here, neither the sentencing remarks delivered when her Honour ordered that Mr Cahill be assessed for an intensive correction order, nor those delivered when the sentence was imposed, adequately revealed the reasoning process by which her Honour arrived at the sentence imposed. Had it been, the serious errors in her Honour’s approach and the conclusions which she reached, might have been avoided.
	
	
	In arriving at a sentence, sentencing judges must pay regard to all of the purposes of sentencing specified in s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They include not merely rehabilitation, but also punishment, deterring offenders and others from committing similar offences, protecting the community from the offender, making the offender accountable for his or her actions, denouncing their conduct and recognising the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	
	
	These considerations were all important in this case, given the serious drug offences which Mr Cahill admitted committing. The seriousness of drug supply offences and the need for general deterrence to feature in the sentences imposed on such offenders, given the serious social consequences of the criminal trade involved in the supply of prohibited drugs, has been repeatedly discussed by this Court. Pity for Mr Cahill’s difficult personal circumstances could not prevail over proper adherence to the requirements of the sentencing task, difficult as that undoubtedly was in this case.
	
	
	I also agree with Johnson J that despite these conclusions, this is a case where the Court should exercise the discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal, despite finding error. In this case, the additional evidence received on appeal which Johnson J has discussed, has also convinced me that this discretion should be exercised in this case.

		02 April 2015",2015-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766311,R v Wright [2015] NSWSC 2109,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The matter before the court is an application for bail in circumstances where there is no requirement as a preliminary for the applicant to show cause as to why bail ought be granted.
	
	
	This is not a matter that the legislature has prescribed is an offence of such seriousness or committed in such circumstances that the ordinary presumptions do not apply. As a consequence I am required to look at the question of unacceptability of risk.
	
	
	It is obvious that there is an unacceptable risk if not ameliorated by conditions. The only real issue is whether conditions can be imposed which ameliorate the risk. The most relevant risk is the one to the victim of the domestic violence offences, each of the other offences having been committed it seems as an ancillary aspect of the desire to perpetrate the domestic violence in question.
	
	
	The applicant is not a person of whom it can be said there is an unacceptable risk of non-appearance but the issue of the risk of serious offence to the victim is one which has given me great concern. The applicant’s lengthy criminal record discloses repeat offending in relation to domestic violence and breaches of domestic violence orders and court orders generally in relation to the issues of his relationships.
	
	
	The applicant says that he does not seek to deal with the victim, that is a commendable attitude in circumstances between now and the trial, but it must be qualified by the fact that most of the offences in question have been perpetrated in circumstances where the applicant was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol thereby qualifying the rational judgment that is displayed by that stated intention.
	
	
	The question was posed that his background, which bespeaks typical circumstances for which the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260, the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 and this Court in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, made mention and their relevance in bail.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Michael John Brown [2013] NSWCCA 178 said this:
	


“In the cases of Aboriginal accused, particularly where the applicant for bail is young, alternative culturally appropriate supervision, where appropriate, (with an emphasis on cultural awareness and overcoming the renowned antisocially effects of discrimination and/or an abused or disempowered upbringing), should be explored as a preferred option to a remand in gaol.

Since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (see particularly Recommendations 89-91 and the National Report at 21.4 and following), the incidence of Aboriginal incarceration has increased dramatically, overwhelmingly as a result of the increase in the numbers on remand. In this case, no such culturally appropriate alternative supervision is proposed or available.”


	
	What is proposed is a situation where the applicant is to reside with a close relative in Lithgow, and not attend at Parkes, which is the residence of the victim over some period.
	
	
	While I still have some concerns as to the risk associated with the liberty of the applicant, I consider that the injunction of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Brown, together with the conditions that have been imposed, are such that the liberty on bail is not in the circumstances unacceptable and bail will be granted.
	
	
	In the matter of Luke Charles Wright, date of birth xx May 1984, for the charges of breach of bond, damage property said to have been committed on 2 March 2013, and the charges of common assault, two counts of damage property, one count of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, one count of assault police officer in execution of duty, one count of resist police officer in execution of duty, one count of intimidation, one count of aggravated break and enter to commit serious indictable offence, malicious damage knowing persons are present, bail is granted subject to the following conditions.

		14 September 2016",2015-04-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766334,Porter v R [2015] NSWCCA 59,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Adamson J. I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour, and with her reasons. I wish only to add briefly to the reasons given in relation to Ground 2. This ground arises out of a remark made by the sentencing judge, quoted at [32] of the draft judgment of Adamson J.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to a previous decision of this Court (Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 85) which had been cited to him, and stated that he was bound to follow it. Precisely what he meant by that is unclear. Of course, a District Court judge is bound to follow statements of principle made in this Court. But his Honour did not refer to any statement of principle in Chen by which he considered himself bound, and which he therefore felt obliged to follow. A reading of Chen shows that, to the extent that there are statements of principle, they are orthodox and well known.
	
	
	However, the offender in Chen was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. That is the sentence ultimately imposed upon the applicant. The remark, taken in isolation from other remarks, but together with the sentence, is apt to give the impression that his Honour felt he was bound to impose the sentence that had been imposed in Chen. If that were what happened, error would be revealed.
	
	
	Perusal of the transcript of the discussion prior to sentencing shows that this was not the case. His Honour was shown a decision of this Court in R v Rudd [2010] NSWCCA 71, about which he expressed the opinion that the sentence imposed was unduly lenient. He was then handed the judgment in Chen, and observed that the sentence was “five and three”. He confirmed that an appeal from that sentence had been dismissed. He then turned his attention to statistics (presumably those prepared by the Judicial Commission of NSW) and observed that 96 per cent of offenders convicted of the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty would be sentenced to imprisonment, and that the most common sentence, applicable to 26 per cent of offenders, was 6 years. He said that he did not look at the non-parole periods. He said:
	


“But the most common sentence is six years and then there’s four years, five years, seven years, whatever.

…

I think they go between two years and 16 years so that’s a pretty wide range.”


	
	He agreed with the observation of counsel for the applicant that the offence was “a wide ranging” one.
	
	
	This discussion indicates, in my opinion, that the impression that his Honour felt obliged to impose the sentence that was imposed in Chen is incorrect. However, it is understandable from the manner in which the remarks on sentence were framed.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Garling ADCJ in the District Court at Nowra on 6 December 2013 following his plea of guilty to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Two matters were taken into account on a Form 1 (pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)): driving an uninsured vehicle and using an unregistered vehicle. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 23 June 2013, with a non-parole period of three years.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal, if leave is granted are:
	


1   The sentencing judge erred by failing to make critical factual findings about which there was unchallenged evidence by the applicant.

2.   The sentencing judge erred in the conclusion that he was bound to follow the decision of this Court in Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 85.

3.   The sentencing judge erred in the failure to have regard to those principles which attach to sentencing a person with a mental illness.

4.   The sentence is manifestly excessive in the unusual circumstances of this case.

The facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the Agreed Facts which formed the basis of the plea and were tendered on sentence. Although there are issues about the extent to which all facts were agreed, it is reasonably clear that the following facts were agreed, except where specifically noted to the contrary.
	
	
	The applicant and the victim’s son, Jake Stannard, had been good friends until about mid-2012. On 13 January 2013 a number of motorcycles had been stolen from the property at Falls Creek where Jake lived with his parents, the victim (Michael Stannard) and his wife, Kerry. Jake suspected the applicant’s involvement and informed police where the motorcycles might be located. On 13 February 2013, the applicant was charged with their theft. The animosity between the applicant and Jake grew.
	
	
	At about 1.45am on Sunday 24 March 2013 Jake was home with his parents and his girlfriend. His parents were woken by someone knocking at the front door and went out to investigate. Jake was woken by his girlfriend who heard noises outside. Mrs Stannard came to the front door ahead of her husband, Mr Stannard (the victim). She recognised the applicant, who said, “Where’s Sean and Josh. . . I suppose Jake’s in on it too?” She told him that Sean and Josh were not there and asked him what he was doing there. By this time the victim had come outside onto the verandah and heard his wife talking to the applicant, whom he also recognised. The victim walked down from the verandah to the grass where the applicant was standing. The applicant noticed that the victim was holding something behind his back and asked what it was.
	
	
	By this time, Mrs Stannard was concerned enough to return inside the house and call Triple-0. The applicant told that victim that there was nothing behind his back, at which point the victim attempted to wrestle the applicant to the ground to remove whatever was behind his back. The applicant pushed the victim to the ground. When the victim saw that the applicant had a machete in his hand he raised his left arm to try to protect his head. The applicant struck the victim’s left arm with the machete.
	
	
	In the meantime, Jake came outside and saw the applicant. He ran back inside to grab something, which the Crown contended was an old wooden axe handle and the applicant said was an air rifle. By the time Jake came outside again, the applicant had pushed Mr Stannard to the ground. Jake saw the applicant strike his father with the machete. The applicant immediately left the scene on his motorcycle but did not illuminate its headlights.
	
	
	After a police chase, the applicant was apprehended and arrested about 200ms from his home in Worrigee. He had a backpack which contained a machete. The motor cycle was unregistered and uninsured. The applicant’s blood alcohol reading was .066%.
	
	
	The applicant agreed to take part in an electronically recorded interview with police during which he admitted going to the Stannard’s property with a machete, which he said was for his protection. He refused to answer questions relating to the assault. He admitted that he was the rider of the motorcycle but said that he did not realise that the police were pursuing him.
	


The sentence hearing


	
	The applicant’s counsel, Mr Ford, sought that the sentence hearing be adjourned for the sole purpose of obtaining a further expert report relating to the applicant’s mild intellectual disability, which was referred to in a report of Dr Furst, a psychiatrist, which the applicant proposed to tender. His Honour declined the adjournment. No complaint is made about this ruling.
	
	
	Mr Ford indicated that there was also an outstanding issue relating to provocation and that the applicant contended that threats had been made from the “victim’s side”, by the victim’s son. He also identified an “issue in relation to the firearm”. The Crown informed the sentencing judge that, in his record of interview, the applicant said that the victim’s son came out with an air rifle and that he fired three shots. His Honour indicated that any such issues could be resolved by calling the applicant and tendering the record of interview. The Crown then informed the sentencing judge that no shots were heard on the recording of the Triple-0 call. His Honour then said that such matters could be resolved by evidence adduced on the sentence hearing.
	
	
	The factual issues having been referred to, the Crown tendered the Crown Sentencing Summary, which included a document entitled “Statement of Agreed Facts”; photographs of the victim’s injuries, the machete and the backpack; the applicant’s criminal and custodial history as well as material relating to the injuries inflicted on the victim. The expert certificate of Dr Swinton stated that the victim sustained an 8cm laceration to the left upper arm, which was debrided and sutured. The Crown also tendered a Form 1 and asked the Court to take the matters on Form 1 into account when sentencing the applicant. The matters listed on the Form 1 were driving an uninsured vehicle and using an unregistered vehicle. None of this material was objected to.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel tendered the report of Dr Furst dated 14 November 2013. Dr Furst recorded that the applicant was a 21-year old Aboriginal male who was unemployed and, at the time of his arrest, lived with his former fiancée and her brother. His parents separated when he was 8 or 9 years old. He missed some of his schooling in Years 9 and 10 because he had learning difficulties, poor concentration and apparent Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, for which he was treated with medication. He had difficulties at school and was suspended several times. He suffered from depression and anxiety. He witnessed his father being assaulted when he was about 13, which caused him to avoid the scene, and also to avoid going out. Dr Furst considered that the symptoms that followed this incident (hyper-vigilance, high levels of anxiety and avoidance, re-experiencing phenomena, depression, substance abuse and social maladjustment) were consistent with the applicant’s having suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.
	
	
	The applicant’s paternal uncle and aunt were murdered when he was about 12-13 years old. His maternal uncle was murdered in Melbourne with a machete when the applicant was 18 years old. The applicant told Dr Furst that these losses “tore him apart”. The applicant takes Zoloft and Seroquel and denied drinking alcohol regularly or using illicit drugs at all.
	
	
	Dr Furst considered the applicant to meet the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic dysthymia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and possible mild intellectual disability. He considered that these conditions “will probably make a custodial sentence more onerous for him than the average inmate”. Dr Furst also considered that his post-traumatic stress disorder, low level of intellectual function and general lack of maturity were “all mitigating factors that probably prevented him from properly considering and choosing an alternative course of action” on the night of the assault. Dr Furst opined:
	


“[the applicant’s] PTSD and past experiences of witnessing his father being knocked unconscious and having three close family members murdered most likely amplified the risk he perceived to his family. . . when he chose the course of action he embarked upon, confronting and attacking the victim with a machete”.


	
	Dr Furst considered the applicant to have “positive prospects of being successfully rehabilitated”.
	
	
	After a short adjournment, Mr Ford called the applicant who verified the history he had given to Dr Furst. The applicant gave evidence of threats being made to him by Jake and the victim. The applicant said that he had been told by a friend that he had received a message from Jake and the victim that they were at the Husky pub and wanted to fight them. The applicant went home to Worrigee that evening and subsequently went out to the property where the Stannards lived. He took a large machete with him. He said that he took it with him because he knew that the Stannards had a small calibre air rifle and he wanted to have something with which to protect himself.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence of what occurred at the Stannards premises was as follows:
	


Q.   So when you went there what happened?

A.   I got there and the, I think it was the far right room, it was all the way at the right end of the house which I believe was Jake’s bedroom the light, there was a small light on in the room so I went and I knocked on the window there and there wasn’t any answer so I knocked on the door, the front door and then I went back down on the grass out the front and Jake’s mum come out and was wondering what was going on, who it was and stuff like that. Soon after that Michael, Jake’s father come out the front door and come running down the stairs and he got real close at first and then he was saying what’s going on and stuff like that and then got up a bit closer and he started to have a bit of a push and shove and he grabbed a hold of me like he we trying to pull me down sort of thing and kept yelling out to Jake that was coming out the door as this was happening to go and get it and that’s all he kept yelling out was, “Get it Jake”. Soon after that was when Jake come out the front doors the rifle, after Jake had fired one shot at me I got the machete from behind my back, it was in my bag, I hit Michael in the left arm so that he’d let go of me.

Q.   What did you do then?

A.   There was another two shots fired at me, one when I was running back down the driveway and one when I was putting my helmet on to get back on my motorbike. From there, yeah I rode back to Worrigee where I was picked up.


	
	The applicant was cross-examined about having stolen motorcycles from the family, which was part of the conflict between himself and the Stannard family. It was put to him that Jake did not come out with an air rifle, but he disagreed. The applicant agreed he had listened to the Triple-0 recording in the brief of evidence and that he was unable to hear any rifle shots on the recording. He agreed that the whole incident took only a few minutes.
	
	
	The applicant’s mother, Veronica Gersbach, was also called. She gave evidence that the applicant and Jake had been to kindergarten together but had fallen out. Ms Gersbach was concerned that threats were being made to her son and went to the police station at Nowra in about late January 2013 to report the threats. She was told that the police could not do anything unless something had actually happened. In cross-examination she agreed that there was harassment on both sides between Jake and the applicant.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	His Honour recounted the facts derived from the Agreed Facts, which are set out above. His Honour noted that the applicant had, at the time of the offence, no criminal record but has since been convicted of various matters for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment. The sentencing judge noted the matters on the Form 1. His Honour found that the applicant was entitled to a 25% discount by reason of his early plea of guilty. His Honour referred to the report of Dr Furst and summarised the main findings as well as the effect on the applicant of seeing his father assaulted.
	
	
	His Honour addressed the principal factual issue between the Crown and the accused in the following terms:
	


“The offender told me a slightly different version of what he said happened on this night. He said he had been at a pub/hotel with some mates having some drinks. There had been an exchange of text messages between himself and at least one or more of the people he eventually got into strife with. They had been threatening each other in effect, he said he had had problems with these people for some time and for some reason, I do not think he could explain it, he arms himself and goes to the property in the early hours of the morning. It is very hard to understand why he might have done that because he was liable to have got a hiding for being on their property but he did. His alcohol intake was not that great because we know what his reading was a short time afterwards but apparently he went there, he gives a slightly different version of what happened. He believes there was an air rifle involved, some shots fired. None of that appears in the facts and I am assured by the Crown that if you listen to the triple-0 call which is going on at the time all this is happening you do not hear any shots. Be that as it may I do not think it affects the sentence too much.

But I can be satisfied that this all occurred in the context of an ongoing dispute. I can deal with it on the basis that he should not have gone to the property. He probably did take the machete to protect himself. I do not believe it was planned. I believe that what happened was he being there that the victim approached him and he struck out hitting the victim on the arm and causing injury.”


	
	His Honour found the offence to be “most serious” and said:
	


“To wound someone in this way is extremely serious.”


	
	The following passage from his Honour’s reasons indicate that general and specific deterrence were taken into account:
	


“He has got to be sentenced in such a way that he understands he cannot do this and that others in the community understand they cannot act in this way.”


	
	His Honour reviewed the statistics and referred in the following terms to a decision of this Court, Chen v R, on which Mr Ford had relied in submissions:
	


“I have been given a case of Chen v R 13 April 2011, despite the fact it is a decision of my brother’s I am still bound to follow it, I do not mean my brother judge I mean my brother, in which there was a somewhat similar sort of altercation and that person was sentenced to a similar sentence to what I am going to sentence this man to, not because of that case but because that sort of shows where the Court of Criminal Appeal are thinking about in these cases. I would have sentenced this man to a much higher sentence until I became more aware of what was going on in the background, in other words it is not someone deliberately going out to use this weapon to injure someone, it happened in the light of this ongoing dispute and obviously a somewhat difficult situation.”


	
	The sentence imposed of five years with a three year non-parole period reflected his Honour’s finding of special circumstances, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term having been adjusted from the statutory ratio of 75% (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) to 60%.
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence

Ground 1: failure to accept unchallenged evidence of the applicant


	
	Ms Francis, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, submitted that his Honour was bound to make a finding on the question whether Jake fired the air rifle and that the applicant’s account ought to have been accepted as it was relevantly uncontroverted.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was not entitled to take facts into account in a way that was adverse to the interests of the offender unless the facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt, but if there were circumstances to be taken into account in favour of the offender it was sufficient that they be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
	
	
	It follows from this principle that the sentencing judge would have been entitled to take into account that Jake fired the air rifle if his Honour had been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this is what actually occurred. However, his Honour was not obliged to accept the applicant’s account, merely because neither Jake nor the victim nor the victim’s wife was called to controvert it. Although Ms Francis described the applicant’s evidence as “unchallenged” it was more correctly described as “uncontroverted” since it was put to the applicant by the Crown in cross-examination at the sentence hearing that no shots had been fired and the concession elicited from the applicant (for what it was worth) that the shots could not be heard on the recording of the Triple-0 call.
	
	
	The trial judge’s reasons indicate that his Honour accepted, on the balance of probabilities, that the applicant believed that the air rifle was involved and also believed that some shots were fired. This finding, which was in the applicant’s favour, was open to his Honour. The applicant has not demonstrated any error in the sentencing judge’s approach.
	
	
	Furthermore it is difficult to see what difference it would have made if the finding had been made that Jake had fired the air rifle. Jake had been woken in the early hours of the morning by the applicant, with whom he had an ongoing dispute. He could see his father on the lawn with the applicant. Jake must have been concerned for his father’s welfare. I do not accept that Jake’s conduct, even if he had discharged the air rifle, could amount to any relevant provocation that would mitigate the seriousness of the applicant’s assault of Jake’s father. It was, in my view, open to the sentencing judge to consider that the actual facts relating to the air rifle were not particularly material to the overall sentence. Moreover, as referred to above, the finding that the sentencing judge made (that the applicant believed that the air rifle had been discharged) was in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	Where there are agreed facts for sentence it is desirable that the statement of agreed facts be signed by or on behalf of the offender and the Crown. Where there are disputed facts it is necessary that any dispute be described with some precision so that it can be recorded on the transcript, if not in a document. Any evidence relating to the disputed factual issue can then be adduced and the issue determined, if required, by the sentencing judge in the remarks on sentence. In the present case, this course was not adopted. Although a dispute was flagged by Mr Ford, it was not described with precision. The statement of Agreed Facts was neither signed nor objected to. However, it was, in some respects, irreconcilable with the applicant’s evidence. For example, the so-called Agreed Facts recorded that Jake went inside to get an old wooden axe handle when this was plainly not agreed.
	
	
	Nonetheless, for the reasons given above in the narrative of the sentence hearing, I consider it to be reasonably clear that there was agreement as to the facts on the basis of which the applicant was to be sentenced, with one exception: whether Jake came out of the house with an air rifle and whether it was fired. The present case illustrates the importance of identifying agreed facts for the purposes of sentencing. Even if negotiations about the facts are continuing up until the time of the hearing, a typed draft brought to Court should be amended, by hand, if need be, and the changes initialled so as not to delay the proceedings. If this procedure is adopted, the sentencing judge and, in the event of an application for leave to appeal, this Court are in a position to know the extent of the agreement as to the facts.
	


Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in the conclusion that he was bound to follow Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 85


	
	His Honour, in the course of the remarks on sentence, referred to the decision of this Court in Chen v R. His Honour also mentioned the fact that his natural brother was a member of the Court that determined the appeal. His Honour also highlighted the double-meaning of the word “brother” which embraces not only a natural brother, but also another judge, who is a colleague. In the present case, Garling J was a brother in both respects to Garling ADCJ. His Honour’s comments, though gratuitous, do not, in my view, reveal error and amount to no more than a relatively unguarded but impromptu irrelevant remark such as might insinuate itself into reasons given ex tempore, where the judicial officer does not have the luxury of time that would have afforded an opportunity to remove it. Any impression of error that these comments may have created was, in my view, dispelled by the following words: “not because of that case but because that sort of shows where the Court of Criminal Appeal are thinking about in these cases”.
	
	
	Ms Francis also submitted that Mr Ford had drawn the sentencing judge’s attention to R v Chen to provide an example of what Mr Ford described as a “much more serious matter” in which a sentence of five years with a three year non-parole period was imposed. The purpose for which Mr Ford relied on R v Chen appeared from the transcript.
	
	
	The use that can be made of other cases is limited: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1, per Simpson J at [303]-[305], cited with approval by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]. I do not consider that his Honour’s remarks on sentence, fairly read, disclose any lack of appreciation of the use to which R v Chen could be put. Error cannot be demonstrated merely by comparing one decision with another and trying to reconcile them as if one were a benchmark and the other required to be measured accordingly.
	


Ground 3: the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the principles which apply to sentencing persons with a mental illness


	
	The applicant submitted:
	


“The complex considerations which warranted particular leniency in this case were the coincidence of the applicant’s youth, his tragic personal history and the resultant psychological frailties of a very young man with no tendencies towards violence.”


	
	A mental condition cannot be regarded as either mitigating or aggravating since it depends on the circumstances: it may, for example, diminish moral culpability and lessen the requirement for general deterrence but may increase the risk of future offending: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the applicant was young, had a very sad history and background and had been traumatised by the violence suffered by members of his family, and in particular the assault on his father and the murder of three of his close relatives. The sentencing judge accepted the applicant’s resultant psychological frailties and that he had no relevant criminal record prior to the offence for which he was to be sentenced. Nonetheless, his Honour was bound to take into account the matters listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act including: punishment (s 3A(a)), general and specific deterrence (s 3A(b)) and the protection of the community (s 3A(c)).
	
	
	Furthermore the maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years and the standard non-parole period is seven years. These are the relevant guideposts, which his Honour was obliged to take into account: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].
	
	
	I am not persuaded that ground 3 has been made out.
	


Ground 4: the sentence is manifestly excessive in the unusual circumstances of the present case


	
	The applicant relied on the following factual findings in support of the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive:
	


“the offence occurred in the context of an ‘ongoing dispute and obviously a somewhat difficult situation’;

the applicant ‘probably’ took the machete to protect himself;

the offence was not planned;

the applicant did not go to the property with the intention of injuring anyone;

he was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation;

there were special circumstances and

the injuries had resolved at the time of sentencing.”


	
	For the reasons given above, I am not satisfied that any of the specific grounds (1, 2 or 3) have been made out. However, manifest excess is a conclusion and does not require the identification of a specific error: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].
	
	
	Although the applicant’s subjective circumstances revealed substantial misfortune and hardship, the objective circumstances of the offence were serious. The applicant went to a residential property at one o’clock in the morning to disturb the occupants. He carried a machete in his back pack. Although his actions appeared to be in furtherance of an existing dispute, he was responsible for escalating the dispute on the night. The victim was a householder who was disturbed in the middle of the night by someone who was apparently antagonistic. When the victim attempted to disable the applicant, he was stabbed with a machete and suffered injuries which, though substantial, might have been even more serious having regard to the weapon used to inflict them. In these circumstances I do not consider the sentence imposed on the applicant to be manifestly excessive.

		10 April 2015",2015-04-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766347,Johan v R [2015] NSWCCA 58,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments in draft of both Simpson J and Schmidt J. I agree with the reasons of Schmidt J and her Honour’s conclusion that although there should be a grant of leave, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
	
	
	I acknowledge the force of Simpson J’s observation that the undiscounted starting point for two of the s 97(2) offences was eight years, considerably higher than the four to five year range stated in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, even allowing for the fact that the latter incorporates a limited utilitarian discount for a guilty plea. But I respectfully disagree that the disparity discloses appellable error. As Schmidt J has pointed out, Henry was directed to a different, less serious offence, where a small amount is taken, committed by a young offender with no or little criminal history. Harley Johan was armed with a loaded rifle when he robbed his victims, the amounts he stole were not small, he had a lengthy criminal history and all of his crimes were committed while he was on parole following his conviction for robbery in company committed the previous year. It was open to the sentencing judge to impose head sentences of 6 years and 9 months for the two most serious of the five armed robberies to which he pleaded guilty, noting also that they were substantially accumulated with the sentences imposed for the other offences.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: The facts of the offences for which the applicant stood to be sentenced are fully set out in the judgment of Schmidt J, which I have read in draft, and do not call for repetition. It is sufficient to say that, as a 17 year old about to turn 18, the applicant embarked on a course of serious and dangerous criminal offending. The offending began on 31 December 2011, just eight days before the applicant turned 18 (and while he was on parole), and continued until his arrest on 22 January 2012. It involved the use of dangerous weapons, and three of the four armed robbery offences as well as the aggravated break and enter offence, were committed in company with another person. The rifle, of which the applicant was in possession at the time of his arrest on 22 January, was then loaded, and it is a fair inference that it was loaded during the commission of the armed robbery offences. Numerous victims were put in fear, and in very real danger. In all, during that short period of time, the applicant committed four armed robberies (each carrying a maximum period of imprisonment of 25 years), a specially aggravated break and enter with intent (carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years) and possession of a firearm (carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years). The armed robbery charges were brought under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	I mention this at the outset of these reasons because it is necessary to balance the very serious objective criminality for which the applicant was to be sentenced against the equally compelling evidence of his personal circumstances.
	
	
	As I have mentioned, the applicant was a young offender, on the verge of turning 18 at the commencement of this criminal campaign, just 18 years of age for the remainder. He has a record of criminal offences that began when he was 14 years of age, and includes a number of non-custodial dispositions. On at least five occasions, in 2008 and 2009, when the applicant was 14 and 15 years of age, those dispositions included orders “to stay every night as directed by the Department of Community Services”, or “to reside as directed by Juvenile Justice and DOCS”. Orders in these terms reflect the instability of the applicant’s accommodation arrangements, and his personal history as presented to the District Court, principally through a pre-sentence report and the report of a psychologist, Ms Kathryn Wakely. In respect of later offences, the applicant was subject to “control orders” to be served in Juvenile Justice custody.
	
	
	At the age of 19 and a half, the applicant estimated that, since the age of 13, he had spent about 18 months in total at liberty.
	
	
	The applicant was in born in January 1994 to an Aboriginal mother and a father who he has never met, but believes to have been African-American. Before the age of 2 he was removed from the care of his mother by welfare authorities. The reasons for the removal were recorded as:
	


“… an itinerant lifestyle, adult sexual activity, substance abuse, violence, and an erratic parenting style.”


	
	Initially he was placed in the care of his maternal grandparents who were themselves subsequently deemed “unsuitable carers”, and from whose care he was also removed. He was then placed into various foster care placements. He was removed from one of these placements by reason of substantiated abuse (the precise nature of which is not before this Court). Other placements failed because the carers were unable to cope with his persistent difficult behaviour. In one placement he was subjected to sexual abuse by an older foster brother. Notwithstanding these placements, he has had some contact with his mother. As a result of that contact, in August 2012 (after his arrest on the present offences), he was awarded $10,000 in victims’ compensation for physical abuse and violence at her hands, and the hands of a person with whom she was living.
	
	
	The applicant has never held employment. Prior to his present incarceration he was in receipt of a disability pension as a result of diagnosed intellectual disability. Over the years he has been diagnosed with various conditions, set out in the report of Ms Wakely. These include disorganised attachment style (1997), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (2001), Asperger’s syndrome (2001, but later eliminated), post-traumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, reactive attachment disorder (2005) and Tourette’s syndrome. He has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but subsequently claimed that that diagnosis came about because he gave a false history to the examiner.
	
	
	Ms Wakely assessed his intelligence as in the mild intellectual disability range.
	
	
	There is a history of mental illness in the family; his mother is said to suffer from mental illness, but again, the nature of that mental illness is not before the Court.
	
	
	The applicant is not addicted to alcohol, which he rarely consumes. He has, however, a serious drug habit, and has used cannabis, ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine and heroin.
	
	
	Ms Wakely interviewed the applicant at a time when he had been in custody for 18 months, and had refrained from drug consumption. He expressed a wish, and intention, to be and remain drug free. Notwithstanding that, Ms Wakely assessed him to be in the high range for risk of general recidivism.
	
	
	It can be seen that the applicant’s criminal offences, and his personal circumstances, presented an extremely difficult sentencing task. In effect, two extremes, pulling in opposite directions, confronted the sentencing judge. At one extreme, the offences were very serious; at the other, the applicant’s personal circumstances called for a degree of mitigation. The sentencing exercise was to effect some reasonable reconciliation between the two.
	
	
	There has never been any doubt that a history of deprivation is a circumstance that warrants, in an appropriate case, some mitigation of sentence: R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58; Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571. However, those circumstances are to be balanced against the need to recognise the harm done to victims of offences, particularly offences of violence: Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600.
	
	
	By his first ground of appeal, the applicant complains that the sentencing judge failed to give “appropriate weight” to his age and background in assessing his moral culpability.
	
	
	What his Honour said in this respect is:
	


“The court has been provided with a pre-sentence report and a Juvenile Justice report. That Juvenile Justice background report is a necessary report in relation to the robbery of the bakery on 31 December 2011 because he was still a juvenile at that point in time. In relation to that matter the Court takes into account s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act [1987]. The Court notes the content of the presentence report and the Juvenile Justice report and the Court has also considered the psychological report prepared by Kathryn Wakely. All three documents speak for themselves and clearly establish that this young man has had a deprived and exceedingly problematic upbringing. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine anything worse. I do not propose though to extract any specific details as to his upbringing into these remarks. It is all to be found in those reports and I have closely considered the reports.”


	
	Later, his Honour said:
	


“The Court notes that this offender is a young man and the principles espoused by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the sentencing of young offenders is applied, although the Court notes the proviso set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the applicability of youth, that is, that general and specific deterrence are still relevant where the young person commits an adult type crime, which is certainly the situation in this case.”


	
	On the face of the Remarks on Sentence, therefore, it is difficult to see how this ground of appeal can be sustained, unless it can be shown that the express recognition of the applicant’s history did not translate into the sentence imposed. In Bugmy, the High Court made it clear that the attribution of weight to the various (and often conflicting) sentencing considerations is a matter for the sentencing judge: see [24]. The question, the High Court held, is whether a sentence has been imposed that is above or below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards.
	
	
	That brings me to the second ground of appeal, which is that the “overall sentence” imposed was manifestly excessive. The argument advanced in support of this ground depended heavily upon the guideline decision of this Court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. That decision was principally concerned with offences against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years (compared with the 25 years applicable to the applicant’s armed robbery offences).
	
	
	In Henry, in respect of offences against s 97(1), with certain common elements (set out in the judgment of Schmidt J) this Court held that sentences should generally fall between 4 and 5 years for the full term. It is of interest that in the Henry guideline, no mention is made of mitigating circumstances other than youth and limited criminal record. In particular, the guideline promulgated was not designed to take into account a history of deprivation and/or disadvantage of the kind recognised in Fernando, Bugmy and Munda - and present, to an extreme degree, in this care. Any recognition of those circumstances must come into effect after consideration of the guideline of 4-5 years.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, although his Honour had referred to Henry, he had “discounted” it, because it dealt with charges brought under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, and had not had regard to it in sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	There are, as Schmidt J has pointed out, more and better reasons for departing from the Henry guideline. The guideline applies to an individual offence. It refers to a weapon as “like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury”. It may be thought that a rifle would be more frightening to a victim, and the fact that it is (as was the rifle in the possession of the applicant on his arrest) loaded makes it significantly more dangerous than a knife. That is the reason that an offence against s 97(2) carries a 25 per cent higher penalty than an offence against s 97(1). Moreover, in all except one of the offences, more than “a small amount” was taken. On the other hand, the Henry guideline presupposes only a slight reduction (10 per cent) in respect of a plea of guilty. Here, the applicant was expressly allowed a reduction of 15 per cent.
	
	
	Sentencing is not a mathematical exercise, and it would not be right to approach the question of manifest excess merely on the basis that, because the maximum penalty in respect of a s 97(2) offence is 25 per cent higher than the maximum penalty applicable to a s 97(1) offence, the sentence, by reference to the guideline, should be adapted in the same proportion. However, such an exercise is capable of bringing the sentences imposed on the applicant into perspective. Here, the head sentences (6 years and 9 months) imposed in respect of two of the armed robbery offences were 68 per cent higher than the bottom of the Henry range, and 35 per cent above the top of the Henry range. In respect of each of those offences, the sentencing judge allowed a reduction of 15 per cent in recognition of his pleas of guilty. That means the starting point was 8 years - double the bottom of the Henry range.
	
	
	In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said;
	


“45 To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.”


	
	In this case, no express ground of appeal challenges the length of the individual sentences, although specific reference was made to those sentences in the submissions. However, it is the length of the individual sentences, together with the extent to which those sentences are accumulated on, or made concurrent with, other sentences, that leads to the ultimate overall sentence. In this case, in respect of two offences of armed robbery, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months; in a third, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years. Given the powerful mitigating circumstances arising from the applicant’s background, it seems to me that in comparison to the Henry guideline, and taking into account the additional allowance referable to the applicant’s plea of guilty, but bearing in mind the very serious nature of the offending, those individual sentences were “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. In turn, that has given rise to an “unreasonable or plainly unjust” overall sentence.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal allowed in part;
	
	
	Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4, 5, and 6;
	
	
	Quash the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3. In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows:
	


Count 2: imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months, to commence on 22 July 2013 and expire on 21 October 2018, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, to expire on 21 April 2016;

Count 1: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, to commence on 22 January 2014 and expire on 21 July 2019, with a non-parole period of 3 years, to expire on 21 January 2017;

Count 3: imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months, to commence on 22 July 2014 and expire on 21 January 2020, with a non-parole period of 3 years, to expire on 21 July 2017.


	
	The overall sentence is one of 8 years to date from 22 January 2012 and expire on 21 January 2020, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 21 July 2017.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In November 2013, Ellis DCJ sentenced a young aboriginal offender, Harley James Johan, to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years, 6 months, for six serious offences to which he had pleaded guilty and for which he received discounts on sentencing of 15% or 25%. Four of the offences involved robbery with a dangerous weapon. One was a specially aggravated break enter and steal in company while armed with a dangerous weapon offence and one was an offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm.
	
	
	Together, these offences amounted to a considerable crime spree committed over a relatively short period, while Harley Johan was at liberty on parole for another robbery offence. He now seeks leave to appeal the severity of those sentences on two grounds:
	


“1.   His Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the Applicant’s age and background in assessing his moral culpability for the offences.

2.   The overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.”


	
	Notwithstanding the case pressed at the hearing that the sentences imposed upon Harley Johan were too severe, having regard to his youth and pitiable background, no error has been demonstrated in either his Honour’s approach to this difficult, complex sentencing exercise, or in the sentences which he imposed.
	
	
	In the result, for reasons which follow, I consider that while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal must be dismissed.
	


The offences


	
	Harley Johan was aged 17 years at the time he committed the first robbery for which he was being sentenced (count 1) and so the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) applied to that offence. He was an adult at the time he committed the other offences.
	
	
	He was sentenced as follows:
	


Count 6 – A firearm offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) with a maximum term of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years: After a 25% discount, a sentence of 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, was imposed, commencing on 22 January 2012, the date of his arrest.

Count 5 – A robbery offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) with a maximum term of 25 years imprisonment: After a 25% discount a sentence of 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months was imposed, commencing on 22 July 2012.

Count 4 – The specially aggravated break enter and steal offence under s 113(3) of the Crimes Act the which carried a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment: After a 15% discount and some rounding a sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months was imposed, commencing on 22 January 2013.

Count 2 – Another robbery offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 25 years imprisonment: After a 25% discount a sentence of 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 22 October 2013.

Count 1 – The juvenile robbery offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 25 years imprisonment: After a 15% discount and some rounding a sentence of 6 years, 9 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months, commencing on 22 July 2014.

Count 3 – Another robbery offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act with a maximum term of 25 years imprisonment: After a 15% discount and some rounding a sentence of 6 years, 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 9 months, commencing on 22 October 2015.


	
	The facts were agreed. Count 6 related to a shortened single shot rifle, found to be in working order, together with suitable ammunition and a repeating air pistol, designed as firearm, but not in working order. More ammunition was later found on search at Harley Johan’s home.
	
	
	Harley Johan was arrested early on the morning of 22 January 2012, on the Pacific Highway at Ourimbah, when police stopped a vehicle that matched descriptions given after the earlier robberies.
	
	
	He was in the back seat and said to the arresting police officers when cautioned and asked whether he understood: “Yes, I have fucked up. Going to big boys house now. No more Juvie.” When asked where the firearm could be found, he said “Under the seat in a red bag”. When asked “Is it loaded?”, he replied “The rifle is, but the pistol is a replica”. He then admitted robbing the newsagency. When asked about other robberies, he declined to discuss them, but some co-accused then gave accounts which implicated him.
	
	
	Count 5 had occurred earlier on 22 January 2012, at Kariong Newsagency, while Harley Johan was armed with a sawn off shotgun. He was alone and demanded money from a worker who was at the newsagency, rolling papers. Harley Johan was wearing a black hood and a red bandanna covering his face. He entered the store, where the victim noticed him, pointed a gun at his head and demanded money. The victim then gave him two $20 notes and he took the victim’s wallet.
	
	
	The victim asked if he could leave the wallet, which he threw to the ground and said “there’s got to be more money, where’s the safe?” The victim replied “I only do the paper run, I don’t know where the safe is, I assume it’s behind the door”. Harley Johan told him to open it, but he said “I can’t I don’t know the combination.” He then kicked the door until it opened and told the victim to go inside. The victim said “I don’t have the combinations, look I only do the paper run”. After pushing buttons on the safe and looking around for things to steal, Harley Johan said “I need money. I need money”. The victim told him “you’ve taken my money that’s not the newsagency’s money” and Harley Johan then gave him back $20.
	
	
	He also asked the victim how to open a cabinet containing mobile phones, but the victim didn’t know. He then went back into the room with the safe directing the victim “stay there or I will shoot you”. He finally left after grabbing some chocolates and handing the victim a snickers bar.
	
	
	Count 4 also occurred on 22 January, just before 1:55 am, when Harley Johan and three others attempted to break into a taxi base at West Gosford. Two had their faces covered and all three were observed via CCTV by staff working inside, as they entered the building and walked towards the stairs leading to a call centre. Those inside were able to isolate themselves and prevent the offenders gaining access, while they called for help. The offenders left when they could not open the door. They were observed driving away in a vehicle, at high speed.
	
	
	Count 2 was committed at 1:50 am on 9 January 2012, at Hungry Jack’s at Beresfield, where two staff members were working. Harley Johan and another offender, who were armed with a sawn off single barrel gun and with what appeared to be a black pistol, entered, both wearing hooded jumpers pulled over their heads, with cloths covering their faces.
	
	
	They ran through the front door, jumped over the counter, yelling, “take us to the registers and to the safe”. They both pointed their weapons at one of the victims. The offender with the gun then ran to the safe, yelling to the other victim to open the safe, while the offender with the pistol took money from the register. The second victim could not open the safe. It was opened by the first victim, who then gave the offenders the money in the safe.
	
	
	The offender with the pistol then yelled at that victim to open some drawers, which were empty. He pushed the pistol into that victim’s back and he walked back to the safe, where he opened a second part which contained cash drawers. The offenders then removed the notes from those drawers and fled. A total of $3,824.76 was stolen.
	
	
	Count 1 was the juvenile offence. It involved a robbery in company at Vili’s Café and Bakery at Ourimbah, where staff were working, shortly after 4:30 am on 31 December 2011. The offender was armed with a shortened firearm and was in company with another offender, who was unarmed. They entered the back door of the bakery and pointed the firearm at one of the victims present. He called for help and told the other victim to run. Harley Johan then demanded money while his accomplice began searching drawers, taking two iPhones.
	
	
	The second victim returned because of her concern for the other victim. Harley Johan then pointed the gun at her and demanded money from the till, which she gave him. He asked “where is the money” and she gave him the previous day’s takings. He then asked for her bag and she gave him the money in the bag, which she had intended to deposit into the bank that day. He then demanded her ring, which she gave him and asked for more money. There was no more. While still pointing the gun at her, he said “If you call the police, we’ll come back and kill you the next day.”
	
	
	The two offenders then ran off. In total they stole $8,465 cash. The ring was valued at $8,000.
	
	
	Count 3 was committed at 4 am on 17 January 2012 at McDonalds at Cessnock, where staff were also working. One of the victims went to the car park from the rear of the restaurant, exiting through a gate, to change the menu signs.
	
	
	One of the offenders stepped out from behind the gate as he returned and pointed a gun at his face, saying “I want the fucking money”. He said “it’s in the office.” The other, who was armed with a 25 cm kitchen knife (with a 5 cm wide blade) followed as they returned inside. Two other staff members were inside working in the kitchen area.
	
	
	The first victim was taken into the office and told to open the safe. He said only the manager could open it. The offender with the knife asked one of the other victims if she was the manager. The offender with the gun yelled “open the safe, open the safe” and she did, while the other two victims stood together with the other offender pointing the knife at them. The manager filled a bag with cash and the offender with the gun continued to yell “Where’s the other notes? Where’s the rest of the notes?”. She panicked when told to open a second safe, entering the wrong combination. When it did not open, the offender with the gun yelled at her “I don’t want to shoot you”.
	
	
	When asked where the rest of the notes were, she said that she could not access anything else, because Armguard had the keys. She grabbed bags to show that they only contained coins. The offenders then grabbed her handbag and left the store. There was $1,581.25 stolen, as well as $40 cash in the handbag.
	


Ground 1 - Failure to give weight to the applicant’s age and background in assessing his probable culpability


	
	The case advanced for Harley Johan was that applicable principles of retribution and deterrence had to be assessed against his youth, the evidence of his deprived background and his impaired intellectual functioning. Those matters also had to be taken into account in assessing his moral culpability for his offending and when fixing the sentences imposed upon him. In oral submissions, it was also argued that Harley Johan’s maturity and how this had affected his moral culpability for his offending, had to be taken into account.
	
	
	It was noted that if Harley Johan served the entirely of the sentence imposed upon him, on release, he would have spent a quarter of his young life in custody. The view was urged that an overall non-parole period of 6 years, 6 months for his offending, in circumstances where he had been substantially incarcerated since the age of 16 years, reflected that all of these important considerations had not been properly taken into account in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The result of the sentence imposed had been to leave him with a sense of hopelessness, which explained how a positive change in his attitude in custody before he was sentenced, had come to an end. A series of misbehaviours in custody had resulted. More recently, however, this had turned around. He had come to realise that his behaviour would have the result that he would not get parole, or a reduction in the sentence which he pursued and that he would spend the rest of his life in and out of custody.
	
	
	In the circumstances, it was argued, delaying his release for a further number of years before he becomes eligible for parole was not appropriate. That would deprive him of the opportunity he needed to access programs in the community, which would assist his rehabilitation.
	
	
	Despite the force with which these submissions were advanced, in my view, this ground of appeal was not made out.
	


Ellis DCJ’s approach


	
	His Honour’s sentencing remarks reveal that the evidence as to all of Harley Johan’s difficult circumstances, including his background, mental state and youth, were all properly taken into account. No error of principle has been established.
	
	
	Ellis DCJ could not approach Harley Johan’s offending systemically, as being less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities (see Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600 at [53]). His youth had to be taken into account and the effects of his profound deprivation had to be given “full weight”, in assessing his moral culpability for his offending, the evidence establishing as it did, that it was such that it could have affected his capacity to mature and learn from experience (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [37] and [42] - [43]).
	
	
	His Honour, however, had to assess the evidence as to these matters in circumstances where Harley Johan himself gave no evidence at the sentencing hearing and where the evidence which was led, revealed that he had given past accounts as to matters relevant to an assessment of the extent and consequences of his experiences, which were untrue. That also had to be considered by his Honour, in reaching conclusions as to what this evidence established and assessing Harley Johan’s expressions of remorse (see R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim 369 at [58] – [59] and [79]; Alvares v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 33; (2011) 209 A Crim R 297)
	
	
	His Honour’s sentencing remarks reveal that he gave these matters careful consideration, with the result that he reached conclusions which were largely favourable to Harley Johan. Those conclusions were also reflected in the sentences finally imposed upon him.
	
	
	Ellis DCJ noted that Harley Johan was aged 17 years and 11 months when he committed the first robbery at the bakery, one week before his birthday on 7 January 2012 and that this offence, accordingly, had to be dealt with on indictment as a special children’s serious indictable offence. The other offences all occurred between 7 January and his arrest on 22 January 2012.
	
	
	His Honour noted that in sentencing Harley Johan for the bakery offence, he thus had taken into account the requirements of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, which provides that:
	


“6   Principles relating to exercise of functions under Act

A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles:

(a)    that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,

(b)    that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,

(c)    that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,

(d)    that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,

(e)    that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind,

(f)    that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties,

(g)    that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions,

(h)    that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.


	
	Ellis DCJ also referred to the material he had been referred to from the Public Defender's website, which included matters going to the sentencing of juveniles and for adults with multiple counts. His Honour noted the evidence as to Harley Johan’s conduct while incarcerated, which had included remaining drug free and with no misdemeanours following his transfer to Lithgow Detention Centre, where he had established a better rapport with Corrective Services Officers.
	
	
	After referring to the sentencing of his co-offenders and noting that no questions of parity in their sentencing arose, his Honour dealt with submissions which had been made in relation to R v Taufahema [2010] NSWCCA 241, which he accepted to have been informative “in terms of the ballpark area of criminality for offending of this type”.
	
	
	His Honour also had regard to the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which include ensuring that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons, to protect the community from the offender, to promote the offender’s rehabilitation, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce the conduct and to recognise the harm done to victims and the community.
	
	
	His Honour also had regard to relevant mitigating and aggravating factors specified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He also considered the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, observing:
	


“ … and while the guideline does not specifically apply, it having

dealt with s 97(1) offences which carry a maximum penalty of 20 years

whereas this sentence involves four offences contrary to s 97(2) each of which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years, the principles set out within the

guideline judgment are generally applicable.”


	
	His Honour then said as to Harley Johan’s youth:
	


“ The Court notes that this offender is a young man and the principles

espoused by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the sentencing of

young offenders is applied, although the Court notes the proviso set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the applicability of youth, that is, that general and specific deterrence are still relevant where the young person

commits an adult type crime, which is certainly the situation in this case.”


	
	His Honour also concluded that special circumstances should be found, given Harley Johan’s youth; that this would be his first lengthy term of imprisonment; and that he would need longer than normal time on parole, to assist him in reintegrating into the community and to deal with his substance abuse issues. The latter reflected the evidence as to his subjective circumstances, as to which his Honour observed:
	


“The Court notes that this young man has had very little support, that there has literally been no adult male support in his life, and that the subjective material which has been placed before the Court is of a high order. Nevertheless the criminality involved is very serious and a lengthy term of imprisonment is required to reflect that serious criminal conduct.

I note that had I been sentencing an older person, perhaps someone in their late 20s for these same offences that the penalties imposed would be significantly greater than I am now imposing for the reasons that I have indicated, that is his age, his deprived background and the fact that essentially all of these matters took place within a few weeks of his 18th birthday.

I note the level of his cognitive functioning is low although there is conflicting material in relation to that. Nevertheless, I accept that he was on a disability pension and I think it is probably a fair observation from all of the material to say that there is a definite cognitive deficit”.

The evidence


	
	In these remarks, his Honour was referring to a presentence report, a Juvenile Justice report and a report from the psychologist, Ms Kathryn Wakely, which were in evidence. His Honour did not refer to the details of the reports, but observed that:
	


“All three documents speak for themselves and clearly establish that this young man has had a deprived and exceedingly problematic upbringing. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine anything worse. I do not propose though to extract any specific details as to his upbringing into these remarks. It is all to be found in those reports and I have closely considered the reports.”


	
	The evidence provided a sound basis for these conclusions, although aspects of the evidence had to be approached with some caution, as I earlier explained.
	
	
	Ms Wakely’s report revealed that Harley Johan had given her an account of having been removed from his mother’s care at 2 years of age, due to exposure to an itinerant lifestyle, adult sexual activity, substance abuse, violence and erratic parenting. His father, whom he had never met, was Afro/American. He was then placed with his grandparents for 8 months, before being placed with numerous foster families. He had two placements between the ages of 3 and 7 and then 8 to 14. There was substantiated abuse in the first of those placements. The second was stable, but he left to live on the streets at age 14, because his foster parents could not manage his behaviour. Since then he had continued to live intermittently on the streets, with friends and with his mother, with whom he still had a close, but difficult relationship.
	
	
	Harley Johan had associated with criminals since age 7. His education was disrupted and finished in year 8, with result that he described his literacy to be limited but “okay” but “hopeless” at mathematics.
	
	
	Ms Wakely observed that Harley Johan had also reported that he had exhibited behavioural problems throughout schooling, being involved in physical altercations with other students and teachers, with the result placement into various units for children with emotional and behavioural disturbances. Past DOCS case notes revealed he had problems with managing aggression, threatening others, violence, property destruction, inappropriate sexual behaviour, learning difficulties and speech delay, as well as problems with concentration and attention.
	
	
	Harley Johan had no history of employment and since age 16, had received a disability support pension, as well as support from Aboriginal Youth Support, as a result of a diagnosed intellectual disability. As a result, he had been helped to locate accommodation.
	
	
	Ms Wakely observed that Harley Johan was able to communicate appropriately and at an acceptable level at the interview. He did not evidence significant defects in communication or verbal comprehension. He had suffered asthma in the past, but now rarely required medication and reported suffering no other physical ill health.
	
	
	She also noted that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when in detention, when aged 13 or 14, but he said he had lied to the psychiatrist about hearing voices, because he wanted medication. He did not like what he was prescribed, however, because it caused him to gain weight. At age 16 he had been held within the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre, where he was prescribed antipsychotic medication, but he also denied having any past or present psychotic symptoms.
	
	
	Harley Johan described his current mood to be stable and good, with his only problems being difficulty managing anger, which stemmed from his upbringing and family situation and resulted in violent outbursts. He said that in recent months he had begun to realise that his behaviour only caused further trouble for himself.
	
	
	Ms Wakely noted that he had been diagnosed with various conditions over time, but he told her that he had never taken any of these sessions seriously at the time and that he had been unwilling to engage. Past diagnoses included Disorganised Attachment Style, ADHD, Asperger’s Syndrome, Oppositional Deficient Disorder and Reactive Attachment Disorder, Tourette’s Syndrome, PTSD, Mild Intellectual Delay to Borderline Range intelligence and mild to moderate speech delay. Subsequent testing in 2000 had shown Harley Johan’s intelligence to be in the average range, but in 2008 testing had suggested mild intellectual disability.
	
	
	Harley Johan also reported having being the victim of past abuse from a foster brother and father and that he continued to suffer flashbacks and nightmares, but that they were reducing over time and he was learning to deal with them.
	
	
	Harley Johan did not enjoy alcohol, but reported using cannabis from age 9 and regularly after age 13. On weekends he used ecstasy. At 17 he began using ice, speed and crack cocaine and was using them regularly before his arrest, at a cost of some $3,000 to $4,000 per week. He had also used heroin on occasion, as well as using prescription drugs, such as valium and Xanax.
	
	
	Harley Johan said that his offending was pursued to acquire food, clothing and cannabis, after he left foster care. He also enjoyed shopping. Later it was to support his substance abuse. He also said that he had spent only 18 months at liberty since age 13. His offences were committed to support his substance abuse. He described his lifestyle, which he now realised had not been as glamorous as he had envisaged. He said he now saw his behaviour as stupid, having himself experienced having guns pulled on him.
	
	
	Harley Johan had not used substances in custody and planned to rehabilitate himself, by participating in the IDATP drug program while in custody, completing his year 10 School Certificate, avoiding anti-social associates on release and taking up employment with family members, who operated a business where there was work available for him.
	
	
	On assessment Ms Wakeley found that Harley Johan’s symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were within normal levels; that he met criteria for a psychological dependence on ice prior to arrest; that his profile was no longer consistent with ADHD; that he was at high risk of recidivism; but that this risk could be reduced considerably, by targeting reasons for his earlier conduct problems.
	
	
	Ms Wakely concluded that his early mistreatment was consistent with Harley Johan’s history and behavioural problems, increased aggression, delinquency, and criminality. She found that he had become somewhat institutionalised as the result of further anti-social influences, substance abuse and criminal behaviour during his mid-teens.
	
	
	She also noted that he had admitted that his history of mental health related diagnoses reflected fictitious and exaggerated symptoms, in order to obtain medication. There was also conflicted past intelligence testing. She considered this to be difficult to disentangle from the effects of past mistreatment, poor modelling, anti-social influences and substance abuse, which, together with minimal education and poor early nutrition, made a diagnosis of any possible conditions he was then suffering, difficult. She did, however, find that he was suffering symptoms of ongoing PTSD.
	
	
	Ms Wakely considered that reports of attraction to living a gangster lifestyle and entertainment violence explained his aggression and high risk of ongoing recidivism, which required targeted treatment. She considered that he displayed some insight into his need to change, with a resulting interest in pursuing education, abstaining from substance abuse and seeking future employment. She recommended participation in the IDATP program and ongoing support and monitoring post release.
	
	
	The presentence report made similar observations as to Harley Johan’s background, drug use, education and employment. It was noted that he had no problems reading a psychologist’s report, but that he had said that he experienced difficulties writing. He also denied having suffered past mental health issues, and that he had identified symptoms in order to gain access to drugs. He was assessed to be at medium risk of reoffending, to require treatment for drug use, supervision on release and monitoring of mental health issues.
	
	
	There were also reasons for an award under the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 (NSW) in evidence. There, it was concluded that Harley Johan had suffered compensable injury as the result of domestic violence, resulting in psychiatric injury, behavioural disturbance and emotional damage, which had longstanding and adverse impacts on his placement and schooling.
	


There was no error in his Honour’s approach to this evidence


	
	There was no error in his Honour’s approach to the evidence as to the impact of Harley Johan’s age and background in this sentencing exercise. They were relevant considerations, given not only the provisions of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, in relation to the first s 97(2) offence, but also in assessing his moral culpability for his offending, as mitigating factors under the provisions of s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. They were also relevant subjective matters which had to be taken into account, as his Honour did, in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	There were, however, other considerations which also had to be borne in mind in this sentencing exercise. As McClellan CJ at CL discussed in KT v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [22] – [25]:
	


“[22]   The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. These principles were considered in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA), R v E (a child) (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [30].

[23]   The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age (R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [25]). The weight to be given to the fact of the offender’s youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence (Hearne at [24]). Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult (Hearne at [25]; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93 at [61]).

…

[25]   The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity (R v Bus (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60074 of 1995, 3 November 1995); R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10]; R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ‘adult behaviour’ (Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence (Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society.”


	
	It is also settled that the weight given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth, must diminish as the offender approaches the age of maturity (see R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). An offender of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age (see R v Bus (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 3 November 1995, unrep) and R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]).
	
	
	These considerations help explain the conclusions which his Honour reached as to the seriousness of the offences for which Harley Johan was sentenced and the length of the sentences finally imposed upon him. As his Honour observed, higher sentences would undoubtedly have been imposed upon him for these offences had Harley Johan been aged in his late twenties, rather 17 and 18, when he committed these offences.
	
	
	The facts that an offender is either a juvenile, a young offender, and has a very deprived background, do not, however, lead automatically to the conclusion that an otherwise appropriate sentence, must be reduced. Indeed, the greater the objective gravity of an offence, the more likely it is that retribution and deterrence will have to be reflected in the sentence imposed, notwithstanding the regard which has to be paid to the interests of rehabilitation in such cases (see IE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 70; (2008) 183 A Crim R 150 at [16] and MJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 52 at [37] - [39]).
	
	
	Further, in Henry it was settled that committing armed robbery to support a drug addiction is not an excuse or mitigating factor (see Wood CJ at CL at [236]). Even the evidence as to Harley Johan’s mental state, equivocal as that was, did not necessarily lead to the result that a lower sentence should be imposed upon him. As discussed by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71, even where there is a causal relationship between a mental illness and an offence in a particular case, this does not automatically result in a lesser sentence. While that might reduce the importance of general deterrence, it could increase the importance of specific deterrence, or of the need to protect the public (see also Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465). On the evidence, these were certainly relevant considerations in this case.
	
	
	On the case pressed on appeal, other than the result of this sentencing exercise, no error in his Honour’s approach was identified.
	
	
	For reasons which I will explain in relation to the second ground of appeal, in my view, there was no error in the conclusions which his Honour reached as to the sentences imposed on Harley Johan, either individually or in total, given the consideration which his youth, his deprived background and mental state required in this sentencing exercise. Indeed, the overall sentence imposed upon him was a considerably lenient one, given the overall criminality of the offences for which he was being sentenced, his moral culpability for that offending and the other relevant matters which had to be taken into consideration in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal was not established.
	


Ground 2 – overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive


	
	A complaint of manifest excess requires an applicant to establish that the sentence imposed was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]). As discussed in Vuni v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]:
	


“This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [26] – [28]).”


	
	Harley Johan’s background is certainly pitiable. That his Honour took proper account of his youth and his very difficult subjective circumstances is apparent not only from the individual sentences imposed upon him, but also from his approach to questions of totality, concurrence and accumulation. That had the result that, in truth, the overall sentence imposed upon him, given the gravity of the repeated, serious offending for which he was being sentenced was a relatively lenient one.
	
	
	In my view, neither any of the individual sentences imposed, nor the overall sentence, have, however, been shown to be either unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	That sentence is certainly within the ‘ballpark’ to which his Honour was directed. In Taufahema, error was found on appeal in the way that the sentence had been structured, with the result that the offender, who was 16 when the first offence was committed and 19 when sentenced, was resentenced to a total term of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 7. His offending comprised 3 counts of armed robbery under s 97(2) and one offence under s7)(1) of the Firearms Act, as well as 5 matters taken into account on a Form 1 for one of the robbery offences. The sums stolen were, however, considerably more than Harley Johan stole.
	
	
	Harley Johan’s case on manifest excess rested in considerable part on the submissions advanced as to his youth and deprived circumstances. It was also submitted that Ellis DCJ had not paid correct regard to the guideline judgment in Henry and that his s 97(2) robbery offences “fell squarely within the category of cases” dealt with in that judgment.
	
	
	Those submissions may not be accepted.
	
	
	The only explanation for the sentences imposed is the regard which his Honour paid to the effect of Harley Johan’s youth and deprived background in his moral culpability for his serious offending.
	
	
	In sentencing Harley Johan, Ellis DCJ had to undertake an instinctive synthesis of the kind discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	Harley Johan was being sentenced for four s 97(2) robbery offences, which each carried a maximum penalty of 25 years. The attempted break and enter offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years and the firearm offence a maximum penalty of 14 years, as well as a standard non-parole period of 3 years. These were all statutory guideposts to which his Honour had to pay regard, in accordance with the High Court’s observations in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	Ellis DCJ also had to assess the objective seriousness of each offence and to consider Harley Johan’s moral culpability for his offending, having regard to the evidence relevant to his youth, deprived background and mental state. His Honour had to have regard to relevant aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence; as well as Harley Johan’s subjective circumstances. His Honour also had to have regard to questions of general and specific deterrence, as well as questions of totality, concurrency and accumulation of sentences. Moreover, his Honour had to determine whether special circumstances should be found, in relation to the ratio of periods of non-parole and parole fixed for the sentences imposed.
	
	
	No error has been shown in his Honour's approach to any of these matters.
	


The Henry guideline judgement


	
	In reaching his conclusions his Honour indicated that while the Henry guidelines did not apply to Harley Johan’s s 97(2) offences, he had regard to them in arriving at the sentences he imposed. That approach was correct (see R v Hamied [2007] NSWCCA 151 at [11] - [13]; R v Franks [2005] NSWCCA 196 at [32] and Taufahema at [30]).
	
	
	As Spigelman CJ discussed in Henry, while the Court had listed and heard together six Crown appeals and one severity appeal, one of which involved an offence under s 97(2), the Crown’s application was that the Court of Criminal Appeal promulgate a guideline judgment for s 97(1) offences, which carries a maximum penalty of only 20 years (see at [48]). That application was accepted (see at [126]). The more serious, aggravated form of that offence involving under s 97(2) a “dangerous weapon”, defined in s 4 to include a firearm, or an imitation firearm within the meaning of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) carries a maximum penalty of 25 years.
	
	
	A sentencing range of four to five years for the full term of a s 97(1) offence was established in Henry (at [165]), for a category of case found at [162] of the guideline judgment to be sufficiently common for purposes of determining the guideline. That category of offences is:
	


(i)    Young offender with no or little criminal history

(ii)    Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury

(iii)    Limited degree of planning

(iv)    Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof

(v)    Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver

(vi)    Small amount taken

(vii)    Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.


	
	Contrary to the case here pressed on appeal, Harley Johan’s s 97(2) offences did not fall into this category. Not only was he being sentenced for multiple, more serious s 97(2) offences, he was a young offender with a considerable criminal record.
	
	
	Further, as Simpson J discussed in R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100 at [66], the Henry guideline of a head sentence of 4 to 5 years applies where the offender is charged with a single offence. Multiplicity of offences call for a total sentence ‘well in excess of the four to five years so promulgated”. Additionally, Harley Johan’s robbery offences involved use of a firearm, and in only one of the four robberies, was only a small amount taken. He was also being sentenced for other offences. All of these factors took him outside the Henry range.
	
	
	In any event, as discussed by Spigelman CJ, in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [113], such a guideline judgment is to be taken into account only as a “check” or “sounding board” or “guide” on sentencing. It does not operate either as a “rule” or “presumption”. That is the more so when the guideline does not apply to the particular offence in question.
	


Other relevant considerations


	
	His Honour was obliged to assess the nature and seriousness of each of Harley Johan’s offences. Consistently with the High Court’s approach in Muldrock at [27], the objective seriousness of the offences had to be assessed without reference to matters personal to Harley Johan.
	
	
	In the s 97(2) offences, it was relevant to have regard to the nature and extent of the threat involved and the use made of the weapons in each offence (see s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [106] - [107]). Use of a gun, even by pointing a gun at a victim, is an aggravating factor necessary to be taken into account, use of a weapon not being an element of the s 97(2) offence (see Dougan v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 34; (2006) 160 A Crim R 135 at [32]).
	
	
	It follows that the use of weapons and threats of violence involved in these robberies, the fact that some were committed in company, that they had involved vulnerable victims and certain planning, also had to be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of these offences.
	
	
	Notwithstanding Harley Johan’s youth and other difficult subjective circumstances, there was also, undoubtedly, a need in this case for both general and specific deterrence to feature in the sentences imposed upon him. Not only was he on parole for an earlier robbery, when he committed each of these offences, he already had a considerable, serious criminal record for offences of theft, break enter and steal, intimidation, malicious damage, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault, affray, and robbery in company.
	


The sentence structure


	
	That Ellis DCJ had proper regard to all of these matters appears not only from the individual sentences imposed, but also from how his Honour structured the sentences.
	
	
	His Honour began with the firearms offence (count 6), which occurred on 22 January 2012. It carried a standard non-parole period of 3 years and a maximum penalty of 14 years.
	
	
	The evidence in relation to this offence had to be considered in light of the relevant legislative purpose: namely, to deter and punish possession of firearms per se (see R v Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [14]). The sentence also had to reflect that Harley Johan’s criminality was more serious, because these firearms had been used in other offences and that one of them was loaded (see R v Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 270 at [14]).
	
	
	In the case of this offence, s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act also had to be borne in mind. Its effect is that the standard non-parole period which applied represents the non-parole period that, taking into account only the “objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence”, is in the middle of the range of seriousness. That term is not defined, but his Honour imposed a sentence considerably lower than provided by the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The result of Ellis DCJ’s consideration was a starting point for this offence of 5 years. After a discount of 25%, Harley Johan was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months, commencing on the date of his arrest, 22 January 2012, with a non-parole period of only 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months.
	
	
	That was plainly not a heavy sentence, given the nature and seriousness of the offence, the statutory guideposts which had to be borne in mind, the obvious need for deterrence to feature in this sentence and the attention which had to be paid to protection of the public. The result plainly reflected the attention which his Honour paid to the evidence as to Harley Johan’s youth and deprived background.
	
	
	Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that the balance of the term of the sentence not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more. His Honour found that such special circumstances existed, given Harley Johan’s youth, deprived circumstances, his need for rehabilitation and supervision once released on parole.
	
	
	The result was, in each case, that the non-parole period was considerably reduced. Had his Honour not adopted that approach, the non-parole period for this offence, for example, would have been 2 years, 9 months and a balance of term of 1 year.
	
	
	Those considerations also had a considerable impact on his Honour’s approach to the question of totality and the concurrency and accumulation of the other sentences he imposed.
	
	
	The principle of totality required his Honour to ensure that the ultimate sentence imposed on Harley Johan for all of his offending did not exceed what was called for, in the whole of the circumstances which arose for consideration. His Honour thus finally had to assess the overall criminality involved in all of the offences for which Harley Johan was being sentenced and to determine what, if any, downward adjustment was necessary in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of his criminality and the totality of the sentences (see Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63; R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [44] and R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 ).
	
	
	Given Harley Johan’s youth, deprived background and past record of offending and incarceration and the results of the sentences imposed upon him, his Honour plainly also had to bear in mind what was discussed in R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [17], that:
	


“… an extremely long total sentence may be ‘crushing’ upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.”


	
	This was not, however, a case where the sentence for one offence could encompass the criminality of all Harley Johan’s offences, given their nature and seriousness. Thus, his Honour also had to bear in mind in structuring the sentences he imposed, that public confidence in the administration of justice required him to avoid any suggestion that Harley Johan was receiving some kind of a discount for his multiple offending (see R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]).
	
	
	The result of his Honour’s approach was that all but 6 months of the sentence imposed for the firearms offence, was made concurrent with the sentence imposed for count 5, the s 97(2) offence also committed earlier that morning on 22 January at the newsagency.
	
	
	No complaint was made about this sentence, or any other individual sentence which his Honour imposed, nor could it have been. It was the result of his Honour’s approach to the question of totality, particularly the total non-parole period of 6 years, 6 months, before Harley Johan becomes eligible for parole, about which complaint was pressed.
	
	
	An examination of the sentences which his Honour imposed, clearly shows, however, that there was no proper basis for that complaint.
	
	
	The starting point for the sentence imposed for count 5, the newsagency offence, was only 6 years, notwithstanding the obvious seriousness of this offence. Ellis DCJ plainly considered that the criminality of this offence was lower than the other s 97(2) offences, given the amount taken and that this offence was not committed in company.
	
	
	That Harley Johan was able only to steal $20 was the result of the victim’s inability to open the safe. Also necessary to consider, however, was that he not only held the gun to the victim’s head, but that he also threatened to shoot him.
	
	
	After a discount of 25% for the plea, the sentence was reduced to 4 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of only 2 years, 6 months. Further, all but 6 months of this sentence was made concurrent with the sentence for count 4. That was plainly also a very lenient result, given the nature and seriousness of this offence.
	
	
	Despite this, Harley Johan’s case was that the overall result of his Honour’s approach was a manifestly excessive sentence, given his Honour’s failure to follow the Henry guideline in relation to the s 97(2) offences and the approach adopted to Harley Johan’s youth and deprived background, which I have already discussed.
	
	
	A close analyses of the sentences imposed, shows that those complaints simply have no foundation.
	
	
	The s 113(3) offence (count 4), also occurred on 22 January. It carried a maximum penalty of 20 years. The starting point for this sentence was also 6 years. After discount by 15%, Ellis DCJ imposed a sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of only 2 years commencing on 22 January 2013. Also necessary to be borne in mind is this sentence was made entirely concurrent with the sentences imposed for other offences.
	
	
	The second s 97(2) offence (count 2), committed on 9 January 2012 at Hungry Jacks, was a considerably more serious offence than that later committed at the newsagency, as his Honour’s starting point for this sentence, 8 years, reflected.
	
	
	After a 25% discount, Ellis DCJ sentenced Harley Johan to 6 years for this offence, but imposed only a 3 year non-parole period, commencing on 22 October 2013. Further, this sentence was also made completely concurrent with the sentences imposed for other offences – counts 4 and 1.
	
	
	This, too, was an entirely separate offence, committed on a different day, at a different place and involving different victims. It was also objectively a very serious offence, given not only the amount taken, but that there were two offenders involved, both armed, with both victims being threatened with those weapons.
	
	
	It is well settled that a sentence for a particular offence which is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence, can result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate, because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender is to be punished for the two acts of offending (see R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] - [13]). Such questions must be approached in the way discussed in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:
	


“In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	The Crown did not submit that his Honour’s approach was erroneously lenient. Nevertheless, the only explanation for this sentence is that it was the result of the considerable regard which Ellis DCJ paid to Harley Johan’s youth, deprived circumstances and mental state, in assessing his moral culpability for this serious offending.
	
	
	Harley Johan’s first (juvenile) s 97(2) offence (count 1), was the robbery in company at Vili’s Café and Bakery at Ourimbah.
	
	
	This was also a very serious offence, reflected in the starting point for this offence at 8 years. After a 15% discount, the sentence imposed was 6 years and 9 months but with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months. While his Honour had to have regard to the effects of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and to take proper account of Harley Johan’s youth and deprived circumstances, this was an offence which could not be dealt with more leniently than it was, given its gravity.
	
	
	This sentence was, however, also made entirely concurrent with the sentences imposed for charge 2, the Hungry Jacks robbery and charge 3, the McDonalds robbery. That outcome could also not be described as either unreasonable or unjust. Nor was the sentence imposed for the last offence.
	
	
	The final s 97(2) offence (count 3) committed at 4 am on 17 January 2012 at McDonalds at Cessnock, was also objectively a very serious offence.
	
	
	The starting point for this sentence was also 8 years. After a 15% discount Harley Johan was sentenced to 6 years, 9 months, but with a non-parole period of only 2 years, 9 months. That was also a very lenient result, particularly given that the non-parole period imposed for count 1 expires on 21 January 2018 and the non-parole period for this count on 21 July 2018. The sentence for count 1 expires on 21 April 2021 and the sentence for this count, on 21 July 2022. This sentence is otherwise totally concurrent with that imposed for other offences.
	
	
	The non-parole period imposed on an offender as the result of a sentencing exercise such as this, is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the crime and the offender’s subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623). There is no jurisdiction on appeal to reduce a non-parole period to the point where the resulting sentence is inappropriately lenient.
	
	
	The result of this sentencing exercise was a considerable sentence for an 18 year old of Harley Johan’s deprived background, who had already spent much of his life in detention. That, however, reflected the seriousness of the offences for which he was being sentenced, while on parole for other serious offences. His record did not entitle him to leniency, but in the result, for the entirety of that serious, repeated, offending, Harley Johan will be eligible for parole on 21 July 2018, after serving a total non-parole period of only 6 years, 6 months. Given the serious criminality involved in his offending, but for the regard paid to his youth and background and the conclusions which his Honour reached as to his prospects of rehabilitation, the overall sentence imposed upon him would not have properly reflected the separate criminality involved in each of his offences. There was no error in his Honour’s conclusions as to that sentence.
	
	
	Whether Harley Johan will avail himself of the leniency which Ellis DCJ has afforded him, so that he will be released when he becomes eligible for parole, in order that he can pursue rehabilitation, will depend on his conduct in custody. That is a matter within his control. Even if not released then, at most, he will serve a total sentence of 10 years and 6 months, for all six of his offences. Given the nature and seriousness of that offending, notwithstanding his youth and very deprived circumstances, that is not an overall sentence which is either unjust or unreasonable.
	
	
	In the result this ground was also not made out.
	


Order


	
	I would order that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

		10 April 2015",2015-04-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766348,Hudson v R [2015] NSWCCA 64,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J and with the orders he proposes.      
	
	
	R A HULME J: Jake Hudson (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 23 August 2013. His Honour Judge King SC imposed an aggregate term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	In the same sentence proceedings his Honour imposed upon the applicant’s co-offender, Jason Robert Carroll, a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. His Honour imposed a lesser non-parole period in the applicant’s case on account of his relative youth and the judge’s assessment of his need for a longer period of supervision on parole.
	
	
	Mr Hudson also brings an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in an unrelated matter. I will come back to that.
	
	
	The offences presently under consideration were committed on 18 August 2011 and comprised two counts of robbery in company, one of stealing in a dwelling, and one of dishonestly obtaining property by deception. The offences are contrary to ss 97(1), 148 and 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and have maximum penalties of imprisonment for 20 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively. King DCJ said that if not for the fact that he was imposing an aggregate sentence, he would have imposed individual sentences of 4 years 3 months; 4 years; 1 year 6 months; and 1 year 6 months respectively.
	
	
	The offences were committed in what is commonly referred to as a “home invasion” at a home unit in Maroubra which was occupied by three men. The applicant and his co-offender physically assaulted two of the men and threatened to do serious harm to them with knives and an object that appeared to be a gun. Naturally enough, the victims were terrified and feared for their lives. The applicant and Carroll stole various items of property and later used a bank debit card stolen from one of the victims at a nearby convenience store to “buy” cigarettes and a prepaid mobile phone voucher.
	
	
	There are two proposed grounds of appeal. The first involves a contention that the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance arising from a comparison of the sentence he received with that imposed upon the co-offender. The judge found no material difference in their relative culpability for the offences. He carefully assessed their respective subjective circumstances and found that some factors favoured one offender more than the other. In the end, however, the differential in the non-parole periods was the only matter the judge felt was warranted. I cannot see that this assessment was not open to the judge in the exercise of his discretion; a discretion which this Court must respect. Moreover, I note that no submission was made to his Honour that there should be any differentiation in the sentences imposed upon the two men.
	
	
	The second ground sought to be raised concerns the fact that between 2 September 2011 (when the applicant was arrested) and 12 February 2013 (when he when he went into custody following his pleas of guilty for the present offences) he had spent three discrete periods in custody in relation to unrelated matters. It was contended that the judge failed to take that fact into account at all, or sufficiently.
	
	
	The problem in relation to this ground is that it ignores the case advanced by the applicant in the District Court. The judge was asked by his counsel to backdate his sentence to 24 January 2013. The judge backdated it to 8 February 2013. Mr Hudson now argues that there should have been a considerably greater regard given to the time in custody he had spent in relation to the other matters and that there should have been a lesser sentence imposed, a shorter non-parole period, or a greater backdating.
	
	
	An appeal to this Court is not an opportunity to argue a different case to that advanced in the court below: generally, see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [75]-[83] (Johnson J). This is especially the case where the issue concerns the manner in which a discretion should be exercised. The submissions made on the applicant’s behalf in the District Court were responsible and realistic. They prevailed except to the extent of 16 days of backdating. There is an air of unreality in what is now contended.
	
	
	Even if any of the errors contended for were found to be established, I am firmly of the view that no lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The applicant committed a serious armed home invasion in which two victims were terrorised and put in genuine fear of sustaining serious injury or worse. It is an easy inference to draw that the psychological impact upon the two victims must have been significant. In my view, the sentencing outcome in the District Court was relatively modest.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused in respect of this matter.
	
	
	The other matter before the Court is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Graham in the District Court on 22 May 2014. This concerned an offence of remaining in a building with intent to commit the indictable offence of larceny on 9 August 2011. The offence is contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years. In sentencing him for that offence, the judge was asked to take into account four offences of damaging motor vehicles and one of stealing from one of the motor vehicles.
	
	
	This matter involved the applicant and two other men being in the garage of a commercial and apartment complex at Brighton-Le-Sands in the early hours of the morning, breaking into cars in an attempt to steal from them. They succeeded in stealing personal items of value from one of the cars.
	
	
	The applicant was serving the sentence imposed by King DCJ when he appeared before Graham ADCJ. Senior counsel who appeared for him in the District Court acknowledged that some further time in custody had to be imposed but argued that it should be relatively minimal, having regard to the principle of totality. The judge’s response was to impose a sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. He specified the commencement date of the sentence so as to have the non-parole period extend the minimum time Mr Hudson would remain in custody by only 3 months. The parole period of the sentence will be completely subsumed by the parole period of the sentence imposed by King DCJ.
	
	
	The proposed grounds of appeal in respect of this matter are that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in comparing his sentence with that which was imposed upon a co-offender, Craig Bodeker, and that the sentence is in any event manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In relation to the latter ground, there is no merit in now arguing that a sentencing outcome that was sought and received in the District Court is erroneously excessive.
	
	
	The parity ground is baseless for the same reason. It is also baseless when examined on its merits. The co-offender Bodeker was dealt with by a magistrate in the Local Court in respect of offences of entering a building with intent, damaging property and larceny. He received a total of 150 hours of community service and a 12 month good behaviour bond. The key differences between the pair were their criminal histories (Mr Bodeker’s history prior to the offending in question was relatively minor and he had not previously been imprisoned) and the fact that Mr Hudson, unlike Mr Bodeker, was serving a significant term of imprisonment which rendered other sentencing options otiose. Graham ADCJ was mindful of the outcome in Mr Bodeker’s case and expressed himself as being careful not to impose a sentence that would be “a crushing burden”. The practical effect of the sentence imposed upon the applicant is not one that reflects marked disparity.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused in respect of this matter as well.
	
	
	It is most unfortunate that these applications have been brought to the Court. Valuable legal aid, prosecution and court resources have been consumed but they are both completely devoid of merit.
	
	
	The following orders should be made in respect of each application:
	


1. Leave to appeal refused.


	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J and with the orders his Honour proposes. I only wish to add that it is regrettable that the applicant’s hopes have been unjustifiably raised by the conduct of the legal profession.

2766381,R v Brenda Haines [2015] NSWSC 390,"Judgment


	
	The Prisoner stands for sentence for having, on 3 March 2001, murdered Haibo Wang to which offence she has pleaded guilty. The offence is one for which s 19A prescribes a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period, the date of the offence preceded the legislation prescribing such periods.
	
	
	I instruct myself that insofar as I make findings adverse to the Prisoner, I must be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt, but that I am only required to be satisfied of matters in mitigation on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The evidence as to the circumstances of the Prisoner’s offence took the form of a statement of Agreed Facts. According to that document the Prisoner was in the Somerset Hotel. At about 1pm she entered a shop nearby conducted by the deceased. A passer-by, Mervyn Johns, heard raised voices and observed the deceased behind the counter and the Prisoner moving towards him. She had knocked over some items on the counter as she approached. The two appeared to be in an argument. The deceased turned towards Mr Johns and called for help. At the time the Prisoner was holding a knife and her arms were moving toward the deceased. His arms were up toward her in indications of resistance.
	
	
	Mr Johns left the scene to seek help. When he returned the Prisoner was walking quickly from the shop in the direction of the Somerset Hotel. Persons at the Hotel saw her running from the direction of the shop. Mr Johns and these witnesses observed what seemed to be blood on her clothing.
	
	
	Soon afterwards the deceased was found behind the shop’s counter, unconscious and bleeding profusely from a stab wound to the chest. Shortly later he died. He had a defence wound to his right hand and a wound to his left forearm.
	
	
	The knife used to kill the deceased was located by Police on the counter of the shop. It matched other knives in the shop and there is no evidence that it was taken to the shop by the Prisoner. Police found a palm print of the Prisoner, in blood, on a refrigerator door.
	
	
	On leaving the shop the Prisoner had taken with her the deceased’s watch and wallet. On arrest she declined to be interviewed and there is little evidence upon which to base any findings about her intent that led to the killing, the circumstances that led to the raised voices or the Prisoner’s motivation in entering the shop.
	
	
	Some evidence relevant to these matters is provided by the Prisoner’s record. She was born in October 1965. A report to the Moree Childrens’ Court indicates that she committed her first offence in 1975, breaking, entering and stealing. Between then and the year 2001, her record includes 4 counts of possessing or self-administration of a prohibited drug, 8 counts of assault including one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 10 of stealing or offences that involved stealing (including one of shoplifting) and 9 of receiving or having goods in custody and one of carrying a cutting weapon. On that last mentioned charge she received a sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment. There was one offence of malicious wounding in 1989 but otherwise no offences of robbery or the like or involving significant violence.
	
	
	Other evidence shows that, although she has given various accounts of when this started, she has a long and extensive history of use of multiple illegal drugs and that at the time of the offence was probably suffering from the effects of heavy use of methylamphetamine and cocaine. The evidence includes a number of accounts by her to that effect. A psychology report of 27 March 2013 from the Bunya Unit records that Ms Haines said she was “off my face on drugs” on the date of the murder. However, given the date of that report and other indications of inconsistent accounts by the Prisoner of her drug use, I am not persuaded that all of these accounts are reliable. Certainly, I am not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that, except as concluded by Dr Giuffrida,  the Prisoner was affected by drugs at the time of the murder.
	
	
	The prisoner’s drug habit and record, and her departure with the deceased’s wallet and watch raises the question whether her presence in the shop or threatening the deceased with a knife was with a view to stealing and while I do not think these possibilities can be excluded, I am not able to come to a conclusion to the appropriate standard about them. The stealing that occurred may have been opportunistic and the evidence is simply insufficient to enable a conclusion, particularly one beyond reasonable doubt, to be reached as to why she picked up the knife.
	
	
	The Prisoner’s decamping very soon after her attack on the deceased indicates that she was in possession of some of her faculties at that time and her stealing of the wallet and watch provides convincing evidence in the same direction. Nevertheless, I remain unable to conclude that there was any intention to kill, or significant premeditation in her offending on the day. It follows from her plea that I must approach the matter that she had an intention to at least inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	On the other hand there is nothing to suggest that the Prisoner was in, or threatened with, physical danger from the deceased or had any reasonable excuse for picking up the knife. The situation as observed by Mr Johns, which would seem to have been prior to injury to the deceased, when combined with the fact that the deceased suffered injuries other than the fatal wound, and the fact that the Prisoner seems to have persisted despite the deceased’s call for help, leads to the conclusion that the Prisoner’s attack was somewhat sustained. Evidence, particularly from Dr Giuffrida persuades me that she was suffering from a psychosis at the time at least largely caused by illegal drugs but possibly contributed to by an underlying vulnerability.
	
	
	Subsequent to the Prisoner’s arrest, on 14 February 2003 a jury found her unfit to be tried. In September 2003 the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that she would not become fit to be tried within 12 months. Pursuant to a direction from the Attorney General a special hearing was conducted and at that hearing, which occurred in June 2004, a jury found that on the limited evidence then available the Prisoner committed the offence of murder. A claim of self-defence was rejected. On 11 June 2004 Miles AJ, in accordance with the relevant legislation, nominated as a limiting term, 17 years commencing on 3 March 2001. In arriving at that conclusion Miles AJ, as he was required to do, determined it in accordance with the normal principles of sentencing.
	
	
	Although the exercise which I am conducting is to formally impose a sentence on the Prisoner, the scheme apparent on the face of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) requires that that sentence be no greater than the 17 years Miles AJ nominated. See R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120 at [29]; R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394 at [32]. Normal sentencing practice requires that the sentence I impose be broken up into a non-parole period and a balance of term. I also take the view, subject to not imposing a sentence greater than the period determined by Miles AJ, I should approach the sentencing of the Prisoner, de novo, uninfluenced by what his Honour did – cf R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 112; 153 A Crim R 257.
	
	
	Since her arrest Ms Haines has been under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. She spent a number of years at Silverwater Womens’ Correctional Centre, moving to the Forensic Hospital in July 2009. In December 2011 the Prisoner was moved to the less restrictive Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. On 13 April 2013, the Mental Health Review Tribunal formed the opinion that Ms Haines’ mental state had improved to the extent that she had become fit to plead.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	Ms Haines is of Aboriginal heritage. She lived with her natural parents until she was about 6, these years being characterised by neglect and poor parental supervision and exposing her to violence including, though it is not suggested that the Prisoner witnessed it, the murder of her grandmother by her grandfather. Abuse of alcohol was another feature of the household.
	
	
	The family moved from Moree to Sydney. A Mrs Harris met the family through a centre established to help Aboriginal children in inner Sydney. In an affidavit put before me she described the Prisoner’s mother as often drunk, with almost no furniture and never food in the house. Mrs Harris said that the Prisoner and her siblings were pretty much left to their own devices and “There was nothing that these kids didn’t see”. Mrs Harris offered to look after one of the children and it turned out that child was the Prisoner who went to live with Mrs Harris’ family in what seems to have been a foster arrangement.
	
	
	When the Prisoner was aged 7 Mrs Harris sought psychiatric help for the Prisoner’s temper tantrums but she was apparently not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. From time to time the Prisoner ran away from the Harris family and returned to her mother, not because she was subjected to any mistreatment but because she disliked her foster family’s rules. Truanting from school seems to have been a feature of her life at that time and the, or at least one, attraction of her mother was the freedom that residing with her mother permitted.
	
	
	Mrs Harris said that the Prisoner started high school with one of her own daughters but did not want to continue at school and ran away back to her own family. This seems to have been after completing Year 7 and at an age variously reported as 14 to 17.
	
	
	On 7 February 1979 at Albion Street Childrens’ Court the Prisoner was committed to the care of the Minister. Case conference notes of 15 March 1979 refer to the Prisoner being a constant absconder from Minali Receiving and Assessments Centre and from Helensburgh (where Mrs Harris) resided.
	
	
	Case conference notes dated 15 March 1979 when the Prisoner was 13 record that:
	


Whilst living at home Brenda has been continuously disruptive and has on numerous occasions left the home for several weeks without letting the family know where she is staying. She is often violent towards her brothers and sisters; will not attend school; and only takes notice of [blank] her older brother.


	
	A school report of May 1979 records under the heading “Learning Interest”:
	


Brenda’s moods determine the extent to which she will participate in any one lesson. These moods fluctuate markedly and on occasions vary from defiance and disinterest to reserved disinterest.


	
	A report to the Moree Childrens’ Court in February 1980 described the Prisoner as very unstable, disruptive and emotionally disturbed
	
	
	Ms Haines lost one eye when she was young and in consequence of the eye being struck by a stone, and possibly a subsequent operation not executed skilfully. She has a glass eye by way of replacement but, as attested by her sister and Mrs Harris, has obviously been very embarrassed by the circumstance. Although it is not suggested that her eye is the only reason, in custody she has been observed to have a practice at meal times of sitting with her back to other inmates apparently staring at her reflection in a window.
	
	
	The Prisoner was subjected to tests of her cognitive functioning and the result of some of the tests places her in, or at the bottom of, the first percentile. However, partly because of restraint operating on the testing, where some answers were guessed at or provided by another person, I remain to be persuaded that the suggested results are valid.
	
	
	Relevant in that connection is the fact that if the extraordinarily low results were valid, I would have expected more support from, say, Mrs Harris or the deceased’s sister than the latter’s simple statement “[The Prisoner] has always needed support”. Although between the Prisoner’s childhood and the testing she has been a drug addict for many years, she clearly managed to function to some degree and well enough to acquire the criminal record she did and presumably support herself, whether by crime or otherwise. I accept that the Prisoners’ cognitive function is significantly impaired but I am unwilling to go further.
	
	
	The prisoner has never been employed.
	
	
	In a report of 19 August 2009 a Forensic Psychologist reported to the effect that the Prisoner at that time was exhibiting aggression, low frustration tolerance and poor impulse control and remained at moderate to high risk of violence toward others.
	
	
	It appears that Ms Haines has proved a diagnostic challenge to the numerous psychiatrists who have seen her since at least 1996. The best assessment seems to be that she suffers from an anti-social personality disorder and a paranoid personality disorder. At one stage the diagnosis was “Schizoaffective Disorder”. For a time it was thought that Ms Haines had a mental illness defence available to her though ultimately that view has been resiled from.
	
	
	The persistence of those caring for the Prisoner has however effected a significant improvement in her health. A report of 27 March 2013 observed that there had been a “dramatic improvement in her mental state”. Another of 23 September 2013 recorded that for some years she had been free of psychotic symptoms. Having regard to the totality of the medical evidence put before me it seems not unlikely that much of this improvement is due to medication. At the same time I should record that in a report of Dr Ana-Louise Martin, a psychiatric registrar, of August 2009 it was observed that the Prisoner had a poor history of medication adherence and in a report of Dr Giuffreda of 23 September 2013 he said that if the Prisoner was conditionally released at some time in the future that “she would require a high level of supervision from one of the non-government organisations such as Richmond PRA”.
	
	
	A report from a Michael Brownlee of the Department of Family and Community Services was tendered. The report dealt with the existence of a Community Justice program focussed on providing support for people with an intellectual disability. In the report Mr Brownlee observes that Ms Haines would be significantly disadvantaged if she was released from custody without appropriate supports for her being in place. I should observe that, although that report would clearly be relevant to any determination of the terms of any parole, and whether parole should be granted, I do not see the report as bearing on either the length of sentence to be imposed or the length of the non-parole period I must fix.
	
	
	Ms Haines maintains contact with her only child, aged about 30, one sister and her foster mother.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	During the hearing on sentence, Victim Impact Statements were read. They were by Li Ping Wang and Yilin Wang, respectively sister and daughter of the deceased.
	
	
	Li Ping Wang speaks of the family’s investment in the deceased and of his desire and efforts to provide a better life for himself and his family than was available to him in his birthplace, China. She goes on to say that her need to support the deceased’s wider family led to the breakdown of her own marriage and of having to undertake two jobs to support the deceased’s daughter and parents; she observes that the happy family was totally destroyed.
	
	
	Yilin Wang speaks of her sadness and the opportunities lost in consequence of her father’s death, of never being able to go to school events because her family could not afford them, that in consequence of the deceased’s death her mother has had to undertake three jobs at cost to her health. Yilin talks also of the difficulty occasioned by members of the family having to deal with the deceased’s affairs where they were unable to speak English and that the Prisoner, though only one person, has inflicted pain and grief on many.
	
	
	Section 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) includes the following:
	



	
	If it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an offender.
	
	
	…
	
	
	If the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence, a court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate.
	
	
	A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.
	



	
	Almost invariably the violent death of a family member imposes suffering on near relatives. Nevertheless, I accept that it is appropriate to take the suffering evident in the Victim Impact Statements into account in determining the appropriate sentence and I will do so.
	


Sentencing


	
	The law is clear that the Prisoner is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards current at the time of her offence. Although in some cases those sentencing standards are difficult to determine – see R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368, they are not so in this case. In 2001 I had been a judge in the Common Law Division for a number of years and was familiar with the relevant standards. While obviously the sentences varied from case to case, my recollection is that probably the most common sentence for murder at that time, absent a plea of guilty and absent particularly mitigating or aggravating circumstances, was a sentence of 18 years including a non-parole period of 14 years. I myself tended to take the view that this was unduly lenient and that 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years was more appropriate.
	
	
	The report by the NSW Judicial Commission, Sentenced Homicides in NSW 1994 – 2001, provides support for the 18 years total sentence. It does however indicate that the median non-parole period was one of 13½ years. 
	
	
	Factors to which weight must be given include the Prisoner’s cognitive functioning and her upbringing. I have referred to these. However, it takes no great mental ability or education to know that one should not threaten people with knives, much less use such weapons against others. The Prisoner had been punished in the past for carrying a cutting instrument and, by 2001, had managed to attain the age of 36 years without, it would appear, inflicting significant personal violence.
	
	
	One must recognise the assessments referring, for example, to the Prisoner’s aggression, low frustration tolerance, poor impulse control, instability and emotional disturbance – characteristics I would attribute to her genes or upbringing. One may accept, as the High Court said in – Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [43] that:
	


The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person’s make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.


	
	However, given her relative freedom from violent offences in the past, I am not persuaded that any impairment to her cognitive functioning, including the psychosis of which Dr Giuffrida spoke, operated to any substantial degree in mitigation, any more than her drug addiction did. And insofar as the Prisoner’s upbringing is relevant, it must not be forgotten that between the ages of about 7 and 14 the Prisoner would seem to have had the advantage of what would seem to have been a normal structured home and a caring environment.
	
	
	Of course, were one to take the view that innate or learned matters such as aggression, low frustration tolerance and poor impulse were substantial factors in the Prisoner’s offending, one would need to reflect on the extent to which they had been overcome and how much they should be reflected in a need for personal deterrence and protection of the community.
	
	
	The Prisoner is entitled to a discount for her plea. I accept that, given her mental condition, she could not have pleaded guilty prior to the finding that she was fit to be tried, an event which occurred on 4 November 2013 before Price J. However, from the expiration of a reasonable period thereafter she was able to plead guilty.
	
	
	In fact what occurred was that on 7 March 2014 Ms Haines was arraigned and pleaded not guilty and a trial date of 26 May 2014 set. On 16 May 2014 that date was vacated - one may infer because Ms Haines wished to change her plea - and proceedings stood over for further arraignment on 4 July 2014. On that day before Johnson J, Ms Haines was again arraigned and pleaded guilty. The change was occasioned by the fact that the psychiatrist who had been retained on Ms Haines’ behalf withdrew his opinion that Ms Haines had available to her the defence of mental illness. It is also appropriate to record that, as was said by Defence counsel without dissent from the Crown, it had been agreed between the prosecution and the defence that the trial would be by judge alone, that the evidence as to the circumstances of the offence would be by way of a statement of agreed facts, that it was expected that all that would otherwise be involved in the trial would be the testing of the evidence of two psychiatrists and the trial would take less than one week.
	
	
	This chronology makes it apparent that Ms Haines did not plead guilty at the first reasonable opportunity after she became able to do so. Rather she did so only shortly before her trial was due to begin. One of the factors inspiring a discount for a plea of guilty is its utilitarian value and in the circumstance it would not be appropriate to allow her the normal maximum discount for her plea. Indeed that plea was almost at the last moment and while I would not adopt the minimum of the usual range for pleas of guilty, the allowance should be closer to that minimum than to the maximum. I propose to allow a discount of 15%.
	
	
	It should also be mentioned that Ms Haines was on bail from 6 December 2013, conditional on her residing at the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. Bail was continued up until 13 August 2014 when it was revoked apparently for breach of a condition. It is obviously concerning that, despite the help the Prisoner has received, she cannot or will not comply with limits imposed on her conduct.
	
	
	Section 28(3) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides:
	


If, pursuant to other criminal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), an accused person is convicted of the offence or substantially the same offence as that which, at a special hearing, the person was found to have committed, the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods relating to the offence) are to be fully taken into account in determining any period of any sentence or the terms of any disposition consequent on the conviction.


	
	However it was submitted that, particularly as the Bunya Unit is a secure mental health facility, the period on bail should be treated as the equivalent of a continuing period in custody. The Crown did not dissent from this contention and it is appropriate for me to acquiesce in it.
	
	
	Regard must also be had to the terms of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A number of the matters there listed are obviously relevant. A weapon was used, Ms Haines has a record of previous convictions, the victim was vulnerable, and the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. I am not persuaded that Ms Haines has good prospects of rehabilitation; I simply do not know and much will depend on her continuing to take medication and to stay off illegal drugs.
	
	
	The Prisoner did not provide any evidence of remorse. However in a report of Dr Giuffrida of 6 December 2006 he recorded that the Prisoner was constantly preoccupied with her offence and he gained the impression that she was traumatised and tormented by it. In light of that evidence it seems to me that the Prisoner is remorseful and the terms of s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have been complied with.
	
	
	Lest it be thought to have been forgotten, there was clearly co-operation on Ms Haines behalf in limiting the issues to be canvassed at the anticipated trial. However, I am not persuaded that the co-operation was of such significance as to merit any appreciable allowance for it.
	
	
	I was asked to make a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that there is advantage in the Prisoner being allowed for a period somewhat longer than otherwise would apply, to be permitted to live in the community “under the stick” of the total sentence not having expired. Attention was drawn to the fact that the Prisoner’s mental condition had improved after she was moved from the mainstream prison population.
	
	
	However, I am not persuaded that I should make any such finding. The frequency of knife attacks generally and vulnerability of persons such as shopkeepers to attack by knife wielding drug addicts is such as to make me disinclined to reduce the Prisoner’s non-parole period from that which would flow from the ratio specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The fact that, even with the benefits the prisoner derived from custody at the Bunya Unit, she was unable or unwilling to adhere to the conditions of her being there, also argues for not abbreviating her non-parole period. Furthermore, given the time that has elapsed since the Prisoner’s arrest I am not persuaded that any reasonable reduction in the non-parole would benefit her.
	
	
	What I have said at the beginning of the immediately preceding paragraph also goes to inform the sentence that, subject to a discount for the Prisoner’s plea, I regard as appropriate.
	
	
	I was asked by the Prisoner’s counsel to make a recommendation to the Ageing, Disability and Home Care sub-section of the Department of Family and Community Services and other appropriate agencies that they progress without delay the process of preparing appropriate resources for Ms Haines ultimate use. There is no doubt that Ms Haines will need considerable support if she is not to relapse into drugs and crime and while the parole authorities may be able to influence things for a time, other help will certainly be needed.
	
	
	In the result I sentence the Prisoner to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 years and 9 months from 3 March 2001, together with a further term of 4 years and 3 months.
	
	
	I record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Prisoner became eligible for parole, 3 December 2013.
	
	
	I recommend to the Ageing, Disability and Home Care sub-section of the Department of Family and Community Services and other appropriate agencies that they progress without delay the process of preparing appropriate resources for Ms Haines’ ultimate use.

2766384,Saraya v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 63,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 10 May 2013, the applicant, Youssaf Saraya, was sentenced in relation to six counts of supplying differing indictable quantities of cocaine between 21 February 2011 and 6 June 2011 contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the Drug Misuse Act). An indictable quantity is specified as 5 grams. The total quantity supplied was 308 grams. The maximum penalty for each offence was 15 years imprisonment or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both. There was no standard non-parole period prescribed.
	
	
	At the time those offences were committed the applicant was on parole. The applicant’s parole was revoked on his arrest on 6 September 2011, with a balance of parole of 2 years to serve from that date. The sentencing judge, Charteris DCJ, having indicated sentences in relation to each count, imposed an aggregate sentence of 5 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The sentence was ordered to commence on 1 September 2012. The aggregate sentence was backdated only partially to account for his pre-sentence custody given the revocation of his parole.
	


Ground of Appeal


	
	The applicant seeks leave under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against the severity of that aggregate sentence. There is only one ground of appeal:
	


That the difference between the total sentence imposed on the applicant, and sentences imposed on his co-offenders, Jamel Arja, Gehad Arja and Toufic Arja, are such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the applicant’s part and give rise to the appearance that justice has not been done.

The co-offenders’ sentences


	
	The applicant’s three co-offenders (who will be referred to by their given names) were sentenced after the applicant and in respect of more serious offences. Attached to these reasons as Schedule A is a table, prepared on behalf of the applicant with minor amendments made orally, which contains a summary of the charges, sentences and differences in the subjective circumstances of the applicant and his co-offenders.
	
	
	Jamel was the co-offender whose objective criminality was closest to, but plainly more serious than, that of the applicant. He pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity (900 grams) of cocaine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse Act. A commercial quantity of cocaine is specified at not less than 250 grams. That offending occurred between November 2010 and September 2011 and involved his knowing participation in excess of twelve separate occasions of supply. Against a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.
	
	
	Gehad and Toufic each pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine at a total weight of 5.89 kilograms. The maximum sentence for that offending is life imprisonment, to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years attaches. The two Form 1 offences taken into account in the sentencing of Toufic were dealing with proceeds of crime totalling $198,550 and the provision of false documents in support of a mortgage application to dishonestly obtain a home loan of $413,000. Toufic was sentenced to 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, and Gehad was sentenced to 7 years 2 months and 12 days with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months and 6 days.
	
	
	Each of the applicant’s co-offenders was sentenced by Jeffreys DCJ. Jamel was sentenced on 20 June 2013 and Gehad and Toufic on 28 February 2014.
	


The parity principle


	
	The ground of appeal invokes the “parity” principle which is founded on the notion of equal justice. In broad terms that notion requires that “like offenders should be treated in a like manner”: per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28].
	
	
	The jurisdiction of this Court under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to quash a sentence “if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law” permits the Court, in its discretion, to reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender or co-offenders. As Gibbs CJ explained in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610, the reason why the Court interferes is that “it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done”. See also per Mason J at 613.
	
	
	Whether there is an unjustifiable disparity directs attention to the differences in the sentences and whether, in the mind of an objective observer, the disparity would give the appearance that equal justice has not been done. That comparison must take account of differences between the antecedents, personal circumstances of the co-offenders and any mitigating factors and the part played by each in the relevant criminal conduct, as well as the fact that those differences form the basis of qualitative and discretionary judgments made as part of the sentencing process: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 323, 338; Green at [31], [32].
	
	
	Whilst disparity between sentences may be an indicator of appealable error, it is the presence of unjustifiable disparity that is the ground for intervention: Lowe at 610, 613, 617, 623; Postiglione at 322; Green at [32]. Consistently with that being the position and as was the case in Lowe, the disparity may arise in respect of, and the principle apply to, the sentence imposed on the first of a number of co-offenders to be sentenced, as is the case on this application: Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376; R v Bellorini and R v Ruiz [2000] NSWCCA 50.
	
	
	In Green, the majority considered, in accordance with the view expressed by Mason J in Lowe at 613 - 614, that in the exercise of the appellate discretion enlivened by unjustifiable disparity, a “sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced … to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient”: [33]. At the same time it was recognised that the existence of a discretion to mitigate disparity by reducing a sentence to one which is otherwise inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so; and would not require the reduction of a sentence to a level which could be characterised as “an affront to the proper administration of justice”: [33].
	
	
	These observations of the majority do not squarely address whether a sentence imposed on a co-offender that is manifestly inadequate can give rise to unjustifiable disparity.
	
	
	As is noted by Bell J in Green at [106], there is authority in this Court that the inadequacy of the sentence imposed on a co-offender may be of such a degree that any sense of grievance engendered in the offender sentenced more severely cannot be regarded as legitimate. That was also the view of Brennan J in Lowe at 617 - 618. In R v Diamond (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1993, unrep) Hunt CJ at CL said at 5 (James J agreeing):
	


The sentence imposed … was, as I have said, appropriate and not excessive. That imposed by the Magistrate was, as I have also said, irresponsible. The disparity between them may give rise to a sense of grievance on the part of the applicant, but it was not a justifiable one.

See also per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [69] and per Howie J (James and Davies JJ agreeing) in Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41; 217 A Crim R 183 at [65].


	
	The decision in Diamond is also cited in support of the proposition that the discretion to mitigate disparity should not be exercised to reduce an otherwise adequate sentence to a level which would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: see Green at [33] fn 96; R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; 50 NSWLR 115 at [19]; R v Chen & Others [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289]; R v Ismunandar and Siregar [2002] NSWCCA 477; 136 A Crim R 206 at [23] – [26].
	
	
	The relevant principle is stated by R A Hulme J (Beazley JA and Hidden J agreeing) in Youkhana v R [2011] NSWCCA 37 at [49]:
	


… the Court has a discretion and is not bound to intervene if a sentence offends the parity principle. A reason for not intervening is if the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is manifestly inadequate and intervention would ""produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved"".


	
	In such a case the necessity to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice continues to prevail for the reasons given by Gleeson CJ in R v Rexhaj (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 29 February 1996, unrep), in the following passage which is extracted in R v Ismunandar at [38]:
	


The principle which underlies … [intervention for disparity] … is that inconsistency in punishment may lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice … . There are, however, other things which may also lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice, and they include the multiplication of manifest errors. That is why numerous judges have stressed the unattractiveness of responding to one wrong decision by making another wrong decision.

The circumstances of offending and sentences imposed on the co-offenders


	
	In considering whether the disparity between the applicant’s sentence and those of his co-offenders gives rise to an unjustifiable sense of grievance warranting the intervention of this Court, it is necessary to review the approach taken by Jeffreys DCJ when he sentenced Jamel on 20 June 2013 and Gehad and Toufic on 28 February 2014, since it is the sentences imposed in those two separate sentencing hearings that is productive of the disparity of which the applicant complains.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 10 May 2013. There is no explanation for why Jamel was not also sentenced by Charteris DCJ some weeks later. This Court has observed, on more than one occasion, the sound procedural sense in co-offenders being sentenced by the same sentencing judge with a view to avoiding the disparity with which this application for leave to appeal is concerned.
	
	
	The appeal papers contained the set of agreed facts tendered by the Crown in the applicant’s sentencing proceeding. The agreed facts referred to by Jeffreys DCJ in the sentencing remarks of Gehad and Toufic, and Jamel, were not included in the materials. It is clear, however, that they were all sentenced as a result of an investigation by the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad in August 2010 of what was described as a “large-scale Cocaine distribution syndicate” operating in South Western Sydney. Investigators, utilising a number of electronic evidence gathering techniques and anti-surveillance techniques, identified both the syndicate and its membership in the course of the investigation. Gehad and Toufic were identified as the principals of the syndicate.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on the basis that he had acquired cocaine from Gehad and Toufic, which he then on-supplied. The agreed facts tendered on the applicant’s sentence nominated each of Gehad and Toufic, or at least one of them, as people with whom he was criminally engaged in committing each of the six counts of supply. He was assigned a code name in his dealings with them, which allowed police, in lawfully intercepted telephone calls, to gather evidence of the method employed by him to obtain cocaine from the principals and of his various dealings with them.
	
	
	In Jamel’s sentence proceedings, the activities relied on as constituting the offence of his knowingly taking part in the supply of 900 grams of cocaine related to his various activities in both actively supplying and assisting others to supply drugs on behalf of the principals of the syndicate of which he was a member, answering to Gehad in particular as the more senior. Jamel’s physical activities included assisting with packaging and weighing the cocaine to be supplied. Jeffreys DCJ also noted that Jamel and others utilised a code in their communications by telephone, including words which designated the addition of cutting agents to increase the weight of the cocaine supplied and coded words to designate differing weights to be supplied.
	
	
	Gehad and Toufic were sentenced as principals of the syndicate. Jeffreys DCJ noted that one of the examples extracted in the agreed facts as an example of “common methods of supply” (by the syndicate) included one of the occasions upon which the applicant was supplied cocaine (for on-supply) and for which he was sentenced.
	
	
	The dealings between the applicant and his co-offenders, other than Jamel, are illustrated in the following extract from the facts agreed for the applicant’s sentencing. The extract relates to the fourth offence (supply 85.2 grams or 3 ounces) committed on 19 March 2011:
	


Between 15:34 and 19:14 on Saturday 19th March 2011 the accused engaged in a short message conversation with Gehad ARJA requesting him to collect money and to bring one (1) stick. Gehad ARJA then contacted Toufic ARJA and as a result instructed the accused to wait. The accused asked if ‘they are the same as the last one‘ and Gehad ARJA replied; yes. Subsequently the accused increased his order to three (3) sticks stating that he has all the money now. Toufic ARJA attended at the accused’s home address at 19:14.


	
	When sentencing Jamel, Jeffreys DCJ made express reference to the fact that the applicant had been sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 10 May 2013 and his obligation to consider questions of parity or proportionality for that reason. His Honour noted that the applicant was a “customer” of both Gehad and Toufic as principals (neither of whom had been sentenced at that date) and that in the applicant’s sentence proceedings, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was “able to engage the Arja brothers and run a business of purchasing drugs from them, and on-selling to others at a profit”. Jeffreys DCJ also noted that the applicant’s offending was aggravated by the fact that the first supply was committed within 22 days of his being released to parole. He also noted that he had an extensive criminal record, although not involving drug offences.
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks, Jeffreys DCJ also noted the Crown’s submission that the application of the principle of parity in an unbroken line of authority in this Court and in the High Court encompasses the activities involved in a criminal syndicate and that the agreed facts tendered in Jamel’s sentence proceedings and in the applicant’s sentence proceeding, revealed that level of complicity. His Honour then quoted the following from the Crown’s written submissions in Jamel’s sentence proceedings:
	


The agreed facts in relation to Yousef Sereya [sic] refer to a large scale cocaine distribution syndicate operating in South-Western Sydney by Jihad Arja [sic] and Toufeg Arja [sic]. Those facts refer to mobile phones being issued to ‘syndicate members’. There can be no suggestion of ambiguity in those facts, very clearly Yousef Sereya [sic] is a member of the syndicate. Jihad Arja [sic] and Tufeg Arja [sic] are described as principals of the syndicate. This offender is being sentenced for assisting Jihad Arja [sic] and Toufeg Arja [sic] in the drug supply activities being conducted by the syndicate of which they were principals, and of which Sereya was a member.


	
	It was the Crown’s ultimate submission in Jamel’s sentencing proceedings that the objective criminality of his offending was “significantly more serious” than that of the applicant and that even if his subjective circumstances were more favourable, a substantially longer sentence of imprisonment was warranted.
	
	
	Jeffreys DCJ rejected the Crown’s submission. He concluded that the sentences imposed on the applicant were of “limited assistance” given that in his view, the applicant was not engaged in “the same criminal enterprise or common criminal enterprise”.
	
	
	When sentencing Toufic and Gehad the following year in February 2014, and after restating his obligation to take account questions of parity and proportionality, Jeffreys DCJ again made findings, effectively disengaging parity considerations, at least insofar as the applicant’s sentence was concerned. He did find, however, that Jamel was “right at the bottom” of the criminal syndicate for parity purposes.
	


Decision


	
	The applicant submits that there is an unjustifiable disparity between his sentence and that of Jamel (as well as those of Gehad and Toufic), and that the disparity enlivens this Court’s jurisdiction to re-exercise the sentencing discretion and to impose a lower sentence in order to mitigate it.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that the parity principle applies as between the applicant and his co-offenders, and in particular Jamel, notwithstanding that each was charged with a more serious offence. In such a case, as the Crown points out, account must still be taken of any difficulties which arise in comparing sentences for different crimes: per Campbell JA in Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [203]. See also Green at [30]. It may be said at the outset that those difficulties do not really arise in relation to Jamel’s sentence which is less than that of the applicant, notwithstanding that his criminality was clearly greater and the offence charged more serious.
	
	
	The applicant’s case rests on the differences between his sentence and the sentences imposed on those who were senior to him in the drug supply hierarchy. Although it was submitted that Jeffreys DCJ wrongly took the view that the applicant was not involved in the same criminal enterprise as Gehad, Toufic and Jamel, no issue was taken with his Honour’s characterisation of the applicant’s role as that of a customer, on-selling much smaller quantities of drugs that he had purchased on credit. In the result, the applicant argued that relative to each of the three co-offenders, his sentence did not reflect his less significant role in the supply hierarchy as a customer of wholesale quantities for on-supply: see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [14], [19] – [20]. He also argued that what his counsel described as the evidence of his heavy drug use ought to have led to the conclusion that his offending was not in the same category as someone who was not using drugs but participating purely for greed: see Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 15 at [46]. One difficulty, as we emphasise later, with that argument is that the sentencing judge did not accept that the respondent’s motivation was need.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that, despite there being no Crown appeal as to the inadequacy of the sentences imposed on his co-offenders, they were on any view “unjustifiably low” and “extremely lenient”. Nevertheless, he argued that his sentence was so severe, when compared to those of the others that he had a justifiable sense of grievance, and that the extent of that disparity was not explained by his criminal record or because his offences had been committed whilst he was on parole. That grievance was said to be such that it appears that justice has not been done.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he could be re-sentenced to a non-parole period as low as 2 years and 6 months which would still fall within the available range and go some way to mitigating the disparity between his sentence and those imposed on the co-offenders, and in particular Jamel.
	
	
	On the assumption that the sentences imposed on Jamel, Gehad and Toufic were considered by this Court to be “unjustifiably low”, the Crown made two submissions. First it was said that taking account of their leniency and of the other differences between the applicant and Jamel (including the applicant’s criminal history and the fact that his offences were committed in breach of parole), there is no objective basis for the applicant to have a justifiable sense of grievance notwithstanding the significant differences between the sentences.
	
	
	Secondly, accepting that there is an unjustifiable disparity between the relevant sentences which could be mitigated by a reduction of the applicant’s sentence, the Crown submitted that the applicant’s sentence is at the bottom of the range of appropriate sentences for the criminality involved and, for that reason, this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, would not reduce the sentence any further to mitigate the manifestly inadequate sentences imposed on the co-offenders.
	
	
	The oral argument focussed upon the question raised by the Crown’s second argument which was formulated in the course of the hearing as being “whether a reduction [of the applicant’s sentence] to address objective disparity would result in a sentence below the lowest possible sentence for the objective criminality and [the applicant’s] personal circumstances”. In other words, would this Court’s intervention to reduce the applicant’s sentence in the face of other sentences which are accepted to be inadequate necessarily “produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved”: per R A Hulme J in Youkhana v R at [49].
	
	
	In our view this question must be answered in the affirmative. That being so, this Court should decline to exercise any discretion arising from the application of the parity principle. Our reasons for doing so are as follows.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on him was otherwise appropriate. Whilst it is plain that there is a disparity between the sentences imposed on each of his co-offenders, that disparity is due principally to the fact that Jeffreys DCJ did not, when sentencing the co-offenders, approach parity considerations in a principled way, but instead determined to forge what we consider to be an entirely artificial distinction between the objective criminality in the offending of the syndicate suppliers of the cocaine and the applicant as a wholesale purchaser of the cocaine for on-supply from the syndicate. That disparity does not of itself justify this Court intervening if to do so would result in the imposition of an erroneously lenient sentence on the applicant.
	
	
	Each of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both. The first was committed within three weeks of his being released on parole for an armed robbery offence for which he had been sentenced to 5 and a half years with a 3 year non-parole period that expired on 30 January 2011. In relation to that sentence, two other robbery offences were taken into account on a Form 1 and in April 2005, the applicant received an earlier custodial sentence for a firearm offence that included a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month.
	
	
	The more significant findings made by the sentencing judge in relation to the applicant’s subjective characteristics included that he had no significant health issues, including any mental health issues, which might have made him more vulnerable to committing the offences. In that respect the judge did not accept the applicant as a sufficiently reliable historian to justify the opinion of a psychologist, Dr Neilsson, that he had a substance abuse disorder and substance induced anxiety. As explained previously, the sentencing judge did not accept that the applicant was so chronically addicted to drugs at the time he committed the offences that it should be concluded his motivation was “need and not greed”. Finally, the judge made no finding that the applicant was remorseful or contrite and was not satisfied that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. In particular, he commented that if “the past were to be a predictor of the future one could not have any confidence [as to whether he would change his ways]”. In the end the sentencing judge considered that the only mitigating factor to be taken into account was the applicant’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	The judge concluded that the applicant’s offending was in the lower end of the broad middle range of the offences with which s 25(1) is concerned. In accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), he indicated the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence, had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. Those sentences were 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years for the largest supply (85.2 grams), 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 20 months for the 3 offences for the supply of 56.8 grams and 2 years with a non-parole period of 16 months for the remaining 2 offences for the supply of 28.4 grams.
	
	
	The sentencing judge then addressed the totality of the criminality involved in the six offences and, despite some measure of accumulation, he also allowed a considerable degree of concurrency in the aggregate sentence of 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. That effective sentence commenced on 1 September 2012 which was 11 months into the more than 2 year balance of parole that the applicant was required to serve for the earlier robbery offences.
	
	
	Having regard to the applicant’s prior criminal record, which deprived him of any leniency, compounded by the fact that the offences were committed less than a month after he was released on parole and to the other considerations that the sentencing judge took into account, it is our view that a lower aggregate sentence would not sufficiently take account of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending. For that reason, such disparity as arises from the sentences imposed on his co-offenders does not justify the exercise the discretion to reduce the applicant’s sentence.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal against sentence.

2.   Appeal dismissed.

2766386,R v Tasker (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 467,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Yesterday I indicated that I was prepared to grant bail to the applicant. That was despite the powerful prosecution case that he had committed a very serious offence, with regard to which he is required to “show cause” pursuant to the Bail Act 2013 (NSW). Reference should be made to my now otiose reasons of yesterday, which have been taken out and will remain on the court file, along with some of the transcript of the proceedings.
	
	
	I based that indication upon the practical absence of a criminal record of the applicant; the very sound community ties available to him; the appreciation shown by his family of the underlying causes of the alleged offence; the stringency of the proposed bail conditions; and a very substantial cash surety.
	
	
	Regrettably, due to a logistical oversight, when I gave that indication yesterday I was not aware of the steps that had just been taken with regard to his substantive matters in another court on that very day.
	
	
	It is now clear that the applicant pleaded guilty yesterday to possession of an air rifle at the scene of the cultivation, and was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for that offence.
	
	
	Separately, it is also clear that yesterday he pleaded guilty to two counts to do with the cultivation of cannabis. One was of cultivating prohibited plants simpliciter, and the other was of cultivating a commercial quantity of prohibited plants.
	
	
	Once it was made clear to me after lunch that there had been unknown substantial forensic developments in the matter elsewhere, I immediately revoked bail for abundant caution, even despite not having proceeded to impose conditions. The matter was stood over until today so that what occurred in the other court yesterday could be thoroughly checked; so that no further errors could take place; and so that the parties could have a chance to reflect and make further submissions without being under undue pressure.
	
	
	To my mind, the pleas of guilty entered yesterday by the applicant to the offences, in particular to the offence of cultivating a commercial quantity of prohibited plants, change the position very markedly.
	
	
	First, the applicant is no longer entitled to the presumption of innocence. That principle remains an important matter to be taken into account in any bail application in which a plea of not guilty is extant.
	
	
	Secondly, any weaknesses or gaps in the Crown case have become irrelevant.
	
	
	Thirdly, there is no prospect of the applicant being acquitted. Although that was always unlikely, it was possible that he could have, for example, relied upon the “defence” of duress. It was also possible (though admittedly most unlikely) that, by way of some negotiations between the parties founded upon favourable conduct of the applicant, the proceedings could have been “no-billed” entirely.
	
	
	Fourthly, there is no longer, with regard to the most serious offence, any prospect of the applicant being convicted of a less serious alternative offence.
	
	
	Fifthly, although a substantial period of imprisonment being imposed was always very likely, I consider that it is now inevitable, despite the very favourable subjective features of the matter.
	
	
	The position of the solicitor for the Crown today may be summarised as being that the circumstances have moved significantly and bail is opposed.
	
	
	The solicitor for the applicant accepts that there have been significant changes. Nevertheless, he made the following submissions in support of the proposition that I should maintain my previous indication.
	
	
	First, the matter will take quite some time to resolve, and there is a need for a number of psychological and possibly psychiatric reports. It is very unlikely, he submitted, that the matter will be resolved on its sentence date in the District Court of 11 May 2015. In truth, it is far more likely that it will take quite some months to resolve.
	
	
	Secondly, it will be easier, if the applicant is on bail, for his proceedings on sentence to be properly prepared.
	
	
	Thirdly, any psychological assistance available to the applicant in custody will not be optimal.
	
	
	Fourthly, his family support remains unchanged.
	
	
	Fifthly, there was and is an awareness on the part of the applicant and his family that it is very likely that a custodial sentence will be imposed.
	
	
	Sixthly, in light of the pleas of guilty there is no question of the applicant having any motive to contact prosecution witnesses.
	
	
	I respectfully consider that there is force in all of those submissions. But to my mind, in light of all of the significant circumstances that have changed since my understanding yesterday, the applicant is no longer in a position to show cause why his detention, bail refused, is not justified. The result is that bail must be refused.
	
	
	Finally, I express my regret to the applicant and his family at this turn of events occasioned by logistical error, and which no doubt will occasion great disappointment to all of them.
	
	
	My formal order is: bail is refused.

		24 April 2015",2015-04-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766387,R v MOORE [2015] NSWDC 315,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Luke Moore appears today for sentence in relation to two offences in respect of which he was found guilty by a jury at Goulburn District Court on 19 February 2015. A trial commenced on 16 February 2015.
	
	
	Count 1, an offence contrary to s 192E(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900, alleges that he, between 13 July 2010 and 10 August 2012 at Goulburn and elsewhere did by deception, namely by making transactions and overdraft from a St George Complete Freedom account by way of electronic transfers, cash withdrawals and the establishment and operation of direct debit facilities dishonestly obtained a financial advantage namely credit balances with financial institutions, cash and payment of accounts.
	
	
	Mr Moore I would very much appreciate if you would pay attention to what I’m saying and not communicate with people at the back of the court, otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered telling you in advance what the sentence was. I do that out of courtesy to prisoners, whoever they may be, unless there’s some security reason not to do so. In other words unless I feel that a prisoner is about to get 10 years imprisonment and is going to go berserk in the dock.  But it’s not an invitation for you not to pay attention to what’s going on because the matters I’m referring to you should pay attention to as they directly relate to the circumstances in which I’m required to impose the term of imprisonment I’m imposing upon you. I won’t have you in any way communicating with people at the back of the court. If they want to communicate with you they can do so elsewhere or they can leave the court. Thanks very much.
	
	
	I am informed today with the assistance of the learned Crown and counsel for the accused that in respect of count 1 the total amount of financial advantage obtained by the prisoner in circumstances I will outline in a moment was $1,988,535 and some cents I assume. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. It has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The prisoner was found guilty of a related offence brought pursuant to a different provision of the Crimes Act alleging that he between 13 July 2010 and 20 September 2012 at Goulburn and elsewhere did deal with proceeds of crime namely a 2001 Maserati sedan (with a particular registration number), a Hyundai sedan (with a particular registration number), an Alfa Romeo sedan (with a particular registration number), a Stessl aluminium 560 Sea Hawk vessel (with a particular registration number), an Aston Martin motor vehicle, numerous paintings, numerous items of memorabilia and numerous items of jewellery, in circumstances where he knew that the items were the proceeds of crime. This offence, contrary to s 193B(2) Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. It likewise has no standard non-parole period for reasons which are self-evident from the way the trial was conducted and I will reflect upon later in my remarks. Clearly Count 1 is the more serious of the two offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced albeit that the second offence has a greater maximum penalty. This is not an uncommon situation in certain circumstances.
	
	
	Obviously it follows from what I have outlined before that the prisoner had pleaded not guilty to these charges after being committed for trial. The facts of the matter established on the evidence at trial I will summarise although I note today, very helpfully, the learned Crown Prosecutor has provided a document which I have marked as exhibit 6 that in more specific detail than I need to set out states what is said to be the “evidence” at trial.
	
	
	The prisoner in March 2010 was an existing customer of the St George Bank. He had for some period of time before March 2010 operated a form of account, as I understand it a loan or overdraft account, which entitled him to trade in securities, particularly shares.
	
	
	In March 2010 he opened what is described in the evidence as a St George Complete Freedom account. This was an account for which he was issued a plastic card and in relation to this account he could make deposits and he could make withdrawals from the bank, or otherwise make electronic transfers. He could establish and operate direct debit facilities and essentially operate the account as a “savings” account.
	
	
	The evidence at trial established that the account had no overdraft facility. However at the time of opening the account the relevant officer of the St George Bank who opened the account for the prisoner wrongly assigned to the account what was described in the evidence as a ‘relationship officer’. The prisoner’s existing account or facility, line of credit or however one wishes to describe it, had a ‘relationship officer’ whose role as I understand it was to approve particular transactions on the account. By wrongly ascribing to the account that the prisoner had opened in March 2010 a relationship officer it meant that transactions which involved withdrawals above the available credit in the account, in particular, needed by one group of the bank to be considered by the assigned relationship officer. If no objection was taken from the relationship officer or more importantly, if an objection was made by the relationship officer, the bank would treat the transaction accordingly. With no relationship officer actually assigned to the account there was no supervision of it and as the account’s overdraft, if I may call it that, ballooned over the following two years and one month. Even if referrals had been made internally by the bank for consideration of the matter there was no ‘red light’ flashing to stop further transactions upon the account until 10 August 2012 when the bank identified the extent of the accused’s indebtedness.
	
	
	I point out from the outset that when the prisoner opened the account he provided all the relevant particulars as to his own identity. There was nothing the prisoner did in any way to cause the officer of the bank to falsely assign to the account a relationship officer and it was just a matter of happenchance that the prisoner discovered subsequently that he had the opportunity to withdraw from the bank more funds than were deposited in it in the manner shown particularly in exhibit A at the trial.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence at the time of the opening of the account the prisoner’s primary income was from Centrelink benefits. He may have had other assets at the time but there was no evidence of any substantial income from other means other than from what could generally be described as social security payments. In fact the history given by the prisoner to the Community Corrections Service Officer suggests that he had in fact been unemployed for a couple of years before March 2010. There is other history given by the prisoner that his previous involvement in share trading had been unsuccessful.
	
	
	The prisoner from the opening of the account drew upon the account initially from the credits available to him from Centrelink payments which were usually in the vicinity as I would understand it of about $400 or thereabouts per fortnight. It is clearly established from the evidence that within a short period of time the prisoner realised that he could withdraw more from his ‘Complete Freedom’ account than he deposited in it, or than were otherwise available as credits in the account. His withdrawals initially over the first few months were modest but by the time of the commencement of the commission of Count 1 by reference to the particulars which are framed from the date that the prisoner ceased to receive Centrelink benefits, that is in July 2010, the prisoner clearly realised that he could by and large do what he pleased without being stopped by the bank. This is shown by the escalating size of sums withdrawn.
	
	
	Although the particulars of the charge are framed as arising between the period in July 2010 until 10 August 2012 the vast majority of the funds withdrawn giving rise to the charge particularised in Count 1 occurred in the latter part of 2011. What the prisoner did over the period of time particularised is either withdraw cash for himself that he was not entitled to or transferred money by electronic transfer or other means to other accounts either controlled by him or accounts relating to corporations or business entities to whom he was indebted or from which he purchased goods.
	
	
	Between December 2010 and January 2011 he transferred to the mortgage broker or mortgagee provider RAMS, $142,991, to what I understand to be a finance corporation (Credit Corporation) between July 2011 and August 2012 he transferred $8,600. He made cash withdrawals between July 2010 and August 2011 of $8,883.
	
	
	As I understand it between December 2011 and 10 August 2012 he organised direct debit deduction from the St George Freedom account to the ‘PayPal’ facility $1,789,000 or thereabouts. He also made direct transfers to the NAB Bank to a particular account called a ‘Classic’ account of $27,800.
	
	
	It is to be noted that so far as the monies that were paid to PayPal, a considerable sum of money were transferred to that Classic account or ultimately were transferred to other NAB accounts, I will call them sub accounts perhaps, that are particularised in some detail in the exhibit 6 which the Crown has provided to the court on sentence. These NAB accounts, one in the Gold Coast as I understand it, one at a Canberra branch of the NAB, were described as ‘I-saver’ accounts. There were other payments or transfers to commercial organisations such as Foxtel, the NRMA Insurance, some payments for mortgage payments and the like.
	
	
	As I understand the matter when the PayPal account was closed the balance available from PayPal for recovery was $394,230. There were funds in accounts of the NAB amounting to $733,484. When the prisoner was arrested a number of the items that are particularised in relation to Count 2, these are items that were relevantly acquired by the prisoner from the proceeds of crime giving rise to his guilt in relation to Count 2, the bank seized. Those items realised on sale sums of money that are particularised in a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions from a senior investigator of the Westpac Group. Motor vehicles were sold in total for $4600. The boat particularised in relation to Count 2 was sold for $35,536 and various items of memorabilia and items of jewellery and paintings acquired by the prisoner were sold for $4,659. I do not for one moment believe that the price obtained for the vehicles or the other items represent true value for those items. But that is a matter over which neither the prisoner or I have any control. Items sold in such circumstances usually are sold at a ‘bargain basement’ price.
	
	
	It is the case that from the funds acquired from the St George Bank in various ways not only did the prisoner obtain particular items that are set out in Count 2 but he also lived off the proceeds of the offence committed in relation to Count 1. It is clear on the facts of the case so far as they went to demonstrate the guilt of the prisoner in relation to Count 2 that he travelled in order to purchase items, particularly a motor vehicle on the Gold Coast.
	
	
	It is clear that he would have realised that he had no authority legal or equitable to the sums of the money that he withdrew from the St George account plunging the account into debit. Ultimately when the account was closed the account was overdrawn to the extent of 2.18 million dollars approximately. But a body of that sum represented interest charged by the bank ironically upon the unauthorised overdrawing of the account which the bank itself had permitted.
	
	
	The prisoner made formal admissions during the trial in relation to both count 1 and count 2. He made a relevant admission that he was responsible for all relevant transactions in relation to the conduct of the Freedom Account and this of course saved the Crown attending to matters of formal proof in that regard. He also made admissions of purchasing and/or possessing various items of property particularised in count 2 of the indictment that he had purchased ultimately from the proceeds of the St George account.
	
	
	I recognise that in the way the trial was conducted on his behalf skilfully by Miss Warwick and in the admissions he made towards the end of the case for the jury, the prisoner’s conduct of the matter, although he did not give evidence, saved a substantial period of time that could have been taken up by the formal proof of those matters.
	
	
	On the basis of the evidence so far as it goes, contained within the letter from the Westpac Bank which is directly concerned with matters of restitution and the sum of money that has been calculated to be without interest calculated directly drawn by the prisoner from the bank, the loss to the St George Bank or the Westpac Group I calculate to be approximately $676,000. In outlining the various amounts I have ignored odd cents.
	
	
	Although the prisoner saved court time in the conduct of the trial and the trial was conducted very expeditiously given its potential complexity there were many eyewitness accounts and other evidence relating to the circumstances in which the prisoner purchased relevant property concerned with count 2 as well as a body of other circumstantial evidence that clearly link the prisoner with the operation of the Freedom Account, the operation of the PayPal and the NAB accounts and the purchase of relevant property as proceeds of crime relevant to count 2. There was also it must be said that ample evidence to show conduct of the prisoner which in my view was entirely inconsistent with any innocent explanation on the part of the prisoner for his operation of the St George account.
	
	
	When the prisoner was arrested he exercised his right to silence. He gave little account of himself. The jury was appropriately warned in this regard. The real issue that he raised as an answer to the strength of the Crown case was, as I understand it, that it was reasonably believed by him that he had the right to withdraw the money from the St George account in various ways and spend it as he wished because he was not queried or stopped by the St George bank from continuing to operate the account even though it was overdrawn in increasingly large sums.
	
	
	This claim of right if that is the way it might be described, may have some salience or strength if it related to the first few months of his operation of the account between March and July when the overdrawing of the account was modest. On 13th July 2010 the account was in debit after approximately four months of operation to the extent of about $1,900. But as I have pointed out the Crown particularised count 1 as commencing some months after the accounts were opened. It is clear on the evidence that over time the prisoner commenced plundering the account and became more audacious in his operation of the account. Conduct which was inconsistent with any reasonable understanding on his part that he was entitled to do what he did.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind there was absolutely no evidence of any agreement with the bank for him to operate the account in overdraft let alone build up an overdraft to any particular amount. The manner of his operation of the account and his use of the funds of the account involved purchasing exotic cars, expensive items of art and jewellery, paying off debts that he otherwise could not afford to pay off and putting moneys away in what the Crown described as “nest eggs.” As well, the manner of clearing a great deal of the money through PayPal and transferring money from PayPal to other sources were all eloquent testament of his dishonesty in my view at relevant times.
	
	
	Once found guilty of count 1, having regard to his relevant admissions, it was inevitable that he would be found guilty of count 2. If found not guilty of count 1 it would appear he could not be found guilty of count 2.
	
	
	The Crown case was overwhelming and the submission skilfully put on his behaviour that he should be found not guilty because he believed he could do what he did with the St George account because the St George Bank did not stop him was, with respect, almost laughable had the situation not been so serious. The reality was in the context of all the circumstances the matter revealed in the trial that the accused had no substantial defence that had any realistic prospects of success.
	
	
	I must confess to some puzzlement at the apparent dismay of the prisoner and people who support him that he was found guilty. This reaction of the prisoner, which I do not hold against him, does reflect a complete lack of appreciation of the irresistible course of the Crown case in the context of the absence any reasonable explanation by the prisoner for what had occurred inconsistent with guilt.
	
	
	The prisoner was born as I understand it in May 1987 and thus, at the time of the offending, was aged between 23 and 25 years. He has one finding of guilt in his criminal history which is to my mind is completely irrelevant in this matter and I accept that prior to the commission of the offences with which I am concerned he was a person of good character. The matter dealt with in the Local Court, in 2012, is an offence, so I would understand it from the criminology of events, that is substantially subsequent to the offending with which I am concerned. He was charged on 23 June 2012 and dealt with the Local Court on 12 September in respect of failing to leave licensed premises. It is minor in any event.
	
	
	The Crown has tendered a report from the Community Corrections Service to which I earlier referred and I have history from the prisoner given to the Community Corrections Service Officer as well as some history provided to Dr Stephen Allnutt, his report I will refer to in a moment. The prisoner is reported to be the beneficiary of a quote, “unremarkable and positive upbringing.” He continues to have his family support and this is evidenced by the letter written by his mother which I will refer to shortly. He has a partner who continues to support him. He left school at the age of 16 years after completing year eleven, he completed his High School Certificate apparently at Tafe. He had some employment in Goulburn at a warehouse for about three years and then commenced investing in the stock market. His mother gives a more detailed history of his employment background which suggests that up until about 2008 he was generally employed in one way or another.
	
	
	He did report however to the Community Corrections Service that it was in 2007 that he lost a substantial amount of money and had a considerable debt. He worked at a bank apparently as a teller in 2008 but was terminated from that position after six months due to his inability to fulfil the responsibilities of the role. One would expect he would have some knowledge of bank matters and bank operations, although as I say there is no evidence that in opening the account or in his dealings with the bank that he took advantage of some special knowledge that he had from previous employment.
	
	
	He was however unemployed for two years prior to his arrest and that reflects upon what I would understand to be some financial insecurity at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned. There is some history in relation to his mental health. He received some treatment for depression but did not follow up after care appointments, he was not compliant with his medication. He suffered a head injury when intoxicated at his 21st birthday celebration, his mother gives some particulars in relation to that. It would seem that if there was a severe head injury the full circumstances of that injury are still not fully known and not fully appreciated at the time. He did not follow up any treatment in relation to that head injury.
	
	
	His mother writes in the reference she provided to the Court that there were, in her opinion, changes in the prisoner after that head injury and the treatment he received in relation to his depression. She said that there were changes to his personality and living skills and she gave some examples of that. She noted, after he had been committed mental health facility at Goulburn in 2008, that when he was released there was a “marked difference in his personality.” That marked difference did not extend to him being other than a loving son and a brother his sibling but he is said to have had a lack of concentration. His mother says the most he could focus in concentration was for about two hours, he would leave tasks unfinished. She said that he was generally, however, a friendly, outgoing person otherwise.
	
	
	He was a regular user of cannabis apparently up until his admission to the mental health facility in 2008 and, even with the benefit of Dr Allnutt’s report, the picture of the effect of that is entirely incomplete on the available evidence to this Court. It may well be that the susceptibility for depressive symptoms was related to cannabis ingestion. There is no suggestion of cannabis ingestion playing a role in the commission of the current offences as he had ceased cannabis use then and at the present time says that he only uses cannabis occasionally. The chronology of events in the Community Corrections report is to be fairly said, somewhat confusing.
	
	
	So far as his attitude to the offending however, his representations to the Community Corrections Service are somewhat unsatisfactory. The Community Corrections Service acknowledges or states that he,
	


“Concedes a degree of intent, however minimised his offending, stating that despite acknowledging the funds were not legally obtained, he accidentally came upon it and rolled with it.”


	
	This seems inconsistent with his plea of ‘not guilty’.
	
	
	He claimed to the Community Corrections Service officer, and made a somewhat similar claim to the psychiatrist, that he continued to access funds over the period from 2010 to 2012, “waiting for the bank to contact me.” He thought he was committing what the Community Corrections Service officer called a “civil transgression versus a criminal offence.” He was challenged by the Community Corrections Service officer as to his knowledge of the function and operations of banking institutions given his past employment but still maintained he thought it was a civil matter.
	
	
	He said of his family, given his obviously vastly increased spending, that they “must have thought I was getting loans.” In fact his father tells the Community Corrections Service officer that he had told the family that he had won ‘Lotto’, an explanation never questioned by his family, which seems rather extraordinary.
	
	
	In any event, the prisoner has expressed some understanding of the impact of his behaviour. He has expressed some concern that the staff member who initially opened the account would be blamed for what happened. He was, “especially repentant regarding the impact on his family,” noting the effect upon his mother and his father. I note that concern. It must fairly be said, there is still has an element of self interest in it.
	
	
	He is assessed as being a low to medium risk of reoffending but requiring assistance in relation to emotional and personal issues and what is described as “attitude and orientation.” I must confess in the context of Dr Allnutt’s report I do not believe this report adequately addresses some of the underlying or, at least, contextual issues with which I am concerned.
	
	
	The assessment of him reflected upon his family environment, the events of 2008, that substance abuse did not appear to be a contributing factor to his offending and his attitude now reflected some understanding that his offences were not “victimless crimes.” His offences have had an impact he understands upon the community, I would imagine particularly the shareholders of the relevant banking institution, as well as his family and himself. I have taken report into account.
	
	
	With regard to Dr Allnutt’s report, this reflects upon the head injury occurring in 2008 and the prisoner’s admission to a mental health facility. Again, the history and the detail of the history is, to my mind, not complete. Although it does appear that the prisoner was treated for some form of depressive illness, he did not pursue with vigour medical treatment after his release and certainly was not receiving any medical treatment, nor thought he needed it at the commencement of the commission of the current offences. He told the doctor that cannabis use and a breakup of a relationship may have contributed to his mindset prior to, or at the time of the commencement of his offending.
	
	
	It seems to me however that the account he gave to the doctor - apparently accepted without query - of his offending bore no real relationship to the reality of the matter. He again made the claim that he was “always expecting to pay back money that he had taken from the bank.”
	
	
	I do not accept that to be true. Since his arrest in relation to this matter the prisoner has, according to the doctor, had considerable reactive stress and anxiety. The doctor was of the view that over the two year period that the prisoner committed the offences, the prisoner was suffering a constellation of depressive and anxiety symptoms predominantly symptoms of depression and that he was also likely, suffering the consequences of a head injury from 2008. He describes it as ‘probably’ frontal lobe injury which resulted in an increased propensity to impulsivity and disorganisation. I do not doubt that if he has a frontal lobe injury it could lead or probably can lead to greater impulsivity and disorganisation. However, when one has regard to the character of the offending with which I am concerned and the period of time over which it occurred, the extent of deliberation and the like, impulsivity does not arise as a relevant consideration and there is no evidence, in my view, of a lack of organisation or an attitude of “disorganisation” in the systematic way in which the prisoner over a period of time pleaded in the indictment plundered the account, transferred moneys and applied moneys for investments and purchases.
	
	
	The prisoner told the doctor that he had been gainfully employed and reasonably financially well off before 2008. But, of course, by the time 2010 had come around his situation was nowhere near as secure and this was a contributing factor, in my view, to his offending. The doctor reflected upon the likelihood of recurrent mood disorder caused by frontal lobe damage. He did not think, however, that the prisoner was mentally ill. He expressed the opinion the prisoner did not suffer from a disease of the mind that deprived him of the capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions or to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions. When he wrote in January 2015, Dr Allnutt reflected upon the need for the prisoner to receive community mental health supervision but he also reflected upon a history of non-voluntary compliance with treatment that was provided to him.
	
	
	Other evidence in the case from the defence, as I said, included the reference from the mother, parts of which I have referred to. I have taken into account, of course, all of her letter. The prisoner is one of four children and he was brought up to be “respectful, moral, honest, caring and with faith.” He was regarded as a happy-go-lucky child and was no disciplinary problem to his parent. I accept, of course, that as his criminal history reveals there is no history of anti-social behaviour on his part and certainly on the evidence there is no sociopathic or psychopathic reason for the prisoner to behave in the dishonest way he did over the period of time that he did. The mother reflects upon the effect upon her of the prisoner’s conduct. Her health has been affected. I have taken into account her understanding of the injuries and treatment he received in 2008. She reflects upon the fact that her brother can provide the prisoner with employment on his release and she also reflects upon the prisoner’s understanding of the wrongfulness of his conduct, which I accept to be now the case. His family will continue to support him which I accept.
	
	
	In relation to other, if I may call it, evidentiary material or relevant material tendered in addition to the evidence at trial, I have been provided with some statistics from the learned Crown relating to sentences for offending contrary to s 192E(1) of the Act. The Crown correctly points out the sample of cases reflected in the statistics between February 2010 and June 2013 or December 2013 is woefully inadequate, 10 cases. Of the 10 cases, nine offenders committing offences contrary to s 193E went to prison and one offender, that is 10% of offenders received a community service order and there is a range of sentences of imprisonment within that very limited sample.
	
	
	As long ago as 1998 Spigelman CJ, newly appointed to the Supreme Court, reflected upon the inadequacy of statistics in the decision of The Queen v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 particularly at 739. Admittedly, his remarks and other remarks of the Court are directed at the use of statistics at the appellate level when reviewing whether a sentence is inadequate or excessive as the case may be. But the general proposition as set out at p 739 about the caution that must be exercised in relation to statistics can be seen to equally apply at first instance. And, of course, an important matter as the Crown acknowledged was the relevant size of the sample upon which the statistical information is based. Noting the limited value the statistics have I have had regard to them.
	
	
	The Crown also provided me with a number of authorities. All of them, as I understand it, are decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. I do not mean this unkindly of the learned Crown, she obviously was very desirous of assisting me as she did throughout the trial, but references to cases contrary to 176A Crimes Act involving offences committed by people with either a fiduciary or other duty of trust to corporations are of little assistance given the significance of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty in criminal offending.
	
	
	I appreciate the Crown was looking for ‘fraud type’ offences involving similar amounts of money. Of course, every case is individual. Comparative cases can be of some assistance. There has been, however, a range of authorities by the Court of Criminal Appeal recently, as with the High Court in the decision of Hili in 2010, cautioning against reliance upon comparative cases when individualised justice is the purpose of the sentencing exercise this was emphasised by the Court of Criminal Appeal even in guideline judgments such as Henry back in 1998. In 2014 there was a decision of MLP where McFarlane J particularised the caution that must be exercised when relying upon comparative cases. That judgment was recently cited by Bellew J with approval in another authority recently reported in a recent Criminal Law Review Newsletter. There is also the decision of RCW (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190 where a judge, a colleague of mine of this Court, focused too much on one comparative case and fixed the sentence, accordingly thus leading to error.
	
	
	But I have had regard to the cases so far as they go. They reflect a number of varying circumstances different from the case at bar. This is an unusual case in a range of ways. But it is certainly not as amenable to comparison as can be the case in matters such as drug importation cases of supply prohibited drugs where quantities of drugs and the role of offenders can be more readily compared. Thus, having regard to all the evidence in the trial and the material produced on sentence I have taken into account the submissions of the learned counsel for the prisoner and the learned Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	The learned counsel for the accused commenced by addressing the report of Dr Allnutt in conjunction with the evidence that I have taken into account from the mother. She particularly took my attention to part of the report at p 6 and the relevance of potential or probable frontal lobe injury affecting the prisoner’s conduct in particular ways. It was ultimately submitted that lesser weight would be given to general deterrence because the prisoner was not an appropriate vehicle for the “message of general deterrence.”
	
	
	I pause for a moment to cite the decision of DPP (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. In that judgment, particularly at [177]-[179], the learned Chief Judge at Common Law reflected upon, after consideration of many cases, a number of particular principles relevant to the sentencing of offenders with mental disability or mental disorder. Some of the matters he identified had been previously summarised by Sperling J in a 2004 decision of Hemsley, an unfortunate woman with a mental illness history who I had to sentence subsequent to the decision of Hemsley in relation to further armed robbery she committed, applying Hemsley principles. I have had regard to what the learned Chief Judge of the Common Law Division as he then was, now the Royal Commissioner, said about these matters.
	
	
	It is true to be said that if a person suffers from a mental disability or a mental abnormality or a mental illness it may be appropriate to give less weight to the issue of general deterrence, there may be need to give greater weight, of course, to specific deterrence depending upon the character of the relevant mental disability or mental disorder. He pointed out, I should say at [178], that the character of the illness or disability or disorder need not be necessarily great for the matter to be taken into account. Of course, the fact that the prisoner has suffered a head injury in the past that ‘probably’ caused frontal lobe injury, although specific evidence in relation to this apart from the history given by Dr Allnutt is not provided to the Court, is a relevant matter as part of the circumstances of the prisoner.
	
	
	However, in this particular matter even allowing for what the mother says to be a change in personality of the prisoner after that injury and treatment for depression, I can see no causal connection between those matters and the commission of these offences. These are offences of dishonesty committed by a person over an extended period of time with ample opportunity to reflect upon his conduct and to desist from it. They reflected no impulsivity, in my view, particularly having regard to the period of time and the number of acts committed by the prisoner and certainly reflected no disorganisation in thinking on the part of the prisoner. I am mindful of the fact that the prisoner may, exhibiting depressive symptoms, require treatment in custody that will affect the circumstances of his custody, another matter identified by McClellan J and also identified by Sperling J reflected in the authorities which they cite. But at the same time, in the context of Dr Allnutt’s opinion, what particular treatment the prisoner specifically needs in custody, whether in fact the prisoner needs any particular medication or not, is not made clear. The material that arises from Dr Allnutt’s report in conjunction with the mother’s letter to the Court I have taken into account as relevant but it is not of such a character as to, in my view, warrant the diminution of weight to be given to general deterrence.
	
	
	As to personal deterrence the imprisonment of the prisoner, the subjection of the prisoner to the court processes over a period of time will, themselves, have salutary effect. There is nothing in any of the evidence produced to suggest that any condition the prisoner has, or any injury the prisoner has, makes him a threat to the community as such. But, of course, the conduct of the prisoner that I am concerned with does reflect upon the potential of the prisoner for acting dishonestly which he did on a repeated basis.
	
	
	The further submissions made on behalf of the prisoner which I accept, are that the prisoner’s offences were not committed by use of any disguise. The prisoner could easily be traced. He used his own name in the opening of not only the St George account but other accounts through which money was, if I might use the expression, laundered. He did not practise on the St George Bank any continuing specific deceptions such as forging documents or forging any particulars provided to the bank, creating false identities and the like. Essentially, he took advantage of a very lax system of security that had arisen through inadvertence on the part of the unfortunate officer who had opened the account.
	
	
	It was submitted that the offences were not particularly sophisticated, this so in the sense that as I said, there were no elaborate deceptions practised other than the deception pleaded and established beyond reasonable doubt in count 1 with no false identities and the like. It was pointed out and it is true that none of the actions of the prisoner in relation to count 1 and thus in relation to count 2 involved any breach of trust on his part. A very significant aggravating factor when dealing with offences involving frauds committed upon others. This, of course, is reflected as a general principle, for example, in some of the cases that the Crown referred me to involving breaches of fiduciary duty and the like by corporation officers.
	
	
	With regard to the matters that arise under s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 particularly the aggravating factors that arise under s 21A(2) of the Act, it was accepted that first of all there was substantial loss suffered by the victim, that is, the St George Bank (s 21A(2)( g)) that the prisoner’s offence in relation to count 1 and count 2 involved “a series of criminal acts” a matter to which I have earlier referred, that the offending was committed for financial gain (see (s 21A(2)(m) - (o)).
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors it was submitted that the prisoner was without prior criminal convictions, in other words, he had no prior criminal convictions at the time of the offending which is true. He was a person that had been of good character which is correct. It was submitted that he was unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. I believe on balance I could conclude in all the circumstances with the salutary experience of this litigation that the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation but subject to, of course, receiving appropriate direction and counselling. He does certainly have the support of a respectable family which should have stood him in good stead before he committed these offences.
	
	
	It was submitted his mental condition did not affect his prospects of rehabilitation and ultimately I conclude that that is so. I was also asked to take into account his cooperation in the conduct of the trial. I acknowledge that.
	
	
	The Crown submissions stress the objective seriousness of the offending in relation to both offences having regard to in relation to count 1, the substantial sum of money taken from the bank and, of course, the substantial property identified in relation to count 2. This is self-evidently so.
	
	
	It was also relevant to take into account the Crown submitted, and correctly so, that the offences were committed over an extended period of time and involved multiple acts, the matter acknowledged by the defence. The motive was financial advantage although the Crown at one stage described this as “self-gratification.” Self-gratification is to my mind merely an aspect of “financial advantage.” It certainly is the case that the prisoner in acquiring financial advantage sought to enrich himself in a range of ways and provide himself with items of property that provided him with considerable pleasure. The Crown submitted that there should be partial accumulation of the sentences for each offence. Particularly referring to aspects of the conduct of the prisoner in respect of the way in which he went about the transferring moneys and acquiring property and the like, such as to reflect in combination an increase of the totality of the criminality beyond that reflected solely in relation to count 1. Amongst other things, she pointed to the fact that the prisoner, as I earlier pointed out, was acquiring “nest eggs” by the building up of credits in relation to NAB accounts and the like.
	
	
	This is a matter, given the substantial agreement between the parties in relation to many of the matters I am required to consider, that has caused me some concern. I am always mindful where I am dealing with multiple counts of the observations, obiter though they were, of the majority of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly at [45]. That judgment, as has been pointed out in a number of authorities including one cited by the Crown as a comparative case (the decision of Kerr v R (2008) NSWCCA 44), has led to if I may quote David Kirby J in that case: “A marked departure from previous sentencing practice” (see [32]).
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact that there are a number of decisions that discuss the impact of Pearce particularly Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540 particularly through the judgment of Simpson J at [7]-[8].
	
	
	In a decision handed down by the Court of Criminal Appeal the day before Easter as I understand it, 2 April, Pound v The Queen [2015] NSWCCA 54, the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside a sentence I had imposed in respect of a man who shot another man in the face blowing his eye out. In that matter, the sentences I imposed were in respect of two offences, an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and an offence of carry firearm with disregard for the safety of himself and another. In the context of the facts of the case by reference to Pearce principles I concluded that the totality of the criminality of the prisoner was greater by reason of the two counts standing together.
	
	
	The Court of Appeal held that the conduct of the prisoner in relation to the carrying of the firearm offence was incorporated within the particulars or elements of the more serious charge. Their Honours set aside the accumulation of 18 months that I had imposed. The factor I had taken into account, which was discussed by the Court, is that the prisoner had had possession of that particular firearm for 18 months or two years before the shooting and that I had concluded on his evidence, that the applicant had placed a bullet into the gun two days previously and had forgotten that he had done so. I obviously respect the decision of the Court. It gives me cause for considering whether, in the context of what was said by Howie J in the decision Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1, particularly at [27], whether it would be appropriate to partially accumulate the sentence for one offence upon the other here.
	
	
	I appreciate in fairness to the learned Crown Prosecutor we did not get to discussing the extent to which accumulation should arise, because even as I would understand it on the Crown’s submissions, bearing in mind there is an acknowledgment of the need for “partial” not total accumulation that from the Crown’s perspective, many acts arising under count 2 have a direct connection both temporal and otherwise with the offending reflected in count 1. I need not go through all the exhibits and the evidence to demonstrate that that is clearly so.
	
	
	I am mindful of what the Court of Criminal Appeal said about this in Pound, particularly at [51] - [54] in the learned judgment of Davies J. I appreciate what matters the Crown drew to my attention as constituting further conduct on the part of the prisoner thus increasing the totality of the criminality. But the truth of the matter is, when one takes into account, to put this matter in its simplest terms, that the prisoner committed count 1, as the Crown herself said eloquently, to enrich himself and for “self-gratification”, what occurred in relation to count 2 was a manifestation of that ‘self-gratification’, a relevant matter to sentencing the prisoner in relation to count 1.
	
	
	Although the matter is finely balanced, in the context of the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in decisions such as Hammoud, to which I referred, and, of course, Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15, I have concluded the sentence for count 2, although it will be less than that in relation to count 1, bearing in mind count 1 is the more serious offence, notwithstanding the lower maximum penalty, will be wholly concurrent with the sentence in relation to count 1.
	
	
	With regard to the further submissions of the Crown, the Crown correctly pointed to the need to consider the totality of criminality which I have dealt with. There was a concession that there were aspects of the matter, even though it was a high level of criminality, that diminished that criminality. The absence of breach of trust, the absence of deliberate acts of forging of documents and the like. The Crown submitted that the health issues of the prisoner were not causally related to the prisoner’s offending and thus did not diminish the weight to be given to general deterrence, and I accept, in general terms, that the offending of prisoner gives rise to consideration of general deterrence.
	
	
	In that regard, of course, I have had particular regard to s 3A of the Act of the various purposes of sentencing. The only purpose of sentencing that I could say is not, to my mind, of salience in this sentencing exercise is the need to give weight to the protection of the community. The prisoner is not a threat to the community, as that matter may be understood when considering that particular purpose of sentencing. But other matters of general and personal deterrence, denunciation, accountability, adequate punishment and the like are clearly relevant, as is the promotion of the rehabilitation of the prisoner.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors, I referred to that matter when I dealt with the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner. I accept, as I have said earlier, the aggravating factors she identified. I have already indicated in the course of discussion that I could not conclude that the offending was relevantly “planned” initially, but it is to be fairly said that the offending of the prisoner reflects an element of deliberation on his part over an extended period of time which is to be taken into account. That deliberation is a matter that works, in my view, against the acceptance of a causal relationship between the conditions identified by Dr Allnutt and the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	As I have earlier pointed out, the prisoner from sometime after July 2010, with increasing intensity, preyed upon, if I could use that expression, the incompetence or failings of the bank in its capacity to supervise the account and that is demonstrated clearly by the particular way in which the prisoner conducted the account and distributed the funds through PayPal through the latter part of 2011.
	
	
	It is clear from the evidence that over a period of time the prisoner became more and more focussed on achieving specific aims, such as discharging mortgage obligations and acquiring specific items of property, that are particularised in relation to count 2. The evidence of deliberation and pre-meditation on the prisoner in respect of count 1, is reflected, and this is another reason for coming back to consideration of concurrency of the sentences, in the conduct of the prisoner to commit the various acts that give rise to his guilt in relation to count 2, such as travelling to Queensland, negotiating bank cheques, entering into specific negotiations to acquire particular property and arranging for the transfer of that property to himself. It is correct ultimately that the objective seriousness of the offending in relation to count 1 and count 2 is considerable when one has regard to the extent of funds obtained and the period of time over which the conduct occurred, a loss to the bank. But on the other hand, whilst the laxity of the procedures of the St George Bank does not mitigate the prisoner’s offending, the laxity of a bank is one matter that contributed to the lack of need for the prisoner to enter into any deliberate planning for the commission of the offences.
	
	
	That finding has to be weighed against, of course, the weight to be given to the absence of criminal history and the other mitigating factors that arise from the conclusions I have reached.
	
	
	Thus, hopefully, taking all matters into account given the brief opportunity I have had to reflect I will impose the following sentences.
	
	
	I point out that I have sentenced the prisoner after morning tea, following the completion of the submissions. But the reason I have sentenced the prisoner today is that I would be unavailable to sentence the prisoner for another five weeks and I do not think it is fair to the prisoner or his family that he should be kept in a state of uncertainty in relation to this matter.
	
	
	Could you stand up, thanks very much, Mr Moore.
	
	
	In relation to count 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years and three months, to commence on 18 February 2015. Therefore, your non-parole period will expire on 17 May 2017.
	
	
	I have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my view, it is appropriate that you receive an extended period of supervision by the Community Corrections Service or the Parole authority to enable you to receive professional assistance to adjust to community living and to direct you as to any medical or psychiatric treatment or psychological treatment that is required and to receive direction in relation to those matters advised by the Community Corrections Service. I do not in your case that this is the first time you have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and I have also noticed, of course, the difficulties that you may encounter in custody in a range of ways, particularly in terms of receiving appropriate treatment in custody.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years, three months. The total sentence is four years and six months. The total sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 16 August 2019.
	
	
	In respect of count 2 you are convicted and in respect of that matter I sentence you to a total of three years imprisonment. However, that term of imprisonment will run concurrently with the terms of count 1, thus it will commence on 18 February and will expire on 17 February 2018. In respect of that sentence I fix a non-parole period of two years and three months. That non-parole period commencing on the same date and expiring on - the same date, that is 17 May 2017 is the other sentence, it being required to be served entirely concurrently, on my calculation, roughly, taken over the morning tea adjournment. There is no finding of special circumstances in relation to that sentence, but that is addressed by the orders I have made in relation to the other sentence.
	
	
	Madam Crown, is there any issues as to dates and the like?
	
	
	MCSPEDDEN: Just, your Honour, in respect of count 1--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, I might have given a wrong date there did I?
	
	
	MCSPEDDEN: --the conclusion of the total term you said was, I think, 16 August 2019 - 17.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No I thought I said that, it should be the 17th of the relevant month of the year. I apologise. The starting point is the 18th of the relevant months and the relevant conclusion date will be the day before which will be the 17th, and I do remember saying the 16th. Thank you.
	
	
	Ms Warwick, any matters from you?
	
	
	WARWICK: No thank you, your Honour.

2766388,Mok v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWCA 98,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT:  Mr Yau Ming Matthew Mok was in lawful custody during his return from Victoria to New South Wales, pursuant to orders made by a Victorian Magistrate in accordance with the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth) (SEP Act) in the execution of a New South Wales bench warrant. He escaped and was recaptured at Tullamarine Airport in Victoria, which is a Commonwealth place for the purposes of s 52(i) of the Constitution. He was charged in New South Wales with the offence of attempting to escape from custody contrary to s 310D of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	A Magistrate (Buscombe LCM) dismissed the charge as not disclosing a prima facie case. A judge in the Common Law Division (Rothman J) allowed an appeal. The Director acknowledged that Mr Mok’s further appeal raised important questions of law, and that there should be a grant of the leave required by Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(h). For the reasons which follow, there should be a grant of leave, but Mr Mok’s further appeal to this Court should be dismissed. Rothman J was correct to conclude that Mr Mok must be taken to have been charged with a federal offence, namely, a contravention of s 310D of the Crimes Act as made applicable by reason of s 89(4) of the SEP Act, giving rise to a prima facie case.
	


Factual background


	
	The facts were at no stage in dispute, and may be summarised as follows. On 11 March 2004, Mr Mok pleaded guilty before a Magistrate to 14 charges of obtaining money by deception, one charge of attempt, and nine other offences involving fraud. All were offences under State law. The Magistrate granted bail and remanded Mr Mok to appear for sentence in the District Court of New South Wales on 13 April 2006. He failed to appear. His Honour Freeman DCJ issued a bench warrant on 18 April 2006. The warrant was directed to “the Commissioner of Police for the State of New South Wales, and to all Police Officers in the said State”, and after reciting the background, commanded them:
	


“forthwith to apprehend the said Offender and to bring him before me or some other Judge of the said Court or some Justice or Justices of the Peace, in and for the said State to be dealt with according to law.”


	
	On 14 December 2011, Mr Mok was arrested in Victoria and charged with two federal offences (possessing a false Australian passport and money laundering). He was granted conditional bail, and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment by the Victorian Magistrates’ Court on 26 February 2013. On that day he was arrested by a Victorian detective in execution of the bench warrant issued by Freeman DCJ. A remand warrant was issued under the Magistrates’ Court Criminal Procedure Rules 2009 (Vic) requiring Mr Mok to be kept in custody and conveyed to the Magistrates’ Court in Melbourne at 2pm on 27 February 2013; nothing turns for present purposes on that warrant.
	
	
	On 27 February 2013, a Victorian Magistrate issued a “Warrant to Remand a Person to Another State”, expressed to be under the SEP Act. The warrant referred to the 14 charges of obtaining money by deception and the one charge of attempt. It ordered that Mr Mok “be returned to Sydney Police Centre in the State of NSW”, for which purpose he was to be delivered into the custody of the New South Wales police officer named in the warrant and for him and any other police officer to “convey [Mr Mok] to Sydney Police Centre in the State of NSW and take him before a Magistrate ... to answer the said charge and to be further dealt with according to law”.
	
	
	On 28 February 2013, Mr Mok was accompanied by the officer named in the warrant and another New South Wales police officer to Tullamarine Airport. He was not handcuffed. While waiting at the gate to board their aircraft, Mr Mok tried to flee. The evidence was that he ran past a number of retail outlets and up a flight of stairs, being pursued by both officers, who eventually detained him and applied flexi-cuffs to him. The three then boarded the same flight (which had been slightly delayed by the attempted escape). When asked why he had run, Mr Mok said, “I’m sorry Bob. I just had to try it. It was a last minute thing.”
	
	
	Mr Mok was taken to Sydney, where he was charged, later that day, with an offence under s 310D(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section provides:
	


“310D Escaping

Any inmate:

(a) who escapes or attempts to escape from lawful custody, or

(b) who, having been temporarily released from lawful custody, fails to return to lawful custody at the end of the time for which the inmate has been released,

is guilty of an offence.”


	
	“Inmate” is defined in s 310A to have “the same meaning as it has in the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999”. There are in fact two definitions of “inmate” in that Act, in ss 3 and 4(3). Section 3 of the latter Act defined “inmate” to mean “a person to whom Part 2 applies”. Section 4(1) (which is the first section in Part 2) identifies, elaborately, the persons to whom Part 2 applies, and s 4(3) provides that in Part 2, an “inmate” means a person to whom this Part applies. Thus both references are to the same definition, and it is convenient to refer to s 4(1) as the definition of “inmate”.
	
	
	It is the complexity of the definition of “inmate” which has been central to the litigation thus far, and which dominated the written and oral submissions on appeal. However, as will be seen below, that is a false issue. The resolution of the appeal turns primarily on an appreciation of the role of the SEP Act and the operation of its terms, which are not dependent upon that definition. Indeed, they operate to its exclusion.
	


The definition of “inmate”


	
	Paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of the definition of inmate are as follows:
	


“(d) any person the subject of a warrant or order by which a court has committed the person to a correctional centre on remand in connection with proceedings for an offence committed, or alleged to have been committed, by the person, and

...

(e) any person the subject of a warrant or order by which a court or other competent authority has committed the person to a correctional centre otherwise than as referred to above, and

(f) any person in custody who is given into the keeping of a correctional officer under section 250.”


	
	Those paragraphs are to be read with the definitions of “correctional centre”, “correctional officer” and “court” which are as follows:
	


“correctional centre means:

(a) any premises declared to be a correctional centre by a proclamation in force under section 225, including any juvenile correctional centre declared under section 225A, and

(b) any police station or court cell complex in which an offender is held in custody in accordance with this or any other Act.

...

correctional officer means a person who is employed within Corrective Services NSW as a correctional officer, as referred to in section 231.

...

The decisions of Buscombe LCM and Rothman J


	
	The prosecution under s 310D was heard in Sydney Central Local Court on 14 June 2013. There was no contest to the Crown’s evidence establishing the escape and the lawfulness of the custody. By reserved decision given on 1 July 2013, the Magistrate dismissed the charge on the basis that there was no prima facie case. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed as of right pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), and his appeal was allowed by Rothman J, who set aside the dismissal and remitted the hearing of the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law: [2014] NSWSC 618.
	
	
	The Magistrate at first instance considered that neither paragraphs (d) or (e) of the definition of inmate applied to the bench warrant, because it directed Mr Mok be brought before a judge or magistrate, rather than committing him to a correctional centre. No challenge has been made to this conclusion.
	
	
	The warrant issued by the Victorian Magistrate on 27 February 2013 did commit Mr Mok to a correctional centre (namely, Sydney Police Centre, noting that the definition of a correctional centre included a police station). However, the Magistrate considered that this warrant had not been made by a “court” within the meaning of paragraphs (d) or (e), because those paragraphs were confined to courts in New South Wales, in accordance with s 12 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) and the “general rule of construction” to the same effect identified in Solomons v District Court (NSW) [2002] HCA 47; 211 CLR 119 at [9] and [37]. Finally, because Mr Mok, when he attempted to escape, had not yet been given into the keeping of a correctional officer but was in the custody of two police officers, the Magistrate considered that paragraph (f) did not apply.
	
	
	On appeal, Rothman J disagreed, concluding that paragraphs (d) and (e) of the definition of “inmate” did apply. His Honour expressed his conclusion as follows (at [69]):
	


“For the foregoing reasons, I consider that the learned magistrate, while correctly construing the provisions of s 310D of the Crimes Act, in circumstances where that provision is unaffected by federal legislation, has not appropriately taken into account the effect of the Service and Execution of Process Act in construing that section as it is applied by operation of s 89(4) of the Service and Execution of Process Act.”


	
	Section 89(4) and the other provisions of the SEP Act are addressed in detail below; it suffices presently to note that it applies the law in force in the place of issue of a warrant to a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with an order such as that made by the Victorian Magistrate on 27 February 2013. The essential reasoning turned on his Honour’s view of the role of the SEP Act, as found in [54]-[56]:
	


“The analysis by the learned magistrate is, as earlier stated, well-reasoned and correct, if the statutory expression to which reference is to be made were the terms of s 310D of the Act and the terms of the Crimes (Administration [of] Sentences) Act, without regard to the effect of the Service and Execution of Process Act. The difficulty with the analysis, in these circumstances, is that the effect of the Service and Execution of Process Act is to supplement the legislative fiat and reach of s 310D of the Act.

The application of the Act, and the legislative provision to be construed, is the intention and purpose of s 89(4) of the Service and Execution of Process Act in so far as it applies the Act and, by reference, the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. In so doing, the Interpretation Act, except as is necessary to determine the effect of s 310D [of] the Act when applied other than by the Service [and] Execution of Process Act, has no work to do in so far as it limits the court or body to whom the statute refers to one in and of the State of New South Wales.

On its face, the definition in the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act refers to any court exercising criminal jurisdiction and it is broad enough to refer to the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. Even the term ""Supreme Court"" would be broad enough, in the context of Federal legislation, to include the Supreme Court of other States and Territories.”


	
	In short, his Honour held that both (d) and (e) of the definition of “inmate” applied because the definition of “court” was to be read as extending to the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria. His Honour also expressed the view that there was “merit” in the Director’s alternative submission that the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court was a “competent authority” within the meaning of paragraph (e) of the definition of “inmate”; in light of his conclusion on “court” it was unnecessary for him to reach a concluded view. His Honour rejected a submission by Mr Mok that neither paragraph (d) nor (e) applied because he had not been “committed” to a correctional centre; this latter submission was not renewed on further appeal.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour concluded that the charge had been misstated, for failing to refer to the application of s 310D under s 89(4) of the SEP Act: at [57]. His Honour said that “[t]he offence under s 310D is a Commonwealth offence applied, by reference, under s 89(4) of the Service and Execution of Process Act”: at [58]. For that reason, his Honour considered that “[t]here may be issues associated with the irregularity or necessity to amend the charge so as to refer to the operation of the Service and Execution of Process Act”: at [70]. For that reason, his Honour remitted the matter to the Local Court.
	


The issues on appeal to this Court


	
	On appeal, Mr Mok challenged the primary judge’s conclusions that the Victorian Magistrate was a “court” or a “competent authority”. By his notice of contention, the Director submitted that either the Victorian Magistrates’ Court or the Magistrate personally was a “competent authority”. In addition, the Director submitted that the Victorian Magistrate was a “court” on the basis that she was a “person who exercises criminal jurisdiction”.
	
	
	It will be seen that those submissions proceeded upon a common premise: that it was necessary, in order for s 310D to apply to Mr Mok on 28 February 2013, for s 89(4) of the SEP Act to bring about the conclusion that he was an “inmate”. Senior counsel who appeared for Mr Mok on the appeal conceded, candidly and properly, that if that were not so, the appeal must fail. As will be seen below, the premise is not made out.
	


Analysis of the two federal laws capable of applying State statutes


	
	It is obvious that s 310D did not apply of its own force at Tullamarine Airport at any time. Tullamarine Airport is a Commonwealth place within the meaning of s 52(i) of the Constitution, and it is settled that State law cannot of its own force apply in such a place:  Worthing v Rowell and Muston Pty Ltd [1970] HCA 19; 123 CLR 89 and R v Phillips [1970] HCA 50; 125 CLR 93. Applications to reopen Worthing were refused in Allders International Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) [1996] HCA 58; 186 CLR 630 at 635 and Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) [2004] HCA 53; 220 CLR 388 at 393-394.
	
	
	It is less obvious that there are two federal laws capable of causing State laws to apply (as federal law) to Mr Mok at Tullamarine Airport on 28 February 2013. The first is s 4 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth), which causes laws of a State to “apply, or shall be deemed to have applied, in accordance with their tenor” in relation to Commonwealth places in a State. Moreover, s 4(4) deals with the possibility of a State law having extraterritorial operation, and provides that insofar as a State law has effect in another State, s 4(1) operates to make the provisions of that other State law applicable in a Commonwealth place. The second turns on the much less well known provisions (notwithstanding their importance) of the SEP Act.
	
	
	The SEP Act defines a warrant to mean a process issued by, inter alia, a court in accordance with a law of a State. The breadth of the term “process” was emphasised in Dalton v New South Wales Crime Commission [2006] HCA 17; 227 CLR 490 at [29]-[34] and [48]-[53]. A bench warrant is a canonical example of a process. The bench warrant issued on 18 April 2006 was executed (a) by the arrest on 26 February 2013 and (b) by the warrant issued by the Victorian Magistrate on 27 February 2013.
	
	
	As to the arrest, Mr Mok was named in the warrant. Section 82 of the SEP Act authorises, inter alia, an officer of the police force of the local State to apprehend a person who is named in a warrant. That occurred on 26 February 2013. Section 83(1) required the person to be taken before a magistrate of the State in which the person was apprehended as soon as practicable. That occurred on the following day, 27 February 2013. The bench warrant being produced, the provisions of s 83(3)-(7) (which, speaking generally, make provision for a strictly limited period to produce the warrant during which the person may be remanded on bail or held in custody) did not apply. However, s 83(8) was applicable. It provided:
	


“(8) Subject to subsections (10) and (14) and section 84, if the warrant or a copy of the warrant is produced, the magistrate must order:

(a) that the person be remanded on bail on condition that the person appear at such time and place in the place of issue of the warrant as the magistrate specifies; or

(b) that the person be taken, in such custody or otherwise as the magistrate specifies, to a specified place in the place of issue of the warrant.”


	
	It was not suggested that subsections (10) or (14) or s 84 applied. Accordingly, on 27 February 2013, the Victorian Magistrate was obliged to make one of the orders specified in s 83(8)(a) or (b). The mandatory nature of the task tended to confirm, as was held in Renton v Renton [1918] HCA 57; 25 CLR 291 of broadly comparable federal legislation, that her Honour was “not acting as a court acts”, but instead was acting administratively.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, the Magistrate did not remand Mr Mok on bail pursuant to s 83(8)(a). Instead, she made an order under s 83(8)(b).
	
	
	Section 89 of the SEP Act, and in particular s 89(4), is critical to this appeal. The section relevantly provides:
	


“(1) For the purpose of complying with an order made under paragraph 83(8)(b), or an order confirmed, varied or made under section 86 that is similar to an order mentioned in that paragraph, the person to whom the custody of the apprehended person has been committed may require that the person in charge of a prison in a State:

(a) receive the apprehended person and keep the apprehended person in custody for such time as the first-mentioned person requires; and

(b) surrender custody of the apprehended person to the first-mentioned person at the time and in the way that the first-mentioned person requires.

...

(4) The law in force in the place of issue of a warrant, being the law relating to the liability of a person who escapes from lawful custody, applies to a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with an order mentioned in subsection (1).

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply to lawful custody in respect of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.”


	
	It was common ground that s 89(4) applied when Mr Mok was at Tullamarine Airport on 28 February 2013. The parties were correct to proceed on that basis, for these reasons.
	
	
	First, subsection 89(5) did not apply. Although Mr Mok had been convicted the previous day of two federal offences, he was not, on 27 and 28 February 2013, in lawful custody in respect of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth. Instead, he was in lawful custody pursuant to an order made the previous day in the execution of the New South Wales bench warrant, which had issued after he had failed to attend for sentence following his guilty plea in respect of State offences.
	
	
	Secondly, it will be seen that s 89(1) authorises a person with custody of an apprehended person to require that person to be kept in a local prison for a period of time. That power was not exercised, so far as the record discloses. However, s 89(4) applies more broadly, whenever a person is “being taken to the place of issue in compliance with an order mentioned in subsection (1)”. Mr Mok was undoubtedly being taken to the place of issue of the bench warrant, and this was taking place in compliance with an order made under s 83(8)(b), which is one of the orders mentioned in s 89(1).
	


Which federal law caused State law to apply?


	
	Accordingly, there were two federal laws which were potentially capable of applying State laws to Mr Mok on 28 February 2013: the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth) and the SEP Act. Importantly, they did so in different terms. The Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act applied State laws generally and “in accordance with their tenor”. The SEP Act applied a limited class of State laws to “a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with [an order under s 83(8)(b)]”.
	
	
	Fortunately, it is straightforward to resolve the potential conflict between the two federal laws. The resolution occurs not because the SEP Act is later in time and more specific in its application (although in the absence of s 4(2) of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970, it is evident that that would be the case). To the contrary, before applying a conflict resolution rule, it is necessary first to construe the two apparently conflicting laws, for “[n]o conclusion can be reached about whether a later statutory provision contradicts an earlier without first construing both provisions”: Ferdinands v Commissioner for Public Employment [2006] HCA 5; 225 CLR 130 at [47]. The application of local and extraterritorial State laws in Commonwealth places effected by subss 4(1) and (4) is expressly qualified by s 4(2)(a):
	


(2) This section does not:

(a) extend to the provisions of a law of a State to the extent that, if that law applied, or had applied, in or in relation to a Commonwealth place, it would be, or have been, invalid or inoperative in its application in or in relation to that Commonwealth place otherwise than by reason of the operation of section 52 of the Constitution in relation to Commonwealth places ... ”


	
	That disabling provision is engaged by the effect of s 8(4) of the SEP Act. Unlike its predecessor (the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 (Cth) which was facultative and non-exclusive:  see Flaherty v Girgis [1987] HCA 17; 162 CLR 574), s 8(4) of the SEP Act provides that:
	


“Subject to this Act, this Act applies to the exclusion of a law of a State (the relevant State) with respect to:

(a) the service or execution in another State of process of the relevant State that is process to which this Act applies; or

(b) the service or execution in the relevant State of process of another State that is process to which this Act applies; or ...”


	
	Subsection 8(4) amounts to an expression of intention that the federal law should (subject to its exceptions) have an exclusive operation:  see Western Australia v Commonwealth [1995] HCA 47; 183 CLR 373 at 467-468. It was not suggested s 8(4) might be invalid.
	
	
	Section 8(4)(a) and (b) of the SEP Act produce the result that any New South Wales or Victorian law falling within the description in s 8(4) (i.e. with respect to the execution of another State’s process) which might otherwise have applied to Mr Mok on 28 February 2013 is inoperative by reason of s 109 of the Constitution. Otherwise such a law would be inconsistent with the command in s 8(4) that the federal regime be exclusive. A law imposing criminal sanctions upon a person who is in custody, pursuant to the execution of a New South Wales bench warrant, and who escapes in Victoria while being returned, is plainly a law with respect to the execution of process in another State.
	
	
	Accordingly, s 4(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act ensured that s 310D was not made applicable by subs 4(1) and (4) of the same Act. The only federal law, relevant for present purposes, making State law applicable was s 89(4) of the SEP Act. It followed that s 310D was not made applicable “in accordance with [its] tenor”. To the contrary, s 310D was made applicable “to a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with an order mentioned in subsection (1)”.
	


The effect of s 89(4) of the SEP Act making s 310D applicable


	
	As Rothman J observed, s 310D of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) applied to Mr Mok in Tullamarine on 28 February 2013 not of its own force, but because it was made applicable by s 89(4) of the SEP Act. It followed that Buscombe LCM was exercising federal jurisdiction, invested pursuant to s 77(iii) of the Constitution by s 68(2)(a) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) with respect to the summary conviction of Mr Mok on the charge of escaping from custody. Moreover, Rothman J on appeal, and in turn this Court on further appeal, was exercising “the like jurisdiction” invested under s 68(2) of the same Act.
	
	
	Moreover, s 89(4) applies State law in circumstances where otherwise it would not apply. It is well established in such circumstances that a State law made applicable by a federal law does so as federal law. That must be so; the State law is not applicable of its own force. One example may be seen in s 74(2A) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which provided that where there was a breach of a term implied by reason of s 74 of that Act, then “the law of the State or Territory applies to limit or preclude liability for the breach, and recovery of that liability” in the same way that it would apply in respect of breaches of other terms. A unanimous High Court in Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young [2011] HCA 16; 243 CLR 149 described State laws so applied as “surrogate federal law” (a term also commonly used to describe the law applied by s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)). Another example, in a criminal context, may be seen in R v Porter [2001] NSWCCA 441; 53 NSWLR 354, which at [41]-[43] dealt with the effect of s 4 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth) which caused laws of a State to “apply, or shall be deemed to have applied, in accordance with their tenor” in relation to Commonwealth places in a State. Spigelman CJ (with whom Studdert J and Ireland AJ agreed) said at [41]:
	


“The effect of s 4 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act (Cth) is to enact a Commonwealth law in the same terms as each State law which falls within its terms. Insofar as offences are created by such a law, they are Commonwealth offences.”


	
	That reasoning was more recently applied in Cameron v The Queen [2004] WASCA 16 at [12] (Steytler J) and [34] (McKechnie J, Wallwork AJ agreeing) and Lorrimar v Serco Sodexo Defence Services Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 371 at [89] (McColl JA, Macfarlan JA and Tobias AJA agreeing).
	
	
	However, there are many federal laws which apply State law, and they do so in different ways. The ultimate effect turns on the terms of the particular federal law. It is wrong to apply, uncritically, a decision on the effect of one federal law making State laws applicable to a differently worded federal law.
	
	
	For example, the Director relied on a line of decisions based on s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) which, speaking generally, invested State courts with “the like jurisdiction” in respect of federal offences as they already possessed in respect of State offences pursuant to s 77(iii) of the Constitution. It has been held of s 68(2) that “the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy”, to use Dixon J’s language in Williams v The King [No 2] [1934] HCA 19; 50 CLR 551 at 561, applied in Rohde v Director of Public Prosecutions [1986] HCA 50; 161 CLR 119 at 124 by Gibbs CJ, Mason and Wilson JJ. Thus in Williams and Rohde it was held that the effect of s 68(2) is to authorise a right of appeal by the Commonwealth Attorney-General in circumstances where State law authorises an appeal by the State Attorney-General. The Director invoked the reasoning in those decisions to support the conclusion that the definition of “inmate” applied by analogy to Mr Mok.
	
	
	Those decisions are of minimal assistance. Section 68(2) invests State courts with a “like jurisdiction”. Section 89(4) is not a provision which invests jurisdiction at all, and even if it were, it does not use language which requires proceeding by analogy, such as is implicit in the term “the like jurisdiction”.
	
	
	Both parties took the Court to a series of decisions on s 79 of the Judiciary Act. Section 79(1) provides that (emphasis added):
	


“The laws of each State or Territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State or Territory in all cases to which they are applicable.”


	
	Section 79(1) is not a law which in terms makes specific State laws or a specific class of State laws applicable; instead it is directed to courts exercising federal jurisdiction, as Gageler SC as he then was submitted in Solomons (2002) 211 CLR 119 at 125. The joint judgment agreed, and noted, relevantly for present purposes, that s 79 is “not, for example, directed to the rights and liabilities of those engaged in non-curial procedures under State laws”: at [23]. That is one reason why authorities on s 79 are of limited assistance to this appeal.
	
	
	Moreover, s 79 concludes with the words “in all cases to which they are applicable”. Those words confine the operation of s 79; see Solomons at [72]-[74]. Even so, there is a limited power to alter the operation of State laws applied as federal law, so as to advance the evident federal legislative purpose. The Court was taken to what Gibbs J said in John Robertson & Co Ltd v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 21; 129 CLR 65 at 88:
	


“If the laws of a State could not apply if, upon their true construction as State Acts, they related only to the courts of the State, it would seem impossible ever to find a State law relating to procedure, evidence or the competency of witnesses that could be rendered binding on courts exercising federal jurisdiction, because most, if not all, of such laws, upon their proper construction, would be intended to apply in courts exercising jurisdiction under State law.”


	
	The principle at play was explained by Mason J in John Robertson & Co at 95 (emphasis added):
	


“The broad purpose of s 79 is to ensure that the laws of the States are applied by courts in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. In general that purpose is achieved by the application of a State law according to its terms. Indeed, s 79 contains no express provision which would enable a court exercising federal jurisdiction to alter the language of a State statute and apply it in that altered form. However, the presence of the words 'including the laws relating to procedure evidence and the competency of witnesses' exhibits a clear intention that State laws relating to those topics should apply to federal jurisdiction. This purpose would fail partly in its objective if State laws on these topics are to be given a literal application under s 79 by courts other than State courts. State laws dealing with matters of procedure, as the earlier consideration of s 37 of the Limitation of Actions Act has shown, are often expressed so as to apply to State courts only, and in some instances they refer to particular State courts.

To ensure that State laws dealing with the particular topics mentioned in the section are applied in the exercise of federal jurisdiction by courts other than State courts, it is necessary that State laws be applied according to the hypothesis that federal courts do not necessarily lie outside their field of application. Section 79 requires the assumption to be made that federal courts lie within the field of application of State laws on the topics to which it refers, at least in those cases in which the State laws are expressed to apply to courts generally. This departure from the general principle that the section requires a State law to be applied according to its terms is justified, indeed demanded, by the clear requirement that State laws on the topics mentioned are to be applied in federal jurisdiction. Whether that requirement supports the broader view that a similar approach is to be taken in applying s 79 to substantive as well as procedural laws it is not now necessary to determine.”


	
	None of these nuances arise in the case of s 89(4) of the SEP Act. Subsection 89(4) takes a limited class of State laws: laws of the place of issue which relate to the liability of a person who escapes from lawful custody. Subsection 89(4) does not purport to apply that class of laws generally, or “in accordance with their tenor”, or “in all cases to which they are applicable”. Subsection 89(4) does something far more focussed. Its premise is that there is a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with an order made under the SEP Act. That order will at least ordinarily name the person. Subsection 89(4) applies that limited class of laws to that person – the person named in the order.
	
	
	In its application to the present facts, the Victorian Magistrate’s order under s 83(8)(b) required Mr Mok to be conveyed by a particular New South Wales police officer to the Sydney Police Centre. When he attempted to escape at Tullamarine Airport, Mr Mok was a person being taken to the place of issue in compliance with that order. Section 89(4) applied New South Wales law relating to the liability of a person who escapes from lawful custody to Mr Mok.
	
	
	The matter may be tested this way. The lengthy submissions and analyses in the courts below all turned on the elaborate definition of “inmate”, for s 310D in terms applies only to persons who are “inmates” as defined. But the effect of s 89(4) applying s 310D to persons being returned to New South Wales was not merely confined to those persons who were being returned in accordance with the SEP Act and who sought to escape who happened to be “inmates”. Unlike s 79, s 89(4) does contain an “express provision which would enable [the court] to alter the language of a State statute and apply it in that altered form”, to paraphrase what Mason J said in John Robertson & Co.
	
	
	The matter may be further tested as follows. The premise of s 89(4) is that a person is in custody by reason of an order made under the SEP Act in the execution of a warrant. On that assumption, s 89(4) makes applicable the law of the warrant’s place of issue relating to the liability of a person who escapes from lawful custody. The place of issue will often (as here) be different from the place where an escape takes place. The place of issue will always be different from the place where the order committing the person into custody is made (that is why the SEP Act has been invoked). And of course it would not be expected that one State will enact laws relating to the escape from lawful custody where a person is in custody by reason of an order or warrant made by another State’s court or magistrate. To paraphrase once more what Mason J said in John Robertson & Co, State law relating to the liability of a person who escapes from lawful custody must be applied, as surrogate federal law, upon the assumption that escape from lawful custody imposed by an order made by a magistrate in another State is not outside their field. If that were not so, the section could have no work to do.
	
	
	This appeal is not determined by a strained reading of whether the Victorian Magistrate was a “court exercising criminal jurisdiction”, or a “competent authority”. Section 89(4) requires putting to one side the carefully crafted definitions of “inmate”, and applying the new federal offence to all persons being taken to the place of issue. Section 89(4) leaves no room for debate about whether or not Mr Mok is a person who, as an “inmate”, is within the scope of s 310D in its ordinary operation as an offence under State law. The new federal offence created by s 89(4) acting upon s 310D applies to all persons who are being taken to New South Wales in compliance with an order under the SEP Act mentioned in s 89(1). Mr Mok was such a person.
	


Orders


	
	The appeal must be dismissed. The Director did not seek leave to appeal from the orders made by Rothman J remitting the proceeding for further hearing, against the possibility that there was a material defect in the Court Attendance Notice through failing to specify that s 310D did not apply of its own force. Accordingly it is not appropriate to express any view as to the operation of Part 2 of Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (made applicable by reason of s 68(1)(a) and s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)), and in particular, whether ss 16(2) and 21 permit in the circumstances of this case the amendment of the Court Attendance Notice (noting the extended definition of “indictment” which includes such a notice).
	
	
	The Director sought an order for costs.    The position as to costs is the converse of that in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154; 66 NSWLR 93 at [86] and Poidevin v Semaan [2013] NSWCA 334; 85 NSWLR 758 at [36]. Costs of Mr Mok’s unsuccessful appeal should follow the event.
	
	
	The orders of the Court will be:
	


1. Extend the time within which to seek leave to appeal until 23 September 2014.

2. Grant leave to appeal.

3. Direct the appellant to file a notice of appeal in accordance with the draft notice of appeal within 7 days, and otherwise dispense with the requirements of the rules as to service.

4. Dismiss the appeal, with costs.

		01 June 2016",2015-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2766390,Saleh v Faddoul [2015] NSWDC 184,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff by Statement of Claim filed on 13 September 2013 brings proceedings for damages arising out of the circumstances in which, while he was riding his motorcycle along Edgar Street, Condell Park NSW, the defendant reversed his motor vehicle onto the roadway, with the result that the plaintiff’s motorcycle collided with the rear driver’s side of that vehicle.
	
	
	The plaintiff particularises that the defendant was negligent in that he:
	



	
	Failed to keep a proper lookout;
	
	
	Failed to brake so as to avoid collision with the plaintiff;
	
	
	Failed to steer or manoeuvre his vehicle so as to avoid collision with the plaintiff;
	
	
	Reversed at a speed which in the circumstances was excessive;
	
	
	Failed to sound a warning to the plaintiff so that he might have avoided the collision;
	
	
	Reversed his vehicle from a private residence when it was not safe to do so.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities are set out in the section below on quantum of damages.
	
	
	After I reserved my decision, an application to reopen was made by the plaintiff in relation to a transcript error. This required the proceedings to be adjourned and for further submissions to be made following the provision to the parties of a report from the Manager of Reporting Services, Mrs Maureen Barrell. The defendant seeks costs in relation to this delay.
	


The issues for determination


	
	The issues for determination have been helpfully summarised by the defendant, and agreed to by the plaintiff (T 3), as follows:
	



	
	What is the content and ambit of the defendant’s duty of care (if any) in all of the circumstances?
	
	
	Did the defendant breach his duty of care in all of the circumstances?
	
	
	If there was a breach of duty of care by the defendant, did that breach cause the accident?
	
	
	Is the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?
	
	
	If the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence, what percentage reduction applies?
	



	
	I also note that issues of quantum arise.
	


The circumstances of the accident


	
	The plaintiff, who was born in 1994, was aged 17 years and 10 months at the time of the accident, and was in Year 12 at school. Although the motorcycle was not registered in the plaintiff’s name, it is not in dispute that it was a gift from his brother a few days before the accident, in circumstances where there had been insufficient time to transfer ownership to the plaintiff. He held a learner’s permit and had ridden the bike “most days” (T 8) since the bike was given to him, but gave no evidence of having had any lessons or prior experience in riding this particular bike, although he claimed prior riding experience.
	
	
	The plaintiff described the accident as follows:
	


“A. I was riding sort of down towards the hill and I was riding about 50 kilometres and then I suddenly see a ute reversing which reversed, like lights coming out of the driveway.  I didn't really have much time to do anything so I had ‑ I went straight into the back of his ute and then after that I don't remember, like I just blanked out.” (T 9)


	
	He first become aware of the ute coming out onto the roadway as follows:
	


“A.  Well, it was just like all of a sudden, he just ramped out and then I just seen the back of the ute with reverse lights on and I couldn't really do much on the motorbike so hoped for the best.” (T 9)


	
	He was asked about the other vehicles in the street:
	


“Q.  Were there parked cars in the street at the time?

A.  Yes, there was a few.  There was a few parked cars.

Q.  Anyway, you've indicated that you struck the vehicle and that's your last recollection for some short period of time, is that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you remember much else about at the scene of the accident?

A.  No, not that I can remember.” (T 9)


	
	This description is of some importance, since the plaintiff would later claim that his vision of the utility reversing was blocked by a van which was parked beside the road.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave a statement to the police which was read into evidence by Constable Karpenko at T 102-103 as follows:
	


“Q.  Could you read out what he told you and when it was that he told you his account?

A.  Yes.  Just bear with me; I'll just quickly find it.  In the same official police notebook 508387 on page 31, I've recorded:

""At 8 o'clock at night on 4 July 2011 I've attended number 5 Fourth Avenue in Condell Park, the address of Abbas Saleh, date of birth 11 August 1993, and his mobile number""--

Do you want that read out?

Q.  No, thank you?

A.  Okay:

""I've then asked him was he the driver of motorbike VID 69, that was involved in a motor vehicle collision with utility Bravo, Tango, Charlie, 49 November upon Edgar Street in Condell Park at 7.05pm on 27 June 2011.  Mr Saleh has replied yes.  I have then asked him, 'Can you tell me what happened?'  He says, 'I was going down Edgar Street towards Condell Park, the ute was reversing out of the driveway.  I was going down and I got close to him so I had to slam my brakes.  I had no control of my bike and I just hit into him.'  I've said, 'Do you recall seeing the reverse lights on the other vehicle?', he says, 'Yes.'  I've asked him, 'Are you the owner?', he says, 'No, Mohammad Elali from Riverwood is the owner of the motorbike.'

I have asked him, 'Was there anything else obstructing your view prior to the collision"", he said, 'Yes, a parked van on the kerbside.'  I've asked him, 'How did it obstruct your view?', the answer is, 'I couldn't see the ute because of the van until about 2 metres.  The van was on the kerbside in the next driveway back from the utility.'  I've asked him, 'When did you apply your brakes?', he said, '2 metres before I got to the ute.'  I've asked him, 'Were your headlights on?', he has said, 'Yes.'  I've asked him, 'Was the utility's headlights on?', he says, 'Yes'.

I've asked him, 'Can you assess if the bike reversed slowly or quickly into the intersection?', he said, 'I'm not sure.  It wasn't slow, but it wasn't fast'.  I've asked him, 'Do you recall where you impacted the utility?', he says, 'Not sure'.  I've asked, 'Alcohol or drugs?  No'.  His answer is 'No'.  I've asked, 'How long have you held your licence prior to the collision?', his answer is, 'About a week and a half'.  I've asked him his speed prior to the collision.  His answer is early 50s.  I've asked him, 'Did you at any time cross over to the other side of the lane?', he says, 'No'.  I've asked him, 'Did you attempt to take over the utility prior to the collision?', his answer is, 'Yes, about a metre from the ute' and that's signed by the maker of that statement on 04/07/2011.""

That completes it.”


	
	In cross-examination, when asked about the circumstances in which he acquired the bike, the plaintiff said:
	


“Q.  You borrowed the money, did you?

A.  No.  My brother actually got it for me.

Q.  It was a gift, was it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How much did it cost?

A.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.

Q.  You're not sure suggests you have some idea?

A.  I just seen the bike as in I got you a present, so I just got ‑ like, I will still be young.  Like, I didn't really ask how much and all that.  So I just got on it and I started [untranscribable]” (T 37)


	
	The word that is now marked “[untranscribable]” was the subject of some controversy in the course of proceedings. Following information provided by Maureen Barrell, Centre Manager of the Reporting Services Branch, on 28 January 2015, the word has been removed from the transcript after submissions from the parties (see 29 October 2014 transcript – T 118, 124-125).
	
	
	The importance of this answer, which was relied upon by the defendant in his counsel’s initial oral and written submissions to a considerable degree, is reduced to being a description of the circumstances in which the plaintiff was given a motor bike which he had not previously ridden (T 38). I expressly disregard any inferences which could have arisen as a result of the plaintiff using such a word to describe the way in which he drove. As the circumstances of the accident show, the use of this word to describe his driving in fact would have played very little part in the circumstances of the accident in any event.
	
	
	How did the accident happen? The plaintiff in examination in chief gave only the limited description set out above, which did not include any reference to there being a van parked by the road which impeded his view, although this was the explanation he gave to the police when he was questioned some time later. In cross-examination, the plaintiff was asked about a statement he made to the police in which he referred to a van parked on the left hand side of Edgar Street. In light of the written submissions of the plaintiff (which asserted that the plaintiff did mention the van), the whole of the questioning on this issue needs to be set out, so that it is apparent that the issue of the van is only raised when counsel for the defendant specifically puts it to the plaintiff in cross-examination:
	


“Q.  You said there were parked cars?

A.  Yes.

Q.  In Edgar Street?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Which sides, your side, the other side, both sides?

A.  From what I remember, both sides.  There's always cars parked on Edgar Street, you know.  It's a busy road.

Q.  You were familiar with Edgar Street on the occasion of the accident.  So you knew it was a street full of houses with driveways?

A.  Yes, of course.

Q.  You say parked cars?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You knew, didn't you, that there could be a car coming out of its driveway, entering Edgar Street on your side of the road.

A.  Yeah, like it's always on your mind.

Q.  You had a difficulty, though, didn't you, as you were travelling down Edgar Street, seeing the utility on the road, didn't you?

A.  No, because the only hard thing was, on the bike, when I was riding down, he came instantly coming out of the driveway, like, I didn't even have time to see him, like, all I seen was, like, almost like the back of his ute, the reverse lights on, and on a bike there's not much you can do, like, it's not like a car your know, press your brakes, you can't do much, it was just instant.

Q.  You say it was instant, but is this correct in terms of what you knew had happened as you were driving down‑‑

A.  Riding.

Q.  ‑‑riding down Edgar Street.  You were asked some questions by the police.  Do you remember answering questions of the police about the circumstances of the accident?

A.  If you can tell me the questions that were asked, I can remember, yes.

Q.  You've said, the one question, ""Was there anything obstructing your view prior to the collision?"" and you answered, ""Yes, a parked van on the kerb side""?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did you intend by that to say, ""on your side of the road""?

A.  Yes, on my side.

Q.  Being the side of the road that the defendant's van‑‑

A.  On the left side.

Q.  ‑‑the left hand side, came from.  You were then asked, ""How did it obstruct your view?""  And you said, ""I couldn't see the ute because of the van until about 2 metres.  The van was on the kerb side in the next driveway back from the utility"", do you remember that question and answer?

A.  Sorry, can you just say the last bit again?

Q.  Yes, ""I couldn't see the ute because of the van until about 2 metres""?

A.  Yes.

Q.  ""The van was on the kerb side in the next driveway back from the utility""?

A.  Yes, that's right.

Q.  Do you agree with that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Question, ""When did you apply your brakes?""  Answer, ""2 metres before I got to the ute"".  Is that correct?

A.  Yes, because it was such a short distance.” (T 43-44)


	
	There were no skid marks at the scene of the accident, even at two metres. The plaintiff later qualified his statement to the police, saying that, “it was just like instant, like.  If you just see a ute reversing out of the driveway, you know.” (T 45)
	
	
	The plaintiff’s written submissions set out at paragraph 5(b) that the street “had parked cars along either side of the road and in particular there was a van parked on the left-hand side of Edgar Street as the Plaintiff proceeded towards Condell Park (Transcript page 9.28-30:44.20 29) [sic]”. That submission, which has been withdrawn, is incorrect. So is the submission that the plaintiff gave evidence that the van he described “concealed his view of the reversing utility until it came out onto the roadway (Transcript page 44.20-44)” (plaintiff’s written submissions, paragraph 5(f)).
	
	
	The statement made by the plaintiff to the police was categorised by the defendant in submissions as “self-serving” (defendant’s written submissions, page 2). I have a choice between accepting the plaintiff’s account of the accident in the police statement as opposed to the plaintiff’s evidence on oath in examination in chief and in cross-examination.
	
	
	The plaintiff said (at T 46):
	


“Q.  You collided with the rear of the utility on the driver's side, didn't you?

A.  Look, when I was about to hit the ute, I didn't think of any of that.  All I thought about was death.  That's all you think about.  Going at a speed of 50 kilometres on a bike, seeing the back of the ute with reverse lights on, you're going to buckle.  I can't remember all of this.  All I remember is the ute reversing out of a driveway, with his reverse lights, and me smacking into it.  That's all I remember.”


	
	He went on to say (at T 47-48):
	


“Q.  There were no vehicles between you and the utility as you rode down Edgar Street?

A.  No.

Q.  Correct?

A.  Yeah, no, there was no‑‑

Q.  The only vehicle was the one you told us about that was‑‑

A.  On the left.

Q.  ‑‑stationary, that was the van that you described.

A.  That's correct.

Q.  On the other side of the road, do you remember whether there were any vehicles coming towards you, on the other side of the road?

A.  Not that I can remember.  It was a bit far back, but.  Look, when I seen the ute coming, I didn't really think of much.  It's a scary position to be in, I'll be honest, and I‑‑

Q.  Didn't you attempt, when it became obvious, even to you, as you were riding down Edgar Street, that there was a van parked, and beside the van was this utility, stationary, slightly moving forward, not backwards, forwards, that you had to avoid the accident by either slamming the brakes on, or overtaking him on the other side of the road and getting away from the area?

[Objection]

Q.  What choices do you say you had?

A.  Sir, there was none.  Like, it's not ‑ it's not my job to get down and be the lollypop man and be, like, stop there's a bike coming.  Like, I was just doing my daily job running down the road and all I see is this ute reverse out of the way, like it's simple.  There's nothing I can do.  Like, he actually reversed into me and I had no choice.”


	
	The plaintiff’s evidence is also contradicted by evidence from statements by witnesses at the scene.
	


The evidence of witnesses to the accident


	
	The accident was seen by Ms Marcella Diaz, who was parking her vehicle on the street. It was also observed by Ms Wendy Staab, who was walking to her parked car along the same street. These witnesses provided statements to the police, who themselves attended the site within minutes because, by coincidence, they were also in the same street, further down, and were able to see the site of the accident from the location where their vehicle was parked.
	
	
	The defendant has also provided a statement, but he effectively saw nothing until he heard the sound of the impact.
	
	
	The statement of Ms Diaz sets out that she was parking her vehicle at about 7:05pm when she observed the following:
	


“4. I heard a noise, a motorbike, I saw the ute moving, reversing into the intersection.

5. I saw a red motor bike trying to overtake the ute, while he was trying to overtake the ute I saw him hit the right corner of the ute. He did not even brake. I noticed the red bike driving really fast on the red line (notebook error) white lines, I saw him before he hit the ute. It was so fast, he didn’t even brake.

6. I saw the rider go over the top of the red bike and land on the opposite side of the road.

7. I rang 000 as I saw everything.” (Exhibit 4)


	
	Ms Wendy Staab provided a statement as follows:
	


“3. At 7.00pm on 27th June 2011 I was about to walk to my parked car. I heard a bike coming south along Edgar Street. I turned to the bike and tried to flag down the driver of the bike as I could see that a ute was reversing back and I could tell they were going to collide.

4. The ute had appeared to me to have stopped reversing as the reverse lights had gone off.

5. I then saw the bike collide wit [sic] the rear of the ute. It looked as though the rider had swerved in order to miss the ute. I did not hear any brake noises from the rider.

6. The rider of the bike got thrown and hit the rear of the truck and then he rolled onto the ground. I saw him try to get up and I have told him to stay down and for someone to call the ambulance and police. The police arrived and took over.” (Exhibit 4)


	
	Constable Kate Karpenko describes how a woman whom she now knows to be Diana Faddoul came to the window and yelled, “Hurry there has been an accident”. She ran three car lengths in front of the police caged truck to find the motor vehicle and motorcycle in the following position. The ute was “facing partially vertical across the left southbound land [sic] lane on Edgar Street, and a red motorcycle lying on its right side over the left southbound lane and partially into the right northbound lane. I observed shattered glass on the rear of the utility and I noticed red coloured panel debris scattered within approximately a 3 metre circumference, surrounding the utility” (Exhibit 4 – Statement of Police).
	
	
	She noted the presence of the witnesses, called for assistance and, at a later stage, entered the relevant details in her police notebook as well as taking photographs and drawing a diagram. No skid marks were observed.
	
	
	Constable Jessica Bill similarly describes exiting the police vehicle and seeing “a few metres down the road” a silver utility “across both lanes and a read motorcycle lying on its right side in the southern lane of Edgar Street.” (Exhibit 4 – Statement of Police)
	
	
	The defendant’s statement to the police has been tendered. He said:
	


“Q3. – Can yo [sic] tell me what happened?

A3. – I was reversing out of my driveway at 177a Edgar Street Condell Park. I looked for any vehicles, there was nothing coming. I had completed the reverse. I put my vehicle into first gear to move forward South on Edgar street [sic], I felt an impact and jumped out of my car.”


	
	The defendant said his ute was in first gear at the time of collision (see also Q11 and A11).
	
	
	As it was 7:05pm, the defendant’s ute has its lights illuminated.
	
	
	The photographs have been tendered and are Exhibit E. I note the following.
	



	
	Although the plaintiff was cross-examined about there being a van, the area identified by the plaintiff as being the location of the van (see Exhibit 6) does not show, in the photographs, a van being present. Having regard to the speed at which the police officers went to the premises, which essentially involved running three car lengths to the scene of the accident, I am satisfied that, as the street was blocked off by the police immediately following the accident, the likelihood of a van leaving the scene of the accident at any time before the police took the photographs in question is remote. I am satisfied therefore that there was no van at the spot marked with the staple (put with a circle), as was put to the defendant by counsel for the plaintiff (Exhibit 6).
	
	
	Secondly, the location of the defendant’s ute as shown in the photographs is where the vehicle should have been located if it had fully completed its reverse manoeuvre. The point of impact was on the driver side of the ute at a point consistent with left hand inside injury to the plaintiff as well as consistent with the location of the motorcycle. This is in turn consistent with the motorcycle “overtaking” manoeuvre as seen by Ms Diaz.
	



	
	Counsel for the defendant put to the plaintiff that he had been attempting to overtake in the manner described by Ms Diaz:
	


“Q.  As you were approaching the point of impact, you attempted to overtake the van, the utility?

A.  Overtake it?

Q.  Overtake it?

A.  Why, was it driving forward?

Q.  Because it was in front of you, with it being all but stationary?

A.  No.

Q.  Fully occupying the left hand side of Edgar Street?

A.  No, sorry, I can't agree with that, it was reversing.

…

Q.  Is this statement correct, Ms Saleh?

A.  Which statement?

Q.  I'm about to read it to you:

""I saw a red motor bike trying to overtake the ute.  While he was trying to overtake the ute, I saw him hit the right corner of the ute. He did not even brake.  I noticed the red bike driving really fast on the red line, white lines.  I saw him before he hit the ute.  It was so fast, he didn't even brake.""

Is that correct, that statement?

HICKEY: I object to this evidence.

WITNESS: No.  That's definitely‑‑

HER HONOUR: On what basis?  He can put to somebody what somebody else says.

WITNESS: No.  That's fine.

HER HONOUR: He's bound by the answer.  I mean, is this person going to be coming and giving evidence.  I don't know.

HICKEY: I think the answer to that question is no.

RONZANI: The answer to that question is there is evidence from that witness, depending on what your Honour rules in due course.

HER HONOUR: It's appropriate that he can put it.  The thing is, I don't think you can say he can't put it.  He can put it that somebody says this, but that's as far as it goes, and we'll deal with the rest of it later but I think he's obliged to actually under section 46.  Yes.  All right.

RONZANI

Q.  Is this correct:

""I then saw the bike collide with the rear of the ute.  It looked as though the rider had swerved in order to miss the ute.  I did not hear any brake noises from the rider.""

Is that correct?

A.  No.  That's completely incorrect.

Q.  I'm suggesting to you that you weren't paying enough attention as you were riding your bike down the road.  Do you disagree with that?

A.  Yes.  Definitely.

Q.  You were going too fast down the road?

A.  No.  No I wasn't.

Q.  When you noticed the presence of the utility it was, in fact, not reversing anymore.  It has completed its reverse and was fully in its left hand lane and proceeding slightly forward.  Do you agree with that?

A.  No.  Definitely not.

Q.  That you attempted to overtake the utility but misjudged because of your inexperience as a rider of a bike and ended up collecting the left side of your body with the right back side, the driver's side, of the utility.  Isn't that right?

A.  No, sir.” (T 46-50)


	
	Finally, there is the issue of the plaintiff’s speed. If I accept that the defendant’s ute commenced its reverse at a time when there was no traffic and was travelling the 4 to 5 seconds of time described by the defendant, then the plaintiff, if he had been riding at a sufficiently safe speed, as well as keeping a proper lookout, would not have collided with the rear of the defendant’s ute either because he would have come to a stop, or because he would have travelled to the opposite side of the road.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence that he was travelling at a speed “in the 50s” is inconsistent with the evidence of the witness, Ms Diaz, who said that the bike was being driven “really fast” and that the plaintiff “did not even brake”. Ms Staab noted that she “did not hear any brake noises from the rider” and it is not in dispute that the photographs taken do not show any skid marks.
	


The evidence of the defendant


	
	The defendant gave evidence that he was looking from side to side as he reversed out of the driveway onto the roadway (T 85) and that it was about 4 to 5 seconds from the time he left the driveway until the point of impact (T 85-86). He said he had just brought his vehicle to a halt and engaged first gear and begun to roll forward when the accident happened. He agreed he was not looking to the left during the whole period that he reversed onto the roadway:
	


“Q.  As you continued to reverse out of your driveway, did you continue to look to your left?

A.  No, I can't do two things at once; to look left and right, I can't do that, I don't have two heads, or something.” (T 90)


	
	Great emphasis is laid on this concession by the plaintiff as being evidence of negligence, including the defendant’s subsequent acceptance that he would not have been looking to the left at all material times. That is not a submission which I accept. The plaintiff was obliged to look both ways as it was a two-way street.
	
	
	The defendant said there was no van parked beside the road within sight or blocking his view and that, even if there had been a van, he would still have a clear line of sight (T 92).
	
	
	The defendant’s account of the events in the witness box is similar to that given to the police in his statement (Exhibit 4).
	


Conclusions concerning liability


	
	The findings of fact in this case depend substantially upon my accepting the plaintiff as a witness of credit, which I am not prepared to do.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submits that according to Ms Diaz’s version, the defendant’s vehicle was still reversing onto the roadway immediately prior to the accident and that, by failing to look continuously in the plaintiff’s direction, the defendant was negligent. Although claims of excessive speed by the defendant were particularised, this particular was not relied upon and the plaintiff’s evidence is to the contrary.
	
	
	I do not accept that Ms Diaz’s statement supports the version of the accident given by the plaintiff. She commenced her statement with the reference of hearing a noise in the distance at a time when she saw the ute reversing into the intersection, but does not say that the defendant’s vehicle was still moving at the time of the accident.
	
	
	Ms Staab is definite that the defendant’s vehicle “had appeared to me to have stopped reversing as the reverse lights had gone off”. That is strong evidence that the defendant’s vehicle had completed reversing, and I accept the defendant’s evidence that he had in fact already put his vehicle in first gear.
	
	
	Given the evidence of these witnesses, the placement of the vehicles as shown in the police photographs, the site of impact on the motor vehicle (which is consistent with the plaintiff engaging in an overtaking manoeuvre, as is the lack of skid marks), I am satisfied that the defendant’s version of events, namely that he had come to a stop and had put his vehicle into first gear when the impact occurred, should be accepted.
	
	
	The plaintiff, beyond submitting that the evidence of the accident is “insurmountable” (plaintiff’s written submissions, paragraph 30), does not address the issue of the duty of care and breach of duty owed by the defendant as a driver reversing from his driveway onto a street where the plaintiff had right of way.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant draws my attention to the explanation given by Deane J in March v E & MH Stramare Pty Ltd (1991) 171 CLR 506 at 521 as follows:
	


“In leaving it (without justifying reason) in what White J in the Full Court accurately described as an ""extraordinary position in the middle"" of the roadway where it ""obstructed not only one half of the right lane for south-bound traffic in which the [appellant] was travelling but also one half of the right lane for north-bound traffic"" (March v E and M M Stramare Pty Ltd (1989) 50 SASR 588, at 590), the second respondent was guilty of a breach of the duty of care which he owed to other road users. It is true that it is unlikely that a careful and attentive driver would have failed to see the lights of the parked truck and to have taken steps to avoid it. As has been said, however, the duty of care owed by the second respondent was also to the inattentive (and intoxicated) driver whose presence upon the road was obviously foreseeable.”


	
	Mr Ronzani also draws my attention to the statement by Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Manley v Alexander (2005) 223 ALR 228 at [11]:
	


“[11] No doubt the appellant's attention was drawn to the figure of Mr Turner standing at the side of the road and behaving in a way that suggested that he might act in some way that would require the appellant to respond. But recognising one possible source of danger does not mean that a driver can or must give exclusive attention to that danger. Driving requires reasonable attention to all that is happening on and near the roadway that may present a source of danger. And much more often than not, that will require simultaneous attention to, and consideration of, a number of different features of what is already, or may later come to be, ahead of the vehicle's path.”


	
	The driver of any vehicle, whether on or off the road, must not reverse the vehicle unless he or she can do so safely, and, when reversing out of a driveway out onto a roadway where others have right of way, must exercise particular care. This requires reasonable attention to all that is happening on and near the roadway that may present a source of danger. As the driver arrives at the final point of reversal, and places his or her car into first gear, for the purpose of travelling forward, his vehicle becomes the vehicle which will have the right of way. Other vehicles using the road at the stage at which the defendant’s vehicle was, namely with the vehicle stopped in the middle of the road and about to, or actually, engaged in first gear, need to slow down or even stop in those circumstances. This is what the defendant means when challenging whether a duty of care is owed.
	
	
	In the present case, there was clear visibility of approximately 50 metres between the plaintiff’s first sight of the defendant’s vehicle and the vehicle being in the position described by Ms Staab.
	
	
	All of the evidence points to the plaintiff attempting to overtake the defendant’s vehicle, a manoeuvre which was nearly successful, in that he hit the right corner of the defendant’s vehicle. The defendant’s vehicle did not reverse into the plaintiff’s path as the plaintiff claims. On the contrary, it had ceased reversing and was about to move forward.
	
	
	I have rejected the evidence of the plaintiff on all issues where that evidence is inconsistent with the evidence of the defendant or the independent witnesses. This is in part because of my findings as to his credit, particularly in relation to his assertion that his line of vision was impeded by a large van, and also by reason of my rejection of his credit in relation to quantum issues, set out in more detail below.
	


The relevant legal principles and their application to the facts of the case


	
	The plaintiff bears the onus of proof of establishing that the defendant was negligent. Negligence is determined pursuant to the provisions of the CLA – see s 3B(2), which provides that Divisions 1-4 and 8 of Part 1A of the Act apply to motor vehicle accidents.
	
	
	The duty that a driver owes to other users of the roadway has been explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Marien v Gardiner [2013] NSWCA 396 at [33] – [37] and in Dungan v Chan [2013] NSWCA 182 at [15].
	
	
	The first question is whether the defendant did in fact owe a duty of care to the plaintiff if he had in fact finished his turn and put the car in first gear in order to move off. I am satisfied that the defendant owed a duty of care to road users generally, but that did not include an obligation to give way to the plaintiff, in that he had completed his reversal, and had stopped his vehicle for the purpose of moving forward, with the car already in first gear. As such, he did not owe a duty of care to a vehicle which sought to overtake him rather than to brake and allow the defendant to move forward. The defendant was entitled to assume that the plaintiff would act in a non-negligent manner: Dungan v Chan, supra, at [15]. It was therefore not reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff, who had sufficiently far visibility of the defendant’s vehicle from the distance at which it was first visible, would continue to speed to overtake a vehicle which I am satisfied was, at the time, stopped in the middle of the road for the purpose of proceeding forward.
	
	
	The content and ambit of the defendant’s duty of care was not to reverse the vehicle unless he could do so safely, and to have regard to all that was happening on the roadway in the vicinity of his vehicle (Hawthorne v Hillcoat (2008) 51 MVR 523 at [47]). I am satisfied that the defendant was not in breach of that duty, in that he exercised reasonable steps to know what was happening, or might happen, in the vicinity of his vehicle. In particular, he was not required to look left at all times; it was sufficient for him to look from left to right in the manner he indicated in his evidence, and also for him to look forward at the time when he was engaging his vehicle in first gear. There were pedestrians in the street, and a careful motorist would be obliged to check that there was no pedestrian on the roadway before engaging in first gear.
	
	
	If I have erred in so finding, the question of factual causation (s 5D) would still arise. In the absence of an opportunity to react to the plaintiff’s proposed overtaking manoeuvre, and the difficulties for the defendant in moving his stopped vehicle out of the path of the plaintiff, it could not be said that the collision occurred but for the breach of duty of care of the defendant. I also find that the second limb of causation pursuant to s 5D (scope of liability) would not warrant such a finding.
	
	
	Accordingly I am satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant was negligent. In the event that I have erred in these findings, I make the following findings as to contributory negligence.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (“the Act”) provides:
	


“5R Standard of contributory negligence

(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.

(2) For that purpose:

(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and

(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.”


	
	This section of the Act is explained by Basten JA In Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis (No 2) (2014) 86 NSWLR 393 at [48]-[52] as follows:
	


“[48] While s 5R must be applied to determine whether a person has been guilty of contributory negligence, it says nothing about how, if that issue is determined by a finding adverse to a plaintiff, the relative culpability of the plaintiff and defendant are determined. That exercise is governed prima facie, by s 138(3) and, arguably also by s 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (NSW) (the “1965 Act“) which deals with apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence and, in particular, s 9(1)(b) which provides that “the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage“.

[49] Section 9 is also part of the enacted law as to contributory negligence captured by s 138(1):Nominal Defendant v Rooskov [2012] NSWCA 43; (2012) 60 MVR 350 (at [117]) per Campbell JA (Young JA agreeing); see also Joslyn v Berryman (at [69]) per Gummow and Callinan JJ (referring to s 10(1) of the 1965 Act which, at the time applicable to the accident in that case, dealt with apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence.)

[50] However there are differences between s 138(3) of the MAC Act and s 9(1)(b) of the 1965 Act. As Kirby J explained in Joslyn v Berryman (at [133]), albeit by reference to s 74(3) of the MAA (which as I have said is relevantly on all fours with s 138(3) of the MAC Act):

Secondly, in s 74(3) of the Motor Accidents Act, Parliament has avoided the more complex statement of the criteria found in s 10(1) of the 1965 Act. There is no reference to the respective “faults“ of the persons involved. Nor is there a reference to the “responsibility for the damage“. In s 74(3) provision is simply made for the reduction of the damages recoverable “as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case“. It is not entirely clear whether this more limited formula replaced the previous statement of the “enacted law“ set out in the 1965 Act. On the face of things, it appears to do so and thus leaves wholly at large the reduction for contributory negligence, made by reference to nothing more than what “the court thinks just and equitable“

[51] Hayne J also considered the operation of s 74(3) and concluded (at [157]) that it required the decision-maker to undertake the process of apportionment as described in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34 ; (1985) 59 ALJR 492 (at 494). In Mackenzie v the Nominal Defendant[2005] NSWCA 180 (at [60] ff) (special leave refused, Nominal Defendant v Mackenzie [2005] HCATrans 844) Giles JA (Stein AJA and Gzell J agreeing) considered the different wording of s 9(1)(b) and s 138(3) and concluded (at [62]–[63]) that the latter still required the court to apply Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd. His Honour accepted that s 138(3) was the applicable provision no doubt because the case involved an intoxicated plaintiff in which circumstance s 138(2) as then in force was invoked. However as s 138(1) only captures the “common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence … except as provided by this section“, in my view the apportionment exercise must be undertaken in accordance with s 138(3). As is apparent from what follows this may be a distinction without a difference.

[52] Neither party referred to either s 9(1)(b) or s 138(3), both being content to submit that the question of apportionment the “just and equitable“ test invokes requires attention to the “degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man“: Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; (1956) 96 CLR 10 (at 16). The reasoning in Pennington v Norris finds reflection in the statement in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (at 494) that the just and equitable apportionment test requires:

… a comparison both of culpability, i.e. of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682; Smith v McIntyre [1958] Tas SR 36 at 42–49 and Broadhurst v Millman [1976] VR 208 at 219 and cases there cited. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination.

These statements were re-affirmed in Wynbergen v Hoyts Corp Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 52; (1997) 72 ALJR 65 (at 66) per Hayne J (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby JJ agreeing).”


	
	Whether the plaintiff was travelling at around 50km/hr or closer to 60km/hr, neither his speed, nor the fact that he was driving with his lights illuminated, are relevant, and the plaintiff’s reliance on this (written submissions, paragraphs 31-32) is misplaced. The real question in relation to contributory negligence is what the plaintiff did when he became aware that the defendant’s vehicle had reversed into his path. The plaintiff (somewhat inconsistently with his evidence in chief) relies upon the evidence of Ms Staab, who observed the plaintiff trying to swerve to avoid the defendant’s vehicle, and submits that this was not an unusual reaction from a motorcyclist confronted with a vehicle reversing onto the roadway only several metres in front of him.
	
	
	The plaintiff submits that any reduction for contributory negligence should be between 5 to 10%. The defendant submits that a finding of 100% contributory negligence should be made under s 5S of the Act.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the accident occurred the way Ms Staab described. The plaintiff did attempt to overtake the defendant’s ute, but failed.
	
	
	The picture painted by the evidence is a combination of speed, rider inexperience and, having regard to the plaintiff’s own evidence, simply not knowing what to do. The appropriate percentage for contributory negligence, in circumstances where the plaintiff had ample time to observe the defendant’s vehicle and slow down, must be high: Vale v Eggins [2006] NSWCA 348. However, the proposal that contributory negligence be assessed at 100% does not sufficiently take into account the plaintiff’s version of events which, if accepted by the court, would put the plaintiff in a similar position to that of the plaintiff (albeit he was a pedestrian) in Vale v Eggins.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am of the view that any allowance for contributory negligence should be in the order of 70%.

Damages


	
	By reason of the findings on liability, I have addressed the issue of damages only briefly.
	
	
	I note the plaintiff is not entitled to non-economic loss by reason of the fact that he had not exceeded a whole person impairment of 10%.
	
	
	The plaintiff was not a credible witness in relation to damages. His claims about the impact of the accident on his schooling is wholly in conflict with the school records. His evidence in chief was that he was “enrolled in year 12” at the time of the accident but that he did not complete the HSC as he found it a bit difficult as “I was delayed on work” (T 5-6). He said he had “done quite average [sic]” in the School Certificate, averaging 65 to 70%, and that his intention was to complete the HSC and then to work for his brother-in-law, a Mr Medleg (T 7).
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant put to the plaintiff that, well before the accident, the school had sent letters to him and his parents that he was at risk in relation to continued enrolment in year 12 because of failure to comply with the requirements of study at the school for the HSC. The plaintiff responded that he “can’t really remember that far back” (T 26). When shown the correspondence, he said that he only had trouble getting his practical work done “after my accident” (T 26), not before. He denied that he failed, or that he received warning letters for not doing work, stating:
	


“A.  Look my behaviour was, I'll be honest it wasn't the best but when it came to work I usually always got stuff done.  Like with mathematics, business, I was always on top of all that work.  But my attitude wasn't the best but when it came to theory work I was really good at that.” (T 27)


	
	This is not supported by the correspondence from the school. The school’s warning letter of 1 June 2011 categorically states that the plaintiff was in danger of not meeting the course criteria for the HSC business studies subject. Letters in the same terms were sent for his other courses. The plaintiff’s evidence that he had “ended up catching up on my work” and that “[t]he only thing I was delayed on was my timber folio [i.e. the work for his timber trade course]” (T 28) is not borne out by this correspondence, and neither are his claims of being up to date but “then I had the accident and then I got really delayed with everything else, with my timber work and everything” (T 28).
	
	
	The plaintiff also denied that he wanted to leave school and do a TAFE course (T 28).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim that these events occurred too long ago for him to remember what occurred need to be seen in the context of this chain of correspondence from 6 May 2011 20 June 2011 - one week before his accident. Each of these seven letters, as well as the personal letter from the principal to the plaintiff’s mother warning of a cut-off date in 14 days’ time (letter 20 June 2011, Exhibit 2), was sent in circumstances where they must have come to his attention (the plaintiff’s parents did not give evidence). I am satisfied from their contents that that the plaintiff was not satisfactorily completing his work in relation to work studies, applied mathematics, business study and English study, the four subjects the plaintiff was enrolled in for the purposes of the HSC, prior to the accident. All of the evidence points to the plaintiff being unable to complete his HSC by reason of pre-existing study and attitude issues.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant relied upon this history in relation to the plaintiff’s evidence of physical limitations and feelings of depression in relation to the completion of his TAFE course and his ability to work. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he had attempted to work as an apprentice carpenter and an apprentice plumber but his significant physical limitations meant that he did not have the physical capacity to complete the practical elements of the apprenticeship, as well as to do the work itself (T 11). He worked with his brother-in-law for five or six months in 2012 but then went through a period of unemployment during which he felt unable to be motivated and reported to his local general practitioner that he was feeling depressed. He remained unemployed until February 2014 when he again commenced an apprenticeship in plumbing and obtained employment with his brother-in-law, Mr Medleg. He continued to work for Mr Medleg three to four days a week.
	
	
	These findings are important in determining whether to accept the plaintiff’s calculations of past and future economic loss. The plaintiff contends that but for the accident he would by now be a third year apprentice carpenter and/or plumber or electrician (see Exhibit G). The rates for first year (not third year) apprentice plumbers provided by the plaintiff are $630 gross per week, and that of an electrician is $523. The plaintiff claims he has lost 50% of his physical capacity to work in manual labour including work as a tradesman, which would equate to a loss of $266 per week from 1 February 2012 until February 2014 ($27,664). His economic loss since that time is thus calculated at $16,524 on the basis of 48.42 weeks at $430 net per week.
	
	
	As to future economic loss, the plaintiff seeks a cushion on the basis that he has lost 50% of his capacity to perform as a tradesman or manual labourer, and claims $493 net per week for the rest of his working life, which amounts to $409,657.
	
	
	Past and future superannuation claims ($4,860 past and $54,935 future) are also claimed.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s activities during the year that he was off work are similarly inconsistent with his asserted inability to work and constant pain. He agreed he posted pictures of himself on Facebook, sitting in cars, that he continued to go to the gym, and that he asked his general practitioner for bulking products (T 31) so that he could build up his body. The plaintiff agreed that he was a “very strong” physical person, but he had maintained his strength through physical activity and that he continued to be able to go to the gym despite being in pain:
	


“Q.  You've posted your successes in that regard on Facebook, you've told her Honour.  Is that right?

A.  Yes.  Before the accident.

Q.  After the accident?

A.  Well, I got my body to a shape where I wanted to before the accident.  I got to high 80 kilos and then till now I dropped all the way to 70 kilos.

Q.  You've stopped taking the bulking products, have you?

A.  No.  I've never actually taken bulking products.  I asked about them, okay, but I've never actually proceeded.  I did try and go to the gym.  Okay.  I'll be honest, there's nothing to hide.  I did go back to the gym to try and get my old body back.  Okay.  I couldn't.  So I had to go very light and then I thought there was no point of it, so I just started doing fitness a bit and now I've stopped.

Q.  That year and a half or longer that you didn't work and you say did nothing other than stay at home, it seems as if you did quite a lot socially.  Would you agree with that?

A.  Yes.  Just out with friends, mucking around.

Q.  But then there wasn't any money left.  Is that right?

A.  No.  That's right.

Q.  You had to get a job again.  Is that right?

A.  That's what made me go back into it.

Q.  Why didn't you look for a job in that period of time?

A.  Just with me, I'm really picky.  I can't do a job that I don't enjoy.  I won't be able to go to work.  Like, I have to do something and choose something I want to do, you know.  Not where someone tries to decide what I want to do.  It's my life.  I want to do what I enjoy.

Q.  No compromises by you, is that what you're saying?

A.  No.  It's not‑‑

Q.  It's either your way or no way?

A.  No.  No.  No.  I'm not ‑ I'm not stubborn but I just prefer to do my work, what I want to do, you know.  Not what ‑ like, if someone does give me a talk, yes, I will take it into, like, my brain but, like, if I don't enjoy it, I won't do it.  I want to do something I like.” (T 32-33)


	
	The plaintiff also was able to play sport over this period, including soccer. He injured his thumb while playing sport and asserted that this thumb injury occurred because of his accident-related disabilities.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s employer, Mr Medleg (who was also his brother-in-law), gave evidence. He described the plaintiff as “a good boy” before the accident, a claim hard to accept, since he knew nothing about the difficulties the plaintiff was having at school (T 75-76). He denied that the plaintiff was stubborn and refused to perform tasks at work, saying that he would “give it a go”.
	
	
	However, Mr Medleg admitted that the reason for the plaintiff ceasing to work for him was that Mr Medleg was building up his business and there was no work for the plaintiff over this period, as “there wasn’t work, enough to keep him going” (T 77). Mr Medleg said he gave the plaintiff a job “to a certain time” but thereafter did not give him work because he could not do so (T 77). In those circumstances, the plaintiff’s claim that he was unable to perform the work, and that this was why he stopped, is in conflict with Mr Medleg’s evidence.
	


The plaintiff’s medical evidence


	
	The plaintiff suffered a fractured left forearm, injuries to the face which had resolved and some pain in the right wrist. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation with plate and screws of the radial shaft of the left forearm. The left elbow joint was not involved in that fracture. The MAS report noted that the plaintiff had good strength in both arms, which was “consistent with the callouses on the palms of his left and right hands” (Exhibit 1, p 11).
	
	
	The fracture of his right thumb while playing soccer is unrelated to the accident the subject of these proceedings. Although Dr Chin refers to some problems with the posterior interosseous nerve, I note the explanation in the MAS certificate (Exhibit 2, p 12) that there is no radial nerve lesion, and that the plaintiff’s lack of feeling problems will settle with the passage of time.
	


The medical and medico-legal reports


	
	Although the plaintiff provided a bundle of 411 pages of medical records, most of these were of little significance. This was for the following reasons:
	



	
	Pages 1-18 relate to the plaintiff’s admission to hospital, documents between pages 169-319 relate to the Liverpool Hospital, and pages 320-382 relate to the Bankstown Lidcombe Hospital, the details of which are largely uncontradicted;
	
	
	Pages 26-29 relate to the plaintiff’s right thumb injury at football in May 2012;
	
	
	The EMG report which is at pages 30-32 was not explained to me and appears unrelated to the accident the subject of these proceedings;
	
	
	The occupational health assessment centre report appear between pages 50-93 was not served and must, in response to the challenge as to its admissibility, be excluded;
	
	
	The MAS reports appearing between pages 114-168 are of little assistance in that they essentially record that the plaintiff falls below the threshold.
	



	
	Essentially the plaintiff relies upon the three reports of Professor Fearnside dated 23 January and 11 October 2012 and an updating report of 30 September 2014, and the two reports of Dr Dixon dated 3 July 2012. Reports of Dr Parmegiani (pages 94-197 of Exhibit A) describes the plaintiff as a “reasonably intelligent and resourceful young man” who should achieve full resolution of his symptoms within a period of six months if he has some appropriate treatment; however, the plaintiff’s claim for future out of pockets did not include this expense and the plaintiff appears not to have relied upon the report of Dr Parmegiani in relation to damages at all.
	
	
	The defendant have served reports from Dr Casikar and Dr Harvey-Sutton (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	I shall set out the contents of each of these reports in detail before considering the heads of damages claimed.
	


Professor Fearnside


	
	Professor Fearnside’s conclusions in his report of 23 January 2012 are as follows:
	


“7.2 Mr Saleh may well have some difficulties working as an electrician because of the injury to his left forearm. He has pain in the region and a partial loss of sensation below the elbow. He has some weakness of extension of the wrist and this is the result of a partial lesion of the left radial nerve below the elbow. Although he is right handed, this may prevent him from working in a vocation such as that of an electrician. A vocational assessment will be appropriate. He would be fit for a range of other occupations which do not involve manual work using the left arm and hand.

7.3 Mr Saleh came to assessment only six months following the injury on 27/6/11. For neurological injury, his condition has not stabilised and he has not reached maximum medical improvement. Re-examination toward the end of 2012 or early in 2013 would be appropriate as by that time, the neurological injury to his left upper limb should have stabilised and an assessment of permanent whole person impairment would be possible. In the meantime, it is recommended that he undergo nerve condition studies of the left upper limb to confirm the injury to the left radial nerve/posterior interosseous nerve and this would provide a prognosis as to likely improvement.

7.4 His other injuries have stabilised.

7.5 Mr Saleh does not require any assistance with personal care. On balance, I doubt that he will require any domestic assistance in the future.”


	
	In his report of 11 October 2012, Professor Fearnside noted that apart from a right thumb injury while playing soccer, the plaintiff’s condition had remained stable. Professor Fearnside said that the soccer injury was “not related to the first motorbike accident” (Exhibit A, p 46). He went on to state:
	


“4.6 Mr Saleh will have difficulty with manual work and as such, may well not be able to proceed with an apprenticeship. He was not able to participate in a course to qualify as a carpenter and discontinued. He may well also have difficulties working as an electrician (paragraph 7.2, 23/1/12) because of the generalised weakness in his left arm and loss of sensation, despite his being right handed. He would certainly be suited for office work or similar sedentary type work but seemed disinclined to consider that as an option.

4.7 When his fractured thumb heals, he should be able to return to playing soccer. He may have some difficulty reaching a professional level but I would not feel qualified to comment on the requirements for professional soccer.

4.8 In the future, he may require some minor assistance with heavy and domestic chores, particularly those which require the use of two hands. Otherwise, he does not require any assistance with personal care.”


	
	Professor Fearnside’s most recent opinion, dated 30 September 2014, is as follows:
	


“6.1 Since he was last assessed on 11/10/12, some two years ago, Mr Saleh’s condition has stabilised.

6.2 He came to assessment three years and three months after the injury on 28/6/11/ His prognosis is as he now presents. It is likely he will continue to experience some measure of pain and limitation of movement of the injured body parts as described above.

6.3 Mr Saleh is fit for light work. If he is able to exercise and improve his physical fitness, he may be able to manage some manual type work but at the present time he is fit only for light work such as that he is now doing with his brother-in-law. I see no reason that he could not work five days per week. He may need to undertake further studies in order to retrain for a longer term vocation which would avoid heavy manual work for which he is permanently unfit. He would seem to have few transferable skills (paragraph 4.1 my report 23/1/12).

6.4 From a neurosurgical point of view, he requires no further treatment. He will need to remain under the care of his nominated treating doctors for review and prescriptions as necessary. He should exercise himself and he does not require any physiotherapy.

Mr Saleh does not require any domestic assistance nor any assistance with personal care.

6.5 In my report, I considered Mr Saleh’s condition to have stabilised and this is consistent with the findings on physical examination on 30/9/14 and with his self-report.

6.6 In my report of 11/10/12, I provided an assessment of permanent whole person impairment using the 4th Edition of the AMA Guides and the current Edition of the MAA Impairment Guidelines. I have looked through the joint ranges of motion and the assessments I made in that report and they remain similar. WPI has not increased and total WPI is 12% (excluding scarring).”

Dr Dixon


	
	Dr Dixon’s reports are of limited value because he saw the plaintiff on two occasions in 2012 and there was no updating report. He concluded that the plaintiff’s condition “should not deteriorate in the future as his fracture lines did not communicate with the left elbow joint or to the CMC joint at the base of his right thumb”. He considered that the soccer injury was related to the motorbike accident because he fell while trying to protect his left elbow injury. He went on to conclude at p 38 of Exhibit A:
	


“As noted above, his current capacity for work and to do his trade apprenticeship remains guarded. It is anticipated that with further active use of his upper limbs, he will be able to attempt an apprenticeship next year in the electrical or building trade but may have difficulty doing the physical tasks required such as carpentry. His future capacity to play soccer is that he had difficulty playing this year but may be able to play as an amateur next year. He may have difficulty playing at a professional level to his injuries. He has gratuitous domestic assistance provided by his mother for domestic chores. He would have difficulty doing handyman tasks such as home maintenance at present but should be able to do these in the future.”


	
	Dr Dixon’s additional report of the same date does not materially add to these findings but providing a percentage only for the plaintiff’s whole person impairment.
	


Dr Casikar


	
	In his medico-legal report of 5 March 2014, Dr Casikar stated that the plaintiff “appears to have recovered well from the motorcycle accident that occurred on 27 June 2011” and that the soccer injury was “unrelated” (Exhibit 1, p 5 of Dr Casikar’s report). He considered that the plaintiff did not seem to have any significant disabilities. His main disability now was the area of numbness in his left forearm and there were no other disabilities as a consequence of the road traffic accident (p 6). He did not consider that this reduced sensation in the left forearm would interfere with the plaintiff’s capacity to function as a plumber as he is right handed. He considered the plaintiff did not require any domestic care or assistance, stating that the plaintiff had “now started doing a plumbing apprenticeship without any difficulty”, that he required no further treatment and that his employment opportunities were not diminished by this road traffic accident.
	
	
	Dr Casikar’s report is brief and repetitive. It is of limited assistance for these reasons, principally because he does not expose his reasoning for saying why the plaintiff has recovered well from the accident (Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705).
	


Dr Harvey-Sutton


	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton is a consultant occupational physician specialising in disability assessment and impairment evaluation. As such, her occupational medicine practice concentrates on disability assessment and she is well placed to provide the rehabilitation report that Professor Fearnside considered was an important indicia of the plaintiff’s future employability as well as his general health.
	
	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton’s 14-page report is the most comprehensive analysis of the plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities. She has provided a list of all of the medical reports and has carefully analysed and set out the analysis of Professor Fearnside and Dr Dixon.
	
	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton gives an educational and occupational history which erroneously states that in 2013 the plaintiff continued to be on a new start allowance and work two to three days a week for his brother-in-law, when in fact, looking at his tax returns, he ceased working for his brother-in-law some time towards the end of 2012. I noted, however, that Professor Fearnside’s report of 23 January 2012 also misstates the plaintiff’s employment history, in that he states (Exhibit A, p 22, paragraph 4.1) that the plaintiff left school after Year 10 and did not undertake any further studies, saying he was intending to commence his apprenticeship as an electrician. In fact, the plaintiff completed Year 11 and did reasonably well and was having serious difficulties in Year 12 prior to the motor vehicle accident. Dr Dixon described the plaintiff as being a school student at the time of the accident, who would like to do electrical trades in the future, but had not been able to do a pre-trade course at TAFE as at July 2012. This also is, strictly speaking, incorrect. As Dr Harvey-Sutton points out, the plaintiff told her he believed that he did not work in 2012 but that she had ascertained he commenced a TAFE course in carpentry which he attended for about one to two months, and then did not return after he injured his right thumb.
	
	
	The reason for these errors may be that the plaintiff is a poor historian, but I do not propose to draw this conclusion and the plaintiff was not cross-examined on these differing accounts. It is one of a number of unfortunate gaps in the evidence in these proceedings.
	
	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton sets out the plaintiff’s current complaints and participation in his daily activities. He told Dr Harvey-Sutton he was able to perform household activities apart from vacuuming, which caused pain, as did lawn mowing. He had returned to exercise in the form of light jogging and running, playing social soccer and Oztag, but no longer went to the gym because he was unable to use the heavy weights. He did, however, fish and swim. He was able to drive an automatic vehicle, as well as his brother’s car, which is a utility with manual transmission, but had pain in his right thumb if he drove long distances. He had difficulties with his nose due to the nose fracture, but his general health was otherwise good.
	
	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton noted the contents of the x-ray reports and her clinical examination. She notes that since Professor Fearnside’s report of 23 January 2012, the plaintiff’s generalised weakness in his left arm and loss of sensation had improved and that he had good strength in both arms now, consistent with the callouses on the palms of his left and right hands. She considered that the fractured thumb was unrelated to the motor vehicle accident but that notwithstanding the fractured thumb, he should be able to return to playing soccer. She did not consider he required any assistance with heavier domestic chores by reason of his improvements since he had last seen Professor Fearnside.
	
	
	Dr Harvey-Sutton noted, in relation to Dr Dixon’s report of 3 July 2012, the potential for future difficulty in performing carpentry, or becoming a professional soccer player. She also notes that Dr Dixon reported the plaintiff had “gratuitous domestic assistance provided by his mother and domestic chores and that while he would have difficulty doing handyman tasks, such as home maintenance”, he should be “able to do these in the future”. Dr Harvey-Sutton makes no comment about these conclusions, and I assume that she regards them as having been correct as at 3 July 2012.
	
	
	Having noted these matters, Dr Harvey-Sutton sets out the 13 questions she has been asked by the solicitors for the defendant, stating that there were no significant disabilities arising from the motor vehicle accident on 27 June 2011 (p 12), that the plaintiff had been able to return to playing social soccer in circumstances where she could identify “no reason now why he cannot play professional soccer, within my area of expertise as an occupational physician” (p 13). Dr Harvey-Sutton further notes that the plaintiff was unable to say whether he was academically able to complete an electrical apprenticeship, but that he was now fit to undertake either a plumbing or electrical apprenticeship (p 13). She considered the plaintiff was “suited to all those vocations now, for which he was suited prior to the accident of 27 June 2011” (p 13).
	
	
	As to ongoing care and domestic assistance, she noted his problems at the time as follows:
	


“In the past, he would have required care and domestic assistance while the left arm was immobilised and would have qualified for six hours of assistance per week for the first some two months following the accident. Thereafter, he may have had required two hours of assistance per week for a further two months and then for a further three months may have required two hours of assistance per fortnight to do the lawn mowing/gardening and heavier physical activities around the home.” (p 13)


	
	Although the plaintiff makes no claim for past care, it is relevant to note that Dr Harvey-Sutton considered any claim for care would be of a past nature and that she answered question 11, concerning the need for future care, with the answer “no”. She also considered that the plaintiff did not require any further treatment and particularly noted that the fracture of the left forearm was not an intra-articular fracture.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the concerns of Professor Fearnside (whose report is dated 23 January 2012, less than a year after the accident) and Dr Dixon (whose report of 3 July 2012 is similarly dated), I accept the evidence paints a picture of a healthy young man now in good health. The only recent medical report in relation to the plaintiff is the report of Professor Fearnside of 30 September 2014 and it adds little to the picture, particularly given the reports of the defendant which paint a picture of a young man in good health who has recovered from his injuries.
	
	
	Having noted the medical evidence I now set out what my findings would be in relation to the heads of damage claimed.
	


Past and future economic loss


	
	The plaintiff was enrolled in year 12 at the time of the accident, but clearly he could not have continued in year 12, given his failure to comply with the course requirement to sit for the HSC. He was therefore someone who can be regarded as being obliged to look for work, including obtaining apprentice work while completing a TAFE course.
	
	
	I have no information as to what TAFE courses were available to him in 2011, and must proceed on the basis that he would have sought such work in 2012, which is effectively what he did do. I accept the evidence of Mr Medleg that he was unable to offer the plaintiff work and that this is the reason why the plaintiff ceased working for him. There is no evidence of the plaintiff making attempts to seek work during 2013. Counsel for the defendant put it to me that the plaintiff effectively had a year off, which is understandable for a young man in his position, who had been unable to complete the HSC and who suffered injuries following a motor vehicle accident. Compensation for past economic loss can take this kind of response to a motor vehicle accident into account, having regard to the plaintiff’s age and lack of work history.
	
	
	The real difficulty for the plaintiff is that his attitude towards not only work but his responsibilities generally, both before and after the accident. The plaintiff received a series of letters from the principal and the teachers in all of his subjects over a two-month period, and it is evident from the principal’s letter to the plaintiff’s mother that these letters were simply disregarded by a young man with an irresponsible attitude to school and work. The plaintiff’s evidence that he did not recall those letters, and his attempts to deny their contents, simply reinforce this impression of a teenager wanting to enjoy life rather than study or plan for the future.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that any award for past economic loss should be of modest compass. The plaintiff proposes $44,186 and the defendant proposes $20,000. I consider the defendant’s estimate both reasonable and sensible.
	
	
	As to future economic loss, I accept the medical evidence tendered by the defendant and find that the plaintiff had completely recovered from his injuries; any future impact caused by problems with his left arm would at best be resolved by time off work, analgesics or at most a visit to the general practitioner.
	
	
	Determination of future economic loss for a plaintiff who is in school at the time of the accident is never easy, as there is no past work history as a guide. In Mundy v GIO of NSW (Supreme Court of NSW, Spender AJ, 5 June 1995 at p 3), Spender AJ described such a task as requiring the trial judge “to assess the unassessable”.
	
	
	I cannot, however, accept the submission of the defendant that no allowance should be made. Clearly, some allowance would need to be made for occasional absences from work and for any impact the delayed entry into the workforce (insofar as this accident has contributed to it) may have. Accordingly, a cushion or buffer for future economic loss of the most modest proportions should be provided. Doing the best I can (New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536), I would allow the same amount for future economic loss as that I have allowed for past economic loss, namely the sum of $20,000.
	
	
	Both those figures would be inclusive of superannuation.
	


Past and future out of pockets


	
	Past out of pockets are agreed at $5,000 (see T 111).
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant proposes the same sum for future out of pocket. I consider that is a sensible proposal. This sum was agreed to by Mr Hickey in closing submissions (T 156).
	
	
	The lump sum the plaintiff would be entitled for past and future out of pocket expenses totals $10,000.
	
	
	Any award of damages would have to be reduced proportionate to the figure I have given for contributory negligence.
	


Past and future care


	
	In submissions, the plaintiff abandoned his claim for past domestic care.
	
	
	The plaintiff did not call any family members to give evidence as to tasks performed on his behalf, nor did he give evidence of his intention to pay persons to perform work on his behalf.
	
	
	I accept the defendant’s submission that there is no evidence the plaintiff would pass the threshold for future care.

	According, the damages would be $15,000.
	


Costs


	
	As there will be judgment for the defendant, the defendant should be entitled for an order for costs. I will enter that order, but with a provision for liberty to apply in the event that any application to vary this order is to be made. Any such application must be made within 21 days.
	
	
	I particularly note that an application for costs is made in relation to the circumstances in which after I reserved judgment in these proceedings, counsel for the plaintiff sought to reopen the case for the purpose of challenging a word in the transcript. Counsel for the defendant had to provide written submissions, the proceedings were delayed for a further three months and the parties were unable to agree about how to approach the problem, in circumstances in which the error in question was drawn to the plaintiff’s counsel’s attention as soon as the transcript was available, during the hearing. In the circumstances, I do not accept Mr Hickey’s submissions (5 February 2015) that these costs be costs in the cause. The appropriate order should be that they be the defendant’s costs in the cause. Given the costs order I have proposed in these proceedings, that order would be subsumed in the costs order favouring the defendant in any event.
	


Orders


	
	Judgment for the defendant.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs.
	
	
	Liberty to apply in relation to costs, which liberty is to be exercised within 21 days.

Introduction


	
	On 7 May 2014, Zhaoyun Wang (the offender) pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Newcastle to murdering Shan Wu (the deceased) on 25 February 2013. He was committed for sentence. On arraignment in this Court on 5 December 2014, he adhered to that plea.
	
	
	I received oral and documentary evidence in the proceedings on sentence on 27 March 2015. The culmination of that procedural background is the imposition of sentence today.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without parole. Parliament has prescribed an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years in the circumstances of this case. I have regarded the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as important guideposts in my exercise of the sentencing discretion. The learned Crown Prosecutor did not submit that this was a case that called for the imposition of the maximum penalty.
	
	
	A comprehensive set of agreed facts was tendered in the proceedings on sentence. In truth, there were only two circumscribed areas of dispute between the parties, the first being the precise things said by the deceased moments before the offence, and the second being an aspect of the motivation for the offence. I have approached those disputed facts as follows. Any disputed fact that aggravates the criminality of the matter must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Any fact that sounds in mitigation in favour of the offender must be proven on the balance of probabilities only. It is possible, of course, that some disputed facts will not be able to be determined by me.
	


Facts


	
	The deceased was born in the People’s Republic of China in December 1982. Accordingly, as at the date of her death she was aged 30 years. The offender was born in the same country in June 1982. On the day of the murder, he was also aged 30 years.
	
	
	The deceased and the offender met in late 2011 at premises in Beijing where people would congregate in order to practice their English in a social setting. Both of them were very high achievers and had obtained qualifications from highly regarded universities in China. The offender was working as a corporate lawyer. The deceased was working for an international accounting firm. They formed a romantic relationship, and quite soon after their meeting the deceased moved into the apartment of the offender in Beijing. Later that year she introduced him to her family. Early in 2012, the offender introduced the deceased to his family. Every aspect of their lives was proceeding well.
	
	
	In May of that year, the deceased transferred to the Newcastle office of her employer. Her father accompanied her, and the two of them lived in a rented apartment in that city. The offender remained in Beijing, but he and the deceased stayed in very close contact by way of email and telephone. The intention of the two of them was that the offender would in due course move to Australia, and the couple would build a new life together in this country.
	
	
	The father of the deceased developed cancer, and moved back to China for treatment. She accompanied him, and moved back in with the offender. Things continued to progress well, though there is a suggestion that the deceased had become a little uncertain about sharing her future with the offender. She returned to Australia alone in early January 2013.
	
	
	Whilst he had been separated from the deceased and living alone in Beijing, the offender was arrested in June 2012 in the vicinity of the premises of a sex worker. He was imprisoned for two months in a Chinese jail. As a result, his employment was terminated. He was also deeply ashamed of himself. He admitted what had happened over the telephone to the deceased. She forgave him, and was prepared to continue with the relationship.
	
	
	Separately, shortly after her return to this country in early 2013, the deceased formed an intimate relationship with a younger man, also of Chinese background. Again, she told the offender by telephone of that setback to their relationship. Again, he was prepared to maintain his commitment to the plan that they would build a life together in this country. In the meantime, he had obtained another professional position, but was prepared to forego it and start his career afresh in Australia with the deceased.
	
	
	It was in that rather unsettled context that, on 23 February 2013, the offender left China with the intention of beginning his new life with the deceased. He flew from Beijing to Hong Kong, and then on to Sydney. On arrival the next morning, he was greeted lovingly by the deceased. The two of them travelled by train to Holsworthy, where they enjoyed lunch with the family of the deceased’s uncle. Thereafter, they travelled by train to Newcastle and arrived at the apartment of the deceased. They made love, showered, strolled around the sights of the city, and did some grocery shopping before returning to the apartment.
	
	
	After that, the deceased explained to the offender that she wished to visit the other man to whom she had been close in the absence of the offender. Somewhat surprisingly, the offender, who had just arrived to begin their romantic co-habitation, agreed to that course. The deceased left the apartment and travelled the short distance to visit the other man. After she had been away for some time, the offender sent her a text message asking when she would return, and requesting that she purchase some headache tablets for him.
	
	
	The deceased returned to the apartment at about 9 PM. What precisely occurred after that is a little unclear, at least with regard to the things said between them. Generally, I accept on the balance of probabilities the truth of what the offender said in his recorded interview with police the following day. I do not accept to that standard the further things, above and beyond the contents of that interview, that the offender has claimed the deceased said, both in his discussions with a psychologist and a psychiatrist and also in the witness box. In particular, I am not satisfied that the deceased spoke of the mother of the offender in harshly disparaging terms.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the deceased told the offender that she intended to end her romantic relationship with him, and continue her relationship with the other man. I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, in blunt terms, she drew a number of unflattering comparisons between the offender and that man. I am further satisfied that the intensity of the conversations between the two of them increased throughout the evening and into the early morning.
	
	
	At some stage both the deceased and the offender slept. In the early hours of the morning they were both awake. The conversations resumed and became more intense. At about 3 AM on 25 February 2013, the offender inflicted very great violence upon the deceased. He repeatedly attacked her with a meat cleaver that he obtained from the kitchen of the apartment. The fatal ordeal of the deceased was by no means of short duration; so much is demonstrated by the numerous and severe defensive wounds that she suffered, and the fact that blood was found in more than one room of the apartment. The attack culminated in the offender embedding the meat cleaver in the throat of the deceased with very great force. There can be no doubt but that the offender intended to kill the deceased.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, at that time of those actions, the offender had completely lost self-control, and was in a blind rage. To the extent that his recorded interview with police suggests that he was angered by the lack of “respect” shown to him by the deceased, I accept on the balance of probabilities that he was referring to his state of mind as the discussions became more heated, and not at the time of the infliction of the fatal violence.
	
	
	That loss of self-control is not easy to understand. That is because the offender had never shown himself to be a person prone to violence or even anger in the past; to the contrary, he has been generally shy and quiet throughout his life. Nor is it the case that he has suffered from any severe psychiatric difficulties in the past, although his incarceration and loss of employment in China affected him in ways that I will discuss later.
	
	
	I think that one can only understand that loss of self-control as the product of disappointment and shock at the unexpected termination of the relationship; the belief that it constituted a further humiliation of the offender after his incarceration and shame as a result of the contact with the sex worker; jealousy of the intimate relationship between the deceased and the other man; resentment of the fact that he had put an end to things in China only to be told that there would be no new life for him in this country; a sense of helpless isolation, having arrived in Australia less than 24 hours previously and having no contacts here other than the deceased; and, to a small degree, exhaustion arising from the overnight plane trip and the day spent socialising and sightseeing in Australia.
	
	
	I interpolate to say that it is true that the offender lost control as a result of things said by the deceased. That serves to explain his fatal actions. It does not justify or excuse them to the smallest degree. It hardly needs stating that adult persons in this country are entitled to engage in lawful romantic or intimate relationships with whomever they choose. Persons who may take exception to those relationships are entitled to be disappointed or unhappy or upset. They do not have the slightest entitlement to inflict violence, let alone fatal violence, upon a person whose relationships meet with their disapproval. And I consider that sentences that are imposed on persons who commit murder because of their emotional reaction to the intimate relationships of others must give significant weight to deterrence, both general and specific.
	
	
	Thereafter, the offender showered. I accept on the balance of probabilities that that was done in a state of shock, rather than with any intention to escape punishment for what he had done. He then promptly telephoned the emergency services, confessed his guilt, and waited at the scene for the police to arrive. He was arrested immediately. Later that day he engaged in a recorded interview with police with the assistance of an interpreter. He has been in custody ever since.
	


Assessment of objective seriousness 


	
	This murder was completely unplanned. Were it otherwise, the offender would have taken steps to evade detection before and after the offence. He took none. The weapon was obtained from the kitchen of the home. As I have said, the murder was the result of a complete loss of self-control.
	
	
	To be weighed against those factors is the fact that the offender possessed an undoubted intention to kill. The deceased, a young woman with her whole life ahead of her, was savagely hacked to death in her own home. The murder was completely unjustified. A deadly weapon was used, against which the deceased was defenceless. The fatal ordeal to which she was subjected was terrifying and excruciatingly painful. Even if that ordeal extended for no more than two or three minutes, it must have seemed like hours to her in her suffering.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, this murder must be assessed as being above the middle of the range of seriousness of such matters. Indeed, I regard this murder as a very grave example of the offence.
	


Subjective features


	
	I turn from a discussion of the offence to a discussion of the life and character of the offender.
	
	
	As I have said, the offender pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court. Although there was some delay in the progress of the proceedings after that, I ascribe that to the need for a number of matters to be thoroughly checked, in light of the enormity of the offence to which the offender had pleaded guilty. I allow a discount of 25% for the usefulness of that plea of guilty to the criminal justice system. To the extent that that discount results mathematically in a head sentence and non-parole period that feature a few weeks or months, they will be rounded down, because the law does not concern itself with trifles.
	
	
	Separately, I am amply satisfied that the offender is deeply remorseful for what he has done. Quite apart from his plea of guilty, as I have said, he admitted his guilt in the phone call very shortly after the offence was committed. During the reading of a lengthy and poignant victim impact statement prepared on behalf of the family of the deceased, the offender showed himself to be deeply upset. That stands in contrast to the behaviour of other offenders that I have observed when victim impact statements in homicide matters have been read out. I do not believe that the offender was feigning his reaction at that or any other stage. In the witness box, he stated that he deserves to be “severely punished.” Indeed, in speaking to one of the experts who assessed him, he stated that he deserved the ultimate penalty available to humankind. Even now, more than two years after the offence, he struggles to understand how and why he murdered the woman he loved.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I accept that the offender bitterly regrets his actions that morning, is deeply ashamed of them, and understands the enormity of what he has done.
	
	
	Despite his incarceration for the contact with the sex worker pursuant to the Chinese legal system, I approach the offender as a man of unblemished record and good character before 25 February 2013.
	
	
	The offender grew up in a small town in rural China. His parents were agricultural workers, and his living conditions were very deprived materially. As well as that, from an early age he suffered from profound short-sightedness. That condition limited him physically, including with regard to engagement in sports. It also affected him emotionally, in that he was bullied about it and was embarrassed by it. He was an introverted and bookish child and young man. The fact that the deceased, an attractive and accomplished young woman, took a romantic interest in him surprised and flattered him.
	
	
	As I have explained, the offender was a person of considerable intellectual and professional achievements in China. In a letter that was tendered before me, his sister described him as having been, before this catastrophe, “the pride of the village.”
	
	
	In Australia, the offender has neither family nor friends. Due to the cost of travel from China to Australia, it is very unlikely that any of those who love and support the offender will be able to visit him. He is able to telephone them only infrequently. I accept that his incarceration in this country will be extremely difficult due to that isolation. I also accept the submission of senior counsel for the offender that, in the circumstances of this case, that isolation is not something that arises inherently from the offence in which the offender chose to partake, in contrast to other offenders such as drug couriers. Those isolated conditions of custody over many years sound in mitigation.
	


Expert opinions about the offender 


	
	A forensic psychiatrist who examined the offender recently noted that he is being medicated in custody for depression. He considered that the incarceration of the offender in China had brought on a period of depression that had never truly abated. The psychiatrist was also of the view that the offender could be described as having an “obsessive compulsive and avoidant personality” that could well have led to him avoiding conflict and “bottling things up”. A psychologist concurred in the opinion that the offender is currently depressed, and also thought that the offender had been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder since his incarceration in China.
	


The future


	
	The offender is not burdened by problems with alcohol or prohibited drugs. He is intelligent and hardworking. I infer that he will be able to spend his time in custody in the years ahead quietly and constructively. It is to be hoped that he will seek to understand, with the benefit of psychological or psychiatric therapy, how this offence came to be committed. It is impossible to predict how his life will unfold once he is released, but one can safely infer that his career as a lawyer has been destroyed. There must be an inevitable caution about how the offender may react in the future to a soured romantic relationship. Nevertheless, I assess his prospects of rehabilitation as being very good.
	


Various matters


	
	I turn to deal briefly with a number of separate aspects of my task.
	
	
	First, each party agreed that my sentence should be backdated to the date of arrest; namely, 25 February 2013.
	
	
	Secondly, I do not propose mechanistically to link the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account to the various parts of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These remarks on sentence fulfil that role. I have referred myself to the section, and taken care to avoid double counting.
	
	
	Thirdly, the parties provided me with a number of judgments of this Court in broadly similar matters. That was of assistance; nevertheless, every matter must turn on its own facts.
	
	
	Fourthly, senior counsel for the offender submitted that it would be appropriate for me to find special circumstances whereby the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period could be adjusted. He relied upon a number of subjective matters, all of which I have sought to summarise above, and all of which I have taken into account in mitigation in my determination of the appropriate head sentence. Whilst that submission of defence counsel was not without force, I consider that the lengthy period on parole that will inevitably be imposed sufficiently provides for the rehabilitation of the offender. For those reasons, I do not propose to vary the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	Fifthly, in accordance with authority, I have put from my mind any prospect of the offender being deported upon his release from custody in Australia.
	
	
	Finally, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that it is possible that he could be detained even after the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is considered that he remains a danger to the community.
	


Victim impact statement 


	
	As I have said, a victim impact statement was prepared on behalf of the family of the deceased, and read by a member of her extended family. It was agreed between the two members of the Inner Bar who appeared in the matter (each of whom is highly experienced in criminal law) that, because of the transitional provision attaching to s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the recent amendments to that section have no application. In accordance with that joint position, I have approached the following matters, which are derived from the victim impact statement, in accordance with principles that had until recently stood for many years: see R v  Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
	
	
	The deceased was the apple of her parents’ eye. They were justifiably proud of her achievements at school, at university, and at work. That was especially the case since she herself grew up in difficult circumstances in the metropolis of Beijing. The immense pain inflicted upon them has been made worse by knowing that their daughter met a violent death thousands of kilometres from her family and her home. Her grandmother, who also loved the deceased very deeply, has not been told of her murder, because it is felt that it would simply be too much for her to bear. The expectation of her parents that the deceased would love and support them in their old age has been dashed. She was their only child.
	
	
	On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my sincere condolences to the family of Ms Shan Wu on their loss, and the deep pain that it has caused. It is possible that the resolution of the matter today will provide a measure of relief to those who are grieving. But I accept that the suffering of many will be unrelenting.
	


Imposition of sentence 


	
	Zhaoyun Wang, you are convicted of the offence of murder.
	
	
	I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years to date from 25 February 2013. That will be followed by a parole period of five years. The earliest possible date for your release to parole is 24 February 2028.
	
	
	To express my sentence another way, the offender is sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 20 years to date from 25 February 2013, with a non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	I indicate that, but for the discount for the plea of guilty of the offender, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 27 years.

2766408,R v MIKA [2015] NSWDC 321,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Just stand up Mr Mika. My practice is to tell people in advance what sentence is to be imposed. In your case I propose to impose a sentence of six years imprisonment. I propose to backdate that sentence to 25 September 2013 and I propose to fix a non-parole period of three years. You will be eligible for release to parole on 24 September 2016 on my calculation. So you will have a further 18 months to serve in custody before you are eligible for parole. Just take a seat and I will give my reasons.
	
	
	The prisoner Junior Mika today appears for sentence in relation to an offence in respect of which he was found guilty by a jury on, the date on the indictment being 25 July 2014. The prisoner was arraigned before a jury panel in respect of two charges. Count 1, the count for which he now is for sentence after a verdict of guilty by the guilty was a count alleging that he at Potts Point did rob David Schmikli of certain property namely an amount of money and personal items the property of that person and immediately before the robbery intentionally or recklessly inflicted grievous bodily harm upon that person. This is an offence contrary to s 95(1) Crimes Act 1900 it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	There was a further charge brought against the prisoner at the trial that he on the same date at the same place did assault Stephen Riley who was a witness in the case. The prisoner was acquitted of that charge. There is no inconsistency between the two verdicts of the jury bearing in mind the different issues for consideration by the jury.
	
	
	The facts in the matter are in relation to the assault that whilst it was properly charged, it was a live issue for the jury as to whether the prisoner had in fact assaulted Mr Riley by words and gestures or whether there was some conditional aspect of the conduct that fell short of what is required to be proven to establish the crime of assault.
	
	
	The relevant events with which I am concerned occurred on 25 August 2013 in the latter part of the evening around about five to eleven or thereabouts, outside the Wayside Chapel or part of the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross/Potts Point. The victim was aged 63. The prisoner, as I understand it at the relevant time was aged 24 years, he being born on 6 March 1989. As I understand it the two men were unknown to each other. The victim had come to the outside of the Wayside Chapel in effect to go to sleep. He was a homeless man like the prisoner and Mr Riley and like the prisoner the victim was living rough on the streets of Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo. He had arranged his bedding in an area that was shown in photographic evidence available to the jury and he was in effect asleep, seeking shelter from the elements. When the prisoner came upon him and for absolutely no reason that can be explained, other than arising from the effect of alcohol upon the prisoner’s feelings of anger, not specifically directed against the victim because of who he was, the prisoner set about assaulting the victim by stomping upon the victim with his feet.
	
	
	There was evidence that the prisoner was seen to stomp or kick the victim in the head at least five times in the course of what was, by nature of the injuries caused, a savage beating indeed. The victim’s primary injuries were suffered to his head and face and in the circumstances of the physical proportions of the prisoner which I will come to in a moment and the prone state of the victim, it is fortunate for the victim the injuries, severe as they were, were not more serious and perhaps more permanent in their effect.
	
	
	The other alleged victim Stephen Riley, who was aged about 59, was also sleeping in this area and he was awoken by the prisoner kicking or stomping on the victim. When he intervened to stop this beating he was told by the prisoner that he had better run away or go because “he would be next”. This was the conduct that constituted the assault in conjunction with any relevant gestures.
	
	
	To Mr Riley’s credit, he went to the Kings Cross police station as I would understand it to report the fact that the victim was being assaulted. He should be commended for this action. He had no access to a mobile phone and I accept that there was little that he could do to intervene. It is to be noted in relation to this matter that the prisoner, being aged 24 years at the time was considerably younger obviously and from physical observation of all men, stronger and fitter than Mr Riley and the victim.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial revealed that the prisoner weighed approximately 110 kilograms. It is to be fairly pointed out in assessing the objective facts that the prisoner was wearing thongs, not wearing shoes or boots, and thus the blows to the head of the victim were occasioned by him, effectively with bare feet. The force of the assault was not aggravated by the use of heavy boots or the like.
	
	
	The victim himself remembered four or five kicks to the head before he lost consciousness for a period of time. The property that was taken from him by the prisoner was modest. It seems to me on the facts that robbery was not the primary motive of the prisoner. To my mind that would aggravate the objective seriousness of this offending, serious though it is. The facts reveal that the prisoner took from the victim at some point, the evidence is a little confused on this matter, about twenty odd dollars, some tobacco and a cigarette lighter. These items ultimately were returned to the victim by police at the hospital. I should point out of course it would seem to me that apart from his clothes and the modest bedding that he had, this would have been all the property the victim possessed. But then again the prisoner was no better off it would seem.
	
	
	If the prisoner’s condition was such for him to fully comprehend what he was doing I would be prepared to conclude that the taking of the property was more an act of need than greed, if it could be reasonable to categorise conduct of this type in that way.
	
	
	It certainly is the case that the taking of the property was opportunistic and the objective evidence of things the prisoner said directed towards the victim as he stomped upon him appeared to be more concerned with some totally unfocussed anger or belligerence than the need to take property.
	
	
	When the prisoner was interviewed by police subsequently he gave an account which was of course his defence, if I could use that expression, at the trial, as he did not give evidence. He was disjointed in his explanation of himself. He made a number of incoherent and rather disconnected observations. He seemed to be more concerned with the conduct of the police towards him subsequently in their endeavour to placate him and arrest him, than addressing the substance of the allegations against him. I discussed this matter with learned counsel for the prisoner in the course of her helpful submissions and I initially suggested that he gave a persona of belligerence towards the police. There was, it must be fairly said, an element of anger in the way in which he presented himself and his account.
	
	
	There was also to be fairly said, as I observed his presentation, some degree of affect upon the prisoner of alcohol or perhaps other substances. He did have the presence of mind, however, to give a false account of trying to help the victim and a false account of how he came into possession of the property found on him by the police which was returned to the victim. He denied kicking the victim in the head or the face and continued an aggressive attitude towards the police. There was absolutely no indication of remorse or regret in his account given to the police. Although it must be fairly said that some of the things he said in the context of outright denials of responsibility reflected some degree of incoherency, he was not so incoherent or disordered that he was unable to give, what on face value at least, was an exculpatory account. He certainly reflected his awareness of the character of the police investigation, given the explanations that he provided.
	
	
	The victim suffered comminuted and depressed fractures of the nasal bones, displaced fracture of the right orbital rim, that is the eye socket, facial lacerations and abrasions and facial swelling. Remarkably he was in his evidence and it seems in his presentation at the hospital, notwithstanding a very graphic photograph which showed considerable blood upon his face, to be somewhat taciturn about his injuries. I accept that clearly it has been established, as the jury accepted, that actual bodily harm was suffered by him. Remarkably apparently he was released from hospital the day after his admission. What the permanent effect upon him of his injuries is I cannot say. There have been attempts to obtain a victim impact statement but the victim’s transient lifestyle has not aided those inquiries.
	
	
	The prisoner’s guilt in relation to the matter was clearly established. There was of course a body of, what I would call, crime scene evidence material, photographs of the prisoner and the like that linked him to the attack upon the victim. He had blood upon his feet consistent with what was alleged against him. There was an eye witness who saw relevant events and to his credit rang triple-0 to contact the police.
	
	
	I must say I have not had any discourse with the prisoner beyond having asked him to go back into custody or sit down or whatever. But I will observe that throughout the trial he maintained what could be called a very, very low profile. He sat through the proceedings at trial and on this day on sentence with his head bowed. I am prepared to accept that at least by his demeanour there appears to be some evidence of regret or contrition for his conduct. That has not been expressed in any way that could enable the court to conclude on balance that it exists as a mitigating factor. But I observe the prisoner’s conduct throughout the trial as being considerably different from the belligerent and aggressive attitude he exhibited towards police when they first arrested him and during the course of the interview that he gave the police.
	
	
	The prisoner was on bail in relation to offences of violence when he committed the offence with which I am concerned. He was charged in relation to what I understand to be three separate offences on 26 July 2013. One was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he received a sentence of one month imprisonment, commencing on the date the matter was disposed of at the Local Court, that is 21 March 2014.
	
	
	In respect of another charge of assault occasion actual bodily harm and a charge of reckless wounding, charged on or about the same date as the earlier matter that I referred to and dealt with at the same time as that matter on 21 March 2014 for some incredible reason which defies any logical or common sense whatsoever, bearing in mind the prisoner was awaiting trial in relation to this matter that I am concerned with bail refused, he was granted a sentence of nine months imprisonment which was suspended pursuant to s 12 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do not have the facts in relation to those matters. Learned counsel for the prisoner and the learned Crown Prosecutor have referred to their understanding of the facts.
	
	
	What I do understand from what I have been told is that the facts of those obviously serious matters of violence were of a different character than the offence with which I am concerned. I take it from what has been said and from what occurred at the Local Court that the fact that those matters were ultimately dealt with in the Local Court in the manner in which they were might provide some indication that that offending is different less serious than the matter that I am now dealing with.
	
	
	In respect of the prisoner’s criminal history, he was charged on 15 December 2006 and dealt with a year later at the Bidura Children’s Court in relation to a number of offences for which he was placed on a bond or some form of Juvenile Justice probation. The Crown points out there was a break in his criminality then for another further two and a half years from the time, or two and a quarter years from the time of appearing at court, when he appeared at the Burwood Local Court in 2010 for intimidating a police officer and refusing to comply with the relevant directions for which he was modestly fined.
	
	
	Then there was a further break in his offending to the time when he was charged in July 2013 with those three offences I have earlier identified. Thus he was on bail when he committed the current matter. Being a matter where the offence was committed while subject to conditional liberty is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I note the conditional liberty related to offences of violence which is a relevant consideration. I also appreciate that there are different degrees of conditional liberty. One might ordinarily, although there is not general rule to be applied, regard offences committed whilst on parole, particularly offences of like nature, as being a more serious breach of conditional liberty than a breach of bail. But I also bear in mind of course that the prisoner was on bail for offences that he ultimately admitted his guilt to which were offences of violence.
	
	
	When arrested in relation to the current matter on 25 August 2013 he remained in custody, bail refused. Reference was made in the course of submissions as to how I should approach the prior custody. Certainly I will give him full credit for all the time in custody directly related to the current matter. Given the modest sentence imposed at the Local Court of one month it seems to me ultimately that I should commence the sentence I impose one month after the commencement of the time the prisoner came into custody in relation to the current matter, that is the sentence will commence on 25 September 2013.
	
	
	If the prisoner, whilst in custody in relation to this matter, had been sentenced to, for example, six months or eight months, or 12 months imprisonment for the other offence, not that I am suggesting that that would have been an appropriate term, I would have fixed this sentence as not wholly accumulative upon that period. But a period of one month is so modest that no injustice is done to the prisoner in the circumstance of the matter. Particularly bearing in mind the absurd orders of the Magistrate in 2014 meant that the prisoner suffered no penalty whatsoever in relation to other offending in respect of which a judicial officer felt that the appropriate term of imprisonment was nine months. One month’s recognition of the other sentence is not a matter that unjustly affects the prisoner.
	
	
	I have a report from a psychologist who has assessed the prisoner and also had regard to a further or earlier report of Dr Peter Ashkar who prepared a report in relation to the prisoner on 10 February 2014. When the verdict of the jury was returned, bearing in mind the prisoner gave no evidence and noting his demeanour throughout the proceedings I raised the issue directly with counsel for the prisoner as to whether some issue of mental illness or some other matter arose in the case. No issue of mental illness arises from the assessment of the prisoner by Dr Ashkar or by Dr Ilana Hepner whose report of 13 April 2015 was, in effect, the evidence adduced on behalf of the prisoner.
	
	
	There is some inconsistency between some of the history obtained by Dr Ashkar and some of the history obtained by Dr Hepner, but ultimately it is not a matter of great significance. The prisoner told Dr Hepner that he had been violently attacked by his father when he was 15 years of age. His father wielding a baseball bat. The history that he gave to Dr Hepner was that he denied ever being taken to hospital because of his father’s actions, denied ever losing consciousness at the hands of his father etcetera. Although he did give a history of being taken to St George Hospital in 2005 after being struck by a motor vehicle and apparently losing consciousness and suffering some form of leg injury.
	
	
	As it turns out psychological testing by Dr Hepner does not reveal, as I would understand it, clear evidence of frontal lobe or other brain injury that is an acquired cerebral injury. It seems in the absence of any MRI scan results that whatever violence the prisoner may have suffered growing up at the hands of his father has not caused any permanent disability.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar’s assessment of the prisoner involved some psychometric testing and he concluded that the full scale intelligence quotient of the prisoner placed him in the “borderline impaired range”, with various results across a number of levels of measure, although there was some variation in the results, largely because of educational reasons. “The prisoner also gave some indication of moderate levels of stress, anxiety and depression”.
	
	
	The prisoner was recorded by Dr Ashkar as saying the he received a TER, a former measure of performance of the Higher School Certificate, of 92. The prisoner in his discussion with Dr Hepner at a later time said that his TER was in fact 65. Again that is an inconsistency of no great moment. It may reflect some poor memory on the part of the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner when interviewed by Dr Hepner gave a coherent account, he was friendly and cooperative and there was no obvious difficulty in the prisoner relating to the psychologist. Her report sets out some history which the Crown has permitted to be led without the prisoner being called. It is rather unremarkable if I say so. The prisoner is of Samoan background. He came to Australia when he was about ten. His parents separated in 2009, his father is in a new relationship, his mother has moved to New Zealand. He has had no contact with his parents or his sister since 2010.
	
	
	He had an unfortunate upbringing in the sense that he was the subject of experiences of domestic violence. His father was a person who drank excessively. It is always surprising I must say to have people come before one with histories of alcohol and drug abuse and histories of violence when they themselves have experienced alcoholism and drug abuse by parents and suffered violence and seen violence perpetrated by parents. But it is the fact that those experiences rather than deterring people from particular behaviours have a counter-indicative effect and it may be that he is inured to violence and is no stranger to it in its various forms.
	
	
	I accept from the history that up until 2008 he was reasonably well occupied with employment. But it must be fairly said that that is five years before he came into custody in relation to the current matter at the age of 24 and suggests that he was only involved in employment from the time he left school until the age of 19. He was in a relationship from 2008 but that relationship came to an end before he committed the current crime. That separation has had a big effect upon him. He was an abuser of alcohol on his own admission. He drank very heavily after his fiancé and he separated in March 2013. He was not an illicit drug user as a matter of course.
	
	
	The testing of Dr Hepner ultimately concluded some inconsistencies. His verbal comprehension skills on the testing she undertook, which was to all intents and purposes standard and appropriate testing, reflected extremely low range results. His vocabulary, knowledge and his social reasoning skills were rated in the ‘borderline impaired’ range. In the non-verbal domain, that is in perceptual reasoning skills, his rating was low/average and it was concluded by the psychologist that there was a significant discrepancy between his performance on these various indices. The magnitude of the discrepancy was not considered abnormal and it was thought that his full scale IQ was most probably in the borderline impaired range. He scored well in relation to other areas of skill both with regard to attention and processing of information and the speed of processing. He was in the 34th percentile relative to persons of similar age. His memory placed him in the 55th percentile relative to persons of similar age.
	
	
	So even though his intellectual functioning might be on a global perspective be seen as borderline, there were other aspects of his functioning that were average or above average, certainly not impaired. His frontal executive function assessment revealed no deficits in areas of complex problem solving. In his ability to utilise feedback to adapt his performance in response to changing task demands and non-verbal reasoning skills he rated within the low/average or average range on these tasks. His ability to give solutions to common social issues, known as “social reasoning” was rated in the ‘borderline impaired’ range. Validity checks were undertaken and the psychologist was satisfied of the validity of the results. She concluded that whilst he was a man of borderline impaired intellectual functioning, as I have pointed out, he did better than expected in relation to other testing concerned with other skills not necessarily reflecting a level of intellect.
	
	
	He had no current symptomology of psychological distress. It was said in the context of the histories that he had given about injuries that, whilst there were discrepancies in his histories there was not much else the doctor could say about the presence of any cerebral acquired injury. She noted the MRI scan which was scheduled for 23 March, in fact that was one of the reasons the case was earlier adjourned, could not be undertaken because of feelings of claustrophobia by the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner has a history of binge drinking and it would seem that his borderline intellectual functioning was longstanding. It was said in the report that as such there does not appear to be a history of concurrent deficits and adaptive function/every day level of function, outside the context of heavy alcohol use or depressed moods which indicates that Mr Mika would not meet criteria for an intellectual disability.
	
	
	She reflected upon his history of heavy intoxication and she said his cognitive function or profile at the time of seeing her would have been about the same at the time of the offence. Although there may have been a worsening in his attention or function since that time and his ability to process information and perform frontal executive functions, due to the effects of his depression and heavy alcohol use, but she cannot say to what extent.
	
	
	She said in view of his strengths and areas of memory, non-verbal intellectual function and frontal executive functions from a cognitive perspective, Mr Mika is considered to have good prospects of rehabilitation. I understand that expression to mean that there is no cognitive reason for him not to have good prospects of rehabilitation. But these prospects of rehabilitation need to be assessed by a reference to a range of other considerations. His criminal history, his future, domestic circumstance, his past performance in the community and the like.
	
	
	The prospects of rehabilitation of the prisoner are very much dependent upon what environment the prisoner returns to when released from custody. It is that aspect of the matter, along with the need for the prisoner to receive professional guidance in relation to alcohol use and to receive assistance to adjust to community living, that has persuaded me that there are ‘special circumstances’ that require an extended period of supervision and thus a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is made. I note in this regard that the recommendations of the psychologist suggest a treatment plan involving psychological evaluation and management, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, direction as to suitable accommodation and vocational advice and also receive regular assistance from a general practitioner in respect of the management of his overall level of health. He should also receive counselling in custody, life-skills, educational and vocational training, as well as undertaking programs such as the Getting SMART program.
	
	
	In respect of the issues that I am required to address under s 21A Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I believe that an aggravating factor of the offence with which I am concerned is that the victim was vulnerable. The victim was alone at night. There was another homeless man nearby but, most importantly, by reason of his age and particularly the fact that he was asleep when he was attacked he had no means whatsoever of defending himself. There was really no rhyme or reason for the prisoner’s attack. In fairness to the prisoner it is not that there is any evidence that he is a psychopath, or that he takes delight in inflicting pain upon other people or that had a particular grudge against the victim. It is clear that he was disinhibited by alcohol. I bear that in mind of course that being intoxicated can be no mitigation for acts of violence but it does explain his circumstances.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors, I accept that the offence was not a planned criminal activity. Whilst the prisoner’s criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency, nor was he a person of good character, I am prepared to accept that with some professional assistance he is unlikely to reoffend and in the context of the helpful submissions of the Crown and counsel for the prisoner, with the caveat or qualification that I have expressed, I believe he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	There are no other “mitigating factors”. I have noted an air of contrition and remorse of the prisoner, but as I have said I could not without the aid of further evidence or other material conclude simply on the basis of what the prisoner has said to the psychologist that the prisoner has demonstrated remorse required to be established under s 21A(3)(i) upon balance.
	
	
	The sentencing of the prisoner in relation to an offence of robbery does require at least some regard to the much earlier guideline decision of Henry from 1998/99 given in respect of the offence of armed robbery. This is not armed robbery of course but it is an offence that carries the same maximum penalty. I bear in mind of course that an armed robbery is a very different ‘kettle of fish’, if I may use that expression, from the offence with which I am concerned. An armed robbery of the character described in the guideline judgement is one that has the connotation of some pre-planning, to conduct a robbery armed with a weapon, an offensive weapon, at a particular location. I have earlier indicated the prisoner to my mind did not have a preconceived plan to rob anybody, but took advantage of his defenceless victim to take his property from him.
	
	
	I also bear in mind when I have regard for example to the criteria or indicia that was discussed by Spigelman CJ at [162] and take into account of course the guideline itself set out in the judgment at [165]. I have also had regard to the common aggravating factors that were identified in [170]. This offence that I am concerned with has elements of violence and harm that clearly very significant factors to be taken into account by reference to whatever assistance the guideline might provide in a case such as this, being so different from the ‘run of the mill’ armed robbery to which the learned Chief Justice referred. I am fully aware of what the learned Chief Justice said in that judgment about the relevance of the observations of Mahoney ACJ in the case of Lattouf that sentencing is an individualised exercise. One is required to the best of one’s ability to provide justice in the individual case. I accept ultimately, as has been described in subsequent cases to that guideline and other guideline judgments, that guideline judgments if they be relevant in any way as guideposts to an appropriate sentence are guidelines not ‘tramlines’, as has been said.
	
	
	When one reflects upon this category of offending, given the character of the injuries suffered by the victim and his vulnerability, it is a serious case of its type objectively more serious than the ‘typical’ armed robbery discussed in Henry. That having been said, of course, one can conjure up a more serious case involving similar injuries. People who deliberately go out and prey on homeless people would be subject to full extraction of retribution and the full application of considerations of general deterrence. In that regard I have obviously taken into account the ‘purposes of sentencing’ pursuant to s 3A of the Act.
	
	
	General deterrence and personal deterrence have their role to play in this sentencing exercise. Denouncing the prisoner’s conduct, making him accountable for his actions are relevant matters to consider, as well as ensuring adequate punishment and promoting the rehabilitation of the prisoner. At this point I could not conclude that the community needs protection from the prisoner. I would hope that the experience of being in custody for this period of time, the longest he has been in custody I hasten to say up until this time, it this matter might have a salutary effect or a moderating effect upon his conduct. But the truth of the matter is if the prisoner goes back to the streets of Kings Cross and drinks alcohol to excess, given his conduct on this particular occasion, it is a real possibility that he could behave similarly again. Thus, I emphasise the need for him to have an extended period of supervision to assist him in a range of ways to avoid coming back into this environment.
	
	
	This brings me to the matter that was discussed as to the relevance of the findings of the psychologist. Ultimately, as I understood the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, the assessment of the psychologist, with its mixed messages I hasten to say, was a matter that I could take into account in respect of the weight to be given to general deterrence. It is not clear that there is necessarily a causal connection between the prisoner’s intellectual functioning and his conduct on this occasion. It seems to me with respect, taking everything into account the psychologist has written, intellectual functioning plays little role in explaining the prisoner’s conduct. His intoxication and perhaps his anger at the world may provide more eloquent reasons for him behaving the way he did to a complete stranger.
	
	
	Making that observation the Crown, I believe, very fairly conceded that even though general deterrence was still a relevant matter, slightly less weight might be placed upon it in the context of what he described as the decisions of for example Grove J in Scognamiglio, and decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Israil, the 2010 decision of DPP (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 and the like. The latter was a matter where a full bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence imposed upon an importer of a commercial quantity of cocaine. The case raised constitutional issues, but in that judgment, particular at [177]-[178], the then learned Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice McClellan, discussed his findings from the principles he examined concerning the sentencing of an offender suffering from a mental illness, an intellectual handicap or other mental problems. He observed that a person’s mental health where it contributes to the offence in a material way may reduce and offender’s moral culpability. I cannot find the necessary causal connection to reduce the prisoner’s moral culpability for his offending in this matter.
	
	
	However he also said that the existence of such a condition may mean that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. These are matters of degree of course. I have sentenced highly intellectually disabled children 17 or 18 committing very serious offences, where I have imposed sentences that objectively might be regarded as wholly inadequate. I make the observation that those people were so intellectually disabled that no reasonable court of justice could commit them to a term of imprisonment. This is not such that case. I accept the submission of the learned Crown Prosecutor that what is found by the psychologist with its mixed messages has some role to play in ameliorating to some small extent the general deterrence aspect.
	
	
	Whether the custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on the prisoner is difficult to say. He is a formidable man physically.  I do not believe he is at risk in custody as some people with intellectual impairment may be and I have no evidence that he is under any particular protective conditions.
	
	
	The circumstances of the prisoner do not reduce or illuminate the significance of personal deterrence, but as I earlier pointed out they do not require greater emphasis upon personal deterrence in the way discussed by learned Chief Justice Gleeson in the decision of Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71.
	
	
	Of course McClellan CJ at CL pointed out that mental health problems, as he describes them, of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may never the less be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence and I have taken that matter into account.
	
	
	The determination of the appropriate term of imprisonment involves many matters. A measure of the seriousness of the matter in context of the maximum penalty, the objective facts and the relevant mitigating factors and of course in that exercise one is required to make two judgments, the appropriate sentence and the fixing of an appropriate non-parole period. It is worthy of note that time and time again the Court of Criminal Appeal has said that the appropriate non-parole period should not be so inadequate as to not give proper consideration to other matters that are also relevant to the fixing of the appropriate sentence, including the objective seriousness of the offending and the need to give weight to relevant purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	It seems to me that the seriousness of this offence is such that I could not consider a non-parole period that would permit the immediate release of the prisoner but I believe that fixing a sentence that would permit his release to parole in 18 months time will assist in the promotion of his rehabilitation.
	
	
	Thank you Mr Mika, would you mind standing up.
	
	
	In respect of the offence that you are found guilty of by a jury, that is count 1 on the indictment, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years by way of non-parole period, that term of imprisonment will commence on 25 September 2013 and will expire on 24 September 2016. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of three years which will expire on 24 September 2019.
	
	
	You can sit down sir thank you very much.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole on 24 September 2016 but whether you are released to parole on that date will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	Now anything else Mr Crown. Thank you Mr Mika can you just go with the officers now. I’ll just sign the orders now if you’ll just bear with me. Thank you Mr Crown thank you mam, I’ll adjourn the court.

		14 January 2016",2015-04-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766423,NSW Police Force v Forster [2015] NSWLC 3,"​JUDGMENT​

Background


	
	Charlie Maxwell Forster (""Forster""), Jack Hayes (""Hayes""), Eli Morris (""Morris"") and Damien Case (""Case"") share a number of things in common. One of them is that they are all well known to each other. The other is that each of them has been convicted of an indictable offence.
	
	
	At around 9.30 am on Friday, 27 April 2012, Forster and Hayes were observed by Police speaking to each other near the front of the Inverell Motel in Otho Street, Inverell. When approached by police officers, Forster said “We’re just hangin’ out”. Both were warned and each then moved off in separate directions.
	
	
	About 20 minutes later the same police officers who had spoken to both men observed Forster speaking with Morris outside Complete Angler in Byron Street, Inverell. Each were given a warning and told to move on; which they did in separate directions.
	
	
	In the early hours of Saturday, 28 April 2012, Forster along with Hayes, Morris and Case were observed by Police walking along Byron Street, Inverell. Police approached the group who by this time were outside the Tattersalls Hotel in Inverell. Forster, Hayes and Case were each warned by the police officers present.
	
	
	At midday on Tuesday, 22 May 2012, Forster and Case were observed by Police to be engaged in conversation outside the Imperial Hotel and then moved on in different directions.  They were observed by Police to re-engage with each other shortly after and continue talking together. When the Police vehicle pulled up outside the Hotel, Forster and Case then remonstrated with Police about being warned.
	
	
	Forster is charged with habitually consorting with convicted offenders after warning contrary to s 93X of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The evidence for the prosecution was by way of an agreed tender of signed statements from Sergeant Shane Gillespie, Constables Mitchell Christie, Mitchell Milne, Callum McArthur, Rosie Spenser, Matthew Harris and Angelica De Filippis. None of the authors of those statements were required to give evidence or to be cross-examined. Forster did not give evidence. I draw no adverse inference from this fact.
	
	
	This matter has a somewhat lengthy history and it is not necessary to examine that to any significant degree other than to say that Forster entered a guilty plea when the matter first came before the Local Court at Inverell and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The matter then proceeded to the District Court after which Forster successfully applied to traverse the plea. In separate proceedings brought by Forster in the Supreme Court and later transferred to the High Court, the validity of s 93X was challenged and the judgment in those proceedings provides a useful analysis of the history of this area of the law and of its development in Australia, particularly in New South Wales: Tajjour v State of New South Wales; Hawthorne v State of New South Wales; Forster v State of New South Wales [2014] HCA 35; 88 ALJR 860. The challenge to the validity of the section was unsuccessful. 
	
	
	In these proceedings it is of course the prosecution which bears the onus of proving the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Forster is not required to prove anything.
	
	
	The following issues arise for determination:
	



	
	Issue 1: Is there a difference between consort and a chance encounter?
	
	
	Issue 2: If so, was Forster’s encounter with Hayes at 9.30 am on Friday, 27 April 2012, at Inverell a chance encounter or consorting?
	
	
	Issue 3: Was Forster’s encounter with Morris at 9.50 am on Friday, 27 April 2012, outside the Complete Angler in Inverell a chance encounter or consorting?
	
	
	Issue 4: Was Forster’s encounter with Hayes, Morris and Case outside the Tattersalls Hotel in Inverell in the early hours of Saturday, 28 April 2012, a chance encounter or consorting?
	
	
	Issue 5: Was Forster’s encounter with Case at midday outside the Imperial Hotel in Inverell on Tuesday, 22 May 2012, a chance encounter or consorting?
	


Issue 1: Is there a difference between consort and a chance encounter?


	
	Section 93X of the Crimes Act  provides:
	


""93X   Consorting

(1) A person who:

(a) habitually consorts with convicted offenders, and

(b) consorts with those convicted offenders after having been given an official warning in relation to each of those convicted offenders,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 3 years, or a fine of 150 penalty units, or both.

(2) A person does not habitually consort with convicted offenders unless:

(a) the person consorts with at least 2 convicted offenders (whether on the same or separate occasions), and

(b) the person consorts with each convicted offender on at least 2 occasions.

(3) An official warning is a warning given by a police officer (orally or in writing) that:

(a) a convicted offender is a convicted offender, and

(b) consorting with a convicted offender is an offence.""


	
	Section 93X of the Crimes Act, like its predecessor s 546A, carried forward the concept of “habitual consorting” from the earlier offences contained within the Summary Offences Act 1970 (NSW) and the earlier Vagrancy Act 1902 (NSW) which preceded it. The term “habitually consorts” as it was used in the offence provisions of the various States required proof of more than one occasion of association between a defendant and reputed criminals. The word “habitually” required that such consorting be more than occasionally and consorting for an innocent purpose was within the ambit of the offence.
	
	
	As was observed by Richards J in Gabriel v Lenthall [1930] SAStRp 62; SASR 318 at 327: 
	


“The offence is not being with thieves on occasions when it may be expected that they are about their nefarious occupation, but simply habitually consorting with them; it is not companionship in thieving, but with thieves.”


	
	It is clear that the purpose of any encounter by persons to whom the section is directed is irrelevant for the purposes of the offence. It is not for the Crown to prove that the defendant had consorted for an unlawful or criminal purpose: Johanson v Dixon [1979] HCA 23; 143 CLR 376. In that decision Mason J explained at 383 the word “consorts” in this context to mean:
	


“...'associates’ or ‘keeps company’ and it denotes some seeking or acceptance of the association on the part of the defendant…Nor does the word ‘consorts’ necessarily imply that the association is one which has or needs to have a particular purpose. What is prescribed is habitual association with persons of the…particular classes. Mere association with those persons, which is not habitual, for a criminal or unlawful purpose, is not proscribed.”


	
	What was said in that case informs the construction of the term as it is used in s 93X of the Crimes Act. The term ""convicted offender"" is defined in s 93W to mean:
	


 ""...a person who has been convicted of an indictable offence.""

The term ""consort"" is defined in s 93W to mean:

""...consort in person or by any other means, including by electronic or other form of communication.""

That definition assumes a received meaning for the verb ""consort"", which may be taken to have been based upon the pre-existing judicial interpretation.


	
	As appears from the judicial interpretation of the consorting laws of the Australian States, innocent purpose was never a defence against a charge of habitual consorting. Section 93Y  of the Crimes Act specifies a number of ""innocent purpose"" defences to a charge under s 93X and this represents a significant shift in the law in NSW. Section 93Y provides:
	


""93Y   Defence

The following forms of consorting are to be disregarded for the purposes of section 93X if the defendant satisfies the court that the consorting was reasonable in the circumstances:

(a) consorting with family members,

(b) consorting that occurs in the course of lawful employment or the lawful operation of a business,

(c) consorting that occurs in the course of training or education,

(d) consorting that occurs in the course of the provision of a health service,

(e) consorting that occurs in the course of the provision of legal advice,

(f) consorting that occurs in lawful custody or in the course of complying with a court order.""

Those defences are predicated on the basis that meeting in the course of any of the listed activities could constitute consorting. None of those defences apply to the present case.


	
	A person does not commit the offence of habitual consorting with convicted offenders, contrary to s 93X of the Crimes Act, unless he or she consorts with them after being warned by a police officer, orally or in writing, that they are convicted offenders and that consorting with them is an offence. That requirement did not appear in the repealed legislation.
	
	
	It appears to be common ground that the legitimate object or end of s 93X of the Crimes Act is to prevent or impede criminal conduct by deterring non-criminals from consorting in a criminal milieu and deterring criminals from establishing or building up a criminal network.
	
	
	Section 93W of the Crimes Act provides that ""consort means consort in person or by any other means, including by electronic or other form of communication"". The forms of consorting set out in s 93Y are to be disregarded ""if the defendant satisfies the court that the consorting was reasonable in the circumstances"". Both s 93W and s 93Y depend upon giving meaning to the idea of ""consort"". Neither of those sections sheds much light upon that meaning. 
	
	
	The fact that the legislation prescribes a minimum level of association necessary for the offence under s 93X of the Crimes Act does not exclude recourse to the meaning of ""habitually consort"" as articulated by the previous decisions to which I have referred in order to identify what further may be required.
	
	
	In the earlier High Court proceedings in which Forster was a plaintiff, it was submitted by an intervening party that ""consort"" should be given the meaning described by Mason J in Johanson v Dixon (supra) to which I have referred. That meaning has two relevant elements; firstly, an element of associating or keeping company and secondly, there must be ""some seeking or acceptance of the association on the part of the defendant"". Forster did not put forward any alternative meaning. Rather, he submitted that s 93X of the Crimes Act would have a very wide application, not least because of s 93W and its provision for consorting ""by any other means"". He seems therefore to accept that ""consort"" should be given the meaning which has been described. Accordingly, there appears to be no reason for departing from the meaning given to ""consort"" by Mason J in Johanson v Dixon and it should be adopted. 
	
	
	It is clear from that decision that the court regarded consorting as a social interaction involving more than the mere physical presence of two or more persons at the same location: one aspect of consorting is the intentional seeking out of the company of a person convicted of an indictable offence. It is in this respect that Forster submits that the prosecution has no evidence with which to prove such an intentional seeking out for the purposes of proving the offence. 
	
	
	The nature of the association is relevant as to whether the relationship is to be characterised as consorting. A casual encounter with an acquaintance is not to consort for two reasons; firstly because the meeting is not sought out, and secondly because an acquaintance is not necessarily a consort. Consorting involves the seeking out or acceptance of a relationship of personal intimacy. In O'Connor v Hammond (1902) 21 NZLR 573 Stout CJ said at 575 - 576, ""Consorting would be proved by companionship."" One of the meanings given by The Oxford English Dictionary to the verb ""consort"" captures this idea, ""To associate in a common lot, to sort together (persons or things)."" This understanding reflects the appreciation that the vice at which the law is directed is the potential spread of criminogenic influence by one's choice of companions. 
	
	
	In Dias v O'Sullivan [1949] SAStRp 15; SASR 195 Mayo J said at 201 - 202:
	


""The idea implicit in consorting ... suggests a more or less close personal relationship, or at least some degree of familiarity, or intimacy with persons, or attraction from, or an enjoyment of, some feature in common, that results in a tendency towards companionship. Where there is consorting it may be expected to be in obedience to an inclination, or impulse, to gravitate into the presence of, or, if accidentally in such presence, to remain in a group with some other person or persons. The fundamental ingredient is companionship. The fact that people meet (inter alia) to carry on some trade or occupation is not inconsistent with a fraternising contemporary therewith amounting to consorting.


	
	Clearly, a casual encounter between persons would not constitute consorting for the purposes of s 93X of the Crimes Act.
	


Issue 2: If so, was Forster’s encounter with Hayes at 9.30 am on Friday, 27 April 2012, at Inverell a chance encounter or consorting?


	
	Sergeant Shane Gillespie stationed at Inverell was on duty on Friday, 27 April 2012. At around 9.30 am that day he was patrolling Otho Street, Inverell along with Sergeant Ginman in a police vehicle. As he approached Inverell Motel in Otho Street, he observed Forster and Hayes standing near the front of the Motel engaged in conversation. The vehicle stopped and both officers emerged and approached Forster and Hayes. The following conversation occurred:
	


Gillespie: “What’s happening fellas?”

Hayes: “Nah, nothing. We’re just hangin’ out.”​

After identifying himself and Sergeant Ginman, Sergeant Gillespie told both Hayes and Forster that both of them had been convicted of an indictable offence. From their response, both men appeared to have been aware of this. They both received a warning. Forster asked what consorting meant and Gillespie provided a brief explanation. There was further conversation between the police officers and both Forster and Hayes, following which both separated and each departed in separate directions.


	
	Forster submits that it is open to the court to find that this encounter was nothing more than an unplanned chance encounter on the basis that there is no evidence that the meeting was sought out by either Forster or Hayes; that is that there was no intentional seeking out and that there is no evidence of any close personal relationship.
	
	
	With respect, I reject that submission. It is correct to say that there is no evidence that the encounter between Forster and Hayes involved any planning by them and indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that both men did not happen upon each other at that time and place by anything other than pure chance. It was submitted for Forster that I may take judicial notice of the fact that Otho Street is a main thoroughfare within Inverell and that it would not be uncommon to come upon known acquaintances in such circumstances. Indeed that might well be so. That, however, is not in my view relevant to the issue at hand. Having become aware of each other’s presence on Otho Street, one or the other of both men at some point in time thereafter formed the intention of seeking out the company of the other, evidenced by the engagement of both men in conversation which was observed by Sergeant Gillespie. Hayes' response to Sergeant Gillespie after he was spoken to suggests at the very least that the two men were more than mere acquaintances. They were indeed well known to each other and this is clear from the submissions made on behalf of Forster at the hearing.
	
	
	I am satisfied that in all the circumstances at that time and on that day this interaction was not a casual encounter and that both Forster and Hayes were consorting for the purposes of s 93X of the Crimes Act.    
	


Issue 3: Was Forster’s encounter with Morris at 9.50 am on Friday, 27 April 2012, outside the Complete Angler in Inverell a chance encounter or consorting?


	
	Following a warning being given to both Forster and Hayes, each man then went in separate directions. Clearly, the import of the warning had not been lost on either of them. Nevertheless, some twenty minutes later, both police officers again observed Forster and Morris engaged in conversation outside the Complete Angler Shop in Byron Street, Inverell. I am asked by Forster to take judicial notice of the fact that Byron Street, upon which the Complete Angler shop is located, is also a busy thoroughfare within Inverell and therefore the chance encounter of a known acquaintance is more likely than otherwise. I accept that as I do with Otho Street. 
	
	
	Sergeant Gillespie again speaks to Forster; who by now is resentful of Police intrusion into his movements. He acknowledges that he is aware of Morris previous imprisonment for offences he has committed. He was given a further warning and acknowledged the previous one given “ten minutes ago.” Morris was also warned. Both men left in different directions.
	
	
	There is no evidence before the Court that either Forster or Morris knew that they might encounter one another in Byron Street on that day. Indeed, that may well be what happened. That being the case, is it open to find that the encounter was therefore not sought out and in such case outside of s 93X of the Crimes Act? That is the position to which Forster submits I should adopt. I reject that submission as well. Whether or not either man knew or expected that they would meet at that place on that day and at that time is not apposite for the purposes of establishing whether the offence has been made out. When they did become aware of the presence of the other, there was at a point in time thereafter a seeking out by one or the other culminating in the conversation to which Sergeant Gillespie refers. It appears to be common ground that both men had known each other for some considerable time.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this encounter was not a mere casual encounter but consorting as contemplated by s 93X of the Crimes Act.
	


Issue 4: Was Forster’s encounter with Hayes, Morris and Case outside the Tattersalls Hotel in Inverell in the early hours of Saturday, 28 April 2012, a chance encounter or consorting?


	
	In the early hours of Saturday, 28 April 2012, Forster was seen by Police in the company of Hayes, Morris and Case walking along Byron Street, Inverell. Constable McArthur along with Constable Spencer approached all four men outside the Tattersalls Hotel in the same street in Inverell and enquired what they were doing. Forster replied that they were “out having a drink.” When he was reminded that they were consorting he protested saying that they were not doing anything wrong and that they were just going for a drink. They all received a further warning.
	
	
	As counsel for Forster submits, this encounter at least suggests some seeking out or that a decision had been made collectively to embark upon an enterprise; namely, to go drinking. There is no evidence to establish conclusively, however, that this was also not a chance encounter at a well-recognised hotel in Inverell. 
	
	
	For the same reasons as I have given previously, it is not necessary in my view for the prosecution to establish that the encounter between Forster and the others was pre-arranged. Clearly, the participants had planned to engage in a social activity and this had occurred prior to the Police speaking to them. Allowing for the fact that Forster happened upon all of the others by chance, there is certainly no doubt that a decision was made to seek out each other’s company for the purpose of mutual association and, accordingly, I am satisfied that this interaction was not a casual encounter and that it falls within the meaning of consorting for the purposes of s 93X of the Crimes Act.
	


Issue 5: Was Forster’s encounter with Case at midday outside the Imperial Hotel in Inverell on Tuesday 22 May 2012 a chance encounter or consorting?


	
	Constable Milne and Constable De Filippis were on patrol in Inverell on Tuesday, 22 May 2012, when at around midday they observed Forster and Case near the intersection of Byron Street and Otho Street, Inverell. As they approached, both men separated and walked in different directions. Police then conducted a U-turn, returned, alighted from the vehicle and approached both men who had reconnected and were speaking with each other. Both men received a further warning. 
	
	
	I am satisfied in the circumstances of this encounter that this was not a casual encounter but that both men had, upon becoming aware of each other’s presence, formed an intention to seek the company of the other for the purposes of the legislation.
	


Determination


	
	I am satisfied in all of the circumstances that the offence has been made out to the required standard, i.e. beyond reasonable doubt, and the offence is therefore proven.

		29 June 2015",2015-04-19 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2766426,DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: DJW (“the applicant”) applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the refusal of her Honour Judge Baly SC on 27 October 2014 to order separate trials in relation to individual complainants in respect of an indictment alleging 23 sexual assault offences against six children. The effect of the order made by her Honour was that there could be a joint trial in respect of four of the complainants but separate trials in respect of each of two of them.
	
	
	The application was heard on 21 April 2015. At the conclusion of the hearing the Court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.
	


Overview


	
	The Crown relies upon the evidence of each complainant as tendency evidence in respect of the counts relating to each of the other complainants. Her Honour found that there was a real risk of concoction or contamination which warranted severance of the trials concerning the offences against the complainants known as RW and CW but found no such risk in respect of the complainants MJ, TJ, KN and DW. She also found, upon a consideration of the issues posed for determination by s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), that the evidence of those four complainants was admissible as tendency evidence.
	


The Crown case


	
	The applicant was married to Ms W and they had three children: RW (born in 1998), CW (2000) and DW (2002). The marriage broke down and the couple separated in 2002. The applicant then lived at various addresses including in a home unit in Dulwich Hill until around August 2007. He then moved to Carlingford after having commenced a relationship with LW. She had four children who became the applicant’s step children. Three of these children are complainants: KN (born in 1995), MJ (2002) and TJ (2004).
	
	
	The Crown alleges that offences concerning RW, CW and DW occurred between January 2007 and December 2009 both at Dulwich Hill and Carlingford when the children were on weekend access visits.
	
	
	The offences against KN, MJ and TJ are alleged to have taken place between August 2007 and December 2011 in the home at Carlingford when LW was absent and the applicant was looking after the children.
	


Counts 1 – 2: offences concerning MJ (aged 8)


	
	Sometime between 1 January and 31 December 2010 at Carlingford when MJ was 8 years old she entered the applicant’s bedroom where he was lying naked on his bed. He walked over to MJ and exposed his penis to her and touched her body with it (count 1). He then sat in a chair and attempted to put his penis into her mouth and flicked his penis across her cheeks. He managed to force his penis into her mouth for a short period of time (count 2).
	


Counts 3 – 8: offences concerning TJ (aged 3 – 6)


	
	Sometime between 1 January 2008 and 1 March 2011 at Carlingford when TJ was between 3 and 6 years old he was in the applicant’s bedroom when the applicant kissed him on the lips and performed an act of fellatio upon him (count 4). He then forced TJ to perform fellatio upon him (count 5). The applicant then touched his mouth on TJ’s anus and buttocks (count 3) and had anal intercourse with him (count 6). The applicant said to TJ: “If you tell your mum I’ll punch you hard in the face”.
	
	
	On two separate occasions during that same time period, the applicant made TJ and MJ remove their clothes and kiss each other (counts 7 and 8).
	


Counts 9 – 12: offences concerning RW (aged 9 – 10)


	
	Sometime between 1 January and 1 August 2007 RW, CW and DW visited the applicant at his Dulwich Hill unit and celebrated RW’s ninth birthday. After having dinner and birthday cake the applicant made the children get undressed and dance around naked to music. This incident was the basis of complaints by both RW and CW (counts 9 and 22).
	
	
	On the same evening, RW went to sleep in the applicant’s bed. During the night the applicant entered the room, pulled the blankets off RW and took off her underpants. He had penile/vaginal intercourse with her (count 10). RW cried and felt pain in her vagina. She said the incident lasted more than five minutes.
	
	
	On an occasion between 1 August 2007 and 31 December 2008 when RW and CW were visiting the applicant at Carlingford they went into his room to get some popcorn that he kept there. The applicant came in, shut the door and turned the light off. He picked up the girls and put them on his bed. He kissed RW on the neck (count 11). He then pulled her pants down and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her (count 12). RW heard the front door shut and LW come home. The applicant quickly got dressed and told the girls not to say anything.
	


Counts 13 – 17: offences concerning KN (aged 12 – 15)


	
	Sometime between 1 August 2007 and 12 December 2011 at Carlingford the applicant committed the following offences against KN. On one occasion he pushed her onto a bean bag and rubbed his genital area against hers (count 13). Shortly after he picked her up, pulled her onto him and again rubbed his genital area against hers (count 14). On another occasion he entered the bathroom naked while KN was in the shower. He propositioned her, stepped into the shower and pushed her against the wall (count 15). On another occasion he called her into his bedroom and asked how quickly she could take her pyjamas off. She pushed him away and ran off (count 16). On another occasion KN and RW were having a pillow fight in the applicant’s bedroom. He entered and told RW to keep a look out. He then removed KN’s pants and rubbed his penis onto her vagina (count 17). He stopped when LW came home.
	


Counts 18 – 19: offences concerning DW (aged 5 – 6)


	
	DW went to live with the applicant and LW at Carlingford in October 2007. On an occasion between 1 October 2007 and 31 December 2008, the applicant told DW to pull his pants down in the lounge room. The applicant manipulated DW’s penis with his hand (count 18). On another occasion when DW was in his bedroom, the applicant came in and again manipulated DW’s penis with his hand (count 19).
	


Counts 20 – 23: offences concerning CW (aged 7 – 9)


	
	The offence in count 22 was alleged to have been committed at Dulwich Hill between 1 January and 1 August 2007 at the same time and in the same fashion as the offence in count 9 concerning RW.
	
	
	On the day after that incident, the applicant took his clothes off and slapped CW in the face after she had accidentally scratched his computer. CW remained clothed but said that the applicant’s naked body was touching hers (count 21).
	
	
	On an occasion when RW and CW were visiting the applicant at Carlingford, sometime between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, they were in his bedroom when he entered, turned off the lights and shut the curtains. He undressed the girls and then undressed himself. They asked the applicant what he was doing but he told them to “shut up” and pushed them onto the bed. He then hit CW and tried to put his penis into her vagina (count 20). She screamed and told him to stop but he told her to “shut up”.
	
	
	On another occasion at Carlingford, the applicant told CW and RW to take their clothes off (count 23). They did not do so as they were interrupted by LW who yelled at the applicant and asked him what he was doing.
	


Offences concerning KN to which the applicant pleaded guilty


	
	The applicant was sentenced on 6 September 2012, following pleas of guilty, for two offences of committing an act of indecency with KN on 1 February 2011. On that day, KN was in her bedroom when the applicant entered, removed his pants and began masturbating towards her. He then directed her to lift up her top but she refused. The applicant made full admissions to this offence in a police interview and described another occasion when he said that he deposited money into KN’s account in exchange for viewing her breasts.
	


Tendency notice


	
	The tendency notice served by the Crown asserted that what was sought to be proved was the applicant’s tendency:
	


(a)   to act in a particular way, namely to engage in sexual acts with young children;

(b)   to have a particular state of mind, namely a sexual interest in young children; and

(c)   to make use of his parental or step-parental authority to act on his sexual interest in young children.


	
	The Crown particularised the ""similarities and the underlying pattern of behaviour/circumstances"" as including:
	


""Every complainant was a child at the time of the offences.

Every complainant was either the child of the accused, or the step-child of the accused.

The accused used his position of authority as the father or step-father of the complainants to facilitate his sexual abuse of them. This included, for example, telling them what to do, or where to go.

Thus, there was frequently a degree of coercion in the offending behaviour.

The events the subject of the charges, and of the other evidence relied on by the Crown as tendency evidence, occurred in the home of the accused.

The offences were frequently committed in the presence of two or more of the complainants.

The offences were committed when the accused was at his home, either at Dulwich Hill or Carlingford.

The offences were committed when no other adults were in the house.

The accused told the complainants not to tell anybody else.

The accused would sometimes quickly remove the clothing of the complainants.

The accused would frequently expose himself or be naked during the commission of the crimes.""

Notice of motion


	
	A notice of motion was filed by which the applicant sought separate trials in relation to each complainant. It was common ground that determination of this application was contingent upon determination of the admissibility of the Crown's asserted tendency evidence.
	


Ruling


	
	Baly SC DCJ made the following ruling:
	


""The notice of motion is allowed in part.

I order that the counts in relation to CW which are counts 20 to 23 be severed from all other counts.

I order that counts concerning KN, which are counts 13 to 17, are not to be tried with those concerning RW, counts 9 to 12, and I order that the counts concerning RW, that is 9 to 12, are not to be tried with those concerning DW, that is counts 18 and 19. Whether that means a separate trial of RW from all other complainants is a matter for the Crown.""


	
	The practical effect of these orders was that there would be three trials; one concerning MJ, TJ, KN and DW, another concerning RW and another concerning CW.
	


Reasons for judgment


	
	The learned judge reviewed the statutory provisions relating to tendency evidence and referred to well-known authorities which discuss the principles relevant to their application: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308; R v Smith [2008] NSWCCA 247; 190 A Crim R 8; R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451; PWD v R [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568; DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363; Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55; Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481 and JG v R [2014] NSWCCA 138. The applicant did not contend that her Honour displayed any misunderstanding as to the correct approach to the assessment of the admissibility of such evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour considered ""whether there is a reasonable possibility of concoction and or contamination of the evidence"". She quoted the following from the judgment of Hodgson JA in BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303:
	


""[110] One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292. However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111], R v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404; (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 at [74], [112]. The onus is on the Crown to negate the “real chance” of concoction: OGD at [74], R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; (2002) 129 A Crim R 126 at [48].

[111] Relevant to consideration of concoction are the factors mentioned in Hoch at 297, namely relationship, opportunity and motive. One of these on its own is not sufficient to base a finding of a real possibility of concoction: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [15], OGD at [111] – [112].""


	
	Her Honour continued:
	


""Therefore, if concoction or contamination may be the explanation for apparent similarities the tendency evidence is deprived of force or significant probative value. Any chance of concoction or contamination must, however, be a real one not merely a speculative one: R v Colby. Now in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 which was a case concerned with the effect of publicity on the various complainants, Basten JA held that the second and third sentences at [110] of BP are inconsistent with the decision in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 and should not be applied as a general rule. The same observation was made in BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 at [65].

It remains however the law that a reasonable risk of concoction and or contamination as distinct from a speculative or conjectural one is relevant. And in determining whether there is a real risk it remains, in my view, the case that the relationship between the complainants, the opportunity for concoction and or contamination and any motive put forward for concoction is relevant. Factors relevant include whether there has been communication between the complainants and whether any of the complainants has been exposed to the fact of the detail of the complaints made by any other complainant, thus the timing of and the nature and circumstances surrounding the complains made by each complainant are relevant.""


	
	Her Honour reviewed the evidence in considerable detail, placing particular emphasis upon anything to do with a complainant having discussed the allegations of sexual abuse by the applicant with other complainants (Judgment pp 12 -37). She then provided her conclusions on the possibility of concoction and/or contamination:
	


""MJ when she made her interview had very limited knowledge of allegations regarding TJ. MJ said TJ told her that the accused pulled TJ’s pants down. This is nothing like what is alleged by TJ, which includes kissing allegations made by TJ and not mentioned by MJ. There is no evidence that TJ had any conversations with any other complainant.

So far as KN is concerned, there is no evidence she discussed her allegation with TJ or MJ. In relation to KN the additional allegations did not emerge until later, by which time it was clear that KN was aware and had discussed RW’s allegations with her, that is by 27 March 2014 when KN’s additional allegations emerged.

RW in turn had discussions with KN and DW, although perhaps not specifics about DW.

DW learnt through RW about the allegations concerning KN’s breasts and nothing more.

But it is clear that DW and RW have discussed their allegations amongst themselves and had discussed the specifics of the allegations.

So far as CW is concerned, it was not until April this year that CW made her allegations, despite the fact that she was interviewed in 2011. She learnt of RW’s allegations four months before making her statement in May 2014. CW’s allegations first emerged to a teacher in April 2014. It is clear that CW by the time she made her 2014 statement knew about RW’s allegations. She knew about KN’s allegations, at least in part, and she knew that there were allegations in relation to TJ and MJ.""


	
	Her Honour then referred again to BP v R; R v BP and JG v R before concluding on the issue of concoction and contamination:
	


""In so far as motive is concerned there is no evidence and there is no obvious motive for concoction. In relation to the other considerations, relationship and opportunity, there is clearly relationships existing between all of the complainants and there has clearly been opportunity, although that varies between the complainants. There have clearly been conversations as outlined in the analysis above and there have clearly been visits between the households. Factoring in the evidence of the actual communication and the complaints and the timing of the complaints, I make the following finding in so far as whether there is a real risk of contamination and concoction between some of the complainants or all of the complainants.

In my view that risk applies to some of the complainants. In my view the evidence in relation to Facebook does not allow me to draw any conclusions beyond those I have already spoken of in relation to KN and RW. In my view the evidence does not allow me to make general findings that there was two way communications between the households. The only conclusion I can make is based upon the evidence I have gone through and concerns actual communication. I do not draw a general conclusion that there was always communications; that would in my view amount to speculation. I do not place any weight on the opinion of Mr Taylor [a psychologist who assessed DJW for sentencing purposes], the report of Mr Taylor which was made when there was only one allegation involving KN.

In my view a real risk does exist in relation to the allegations made by CW. In my view CW should be tried separately to all other complainants. That is based on the fact that her complaint emerged only months ago and after discussions with other complainants and in the light of the fact that she made no complaint in 2011. In addition I find that there is a real risk of concoction as between KN and RW and as between DW and RW.""


	
	Her Honour then turned to the question more generally of ""significant probative value"" of the evidence, although putting aside that concerning CW:
	


""Applying the s 97 standard that the evidence must have significant probative value I accept firstly that there is a variety of allegations and that the allegations do not necessarily exhibit close similarity, however in my view there is a similar course of conduct alleged. What is shown is a sexual interest on the part of the accused in his children whether they be his own or those of his partner which he himself describes as a step-father relationship. I accept that there is shown an underlying pattern whereby the accused used his position to facilitate the alleged sexual abuse.

I do not place any weight upon the fact that the complainants are of different genders and that the complainants were of different ages, in my view that is not material and it does not deprive the evidence of significant probative value: R v SK; SK v R [2011] NSWCCA 292. I place a great deal of weight on the fact that all the complainants were his children and all of the acts were done in his home. I accept that there was frequently a degree of coercion or a use of force or some violence or threats and that there were threats made to the complainants not to disclose and I base that conclusion upon what I have read in exhibit A [sic – Exhibit A was the tendency notice and Exhibit B was the bundle of statements and interviews referred to therein] as well as the analysis provided by the Crown in exhibit E [a table of references to the ""use of force, violence, threats or admonitions to not disclose""]. Again I place weight on the fact that all events occurred in the home of the accused. I place weight on the fact that there were no adults in the house at the relevant time. I accept the Crown’s submission that the accused was frequently naked or at least partially naked.

I pause to consider the allegations in relation to the prior conviction concerning the viewing of KN’s breasts and I note that in that allegation monies were paid into her bank account. This is a difference that does stand out in my mind, however in my view the significance of that difference does not deprive the proposed tendency evidence of its significant probative value, that is having regard to the other factors and circumstances that point strongly in my view to an underlying pattern of behaviour and a sexual interest by the accused in his children.

By way of conclusion in relation to each remaining count and the evidence concerning the allegation of KN to which the accused pleaded guilty, in my view that evidence does have significant probative value in that it is capable of being an important circumstance establishing a definite tendency on the part of the accused to engage in sexual misconduct with his children or step-children. In my view the Crown has discharged the onus of establishing significant probative value.""


	
	Finally, her Honour turned to the requirement in s 101 that the ""probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant"":
	


""Again the onus is on the Crown to establish that the probative value of the tendency evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. I must factor in the ameliorating effect of directions including that any tendency evidence that is used must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. No specific prejudicial effect has been identified and I note that this is not a case of, for example, where there is some deviant behaviour which is inherently likely to raise prejudice. The applicant in my view has not identified how the risk of misuse by the jury could arise. It is no answer to make general statements about prejudice in a general way, see SK at para 34 per Latham J. The Crown has satisfied me that the probative value of the tendency evidence does substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect.""

Submissions for the applicant


	
	The sole ground of appeal is that her Honour erred in not ordering a separate trial for each complainant but the principal issue is the correctness or otherwise of the ruling upon the admissibility of tendency evidence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant who was the author of written submissions (but who did not appear at the hearing) identified that:
	


""The issue in this case was whether or not there was, in respect to each complainant, a real risk of concoction or contamination and, if there was, what effect that should have on the assessment of the probative value of the evidence.""


	
	Four specific contentions were raised in the written submissions which will be dealt with in turn.
	


Error in concluding no real chance or possibility of concoction or contamination between MJ, TJ and KN

Submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour concluded that MJ had very limited knowledge of the allegations made by TJ but she failed to take into account that MJ had told police in his interview that, ""[TJ] tells me everything"".
	
	
	It was also submitted that her Honour referred to KN saying in her statement that she had not spoken with TJ or MJ about sexual abuse. But RW said in her police interview that KN had told her that the applicant had done things to MJ and TJ. KN did not say anything in her interview about witnessing any offending against MJ or TJ so it may be inferred that KN had been told about it by one or the other (or both). Accordingly, her Honour was in error in saying that there was no evidence that KN had ""discussed her allegation with TJ or MJ"".
	
	
	The Crown did not challenge the decision to sever the trials concerning RW and CW. But it was submitted that this was not a case in which there were competing inferences of concoction or contamination arising in relation to the other four complainants and the decision to refuse separate trials in respect of them should be maintained.
	


Consideration


	
	It was implicit in the written submissions, and made explicit at the commencement of the hearing (T1.32), that the applicant accepts that there was no error by the primary judge in identifying the correct principles to apply to the determination of the admissibility of tendency evidence. As a consequence, it is unnecessary for this Court once again to refer to the principles in detail. They are more than adequately set out in the cases to which the primary judge referred (see above at [26]).
	
	
	It is, however, necessary to refer in some detail to a case in which judgment was delivered after the primary judge's determination. The judgment is presently restricted: Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280. In that case, the primary judge had held that questions of possible concoction or contamination relate to the reliability and credibility of the evidence. This was said to be so on the basis that Hoch v The Queen and post-Evidence Act cases that had applied it, notably BP v R; R v BP and FB v R, should not be followed. In accordance with cases such as R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 and R v XY the probative value of the evidence was not to be determined by an assessment of its reliability and credibility.
	
	
	In Jones v R, Bellew J (Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreeing) considered (at [87]) that the primary judge had gone too far in holding that R v Shamouil prohibited, under any circumstances, consideration of issues of credibility. He referred to some of the judgments in DSJ v R; NS v R and R v XY and said (at [88]) that they supported the conclusion that in assessing probative value a court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence. Whether that may extend to allowing a court to take into account concoction and contamination was said (at [89]) to be a separate question which would depend largely upon the evidence. His Honour allowed (at [90]) for the possibility that evidence of concoction and contamination may give rise to competing inferences that may be relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence.
	
	
	What was said by Bellew J in Jones v R was strictly obiter; the determination of the case was based upon a finding that it was open to the primary judge to have found that there was an absence of evidence of concoction or contamination. Nevertheless, I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasoning with one relatively minor exception. That is that Simpson J in R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238 at [189]-[194] (with which Barr AJ and I agreed) identified that in R v XY, only two of the five judges constituting the Court accepted the relevance of there being competing inferences to the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 137. R v Shamouil and R v XY were concerned with that provision. DSJ v R; NS v R was concerned with s 98 (coincidence evidence). In JG v R, Simpson J said (at [105]) that (on the authority of DSJ v R; NS v R) competing inferences were also potentially relevant to the assessment of probative value in relation to s 97. The distinction is that ss 97 and 98, but not s 137, require consideration of “other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence”.
	
	
	The primary judge in the present case was in error (the decision in Jones v R was not available to her) in determining the issue of concoction or contamination quite separately from the issue of whether the evidence had significant probative value. Whilst her Honour acknowledged what was said by Basten JA in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 in criticism of BP v R; R v BP, the separate treatment by her of the concoction/contamination issue, and finding that it was determinative by itself in respect of the trials concerning RW and CW, indicated an approach which was more akin to the Hoch approach. The Crown submitted, and I respectfully agree, that this resulted in her Honour adopting an approach that was unduly favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	In the present case I am prepared to assume that the issue of possible concoction or contamination in the present case could give rise to a competing inference in the assessment of whether there was significant probative value. I am prepared to make this assumption because the applicant's submissions on this subject must all be rejected in any event.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the statement by MJ to police that ""[TJ] tells me everything"" as a failure of the judge to take into account a material consideration. It was submitted that in light of this, it was not open for the judge to conclude that there was no real risk of contamination in relation to MJ.
	
	
	There is no merit in this. MJ made this statement when she was being asked by police about how she knew of TJ's complaint that the applicant had pulled his pants down. The judge specifically mentioned that ""MJ said TJ told her that the accused pulled TJ's pants down"" but observed that ""this is nothing like what is alleged by TJ"" (Judgment p 15). It was well open to the judge not to find any real possibility of concoction or contamination on this account.
	
	
	The asserted inference that KN must have spoken with either or both of MJ and TJ about their allegations was said to arise from something RW told police. This is a rather flimsy foundation for a conclusion that there is a real risk of contamination. And it is contradicted by KN saying in her statement of 8 December 2012 that:
	


""TJ and MJ have never spoken to me about anything that has happened to them with the accused. I have never spoken about my sexual abuse with TJ or MJ … I have never talked about sex or sexual abuse with TJ or MJ"".

Her Honour erred in not ordering a separate trial for DW


	
	The applicant referred to her Honour's conclusion that ""there is a real risk of concoction as between KN and RW and as between DW and RW"". It was submitted that as this was assessed as a risk of concoction rather than contamination there must be doubt about the entirety of DW's evidence. This should have led to her Honour ordering a separate trial for DW.
	
	
	RW's allegations are of the applicant requiring her and CW to dance whilst naked; kissing her on the neck; and having penile/vaginal intercourse with her. DW's allegations are of the applicant fondling his penis. Her Honour found that RW and DW had discussed ""the specifics of the allegations"". But having regard to their different gender and the differences in their allegations the prospect of ""concoction"" would appear to be remote.
	
	
	After the judge had announced her reasons for judgment on 27 October 2014, the Crown Prosecutor sought some clarification which included:
	


""CROWN PROSECUTOR: And as I understood it … your Honour was quite deliberately using the words 'contamination and concoction' in different sentences and different ways.

HER HONOUR: It's contamination that I've really ruled upon.""


	
	It seems, therefore, that her Honour may have used the word ""concoction"" in relation to RW and KN, and RW and DW, when she intended the word ""contamination"". In any event, I consider the submission that there must be doubt about the entirety of DW's evidence as a substantial overstatement. I am not persuaded that the fact that DW had discussed his allegations with RW denied his evidence the probative value her Honour assessed.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant made further submissions at the hearing concerning the refusal of the judge to order a separate trial in relation to DW. The submissions were concerned with RW telling police in her interview that DW had said ""he was joking"" when he had earlier said, according to RW, that the applicant had tried to rape him. The judge had included this in her review of the evidence (Judgment at p 25). She also referred to RW having said in the same interview that DW had proceeded to tell her that the applicant ""was just playing with him … like pulling the foreskin back"". The latter is consistent with the offences alleged concerning DW, allegations that the applicant fondled DW's penis.
	
	
	The further submissions also made reference to RW and DW having discussed their ""secrets"". Again, this was included in the judge's review of the evidence.
	
	
	These two additional matters did not support severance of the trial of DW from those concerned with MJ, TJ and KN. They did support, in the judge's view, severance of the trials of RW and DW. There was no suggestion of DW having been involved in discussions of his allegations with any other complainant, or of other complainants discussing their allegations with him. The submission that there was ""a risk of contamination in relation to DW"" in relation to complainants other than RW is not supported by the evidence.
	


The evidence of KN, additional to the above, is too dissimilar to the evidence of the other complainants to have significant probative value


	
	The offences alleged in respect of MJ (indecent touching and fellatio) were said to have occurred when she was aged 8 and the offences alleged in respect to TJ (indecent touching, fellatio and anal intercourse) were said to have occurred when he was aged 3 to 6. In contrast, the offences alleged in respect of KN (various forms of indecent assaults) were said to have occurred when she was aged 12 to 15. There were also the offences concerning KN to which the applicant had pleaded guilty which occurred when she was 15 and involved masturbating in her presence, asking her to reveal her breasts, and admitting to having paid her money in the past in order to show him her breasts. Accordingly, it was submitted that the acts were dissimilar and the difference between the ages of MJ and TJ on the one hand and of KN on the other was indicative of the applicant having a different state of mind.
	
	
	The judge was mindful of the different ages of the complainants but found that this was not significant. She was also mindful that ""the allegations do not necessarily exhibit close similarity"". (This was correct: see, for example, R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [43], and Sokolowskyj v R at [36].)
	
	
	The applicant's submission should be assessed in the context of the various matters her Honour took into account in coming to the conclusion that there was ""significant probative value"" (see above at [31]). Without referring to every matter, her findings included that ""there is a similar course of conduct alleged"" and ""there is shown an underlying pattern whereby the accused used his position to facilitate the alleged sexual abuse"". These were findings that related as much to the offences concerning KN as to any of the other complainants. Having regard to the matters her Honour did take into account it cannot be said that the assessment was not one that was open to be made.
	


Her Honour did not give appropriate weight to the prejudicial effect of the evidence when weighing it against its probative value


	
	It was submitted that her Honour erred when she said ""No specific prejudicial effect has been identified""; there was no ""deviant behaviour which is inherently likely to raise prejudice""; and ""the applicant … has not identified how the risk of misuse by the jury could have arose"". This ""ignores the inherent identifiable prejudice in tendency evidence and also in prior convictions"". Reference was made to a discussion of ""prejudicial effect"" in Sokolowskyj v R at [47]-[50]. It was submitted that the ""types of prejudice outlined [in that judgment] including [the applicant's] prior conviction and 'deviant behaviour' were present in this case"".
	
	
	This was not a submission that was developed any further in oral argument, except for counsel to acknowledge the practical reality that evidence of prior convictions would not be before the jury (T8.44). This was understandable in my view as it has no merit.
	
	
	Sokolowskyj v R was a case in which the tendency evidence concerned the alleged offender having exposed himself to women when he was in public places whilst masturbating on three separate occasions some five to nine years before the offence in question was allegedly committed. The offence alleged was that he had taken an eight year old child into a public toilet, closed the door and indecently assaulted her. Hoeben CJ at CL identified (at [48]) the potential prejudice as involving the jury thinking that the accused was a ""sexual deviant"" who was ""the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him"". Another danger was that the jury would be ""so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the accused's version and disregard judicial directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner"". A third danger was that the jury might be ""disinclined to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt"".
	
	
	The types of prejudice identified in Sokolowskyj v R is far removed from anything identified in the present case. In fact, no specific prejudice was identified in the present case and this was acknowledged at the hearing (T8.20). Counsel who appeared at the hearing pressed a submission that there was error in the judge not weighing any ""identifiable prejudice"" against the probative value of the tendency evidence and also submitted that there was a potential for a jury to consider the applicant's behaviour as ""deviant"".
	
	
	My reading of the judge's reasoning leaves me with the view that her Honour was well aware that tendency evidence in cases such as this has an inherent prejudicial effect but that could be adequately dealt with by directions which would include that before the tendency evidence could be taken into account it must be proved to the criminal standard. It was open for her to conclude that ""this is not a case … where there is some deviant behaviour which is inherently likely to raise prejudice"". She made reference to the judgment of Latham J in R v SK; SK v R [2011] NSWCCA 292 where her Honour said:
	


“[34] … [T]he applicant did not identify how the risk of misuse of the evidence by the jury could arise. It is no answer to make general statements about the arousal of prejudice. A jury's antipathy towards an accused, assuming that the accused is guilty and failing to properly consider a defence are all potential by-products of tendency evidence. In that sense, the nature of tendency evidence is inherently prejudicial, hence the need for strong directions, including the requirement that the tendency evidence be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is not however, prejudicial simply because it tends to prove the commission of the offences. That constitutes, subject to proper directions, appropriate use of the evidence, not its misuse.”


	
	There was no error in the judge's weighing of the probative value and the prejudicial effect.
	


Conclusion


	
	The foregoing are my reasons for joining in the orders made at the conclusion of the hearing on 21 April 2015:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	BELLEW J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2766427,R v Duffy (No. 1) [2015] NSWSC 444,"Judgment


	
	The accused has been charged with murder, alternatively being an accessory after the fact to murder. He has also been charged with breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, alternatively that he did steal in a dwelling house.
	
	
	The Crown wishes to tender his ERISP made on 7 June 2012. The parties have agreed on which questions and answers should be omitted from that ERISP with the exception of question 259 and its answer. So that this question and answer can be put into context I will set out questions 256 to 260 with their answers.
	


Q256   Micheal, I'll just bring you back to when you, when you, you stated

that you saw Rachael strangling which you said with a belt. Was that correct?

A   Yeah, a belt or a leather strap or something.

Q257   And then you said, what, sorry, what was Rachael's, how, how was, how was she? Did she say anything or --

A   No.

Q257(sic) -- what, what was she doing?

A   She was trying to strangle her like, she had like, a, like, a fucken, a smile on her face.

Q258   What do you, what do you think she was, she was trying to achieve by

that?

A   I'm not sure.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE GROVES

Excuse me.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE KING

Q259   At any time did you become aware that or did you inquire about the welfare of Colleen Ayers or Marlboro as --

A   No.

Q260   Did you see her any other time after, after that?

A   Yeah, when they were fucken trying to take her out of the house. As I

said I'll make a full interview and statement at a further date. I'm not willing to, you know, to give one now until I find all the evidence and that come through. And then I'll make a full statement. I'll tell youse everything.


	
	Counsel for the accused objects to question 259 and its answer on two bases. First, it is said that the question and answer are ambiguous as to the time about which the question is asking, with the result that the evidence is misleading and confusing. Secondly, it was submitted that the jury may impermissibly reason that there some duty or obligation on the accused to act to assist the deceased in circumstances where there is no duty or obligation to do so and that this failure is somehow indicative or probative of his guilt. In that regard the jury may think that the failure demonstrates bad character which would be prejudicial to the accused.
	
	
	The Crown’s principal case against the accused is that he was responsible for strangling the deceased. That is expected to be the evidence given by the co-offender whose evidence at her sentencing hearing was to that effect. The Crown’s alternative case is that there was a joint criminal enterprise and, even if the co-offender did the strangling, the accused was present encouraging and assisting that act. The evidence is relevant to this alternative case.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that there is no duty on the accused to have assisted the deceased nor to have made any enquiry about her welfare. The Crown says, however, that his failure to make such an enquiry is one piece of evidence that would enable an inference that he was in fact encouraging and assisting in the killing of the deceased.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused submits that, if that is the purpose of its tender, the evidence contained in the answer has very little probative value and that is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused because of the impermissible way that the jury may reason.
	
	
	In my opinion, the question and answer are admissible and ought to be received into evidence. In the first place the question and answer are relevant to a fact in issue, namely, whether the accused was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with the co-offender to kill the deceased.
	
	
	I do not consider that any ambiguity about the timing to which the question is directed results in unfair prejudice. The question and answer must be seen in the context of the surrounding questions. The events involving the accused and the deceased commenced a day or so earlier when they first met. Those events included sexual relations between the accused, the deceased and the co-offender on the day before, the travelling to the deceased’s parents’ house, sexual relations between the accused and the deceased in the bedroom at the house, and the killing involving at least the offender and, on the Crown’s case, the accused.
	
	
	Although the words “at any time” which introduced the question could theoretically encompass any of those events, there is nothing to suggest any problem with the deceased’s welfare (apart from the fact that she with the others had ingested drugs and alcohol) until the events in the bedroom of the house involving the use of the belt around her neck. A reading of questions 256-258 make that clear. Question 259 did not introduce a new topic. It is noted that it was the same police officer who asked questions 256-260.
	
	
	As far as the jury’s misusing the question and answer is concerned, the context of the events is also relevant. The accused was not an uninvolved bystander such as a person at a street brawl. Until the time the co-offender entered the bedroom and attempted to strangle the deceased with the belt the accused was involved in sexual activity with the deceased. In those circumstances a failure to enquire about the deceased’s welfare at that time in the events is a relevant matter for the jury to consider when coming to a view about whether or not the accused was encouraging and assisting the co-offender in her attempts to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The jury will certainly need to be told that there is no general duty or obligation on the part of a person to assist the deceased in those circumstances nor to enquire about her welfare. The jury will need to be told that they cannot use his failure to enquire as a sign of his bad character to draw a conclusion of guilt. However, his failure to make an enquiry has some significant probative value for the jury to determine whether or not he was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise. The question and answer is not, in the context of the events that happened, unfairly prejudicial to the accused. However, even if there is some unfair prejudice, such unfair prejudice does not outweigh its probative value.
	
	
	Nor does the admission of the question and answer reverse the onus of proof, as counsel for the accused asserted, on the basis that it requires the accused to give an explanation for why he did not make such an enquiry. The mere fact that evidence tends to call for an explanation does not of itself involve reversing the onus. For example, evidence is likely to be given by the co-offender that the accused killed the deceased. On one view, such evidence calls for an explanation by the accused. The evidence is not inadmissible for that reason alone. The jury must decide if they accept the co-offender’s evidence regardless of any explanation, or lack of it, from the accused. The jury will be told that the accused has no obligation to explain or say anything.
	
	
	Similarly the jury will be directed as I have indicated earlier. No reversal of onus arises.
	
	
	Question 259 and its answer should not be excluded from the ERISP.

		25 May 2015",2015-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766431,R v Scott (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 462,"Judgment


	
	On 2 April 2015, that being the fifteenth day of the accused’s trial, the accused made an application for the discharge of the jury. Having heard submissions on the application, I refused to discharge the jury and the trial continued.
	
	
	A further such application was made and refused on 7 April 2015.
	
	
	These are my reasons for those decisions.
	
	
	To make sense of the applications it is necessary to set out some relevant history of the trial, and to refer to other earlier applications for the discharge of the jury which were made by the accused, and refused.
	
	
	The accused stands charged with the murder of Riley Dehn, a crime said to have been committed in the early hours of 5 April 2013, at Cessnock in this State. He was arraigned on 10 March 2015 upon an indictment which charged him in those terms, and he entered a plea of not guilty. A jury was empanelled and the trial commenced. The accused was at that time represented by Mr. Cavanagh of counsel.
	
	
	On 19 March 2015 Mr. Cavanagh made an application for the discharge of the jury, the application being opposed by the Crown. That application was made after a witness had given evidence the previous day of knowing the accused “from in and out of gaol a few times” (T531:40).
	
	
	The evidence was given on the seventh day of the trial, at a time when all of the witnesses who had been present when the stabbing occurred had completed their evidence. Some twenty-four witnesses in total had given evidence to that point, and much of the most significant evidence to be called in the case against the accused had already been given.
	
	
	Considerations of the administration of justice, together with the interests of the Crown, witnesses who might be required to repeat their testimony at another trial, or again be inconvenienced whilst waiting to testify, and those of the community in seeing matters brought to finality as quickly as can be reasonably and justly achieved, are important, and must be balanced with the question of prejudice to an accused.
	
	
	The impugned evidence was given as an unresponsive answer to a question from the Crown by a witness who was particularly difficult to hear, as he was very softly spoken, and whose speech was also difficult of comprehension, the witness having a most idiosyncratic manner of speaking. It seemed unlikely that any of the jurors had in fact heard the relevant statement or, if they had heard the words, that they had necessarily understood them. Even assuming that at least one juror had heard the reference to the accused having been in gaol, I did not regard that evidence as leading to incurable prejudice such that the jury should be discharged.
	
	
	The effect of the unwanted evidence had to be assessed against the overall context of the trial. The charge against the accused arose from a fist fight between two individuals in a public street in the very early hours of the morning. All of the witnesses to the affray had been drinking at a nearby hotel for a number of hours and all but one were heavily intoxicated. The evidence of the conduct of many of the witnesses could readily have given rise to opinions adverse to those individuals in terms of their presumed and actual willingness to comply with the criminal law.
	
	
	Other witnesses closely associated with the accused gave evidence of casual acts of criminality, including larceny and drug use. It must have been clear to the jury that this was the social milieu in which the accused moved and in which the events took place. He was to be judged against that background.
	
	
	Whilst that feature of the case, and the reference to the accused having been in gaol, does have the capacity to cause prejudice to an accused person, in the circumstances of this case, I considered that a direction could readily be crafted to address that prospect.
	
	
	Ordinarily, there is something of a dilemma as to whether giving a direction to the jury to disregard the problematic evidence simply places an unwelcome focus upon it. In the circumstances of this case, it is possible to give a direction which will direct the jury to ignore the evidence without having to refer to it directly.
	
	
	The Crown also led evidence of a number of telephone calls made by the accused to others after he had been charged and whilst he was he was held on remand (Ex. V). The calls were played to the jury and it was clear from their content that each was being placed from a gaol. Each contained the familiar Corrective Services warning that referred to the call as one made by an “inmate” of such a facility. There were also some gaol references in some of the conversations that followed.
	
	
	In those circumstances it was necessary to say something to the jury at the time the evidence was given about the accused having been held in prison. In the summing up, that direction can be expanded to one directing the jury to disregard any evidence that suggested that the accused had previously been in prison, as entirely irrelevant to the facts to be decided, and to the question of whether the Crown had proved the accused’s guilt of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Court can and must proceed on the basis that the jury will follow the directions it is given by the trial judge: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592; Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R.
	
	
	Accordingly, I refused the accused’s application for the jury to be discharged and the trial continued: R v Scott (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 458. The offending evidence was struck from the record.
	
	
	The second application for a discharge of the jury followed evidence given by Kayla Houston.
	
	
	The trial was adjourned for the day early on 19 March 2015 because Ms. Houston did not appear in answer to her subpoena. A warrant was issued for her apprehension.
	
	
	The warrant was executed some time on 19 March 2015 and Ms. Houston appeared before the Court in custody the following day. She was refused bail and remanded in custody until such time as she might be excused from further attendance on her subpoena.
	
	
	The Crown called Ms. Houston to give evidence on the morning of 24 March 2015. Ms. Houston was a witness who had made an induced statement to police concerning her knowledge of matters relevant to the death of Mr. Dehn; she had been granted an indemnity from prosecution for her part in a number of public justice offences on the basis that she give truthful evidence at the accused’s trial and in any related proceedings.
	
	
	Despite the possibility that she could be criminally charged if she failed to give complete and truthful evidence at the accused’s trial, Ms. Houston appeared to be a less than forthright witness when she gave evidence in chief before the luncheon adjournment on 24 March 2015. She appeared, at the very least, to have significant problems with her memory.
	
	
	Over the luncheon adjournment, information came to the attention of staff of the Department of Corrective Services that could have explained Ms. Houston’s memory loss. Discovered in the possession of the witness were two handwritten letters, one evidently from the accused to Ms. Houston, and one that appeared to be her undelivered reply. The letters were seized and made available to the parties.
	
	
	The Crown was provided with statements from Corrections officers and footage from surveillance cameras in operation in the Court’s holding cells which established that the accused had passed a document to Ms. Houston in the holding cells of the Court house at Darlinghurst, where both were held whilst the trial was continuing. Ms. Houston had written a letter to the accused, but that letter had not been delivered by her to him.
	
	
	Both letters were tendered in evidence in the trial (exhibits W and X). Whilst Ms. Houston’s letter was principally an expression of love and support for the accused, the accused’s letter urged Ms. Houston to give the “right” evidence, to ensure that the accused “beat the trial” so that the accused and Ms. Houston could enjoy a future together.
	
	
	After the luncheon adjournment, and plainly being aware that the authorities had the two letters, Ms. Houston’s memory improved and her evidence became more complete. She continued in evidence that afternoon, and into the following day. She gave considerable evidence of what might be regarded as attempts by the accused to interfere with the trial process. Ms. Houston said that the accused had asked her to “staunch”, or intimidate, three Crown witnesses (Russell Payne, Carol Myles, and Melanie O’Neill) to persuade each to retract statements made to police. She deposed that the accused had urged her to get rid of the implement used to stab Mr. Dehn by disposing of it at sea or in some other large body of water; and, he endeavoured to prevail upon her to herself make a false statement to police, by claiming that she had seen the contents of the accused’s pockets on the night of 4 April 2013, and he had not then been in possession of a knife of any description.
	
	
	The witness finished giving evidence in chief at one o’clock on 25 March 2015. At 2pm that day, in the absence of the jury, counsel for the accused advised the Court that he had what was referred to as an “ethical dilemma” in relation to which he required advice from senior counsel. An adjournment of the trial was sought pending resolution of the ethical dilemma. The trial was stood over until the following day.
	
	
	On 26 March 2015, in the absence of the jury, Mr. Cavanagh sought the Court’s leave to withdraw from further representing the accused. He referred to “insuperable ethical conflicts”, emphasising that there was more than one such conflict. Although no detail was provided because Counsel considered himself restricted in what he could say by legal professional privilege, he advised the Court that the accused had changed his instructions in some significant respect, with counsel additionally placed in a position where he might himself be obliged to give evidence in the trial. His position and that of his instructing solicitor was such that he could have, as I understood it, been obliged to either mislead the Court, or to put the accused’s case without proper vigour, if he was required to continue in the trial.
	
	
	The Court was not given any further information beyond that somewhat opaque account for the reasons behind Mr. Cavanagh’s application for leave to withdraw. Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory information, I granted leave to Mr. Cavanagh and his instructing solicitor to withdraw. Even on the limited information provided to the Court it seemed clear that both counsel and his instructing solicitor had been placed in an untenable position by some significant variation in the accused’s instructions to them.
	
	
	What I could not ultimately determine was the reasonableness or otherwise of the alteration to the accused’s instructions. This was not an irrelevant consideration.
	
	
	On one view of the matter, and having regard to the chronology of the amended instructions, it is possible that the variation was connected with the evidence given by Ms. Houston, evidence which was unhelpful to the accused. Where there is such a background, and even without it, it is always necessary for the Court to be alive to the possibility that its processes may be manipulated, and to prevent any such manipulation from occurring.
	
	
	On balance, I could not conclude that the accused had acted as he did to secure an adjournment of his trial. I think it is unlikely that he would have had sufficient knowledge of either legal procedure or the ethical obligations applicable to lawyers to alter his instructions in a deliberate attempt to precipitate the withdrawal of his counsel, and the frustration of the trial process.
	
	
	After Mr. Cavanagh and his instructing solicitor were granted leave to withdraw, the jury was told that the accused’s former representatives were not able to continue and the trial was adjourned to allow the accused time to obtain new representatives.
	
	
	The accused obtained alternative representation during the course of that day, and Mr. Flynn of counsel, instructed by another firm of solicitors, thereafter appeared for and with the accused.
	
	
	On coming in to the matter on 26 March 2015 Mr. Flynn made an application for the discharge of the jury (the second such application in the trial). The basis of the application was that the accused would be impermissibly prejudiced by having new counsel appear for him. It was submitted that counsel was not familiar with the matter and could not be as familiar with it as would be the case had the same counsel been instructed in the matter from the outset. It was also submitted that Mr. Cavanagh had conducted the accused’s case in a particular way, with Mr. Flynn restrained to a degree by the way in which the trial had been hitherto conducted.
	
	
	The application was opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn’s task was a difficult, but by no means an impossible, one. Whilst accepting instructions to appear for an accused person in a part-heard trial places counsel in a difficult situation personally, that is not a disadvantage that necessarily flows to the accused.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn is a very experienced barrister, and the trial transcript was immediately made available to him, as was the brief of evidence. He could be and was given sufficient time to go through the transcript and witness statements and to obtain full instructions. This should have been sufficient to address any possibility of disadvantage to the accused as a consequence of the change of representation.
	
	
	Whilst the interests of the accused were a significant consideration, so too were the community’s interests in the expeditious determination of trial matters: R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286. At this advanced stage of the trial, all of the significant witnesses had given evidence and the jury had attended to that evidence over the eleven days of the trial.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances I concluded that there was no real prejudice to the accused, and I refused the second application to discharge the jury: R v Scott (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 460.
	
	
	A short adjournment (from Thursday 26 March 2015 to Monday 30 March 2015) to allow counsel to finalise instructions, followed.
	
	
	On 30 March 2015, prior to any further evidence being taken, the accused made another application that the jury be discharged, that being the third application of that nature made by the accused.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn contended that, as he had not had the advantage of seeing the witnesses as each gave evidence, and of seeing the jury as the evidence was given, there was necessarily prejudice to the accused, in that his counsel would not be in a position to make assessments of the credit of particular witnesses, or of any response from jurors to individual witnesses.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application.
	
	
	It is acknowledged that a transcript of evidence cannot recreate the demeanour of a witness, or reflect any apparent reaction to a witness from members of the jury, the latter being at least theoretically discernible by observation. It is also acknowledged that it is a difficult task for counsel who accepts instructions to act for an accused person in a part-heard jury trial.
	
	
	However, I did not regard that situation as inevitably creating insurmountable prejudice to the accused such that his trial, then at the twelfth day of evidence, and having heard from thirty-three witnesses, should proceed no further.
	
	
	The accused was present in Court when each witness gave evidence and, whilst his observations of witnesses or jurors could not be expected to be of the same nature as those made by a lawyer, the accused could discuss his observations and impressions of witnesses with counsel. Equally, there was no impediment to Mr. Flynn discussing the case with counsel previously instructed, and gaining the benefit of counsel’s contemporaneous observations of witnesses and the jury. To do so would not trespass on any issue of conflict, and that course was open to Mr. Flynn, as he acknowledged.
	
	
	I do not accept that it is impossible to gain a proper and sufficient understanding of the evidence and issues in a part-heard trial from a transcript to competently represent the interests of a party for the balance of the trial. Whilst a transcript is not the perfect medium through which to convey a witness’ manner of speech, and nor can it reflect the intonation, emphasis, and delivery of the spoken word, it can and does adequately record the evidence in such a way that persons with legal training particularly, familiar with the procedure of a trial and with reading trial transcript, can gauge both the nature and flavour of a witness’ evidence.
	
	
	If that were not so, no appellate court could ever consider a ground of appeal against conviction that required an assessment to be made of the credibility and reliability of particular evidence. Plainly, that is not so. Appellate courts daily determine such questions and do so on the basis that, whilst the jury had the advantage of having seen and heard the evidence as it was given, the court is, nevertheless, able to determine not just the sufficiency of evidence, but also its quality: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 48 at [7]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [13]; Mansaray v R [2015] NSWCCA 40 at [59] – [60].
	
	
	For those reasons I refused the third application to discharge the jury: R v Scott (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 461.
	
	
	The accused’s fourth application for a discharge of the jury was made on 2 April 2015, after the Crown case had closed, on what was the fifteenth day of the trial.
	
	
	The application was precipitated by some evidence that was before the jury as part of Exhibit V, a series of recordings of telephone calls from the accused to other persons after he had been charged by the police, together with transcripts of each call as an aide memoire to the exhibit.
	
	
	Exhibit V was tendered by the Crown on 24 March 2015, without objection from the accused, then represented by Mr. Cavanagh.
	
	
	There had been some dispute about the admissibility of one of the recorded calls which the Crown sought to tender, and that dispute had been dealt with on the first day of the trial. The evidence then objected to was not the evidence Mr. Flynn referred to in making the fourth application for a discharge of the jury.
	
	
	Exhibit V contained recordings of twenty one telephone calls made between 2 June 2013 and 1 November 2013 by the accused. Calls 19 and 21 both contained a reference to “ice”. In call 19, the accused described the actions of Kayla Houston in inspecting the contents of his pockets on 4 April 2013 in these terms:
	


[…] she went through me pockets lookin’ for money and ice, and I had, I had ‘em both in my pocket”.


	
	In call 21, referring to the same activity, the accused said,
	


Hey, her and Deany know, right, because they went through me pocket lookin’ for fuckin’ ice and money, right, and I said “it’s in me pocket there”.


	
	Although these particular recordings were not played before the jury until 1 April 2015, all recordings had been tendered together as a single exhibit on 24 March 2015, and the jury had had access to the exhibit, which contained the transcripts of the calls, since that date. There had been no objection to that course from counsel then acting for the accused.
	
	
	The application for a discharge was made on the basis that this evidence, taken with the evidence of the accused having been in gaol (that grounded the first discharge application), had a cumulative effect that caused unfair and incurable prejudice. It was submitted that that prejudice could only be worsened by some other evidence placed before the jury on 24 March 2015 which dealt with an alleged attempt by the accused to have Crown witnesses intimidated such that each would withdraw their evidence.
	
	
	At T779:01 – T779:25 Kayla Houston had deposed that the accused had asked her to “staunch” particular witnesses. She defined that term to mean to intimidate or scare a witness, including by giving the witness a “hotshot”. She explained “hotshot” to mean a drug such as “ice” mixed with some other substance that was given to a person leading to illness or death.
	
	
	This evidence was led by the Crown without objection from the accused.
	
	
	Mr. Flynn submitted that the evidence should not have been led, should have been objected to, and was unfairly prejudicial in isolation, and in combination with the other matters referred to.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application, pointing out that the evidence was led without objection in circumstances where trial counsel had asked for, and been given, time on the first day of trial to consider the evidence of the gaol calls and take instructions. Having done so, objection was taken to one discrete part of one call, which related to the accused detailing discussions with his lawyers about the plea he might enter and whether the Crown might accept that he acted in self-defence, albeit excessive. The impugned evidence was not previously the subject of any disquiet.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the wider context of the trial – that the evidence referred to events and circumstances that had clearly arisen in an environment other than one peopled by the most law abiding of citizens, and that would have been apparent to the jury. Many of those concerned in the events were clearly living a criminal lifestyle, where drugs were a regular and unremarkable part of life, and time in gaol was nothing out of the ordinary.
	
	
	It was submitted that it was impossible to hide this from the jury, and it could be dealt with by direction.
	
	
	Having considered the matter, I concluded that, whilst there was potential prejudice to the accused, it was not inevitable and could be addressed by an appropriate direction.
	
	
	The Court is not privy to the reasoning behind counsel’s decision not to object to the evidence of “ice” in the accused’s pocket. The Crown submitted that the relevance of the evidence relating to the drug was as part of the false version that the accused was constructing for Kayla Houston to give as evidence to assist him. That interpretation is certainly open to the jury, and it may well have been why defence counsel did not object to the evidence. It could be concluded that the reference to Ms. Houston searching the accused’s pockets for drugs as well as money was intended to make the proposed false testimony more believable.
	
	
	In any event, it is not always possible to comprehensively sanitise evidence which is placed before a jury, and there is no general requirement that an attempt be made to do so. Questions of prejudice must be determined on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, rather than by reference to any generally applied proposition that evidence of familiarity with prison, or with drugs, must lead to prejudice.
	
	
	Here, it is quite likely that the jury would have had some idea that the accused was no stranger to a less than wholesome lifestyle. That feature of the case did not necessarily mean that the jury would be prejudiced against him, and incapable of deciding the case solely upon the evidence, applying the law to the facts as it finds those facts to be.
	
	
	I considered that, if given a clear direction that the jurors should not allow themselves to be prejudiced against the accused by such matters, and that they should set considerations of drug use, prison experience and the like entirely aside, there was no reason to conclude that the jury would not do as directed. Indeed, the notion that juries will do as they are directed underpins our criminal law.
	
	
	For these reasons the accused’s fourth application to discharge the jury was refused.
	
	
	Counsels’ addresses followed, with the defence address incomplete when the Court adjourned on the afternoon of 2 April 2015 for the Easter period.
	
	
	On 7 April 2015, when the trial resumed, a fifth application was made by the accused for the discharge of the jury.
	
	
	This application was based upon something that occurred during Mr. Flynn’s address on the afternoon of 2 April 2015. During his address, Mr. Flynn made reference to the evidence given by a witness, Brodie Jobson. In referring to the witness, Mr. Flynn, who had not seen Mr. Jobson and knew his evidence only by transcript, referred to him using the feminine pronoun. At one point (T1096:11) Mr. Flynn said,
	


Brodie Jobson, she was also at the car park.


	
	A juror called from the witness box “He”. The Crown Prosecutor, who had been invited by Mr. Flynn to correct any errors he may have made in address of such nature said, almost simultaneously, “He”. Mr. Flynn corrected himself and continued.
	
	
	The accused’s submission was that the interjection from the juror highlighted the prejudice to the accused inherent in having new counsel. It was contended for the accused,
	


[…] I can just point out that it was an interruption by a juror indicating that I didn’t even know the sex of the witness about whom I was addressing and that raises the issue as to whether the jury can properly accept that I was over the brief. Under those circumstances it reflects upon me and therefore on my abilities to properly represent the accused when continuing the trial. That’s yet another reason when added to all of the other reasons that I have raised earlier, your Honour, but that is an example of the prejudice that flows to the accused when that happens.


	
	The Crown opposed the application, made on the sixteenth day of the trial. The Crown submitted that the juror’s interjection was nothing more than an indication of the careful attention given to the addresses by an engaged jury who knew the evidence; it was submitted that it could in no way reflect adversely on Mr. Flynn, or have any prejudicial effect against the accused.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor referred to another, similar, interjection, where he had mistakenly referred to a direction as west, when it was in fact east, and a juror had called out to correct him. Whilst that interjection on 31 March 2015 does not appear in the transcript (at T1003:04), probably because there was no microphone near the juror to record the comment, it was certainly made. As with the correction offered to Mr. Flynn, I regarded it as having been advanced in a helpful way, by a juror who was clearly attending closely to the evidence, that being the very thing jurors are asked to do. I saw no implicit reprimand in it.
	
	
	My own observation of the interjection during Mr. Flynn’s address was that it was made in a very good humoured way, and in the same spirit of helpfulness as that in which the Crown Prosecutor was corrected. The particular juror was smiling, as were a number of the other jurors. I interpreted the juror’s act as an attempt to be helpful to counsel who, as all were aware, had not personally seen the witness. The interjection did not appear to embody some adverse opinion of Mr. Flynn, his capacity to represent the accused, or of the accused himself.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I see no reason to interpret the gesture as illustrative of some negative assessment of counsel that must itself have necessarily reflected adversely on the accused.
	
	
	Even were that a possibility, the slight risk of prejudice to the accused attaching from a negative view of counsel is readily capable of being addressed by direction. The jury will be told – in common with every jury in every criminal trial - that its task is to act judicially, without partiality or prejudice, and without allowing sympathy or emotion to sway its judgment. The jury will be called upon to use its common sense, wisdom, and sense of justice.
	
	
	Bearing in mind that direction, I do not think that there is any reasonable possibility that the circumstances advanced by the accused are such as to in fact give rise to prejudice against him.
	
	
	The additional question is whether all of the matters raised individually as grounding the five discrete applications for the discharge of the jury could, cumulatively, have the effect of causing irredeemable prejudice to the accused, such that he could not receive a fair trial, were the trial to continue.
	
	
	In support of his contention that there was such prejudice the accused did not identify any separate, or additional, prejudice to those earlier asserted to exist.
	
	
	For the reasons already given, I do not consider that the change of counsel in fact caused any material prejudice to the accused, either because of the disadvantage connected with Mr. Flynn not having personally observed witnesses, or arising from the case being conducted differently to the manner in which new counsel might have conducted it, or, due to any negative impression counsel may have made on the jury. These considerations might, theoretically, lead to prejudice, but did not in fact do so in circumstances where experienced and competent counsel came into the matter when it was part-heard. I do not consider this aspect of the matter to add to any additional danger of prejudice to the accused’s right to a fair trial, either taken alone or in conjunction with other matters. There remains the evidence of Mr. Russell having met the accused in prison, and that of drug use.
	
	
	Could the evidence suggesting that the accused had prior experience of the use or, at least, possession, of illicit drugs, and of time in prison, have a prejudicial effect which, cumulatively, was greater than the sum of its parts?
	
	
	Whilst there may be circumstances in which that could be so, I do not consider the circumstances applying here in fact give rise to such a heightened risk. The references to gaol and drug possession in the evidence were very much peripheral ones; there was no focus upon those aspects of the evidence by the parties and it is likely that the jury followed that lead. Even if the jury should be tempted to give that evidence some greater weight in combination than it deserved individually, that risk is capable of redress by appropriate direction.
	
	
	In the context of the trial, where casual acts of criminality by a number of individuals figured in the evidence, the impugned evidence did no more, in my opinion, than to place the accused against the background of the environment in which he moved and in which the offence is alleged to have occurred.
	
	
	Such prejudice as might arise can be readily dealt with by direction.
	
	
	In those circumstances, and having regard to the very advanced stage that the trial had reached, and the community’s expectation that trials once started will ordinarily be brought to finality, I declined the fifth application for the discharge of the jury.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Nature of proceedings

This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in relation to rulings on the admissibility of evidence by North DCJ on 19 February 2014 and 11 November 2014.


	
	Section 5F(3A) relevantly provides:
	


“5F(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.”


	
	The respondent has been charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years and in the alternative, indecent assault on a person under 16 years.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the respondent digitally penetrated the 7 year old complainant as they sat on a lounge at her grandmother’s house. They had been left alone when her mother went upstairs to change her younger son’s nappy. The complainant’s mother returned downstairs to get some baby wipes and was approaching a glass door that led into the lounge-room when she saw the respondent put his right hand in between her daughter’s legs, pull her shorts and underpants to one side, and then appear to push his fingers into the area of her daughter’s vagina. The mother confronted the respondent who then left.
	
	
	The matter has a most unfortunate history. The respondent’s trial has been fixed for hearing on six occasions: 2 October 2012, 27 May 2013, 5 August 2013, 17 February 2014, 21 July 2014 and 10 November 2014.
	
	
	On 19 February 2014 during the course of the trial which commenced on 17 February, North DCJ excluded DNA evidence relating to the presence of two male DNA profiles on the complainant’s underpants, one of which was consistent with that of the respondent. His Honour also excluded evidence relating to an area of staining, consistent with blood, on the interior crotch of the underpants and on the exterior hip. The trial continued thereafter but was aborted for other reasons after the Crown address.
	
	
	Another trial commenced on 10 November 2014 before North DCJ. The Crown sought to adduce evidence comprising a further DNA certificate providing evidence of the location of the complainant’s DNA in the underpants and referring to the presence of blood on the complainant’s underpants. The Crown also sought to adduce medical evidence which depended upon the admissibility of the DNA evidence for its admissibility. On 11 November 2014 North DCJ rejected the further DNA certificate and the medical evidence.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal relied upon by the DPP are:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in excluding the evidence of Michele Anne Franco in her expert certificate dated 18 July 2014 and a consequent order excluding the expert opinion of Dr Deborah Perkins in her addendum report of 16 July 2014.

Ground 2 – His Honour erred in excluding the evidence of Michele Anne Franco in her expert certificates dated 18 May 2012, 28 May 2013 and 1 July 2013.


	
	The matter has been stood over for trial in the District Court on 18 May 2015.
	


FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND CROWN CASE


	
	The complainant, who was then aged 7, with her mother and two brothers aged 8 and 1, was visiting her grandmother on 26 December 2011. The respondent who lived nearby was also present. The respondent was well known to the complainant’s mother and to the complainant. The grandmother’s home was on three levels, with the bedrooms on the top level and the lounge-room on the middle level. There was a stairwell between each floor with a glass door leading from the stairwell to the lounge-room.
	
	
	Between 8.30pm and 9pm the complainant’s mother left the lounge-room in order to change the youngest child’s nappy in one of the bedrooms. The respondent and the complainant remained alone in the lounge-room. After being upstairs for about ten minutes, the applicant’s mother decided to go downstairs to get some wipes and as she did so, she observed the respondent sitting next to the complainant. She then observed the complainant to engage in the conduct already described. At this time the complainant was wearing small pink and blue coloured shorts, underpants and a coloured t-shirt. In a later statement the complainant’s mother said that she also observed the respondent touch the complainant’s breast area.
	
	
	After the complainant’s mother had told the respondent to leave, and he had departed from the premises, she remained extremely upset and told her mother and another person, Ms Turner, who was also at the premises, what she had seen. At this time the complainant was also upset and crying.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother said that she took the complainant into the downstairs toilet where she pulled down her shorts and underwear to check if there was any bleeding. She did not notice any bleeding but saw some redness. The complainant’s mother contacted the authorities and police arrived at the scene at about 9.30pm.
	
	
	There was an issue before the primary judge as to exactly how the police came into possession of items of clothing belonging to the complainant. It was the complainant’s mother’s evidence that she removed the complainant’s shorts and underpants and handed them to a female police officer, Constable Allen. The police officer’s evidence is set out in a statement of 10 February 2012:
	


“Two ambulance officers arrived at the location. I then explained to [the complainant] that I needed to take the pants and underwear she was wearing with me. [The complainant] immediately started crying. [The complainant’s] mother spoke to her and convinced her to put her pyjamas on. [The complainant] went to the bathroom and came back out wearing her pyjamas. [The complainant] handed me her underwear and pants and I took them out to Inspector Cullen who gave me two brown exhibit bags. I put the underwear and pants in separate brown exhibit bags and handed the two bags to Constable Fischer. I then went in the ambulance with [the complainant] and her mother to the Sydney Children’s Hospital.”

It was Constable Allen’s recollection that she was wearing gloves when she was given the complainant’s clothing.


	
	There was apparently some delay at the Children’s Hospital and no examination was conducted that night, although a history was obtained. The complainant returned to the hospital the following afternoon where she was examined by Dr Deborah Perkins. During the examination of the complainant’s vagina, two discrete areas of erythema, or redness of the skin, were identified. One was at the five o’clock position on the inner vestibule wall with some extension up the left vestibule wall of the vagina. The second area was on the right vestibule wall. The vestibule is the area immediately in front of the hymen. The hymen showed no evidence of injury.
	
	
	The complainant was interviewed at 1.10pm on 27 December 2011. During that interview she told police that the respondent, whom she referred to as “Alex”, was her “nan’s next door neighbour”. She said that he touched her on her “rude part”. When asked about touching, the applicant said it was “in my clothes”. She also referred to the touching as “deep” and “down”. The complainant said that when she was touched, she felt “sore” everywhere.
	
	
	Constable Allen, who received the complainant’s shorts and underpants, placed them in two separate exhibit bags, but did not herself mark each exhibit bag so as to identify its content. Although the two exhibit bags were entered into the police exhibit system, one of them was incorrectly marked as containing a singlet. The other was correctly marked as containing the complainant’s shorts. The contents of the exhibit bag which was wrongly marked as containing a singlet, were not forensically examined because there was no complaint at that time relating to the complainant’s upper body. Only the complainant’s shorts were forensically examined. Dr Franco, a DNA expert, prepared two reports concerning DNA found on the complainant’s shorts.
	
	
	On 30 May 2013 during the course of the trial which commenced on 27 May, the error in relation to the labelling of the exhibit bag containing the complainant’s underpants was detected. This led to the aborting of that trial. The evidence of the police officer who discovered the error (Detective Hector), was that when she opened the incorrectly labelled exhibit bag it was sealed and there was no evidence that the bag had been previously opened. When the underpants were discovered, they were referred to Dr Franco for DNA analysis.
	
	
	Three analysts’ certificates were produced by Dr Franco. Only the first and third certificates are relevant. Their content is as follows:
	


“Certificate 18/5/2012 – complainant’s shorts (the first certificate)

Upper inside front 

The DNA recovered (using the Profiler Plus System) is a mixture that originates from more than one individual. The major component of this mixture is consistent with originating from female individual “A”. The minor component is too weak and too complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors.

Additional DNA testing using the “Y-Filer System” was conducted. The Y-Filer profile recovered is a mixture that originates from two male individuals. Due to the complexity of the mixture, the profiles of the individual contributors could not be determined.

Lower Inside Front

The DNA recovered (using the Profiler Plus System) is a mixture that originates from more than one individual. The major component of this mixture is consistent with originating from female individual “A”. The minor component is too weak and too complex to determine the profiles of individual contributors.

Additional DNA testing using the “Y-Filer System” was conducted. The Y-Filer profile recovered is a mixture that originates from at least three male individuals. The major component of the mixture matches the Y-Filer profile of Shaheed Ali. Therefore Shaheed Ali cannot be excluded as the major source of male DNA recovered in the mixture. In addition, all male relatives on the paternal line and approximately 1 in 750 unrelated males in the general population cannot be excluded. The minor component is too weak and complex to determine an individual profile.”

Certificate 1/7/2013 – complainant’s underpants (the third certificate)

Exterior crotch

DNA testing using the Y-Filer System was conducted. The male DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from at least two individuals.

Due to the complexity of the mixture, the profiles of the individual contributors could not be determined.

Exterior rear right side

DNA testing using the Y-Filer System was conducted. The male DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from at least two individuals. Due to the complexity of the mixture, the profiles of the individual contributors could not be determined.

Interior crotch

Positive screening test for blood – DNA testing using the Y-Filer System was conducted. The male DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from more than one individual. The major component of this mixture matches the Y-Filer profiler of Shaheed Ali and is also expected to match all males of his paternal line. Additionally, this major profile is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 750 unrelated individuals in the general population. The minor component is too weak to determine the profiles of the individual contributors.

Stain on exterior left hip – Positive screening test for blood. The DNA recovered is consistent with originating from individual “A”.

Stain on interior crotch – Positive screening test for blood. The DNA recovered is consistent with originating from individual “A”.”

In cross-examination it was made clear that the screening test for blood was a presumptive or indicative test.

The ruling as to admissibility of 19 February 2014


	
	Following a three day voir dire on the admissibility of the DNA Certificates, North DCJ excluded the evidence. His Honour’s process of reasoning was as follows.
	
	
	His Honour reviewed the evidence on the voir dire, paying particular attention to the mislabelling of the exhibit bag which was found to contain the complainant’s underpants and the explanation for why the underpants had not been forensically examined until June – July 2013. His Honour said in relation to the evidence of Dr Perkins:
	


“Dr Deborah Perkins was called on the voir dire. The accused objected to parts of her opinion in her expert certificate dated 29.12.2011. This was on a discrete issue and I allowed her to say under the heading “opinion” in her expert certificate dated 19 January 2012 the following: “The findings of two discrete areas of erythema in the vestibule could be consistent with the allegation”. In doing so I accepted that her original opinion in this regard contained evidence where any probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.”

It should be noted that no complaint has been made by the Crown in relation to this part of his Honour’s ruling.


	
	His Honour then set out the contents of the three DNA certificates and reviewed the evidence of Dr Franco. His Honour noted that Dr Franco acknowledged the possibility of secondary transfer of DNA but that she thought it was more likely that an indirect transfer of DNA would come from a bodily fluid such as saliva. Dr Franco said that there were many variables associated with the secondary transfer of DNA and that something was less likely to be found on the inside of a garment than on the outside. Dr Franco agreed that sweating could help secondary transfer but that bodily fluid was more likely than skin cells to transfer DNA.
	
	
	Having reviewed the evidence, the primary judge expressed concern as to the continuity of custody of the garments which were the subject of the DNA certificates, in particular the underpants. His Honour noted that there was evidence from the complainant’s mother that she handed the complainant’s clothing to the police but that the evidence of the complainant and Constable Allen was that the complainant had removed the clothing herself and handed it to Constable Allen.
	
	
	His Honour noted the concessions by Dr Franco as to the possibility of secondary transfer of DNA onto the underpants. He also noted the presence of other male DNA on the underpants which in his opinion had not been satisfactorily explained.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the evidence left open the distinct possibility that contamination and/or transference of the DNA onto the underpants had occurred. He found that no-one had posited a theory as to how the other male DNA, not in anyway associated with the respondent, was found on the underpants. He noted that the respondent had been physically close to the complainant from time to time during the day before the incident was alleged to have occurred.
	
	
	His Honour expressed his conclusions as follows:
	


“In these circumstances I find that the DNA evidence has relatively slight probative value given the issues surrounding its retrieval and the lack of continuity, combined with the fact that the accused and the complainant were in close contact leading up to the alleged offence. Further there is the presence of other male DNA which cannot be satisfactorily explained given the evidence:

…

Given the fact that there is no satisfactory explanation for other male DNA and the complete breakdown in continuity means that this might not only be unfairly prejudicial to the accused under s135(a) but also could be misleading or confusing to a jury under s135(b).

It is difficult to see what a jury would make of the number of people who may have come in contact with the clothing or with the complainant prior to it being analysed. Further it could be misleading and confusing for a jury to hear of other male DNA being recovered albeit not being able to be profiled.”


	
	By reference to s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) his Honour said:
	


“The section is concerned with the admissibility of evidence and it is necessary to look at the whole evidence in the context of the case. Here the retrieval of the evidence from the child and its subsequent continuity is shrouded in doubt. It is not certain who handled the clothing and why the underwear, which was the most important piece of clothing in the whole case, came to be labelled ""singlet top"".

The possibility of contamination and of secondary transfer is real in the circumstances of this case.

There must be a real risk and not a hypothetical one that the probative value of the evidence will be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

Section 137 applies where the jury may give more weight to a particular piece of evidence than it deserves. (See R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520) because there is some prejudice emanating from the evidence that will be likely to cause the jury to overreact to it in an illogical or irrational manner.

Here I do not think that there are directions or warnings that could be given to the jury because of the uncertain nature of what happened to this evidence from the moment police sought to retrieve it up until it was finally tested.

Keeping in mind also s90 the general discretion to exclude admissions or facts I am satisfied that due to the lack of continuity and the distinct possibility of contamination and/or transference that the prejudicial value of this evidence outweighs its probative effect. This is not just any evidence as DNA carries with it the backing of science and may well be given more weight by a jury.”

Ruling on Admissibility on 11 November 2014


	
	On 18 July 2014 Dr Franco provided a further certificate identifying the female DNA located in the area of the discolouration or stain, thought to be blood, on the inside crotch and left outside hip of the underpants as that of the complainant. The complainant’s DNA sample had been provided for comparative analysis on 7 July 2014. Testing was done on the stain found on the left hip to establish that it was human blood. As at the date of the second ruling, this level of testing was not done for the blood found on the interior crotch area. In this area the presumptive test result was positive for blood but not that the blood belonged to the complainant.
	
	
	At the commencement of the trial on 10 November 2014 which was again before North DCJ, the admissibility of this fourth certificate and further medical evidence was objected to. The Crown accepted that the admissibility of the further medical evidence was dependent on the fourth DNA certificate being admitted.
	
	
	Evidence was taken from Dr Franco. She confirmed that the stain on the left hip was definitely blood. She said that in relation to the stain on the interior crotch, a screening test was presumptively positive for blood and because the DNA located there was from a very strong source, it was her conclusion that the stain was most likely blood from the complainant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the material in the fourth certificate was not caught by his Honour’s earlier ruling because it confirmed that the female DNA profile, located within an area of staining on the interior crotch area, was likely from blood. The Crown submitted that his Honour’s previous ruling related to the admissibility of the location of the respondent’s DNA, not that of the complainant. The Crown submitted that the significance of the blood stains had not been raised in his Honour’s previous ruling.
	
	
	The additional evidence of Dr Perkins also relied upon by the Crown was:
	


“The relevant findings during the medical examination of [the complainant] conducted at the Child Protection Unit at Sydney Children’s Hospital on 27 December were as follows:

The genital examination performed by Dr Deborah Perkins with the aid of a colposcope revealed two discrete areas of erythema (redness) … The area at the 5 o’clock position was circular and measured approximately 6 mm in diameter and the area of erythema at the 11 o’clock position measured approximately 3 by 2 mm.

This redness most likely represents a residual to recent trauma. Trauma with a digit could cause this type of injury and the finding would support the application of digital penetration of the vulva area, approximately 20 hours prior to the examination.”


	
	The primary judge found that nothing had changed since his first ruling and that the fourth certificate, and the medical evidence relating to it, did not cure the problems of continuity, possible contamination or secondary transference. His Honour excluded the evidence.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, his Honour reviewed the further evidence of Dr Franco and noted that it was her opinion that the area tested from the interior of the crotch of the underpants contained the complainant’s blood which was a stronger amount of DNA than found in the left hip area which had been positively identified as the complainant’s blood. Dr Franco thought it was unlikely to result from touching by a finger, unless it was bleeding or unless it was loaded up with saliva.
	
	
	In relation to that evidence, his Honour noted that neither the mother nor Dr Perkins saw any blood and that Dr Perkins when describing her examination of the complainant made no mention of any blood. His Honour noted that the complainant’s mother said that she was specifically looking for blood and did not see any when she examined the complainant.
	
	
	His Honour’s conclusion was:
	


“However in my ruling in the second trial regarding the first three certificates I specifically mentioned the blood originating from “individual A” in two areas. What has changed? One area, the left hip, has been positively identified as blood belonging to the complainant. The crotch area contains, in Ms Franco’s opinion, blood also belonging to the complainant. The final test, as I have said, has not been done to positively identify it as blood.

However, all the other matters considered by me in rejecting the first three certificates remain the same. The underpants were possibly pulled down and handled by the mother. They were removed and handled by the complainant herself and they were handed by her to police and then handled by various police either putting it into a bag for forensic reasons and eventually mislabelled.

In my view nothing has changed apart from the left hip area being positively identified and Ms Franco being of the strong opinion that there was blood of the complainant in the area of the crotch on the interior of the underpants. This testing, in my view, does not cure the problems of continuity and possible contamination and/or secondary transference. Accordingly I intend to exclude exhibit “A” and it therefore it follows that I exclude exhibit “E”, the doctor’s addendum.”

The appeal pursuant to s5F(3A)


	
	It is convenient to deal first with the DPP’s second ground of appeal:
	


Ground 2 – His Honour erred in excluding the evidence of Michele Anne Franco in her expert certificates dated 18 May 2012, 28 May 2013 and 1 July 2013.


	
	The DPP submitted that the evidence of Dr Franco was that in relation to the inside crotch of the underpants, it was possible for the male DNA to have been deposited there by direct transfer. She said it was also possible for the male DNA to have been deposited there by indirect transfer if a number of variables aligned but that it was more likely for an indirect deposit to be on the outside of clothing rather than on the inside of clothing or on a more intimate part of the clothing because such places were not generally in contact with surfaces or other places where DNA could be deposited and transferred.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that the cross-examination of Dr Franco did not seek to cast doubt on the fact that the respondent’s DNA was on the inside of the complainant’s underpants but sought to offer an explanation as to how it may have got there. The issue raised by the defence was that the complainant may have acquired the respondent’s DNA on her hands during the course of her contact with him during the day and that she may have then transferred his DNA from her hands to her clothing when she removed her clothing and handed it to the police officer.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that ordinarily continuity in relation to clothing which produced DNA results and contamination were each issues of fact to be determined by the jury. It submitted that in this instance there was no good reason to exclude the DNA evidence. The DPP submitted that by basing his rejection of the evidence on issues of continuity of possession and the possibility of contamination of the underpants, his Honour had trespassed upon the function of the jury.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that the problems with continuity and contamination were significantly overstated. In relation to continuity, the DPP submitted that the police continuity chart and the evidence of police officers whose actions gave rise to that chart, did not provide a basis for a finding that continuity or chain of possession could not be established. The DPP submitted that while it was clear that the exhibit bag containing the underpants was wrongly labelled, there was no evidence that there had been any interference with the exhibit between when the underpants were placed in the exhibit bag by Constable Allen and when the error was discovered by Detective Hector. On the contrary, the evidence was that the exhibit bag marked “singlet” had remained sealed throughout that period. In any event, that issue remained a jury question.
	
	
	In relation to contamination, the Crown submitted that the only issue was whether the complainant’s mother, in addition to the complainant, had touched the underpants before they were handed by the complainant to Constable Allen. The presence of DNA from another male in a quantity too low for analysis on the underpants did not confound the finding of DNA consistent with that of the respondent. On the contrary, the presence in the household of the complainant’s two brothers and the explanation by Dr Franco of secondary transference of DNA provided an adequate explanation. Dr Franco gave a specific example of transfer of DNA in the wash, having noted that the complainant lived with her two brothers, each being a half brother with different fathers.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that it was not unusual for evidence relied on by the Crown to be open to more than one interpretation or being capable of giving rise to more than one inference. It submitted that this was not a basis for ruling the evidence inadmissible. Provided that the evidence was capable of bearing the interpretation, or of giving rise to the inference contended for by the Crown, it was admissible even if the defence were able to suggest some other interpretation or inference consistent with the innocence of an accused. Such a circumstance did not establish that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The DPP submitted that it was an essential function of a jury as judges of the facts, to determine what interpretation should be given to such evidence and that it was the jury and the jury alone which determined what inferences should be drawn from such evidence as they accepted.
	
	
	The DPP relied upon R v Kalajzich (1989) 39 A Crim R 415 at 430 where the Court (Yeldham, Carruthers and Wood JJ) approved the following statement of principle by McPherson J in R v Berrill [1982] Qd R 508; 5 A Crim R 431:
	


“Whether it (the evidence in question) in fact bears the interpretation placed upon it by the prosecution is a matter of inference, and as such, a matter of fact for the jury to whose decision it should ordinarily be left … . For the judge to withdraw it from the jury simply because some possible alternative inference is open involves a usurpation of the jury's function ….”


	
	The DPP submitted that the approach to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act by his Honour was contrary to the decisions of this Court in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363. The DPP submitted that in accordance with those decisions, his Honour’s task in determining the admissibility of the certificates required an assessment of whether the evidence was “capable” of establishing a particular issue. The DPP submitted that his Honour’s task did not require the assessment of the credibility, reliability or weight of such evidence since those were matters which should be left to the jury if the evidence were admitted.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that his Honour’s finding that the jury would overreact or approach the evidence in an illogical or irrational manner by reason of the fact that the certificates had the backing of science, understated the capacity of the jury to understand evidence which was not particularly complicated. The DPP submitted that the evidence of the respondent’s DNA being in the complainant’s underwear was not manifestly unreliable such that a jury would attach more weight to it than it deserved. The DPP disputed his Honour’s conclusion that no directions could be given to the jury as to the uncertain chain of continuity and that the importance of that issue was overstated by his Honour.
	
	
	The respondent raised no additional arguments beyond those which had been put to the primary judge. The respondent relied upon his Honour’s findings and his Honour’s reasoning.
	


Consideration


	
	The submissions of the DPP should be accepted. While there were difficulties with the chain of possession, and there was a possibility of contamination, those difficulties were overstated by his Honour. They were issues which were quite capable of being explained to the jury and understood by them. Most importantly, however, his Honour’s approach to the question was not in accordance with the proper application of s137 of the Evidence Act 1995. In R Shamouil Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said in relation to s137:
	


“60    The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.

…

64    To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible “basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function”. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137.”


	
	In R v XY Basten JA (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said in relation to s137:
	


“42   There are a number of points to make in relation to this statement. First, s 137 only requires the court to balance different qualities of particular evidence proffered by the prosecution (namely, probative value and unfair prejudice). It does not require assessment of the proffered evidence by reference to other aspects of the prosecution case. Nor does it require a balancing of the proffered evidence against conflicting evidence likely to be led for the defence: R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [43] per Simpson J.

43   Secondly, the proposition is concerned with issues of ""reliability and credibility"". It does not deny that an assessment must be made of the ""probative value"" of the proffered evidence. Rather, the Chief Justice noted the definition of ""probative value"" in the Dictionary to the Act as meaning ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"": at [61]. He noted that ""[t]he focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude"": at [61]. He further opined that reference in the definition to how the evidence could ""rationally"" affect the probability of a fact also directed attention ""to capability rather than weight"": at [62]. This proposition may be thought ambiguous, in that assessing ""the extent"" to which evidence could affect the probability of a fact is to assess its weight. Read in context, the reference to ""weight"" should be understood as a reference to the weight likely to be given to the evidence by the jury, acting rationally. It is that exercise which was rejected at [61].

44   Thirdly, adoption of ""a restrictive approach"" was not intended to exclude all consideration of credibility and reliability. There must be, as the Chief Justice noted, an initial assessment as to whether it was open to a jury acting reasonably to use the proffered evidence in assessing the existence of a fact. If the trial judge were satisfied that evidence could not rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue, it would not be relevant evidence and would therefore not be admissible: Evidence Act, ss 55 and 56. That, however, is not the end of the exercise. The extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the probability of a fact in issue involves an evaluative judgment. That judgment is not a forecast of the weight the jury is likely to give the evidence, nor is it a statement of the weight the judge would give the evidence. That is so for a number of reasons. For example, the evidence is being assessed in isolation: its ultimate weight will often depend upon circumstances not yet fully revealed. Were that not so, a different assessment might be made depending on the stage at which the question of admissibility was determined. Often it will be determined on a voir dire before the trial properly opens. It would be most unfortunate if the prosecution were required in some manner to call the whole of its case to demonstrate the probative value which the evidence, seen in context, would provide. Further, even if some overall assessment were required, as may be necessary in applying the s 5F(3A) test, it is likely to be undertaken, properly, on the papers and not by calling oral testimony.

45   Fourthly, the reasoning in Shamouil should not be extracted from its factual context. Mr Shamouil was charged with shooting a Mr Dawood (the victim). Shortly after he was shot, the victim provided a detailed description of the shooter to police. Less than three weeks later, he identified the shooter from a board containing 20 photographs. He later made a statement retracting his evidence. If his evidence had gone to a jury (as it did), there would have been issues as to credibility and as to the reliability of identification evidence, with its notorious difficulties. It was in this context that Spigelman CJ sought to focus on ""what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude"" and reject consideration of ""what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude"": at [61].

46   Fifthly, Spigelman CJ did not deny the need to assess the probative value of the evidence, taken at its highest, for the purpose of the ""weighing"" exercise prescribed by s 137. When discussing unfair prejudice, the Chief Justice referred to the following passage in the judgment of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51]:

""It is only when the probative value of evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. ... It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.""

47   The Chief Justice then noted at [74] in Shamouil:

""[The trial judge] said that 'juries can be seduced by unreliable identification evidence'. It was this which his Honour identified as constituting the 'real danger of unfair prejudice'. In this analysis his Honour makes no reference to the warning about unreliable evidence under s 165. Such a warning must be taken into account before drawing the conclusion that such prejudice as may arise would be 'unfair'.""

…

66   The importance of Shamouil lies not in the precise language used (the judgment is not to be treated as a statute) but in the general principle it articulates. The operation of that principle may vary depending upon the circumstances of the case. In broad terms, the principle has three elements:

(1)    in determining inadmissibility under s 137, the judge should assess the evidence proffered by the prosecution on the basis of its capacity to advance the prosecution case;

(2)    it follows from (1) that the judge should deal with the evidence on the basis of any inference or direct support for a fact in issue which would be available to a reasonable jury considering the proffered evidence, without speculating as to whether the jury would in fact accept the evidence and give it particular weight;

(3)    it also follows from (1) that the judge should not make his or her own findings as to whether or not to accept the inference or give the evidence particular weight.”


	
	Keeping in mind the above principles, when one applies s137 of the Evidence Act to the three DNA certificates, it is apparent that the section does not bar their admissibility. It is open to a jury, acting reasonably, to use the certificates in assessing whether the respondent committed the offences with which he has been charged. The capacity of the certificates to establish that issue, as distinct from the weight likely to be given to them, is substantial. Accordingly, the certificates have significant probative value.
	
	
	That has to be balanced against the capacity of the evidence to give rise to unfair prejudice, i.e. the likelihood that the jury would give the evidence more weight than it deserved or that it might inflame the jury or divert them from their task. For the reasons already given, such unfair prejudice is unlikely to arise given the relatively simple issues confronting the jury as to continuity, contamination and the possibility of secondary transfer. To the extent that there is such a risk, it can be adequately dealt with by appropriate directions. Directions of this kind relating to DNA evidence are frequently given by judges.
	
	
	The proposition that DNA evidence carries with it the backing of science is true of all DNA evidence. This does not mean it is unfair. The issue of whether too much weight might be given to such DNA evidence can be adequately cured by appropriate directions depending upon the nature of the evidence.
	
	
	It follows that when the balancing exercise required by s137 is appropriately carried out, the section does not preclude the admissibility of the three DNA certificates. This ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in excluding the evidence of Michele Anne Franco in her expert certificate dated 18 July 2014 and a consequent order excluding the expert opinion of Dr Deborah Perkins in her addendum report of 16 July 2014.


	
	The DPP repeated its submissions before the primary judge to the effect that the fourth certificate and the medical evidence were not covered by his Honour’s ruling of 19 February 2014. The DPP submitted that the February 2014 ruling related to the presence of the respondent’s DNA within the complainant’s underwear, not the admissibility of evidence relating to the staining on the underpants, which had presumptively tested positive for blood.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that the fourth certificate made it clear that the female DNA profile taken from the staining on both the exterior left hip and on the interior crotch was consistent with that of the complainant. Neither that fact nor the confirmation that the staining on the exterior left hip was human blood was previously known. That being so, the DPP submitted that the evidence could not fall within the ambit of the first ruling.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that the fact that there were observable blood stains on the underpants negated concerns about tampering and continuity. This is because insofar as the evidence related to the complainant’s blood on the underpants, there was no suggestion that this could have been influenced by contamination or otherwise.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that for the same reasons the additional evidence from Dr Perkins to the effect that the complainant could have bled with the type of erythema which she observed had significant probative value because it had the capacity to rebut a substantial part of the defence case. It was the defence case during the aborted trial that the complainant’s mother fabricated the allegation and caused her daughter to also fabricate the complaint.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that his Honour erred in the way in which he assessed the admissibility of the fourth certificate and the addendum to the report of Dr Perkins. This was because his Honour considered that this evidence was covered by his earlier ruling and had not carried out the balancing exercise required by s137. The DPP submitted that his Honour had not considered the probative value of the evidence and balanced it against any unfair prejudicial effect. The DPP submitted that the fourth certificate and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report were clearly fresh evidence and could not fall within the ambit of his Honour’s previous ruling.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that had his Honour carried out the balancing exercise required by s137, he would have realised that the issue of continuity simply did not arise insofar as the complainant’s blood on the underpants was concerned. This was because there was observable staining on the complainant’s underwear in circumstances where the underpants were recovered by police shortly after the offence and placed in an exhibit bag. This made it highly unlikely that the exhibit was tampered with or contaminated. There was no evidence of how that could possibly have taken place. The DPP submitted that the very fact that the underpants had been placed in a bag incorrectly labelled made the prospect of any interference or contamination much less likely.
	
	
	The DPP reiterated its earlier submissions that his Honour had erred in his approach to s137 generally in that matters of continuity and contamination were matters of fact and issues for the jury to consider and should not have been taken into account when considering admissibility. The DPP submitted that the lack of explanation of how the exhibits bag containing the underpants came to be mislabelled, that there was no adequate explanation for the failure to conduct testing before the second trial and that the previous trial had aborted due to the Crown’s closing address, were matters irrelevant to the admissibility of the fourth certificate and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report.
	
	
	The DPP submitted that the issue of whether the stain in the crotch of the underpants was blood from the complainant was an issue to be determined by the jury, having the benefit of the expert opinion of Dr Franco, to the effect that it was most likely the complainant’s blood. The DPP submitted that his Honour was in error when he acknowledged this conclusion of Dr Franco, but determined that in order to make this finding admissible there had to be a further test to positively identify the blood. The DPP submitted that in doing so, his Honour implicitly rejected the expert opinion of Dr Franco which was impermissible in the context of purporting to apply s137.
	
	
	The respondent relied upon the submissions which he had made to the primary judge and on the reasons given by the primary judge for rejecting the fourth certificate and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report.
	


Consideration


	
	The DPP’s submissions should be accepted. The fourth certificate and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report were not covered by the primary judge’s ruling of February 2014. They raised different issues and his Honour was required to carry out the balancing exercise mandated by s137, i.e. balancing the probative value of the evidence against unfair prejudice. This his Honour did not do.
	
	
	To the extent that his Honour purported to apply s137 to the admissibility of the fourth certificate and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report he was in error in that he did not consider the capacity of the evidence to establish the Crown case, but rather usurped the function of the jury by assessing its weight and reliability. In doing so, his Honour failed to follow the guidance provided by this Court in R v Shamouil  and R v XY. Had the balancing exercise required by s137 been carried out, the section would not have rendered the evidence inadmissible.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Sections 90, 135 and 136 of the Evidence Act 1995


	
	For the reasons already given, none of those sections provide a basis for his Honour rejecting the four DNA certificates and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report. To the extent that his Honour relied upon s90, he did so on the basis that the unreliability of the evidence would make it “unfair” to permit its use in the trial. Similar considerations applied to his Honour’s application of sections 135 and 136. The factors relevant to the application of these sections and the error in his Honour’s approach have been considered above.
	


Jurisdiction to intervene


	
	The respondent submitted that even if his Honour erred in the way in which he approached the application of sections 90, 135, 136 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, this did not enable the DPP to obtain an order under s5F(3A). The respondent submitted that the weight and reliability of the DNA certificates and the addendum to Dr Perkins’ report have to be taken into account by this Court when deciding whether the exclusion of the evidence substantially weakens the prosecution case. The respondent submitted that the findings and criticisms of the primary judge of the weight and reliability of that evidence had the effect that its absence would not “substantially weaken” the prosecution case. He submitted that the evidence was so weak that it would almost certainly be rejected by the jury, even if it were admissible.
	


Consideration


	
	This issue was considered by Simpson J in R v XY where her Honour said:
	


“119   Ironically enough, the evaluation of the importance of the evidence in question in the prosecution case involves a question similar to one which will be raised by the substantive appeal, should jurisdiction be established - to what extent, if at all, does this Court consider questions of the credibility, reliability, or weight of the evidence the subject of the appeal? In that context, in Shamouil, Spigelman CJ said:

""39    The issue is similar to that which arises when determining the probative value of evidence in the context of the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act, to which I will refer below. The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to 'the prosecution's case', to be considered as a 'case'. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown's evidence.

40    This Court should determine whether or not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence 'substantially weakens' the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. It is not desirable for this Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations.""”


	
	It is apparent from that statement of principle that the respondent’s submission is misconceived. What the Court looks at is the importance of the evidence in question on the assumption that the jury accept the evidence.
	
	
	In this case the evidence in question has particular importance because of credit issues associated with the evidence of the complainant’s mother. Her evidence as to what she observed the respondent doing would normally be the centrepiece of the Crown case. Based on what occurred in the aborted trial, that evidence will be challenged on the basis that she deliberately fabricated the allegation and persuaded the complainant to give evidence in accordance with it. In that context, the importance of the evidence in question is particularly significant because if accepted by the jury, it provides independent corroboration of the mother’s evidence.
	
	
	It follows that I am satisfied that if the evidence in question were excluded, the prosecution case would be substantially weakened so that the requirements of s5F(3A) have been made out by the DPP.
	


Orders


	
	On finding error in an appeal under s5F(3A), this Court usually vacates the trial judge’s ruling and remits the matter to be determined according to the Court’s decision. There is power, however, for the Court to determine that the evidence, the subject of the appeal is admissible (R v Chanthovixay [2004] NSWCCA 285 at [60] and R v Frangulis [2006] NSWCCA 363 at [35]). Pursuant to s5F(5)(b). the Court may “give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against”.
	
	
	In the present case, for the reasons already given, I am satisfied that the evidence has “probative value” which is not substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or cause or result in undue waste of time and is admissible for the purposes of sections 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Submissions in relation to the evidence in question have already been heard and evidence taken over five days in the District Court. Moreover, the history of this case is most unfortunate in that it has been listed for hearing on six occasions and has proceeded to hearing, at least in part, on three of those occasions. The matter has now been listed for hearing on 18 May 2015 and it is important for the parties that the matter proceed on that date without further delay. For those reasons, I have concluded that it is in the interests of justice for the Court to determine the issue of admissibility rather than to remit the matter for further argument in the District Court. When this proposal was put to the parties during the hearing of the appeal, both the DPP and the respondent agreed that this Court should determine the issue of admissibility rather than remit the matter to the District Court.
	
	
	When discussing the orders to be made, the Court determined that should the appeal be successful and the addendum to the report of Dr Perkins become admissible, the second last paragraph of that report should be amended so that it reads:
	


“This redness most likely represents a residual to recent trauma. Trauma with a digit could cause this type of injury and the findings are consistent with the allegation of digital penetration of the vulva area approximately 20 hours prior to the examination.”


	
	Accordingly, the orders which I propose are:
	



	
	The appeal by the DPP pursuant to s5F(3A) is allowed.
	
	
	The ruling of his Honour North DCJ on 19 February 2014 as to the admissibility of the DNA certificates, dated 18 May 2012, 28 May 2013 and 1 July 2013 and the ruling by his Honour of 11 November 2014 as to the admissibility of the DNA certificate, dated 18 July 2014, and the addendum to the report of Dr Deborah Perkins of 16 July 2014 are set aside.
	
	
	The DNA certificates of Michele Anne Franco of 18 May 2012, 28 May 2013, 1 July 2013 and 18 July 2014, together with the amended addendum to the report of Dr Deborah Perkins of 16 July 2014, are admissible in these proceedings.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2766473,Workcover v Brandown Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 261,"Judgment


	
	Brandown Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that by its acts and/or omissions it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of an employee George Laidlaw contrary to section 8(1) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (the Act).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is 5000 penalty units ($550,000): section 12(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	On the sentence hearing, Ms J McDonald appeared for the prosecutor and Mr Neild appeared for the offender.
	


Facts

The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts, which can be summarised as follows.

The offender operated a business recycling materials including dirt, bricks and plastic from its worksite located at Lot 90 Elizabeth Drive Kemps Creek, New South Wales (the site). The offender employed approximately 35 employees and 10 contractors, including Mr Laidlaw, Darlan Bartolome and Brendan Lowe.

Mr Laidlaw had been employed by the offender for approximately 12 to 14 months as a full-time plant operator and he usually worked in the recycling plant located at the site. Mr Bartolome had been employed by the offender for approximately 5 years as a fitter/mechanic and was involved in the work undertaken by Mr Laidlaw when he was injured. Mr Lowe was a contractor who was engaged by the offender to act as foreman at the site and to supervise the activities of 30 of its employees. Mr Lowe was an experienced plant operator and supervisor who had over 25 years experience and had been in the foreman/supervisor role at the site for approximately 22 months.

On 22 August 2011 Mr Laidlaw commenced work at 6.00am. He was directed by Mr Lowe to work in the Stockpile 4 area of the site and to operate the combined plant which consisted of:

a land fill grading machine (the Mustang trammel);

a mobile M40 conveyor that took oversized product away from the Mustang (the M40 conveyor); and

a mobile M100 conveyor that took fine product away from the Mustang (the M100 conveyor).

Mr Laidlaw had not previously worked in this area of the site or with the combined plant. Mr Laidlaw’s duties were primarily to operate an excavator to feed material into the Mustang, to be sorted and distributed by the conveyors. Mr Laidlaw’s duties included maintaining the operation of the conveyors, including removing any blockages from them.

The conveyors were operated by a common diesel engine and hydraulic system. The M40 conveyor was operated by use of the controls of the M100 conveyor. Mr Lowe instructed Mr Bartolome to instruct Mr Laidlaw on the start and stop procedures for the combined plant. Mr Bartolome showed Mr Laidlaw how to start and stop the conveyors. The informal induction given to Mr Laidlaw by Mr Bartolome was not documented and Mr Lowe did not make any enquiry as to the content of that induction.

Mr Laidlaw commenced work by cleaning mud off the combined plant that was present as a result of rainfall in the preceding days. At sometime after morning tea, Mr Lowe directed Mr Laidlaw to start feeding the Mustang with the dry land fill to be sorted. Mr Laidlaw used an excavator to put some dirt into the feed hopper of the Mustang, but noticed that the M40 conveyor was becoming blocked and thereby stopping intermittently.

Mr Laidlaw used the emergency stop button on the M100 conveyor to stop the combined plant. He attended the fitter’s shed, sought assistance from Mr Bartolome and telephoned Mr Lowe. Mr Laidlaw, Mr Bartolome and Mr Lowe then went to the combined plant to clear the blockage.

Mr Lowe instructed Mr Laidlaw to shovel dirt off the conveyor. Mr Laidlaw declined and during the course of the ensuing discussion Mr Bartolome climbed onto the conveyor and shovelled dirt from it. At about this time, Mr Lowe returned his car which was approximately 30m away to take a telephone call. Mr Bartolome then went to the control panel of the M100 conveyor which was approximately 10 to 15m away, so that he could start and stop the M40 conveyor on the verbal command of Mr Laidlaw. Mr Bartolome stopped the M40 conveyor by putting it into neutral with the use of a lever control on the M100 conveyor. Whilst the M40 conveyor was disengaged, the engine was still idling.

While the M40 conveyor was stopped, Mr Laidlaw used his hands to clear a build-up of material near the tail drum. He reached between the conveyor belt and the tail drum of the M40 conveyor when the conveyor started operating and his right arm was caught and dragged into the tail drum of the combined plant. Mr Laidlaw cried out and Mr Bartolome stopped the M40 conveyor.

As a result of the incident, Mr Laidlaw sustained crush injuries and severe lacerations to his right arm, including a fracture to the proximal end of his right radius and ulnar. He underwent surgery on 24 August 2011 where plates and screws were inserted.

The offender investigated the incident and found that it had 3 causes:


	
	the guarding of the tail drum of the M40 conveyor had been removed and was present in the Stockpile 4 area of the site within about 40m of the combined plant. It was agreed that another employee had observed the tail drum guard in situ on the M40 conveyor approximately 2 weeks before the incident and that to the best of Mr Lowe’s recollection it had been in situ until about one week prior to the incident. The offender had a Daily Machine Report (DMR) that included a section to be completed to verify that machinery guards were in place. The offender did not provide adequate supervision to ensure that the DMR was completed by a supervisor, Mr Laidlaw or another employee in relation to the combined plant in the relevant period leading up to the incident;
	
	
	the M40 conveyor had not been isolated. At the time of the incident the conveyor controls were in the neutral position, but it had not been isolated. The isolation of the M40 conveyor was required in order to prevent it from unexpectedly starting to operate, as it did. The isolation of the M40 conveyor required the switching off of the M100 conveyor engine and isolating the batteries;
	
	
	there was no specific Safe Work Procedure for the combined plant. Mr Laidlaw had been given some training relating to his work in the recycling plant, including being given the general warning that conveyors without a guard were a hazard and as to the various isolation procedures to be adopted within the recycling plant. Mr Laidlaw had not been provided with any job specific training, safety information or safety procedures in relation to the combined plant. Mr Laidlaw was not adequately supervised in circumstances where he was working for the first time on unfamiliar machinery. There was no risk assessment conducted on the day the incident to identify the risk and to replace the guarding. There was no emergency stop button or lanyard on the M40 conveyor. There was no specific isolation procedure for the M40 conveyor or the task that Mr Laidlaw and Mr Bartolome were performing on the day of the incident. In the circumstances the offender was in breach of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2001 and the Australian Standard AS1755 relating to the safety requirements of conveyors.
	


The offender complied with a prohibition notice and seven improvement notices issued on it by WorkCover in relation to the incident. It fitted guarding and signage to the M40 conveyor at a cost of approximately $10,000. It revised its Mine Safety Management Plan (MSMP) to ensure that it was up-to-date with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 at a cost of $4,500. The offender conducted a risk assessment for the combined plant and developed a Safe Work Procedure for the operation of the combined plant that included the following requirements:


	
	that the site supervisor ensure that employers are competent to perform their respective tasks in the safe operation of the combined plant, including having had an induction on the plant covering emergency stop location, its function and operation and the isolation procedures;
	
	
	the plant operator is to undertake a pre-start inspection to ensure that all guards are in place; and
	
	
	that the plant operator undertake the isolation procedures if it is decided to cease operation for any reason.
	


The offender has also retrained the relevant personnel in the isolation procedures.

Photographic evidence


	
	The prosecutor tendered a number of photographs of the combined plant. The photographs behind tab 4 of the Agreed Bundle were taken on the day of the incident. The photographs depicted an antiquated control mechanism for the combined plant with the following obvious deficiencies:
	



	
	the M40 conveyor was controlled from the control panel of the M100 conveyor;
	
	
	the labelling of the control panel on the M100 conveyor was incomplete, inadequate and misleading;
	
	
	there were no emergency stop buttons located on the M40 conveyor; and
	
	
	there was no mechanism provided to allow for a simplified isolation procedure.
	



	
	Further, the photographs depicted a lack of warning signs requiring workers to isolate the conveyors prior to removing any guarding.
	
	
	The photographs behind tab 5 of the Agreed Bundle were taken on 31 August 2011 depicted the combined plant after the guarding was refitted, the control system was revised and the warning signs were put in place.
	


The offender’s evidence


	
	The offender relied on an Affidavit of Terrence John Martin sworn 8 April 2015. Mr Martin was not required cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Martin has been the General Manager of the offender for the past 21 years. He is responsible for the overall management of the business operations including occupational health and safety matters. He deposed to the following salient matters.
	
	
	At the time of the incident the combined plant had only recently come into use on an “as required” basis when there were staff available to operate it. After the incident the combined plant has been dismantled and is no longer operational, although each of the individual parts are still used or available for use. The M40 conveyor was purchased in or around 2000 and the last recorded maintenance work was performed on it in or about June 2011. During a weekly inspection of the plant by the Site Engineer in the week prior to the incident the tail drum guarding was present. Mr Martin was unaware as to any reason why the guarding had been removed. He deposed that it was not common practice for guards to be removed without authorisation or unless the relevant isolation procedures had been undertaken and a risk assessment carried out.
	
	
	The offender adopted the MSMP in about 1994 following an inspection by a Mines Inspector who determined that the offender was undertaking mining activities and needed to be certified in accordance with the Mines Inspection Act 1901. The MSMP was intended to cover all aspects of occupational health and safety and incorporated measures for reviewing and monitoring safety systems including policies dealing with hazard identification, risk management, reporting of incidents and hazards, on-site inspection, safe work procedures training, supervision and maintenance of plant and equipment. The MSMP issued on 12 January 2010 and in force at the date of the incident was an exhibit to Mr Martin’s affidavit.
	
	
	In September 2010 the offender engaged in independent safety specialist to undertake a review and audit of the recycling plant and associated equipment and systems.
	
	
	The offender had incorporated reporting processes that included a weekly verification checklist to be completed by the supervisor and the DMR to be completed by each plant operator. Both forms sought to ensure and report that machinery guarding was in place.
	
	
	On hearing of Mr Laidlaw’s injury, Mr Martin telephoned for an ambulance and made arrangements for Mr Laidlaw’s son who was also employed by the offender at the site, to be with him until the ambulance arrived.
	
	
	Mr Laidlaw pursued a workers compensation claim against the offender and resigned from his employment in or about January 2014.
	
	
	Mr Martin acknowledged the failure to identify the risk of injury prior to requiring employees to work with the combined plant and allowing that work to be performed in the absence of the tail drum guard, which included a breakdown in the system of reporting.
	
	
	Mr Martin apologised for the serious personal injury sustained by Mr Laidlaw and for the breach of the relevant legislation.
	
	
	Mr Martin deposed to the offender’s commitment to use its best endeavours to comply with the relevant legislation.
	
	
	After the incident, the offender took steps other than those referred to in the Agreed Facts, which included:
	



	
	employing a Work Health and Safety Officer with a related entity, at a cost of $150,000 per annum, which is mostly born by the related entity;
	
	
	employing a Mechanical Engineer in the management team to provide an increased level of competency and supervision of all matters, including all safety matters, at a cost of approximately $200,000 per annum;
	
	
	modification of record keeping systems to ensure the completion of internal paperwork such as the DMRs;
	
	
	verification of competency assessments for Plant Operators together with other skills training.
	


Consideration


	
	Both the prosecution and the offender reminded me of the general principles to be applied in the sentencing process and I have had regard to those matters, which were helpfully set out in the written submissions of the parties.
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limted v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of forseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk of serious injury to a worker such as Mr Laidlaw was reasonably foreseeable and obviously so: a matter which was appropriately conceded by the offender. The risk of entrapment in the conveyor whilst it was operating had been identified and provided for by the fitting of the tail drum guard. The provision of the tail drum guard was required by the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2001 and the relevant Australian Standard.
	
	
	The operation of the M40 conveyor without the tail drum guard being fixed on the day of the incident exposed Mr Laidlaw to a risk of serious injury and was a circumstance of aggravation, but it was not the cause of the injury suffered. Mr Laidlaw’s injury was caused when he was engaged in clearing blockages from the conveyor where it was necessary to remove the tail drum guard to get access.
	
	
	The fact that the tail drum guard had only been removed for a period of about one or two weeks and that this was unknown to management of the offender is not a circumstance of mitigation in this case.
	
	
	If it sought to operate the combined plant the offender should have had in place a Safe Work Procedure for the combined plant that in particular required the isolation of the conveyor when the tail drum guard was removed. This also required the modification and upgrading of the control mechanisms to provide a simplified isolation procedure. The control system of the combined plant as depicted in the photographs referred to above, was plainly inadequate.
	
	
	Due to the absence of a Safe Work Procedure relating to the combined plant:
	



	
	Mr Laidlaw was given ad hoc instruction as to its operation; and
	
	
	Mr Bartolome failed to isolate conveyor when Mr Laidlaw was attempting to clear the blockage.
	



	
	The offender exposed Mr Laidlaw to a risk of injury from the combined plant which was heavy machinery that was configured and operated in an unsafe manner on the day of the incident.
	
	
	Mr Laidlaw suffered serious lacerations and crush injuries to the right arm that required surgery. Mr Laidlaw has not returned to work after the incident. He has pursued a workers compensation claim against the offender and evidence is unclear as to what his post injury capacity is. I accept the submission put on behalf of the offender that the risk of injury to Mr Laidlaw in the circumstances of this case did not include a risk of death.
	


Deterrence


	
	There is a requirement for the penalty imposed in relation to this offence to provide for general deterrence. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses, which are inherently dangerous to employees, that it is necessary to ensure that those businesses operate without risk to the health and safety of their employees.
	
	
	In this particular case, the requirement for the penalty imposed to provide for specific deterrence is significantly reduced for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the offender took immediate steps to replace the tail drum guard, install emergency stop buttons, install signage, revised the MSMP, adopted a Safe Work Procedure for the combined plant that included relevant isolation procedures.
	
	
	Second, the offender by its prior conduct, in the adoption of the MSMP and the provision of the tail drum guard, had demonstrated a significant commitment to workplace safety.
	
	
	Third, the offender has through Mr Martin has accepted responsibility for its failings that led to the incident and expressed an apology.
	
	
	Finally, the offender is no longer operating combined plant as part of its regular operation.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Laidlaw suffered serious crush injuries. Notwithstanding that the evidence as to the continuing effect on Mr Laidlaw is unclear, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries were substantial.
	


Mitigating factors.


	
	The offender does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that the offender has operated the relevant business since 1989.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Martin has accepted responsibility on behalf of the offender for the incident and the failures that led to it. He has acknowledged that Mr Laidlaw sustained “serious personal injury”. He has apologised for the incident and the breach of the relevant legislation. I am satisfied that the offender has demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offender was a person of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The evidence demonstrated that the offender had a serious commitment to workplace safety and when taken in conjunction with its lack of any prior convictions or the issue of any prior improvement notices over a period in excess of of 20 years I am satisfied that the offender was of good character.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the time of the incident the offender was operating the combined plant on a sporadic “as required” basis. The evidence is that after the incident, notwithstanding that it restored the guards and upgraded the safety equipment on the combined plant, that the offender has effectively decommissioned the combined plant. The systemic failures in this matter to which I have already referred predominantly related to the sporadic operation of the combined plant. In those circumstances and taking into account the offender’s previously unblemished history I am satisfied that the offender is unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32] The prosecutor accepted that the offenders plea was an early one. In the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Capacity to pay a fine


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	


In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:

(a)   such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

(b)   such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine.
	
	
	The offender did not put on any relevant evidence.
	


Penalty


	
	Taking all of those matters into account I find the appropriate penalty to be a fine of $120,000. In recognition of the early plea of guilty that sum is to be discounted by 25%.
	
	
	The offender is convicted and I impose a fine of $90,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	


Costs


	
	To give effect to the agreement of the parties, I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $37,000.

2766479,Kutschera v R [2015] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Lukas Gleeson (the deceased) at Muswellbrook on 21 July 2007. On 28 November 2008 Fullerton J sentenced him to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 years, commencing 21 July 2007 and expiring 20 July 2027, with a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months. An appeal against conviction (Kutschera v R [2010] NSWCCA 150) was dismissed.


	
	The applicant seeks to apply for leave to appeal out of time against the severity of his sentence on the following ground:
	


Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

Application for leave to appeal out of time


	
	The decision in Muldrock v The Queen  [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 was handed down on 5 October 2011. The effect of that decision was to overturn the approach to standard non-parole periods set out in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 which this Court had followed since Way was decided. Following the decision in Muldrock, Legal Aid established a review team whose task it was to identify matters where in its opinion “Muldrock error” had occurred.
	
	
	This matter was one of those identified by the review team. A further delay occurred after the decision in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 while the approach in that case was considered by the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 and O’Grady v The Queen [2014] HCA 38. The effect of those latter decisions was that the test for granting an extension of time for an appeal against sentence was whether the “interests of justice” required that an extension of time be granted. This would usually involve a consideration of the merits of the application.
	
	
	It follows that if the applicant is successful in establishing error of the kind relied upon, then the interests of justice would require that an extension of time be granted for the hearing of his application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Did Muldrock error occur?


	
	When this matter came before the Court, it was common ground that Muldrock error had occurred. It is clear that the primary judge did give determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. At [42] of her sentencing judgment (R v Michael Kutschera [2008] NSWSC 1271), her Honour said:
	


“42    Since I am satisfied that the offence is within the mid range of offending of its type, I am required by s 54B(2) of the Sentencing Act to impose the standard non-parole period of 20 years unless I am satisfied, by reference to s 21A of the Sentencing Act, that there are reasons for departing from it.”


	
	Given that approach, it was inevitable that in sentencing the applicant her Honour would engage in the two stage approach to sentencing, specifically disapproved by the plurality in Muldrock, i.e:
	


“28   … commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.”


	
	Since specific error has occurred in the sentencing process, in accordance with the guidance provided in Kentwell, it is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …”


	
	In exercising that discretion afresh, this Court has to take into account the factual findings by the primary judge except to the extent that those factual findings have been successfully challenged, or are subject to modification as a result of events which have occurred following the imposition of the original sentence. That is particularly so in cases such as this where the primary judge had the advantage of observing the applicant when he gave evidence at trial.
	


Factual Background


	
	On the evening of 20 July 2007 the deceased met with a number of his friends at a hotel in Muswellbrook to celebrate the 18th birthday of a young woman. The deceased arrived with a friend, Tony Matthews. The applicant and a friend of his, Mr Newbold, were also present at that hotel on that night. Neither the applicant nor Mr Newbold knew the deceased or any of those persons with him.
	
	
	At some point in the evening the deceased confronted Mr Newbold over unwanted attention which he was showing the young woman whose birthday was being celebrated. One of the deceased’s friends intervened and the matter was apparently settled without the argument descending into violence.
	
	
	The applicant left the hotel at about 2am, which was closing time. Once outside the hotel, he was involved in an incident with another patron in the course of which he was punched in the face by Tony Matthews. Mr Newbold intervened on his behalf and they walked away together.
	
	
	As the applicant and Mr Newbold were making their way along Sydney Street in the direction of the applicant’s home, they were verbally and then physically accosted by the deceased, Tony Matthews and two other men who approached them from behind. The applicant became embroiled in a fight either defending himself against a renewed attack by Tony Matthews, or defending Mr Newbold, or both. The deceased and the two other men were both well affected by alcohol as was Mr Newbold at this time.
	
	
	No finding was made as to whether or to what extent the applicant was affected by alcohol at that time.
	
	
	In the course of the fight the applicant was again punched to the face by Tony Matthews and had his head forced into an electricity box. Mr Newbold managed to become free of his attackers and ran off, pursued by the two other men. He hid in a house in a side street. His attackers did not find him and they left the area. The applicant also managed to escape from Tony Matthews and ran directly to his house which was approximately 300 metres away. Once there he got into his Nissan Patrol motor vehicle and headed back at high speed to where the fight had occurred.
	
	
	In the meantime, Tony Matthews and the deceased left the footpath a short distance from where the fight had taken place to urinate in a side alley. The deceased emerged from the alley before Tony Matthews at which time, quite coincidentally, Mr Newbold also emerged from the nearby side street where he had been hiding. The two men confronted one another and despite an attempt by Mr Newbold to end the dispute by the offer of a handshake, the deceased swung a punch at him. Both men fell or wrestled each other to the ground, in the process of which the deceased’s head struck the footpath. Mr Newbold succeeded in gaining the advantage over the deceased by pinning his shoulders to the ground. The two men were in this position when the applicant arrived in his Nissan Patrol.
	
	
	Her Honour made the following findings as to what happened next:
	


“15   Whatever the offender’s intentions might have been in getting his car and driving back along Sydney Street, there is nothing to suggest that he had any particular animus towards the deceased. At worst he may have intended a retaliatory attack on Tony Matthews as the person who had assaulted him twice within the space of less than an hour. Importantly, when he ran off and when he returned with the car he could not have known there was any resumption of the conflict between the deceased and Mr Newbold. I am further satisfied that it was only when he saw the two men fighting on the footpath (and likely identified Mr Newbold as one of them) that he made the decision to involve himself, and to use the car as a weapon of intervention. Were his intentions otherwise I fail to see how, in one continuous driving sequence, he would have crossed to the incorrect side of Sydney Street, mounted the footpath at the point where the driveway to the tyre yard crossed the footpath, ordered Mr Newbold to get out of the way and, by extending his head from the driver’s window, deliberately manoeuvre the front driver’s wheel at and over the person on the ground. When he saw Mr Newbold jump clear of the car he must have been aware that the deceased could not, or did not, move out of the way and, since he did not pause at this point, but instead accelerated at and across the deceased’s upper body as he lay prone on the footpath, I am satisfied that he did so with the intention of killing him. …”


	
	The deceased was effectively shunted under the front wheel of the Nissan Patrol along the footpath so that he ended on his stomach with his left cheek against the footpath and his neck at an acute angle. It was not clear whether the rear wheels of the vehicle also came in contact with the deceased at that time. The most significant injuries suffered by the deceased were to his head and neck and these would have caused immediate death.
	
	
	After driving over the deceased, the applicant drove off the gutter stopping momentarily to order Mr Newbold into the car. He then executed a U-turn and drove back to his house. The applicant did not know that at this time Tony Matthews was hiding in the alley and had seen everything. The applicant drove into his front yard and went into the house with Mr Newbold. Mr Newbold was extremely agitated and upset. The applicant left shortly thereafter in the Nissan Patrol, telling Mr Newbold that he was going back “to find the other guy”. After the applicant drove away, Mr Newbold went home on foot.
	
	
	The applicant drove to where he had killed the deceased and mounted the gutter and passed along the footpath a second time. The applicant took the opportunity when he found the scene apparently deserted, to see whether the deceased was dead or injured.
	
	
	The primary judge made the following observation in relation to this conduct by the applicant:
	


“25    … Suffice to say that quite apart from his chilling lack of empathy for the deceased, who he not only killed but who he had left lying on the footpath a second time, to be found, so far as he knew or cared, by a casual passer-by, his motives from this time and in the events that followed displayed nothing short of a calculated self interest.”


	
	When the applicant arrived at his home a second time, he washed the front wheels of his car and left it parked at the rear of his house. He drove to Mr Newbold’s home in a different car and persuaded Mr Newbold to accompany him to where he had left the deceased. He did this with a view to pretending to be a curious observer of a hit and run accident and to thereby deflect any unwanted attention in the event that the police were in attendance. In the meantime, Tony Matthews had called 000. The police and ambulance were in attendance as the applicant and Mr Newbold walked into the area. Mr Newbold was arrested, but the offender was allowed to go home. He was arrested later that morning, after Mr Newbold had been interviewed.
	


The sentence proceedings


	
	Her Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending at mid range:
	


“36   Despite the fact that I am satisfied that the offender only formed the intention to kill the deceased when he decided to manoeuvre the car at and over the upper body of the deceased, the fact that he used the vehicle at that time with deliberation and determination, coupled with the fact that he must be taken to have known that the deceased was vulnerable and unable to defend himself, is sufficient, in my view, to characterise the offending as within the mid range. … Although I am satisfied that there was no premeditation or planning involved, and that the probabilities favour a finding that the offender’s decision to drive over the deceased was impulsive and reactive to the circumstances in which he came upon the deceased and Mr Newbold, I am satisfied that this offence nevertheless falls within the mid range. His conduct and behaviour after the deceased was killed confirm my view that having formed the intention to kill he did so with a cold and calculated detachment and not as a result of loss of self control.”


	
	Her Honour considered that the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon was a serious aspect of the offending. In that regard, her Honour relied upon what Sully J said in R v Hall [2001] NSWCCA 202 at [66]:
	


“66   … When, as in the present appellant's case, the crime to be punished is not the crime of dangerous driving causing death, but the crime of murder where the murder weapon is a motor vehicle, then the foregoing statements of principle are strengthened even further, and must be applied accordingly by a primary sentencing Judge.”

Because the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon frequently involved young offenders, her Honour determined that general deterrence was a paramount consideration when framing an appropriate sentence.


	
	Her Honour took into account the applicant’s subjective case. She noted that on 1 January 2007 the applicant had committed offences comprising assault police, resist arrest, enter a vehicle without permission and possess/make an explosive without lawful purpose. Because of those matters, and his admitted polydrug use of many years, her Honour did not regard him as having an unblemished character. Nevertheless, she was not prepared to regard his criminal antecedents or his drug use as matters of aggravation. Even though this offence was committed while the applicant was subject to a bond to be of good behaviour, her Honour did not regard that as a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	Her Honour had available a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Walker, a pre-sentence report and favourable testimonials from the applicant’s friends and family. The applicant gave a history of chronic drug addiction and of regularly consuming large quantities of alcohol. Her Honour noted, however, that there was no evidence before her that the applicant was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol when he killed the deceased, or that the behavioural disorder identified by Dr Walker was relevant to his offending in any causative sense.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account that the applicant had had a disturbed upbringing in that his parents had separated when he was an infant. Although during his early years, he had resided with his mother in New South Wales, his father had gained custody of both him and his siblings when he was aged 7. He lived with his father until he was expelled from school at age 14 and by 16 was living alone. The applicant said that over the last three years he had had little contact with family members.
	
	
	Her Honour found it somewhat surprising that in contrast to the history recorded by Dr Walker, the testimonials from his family, in particular his older brother, described a close relationship between the applicant and his siblings. His brother and a step sister spoke of a shared and happy childhood with the applicant, including recent years. None of the family members spoke of his drug use. Her Honour accepted that the applicant had the love and support of his friends and family.
	
	
	In relation to rehabilitation, her Honour said:
	


“52    Because the offender has not acknowledged his guilt and has not given any explanation for his conduct or his motivations, or made known his attitude to his offending and the loss of life that resulted, I have only a very limited basis upon which to make any assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. I have been invited by his counsel to find his prospects are good by reason of his youth, his relatively minor criminal history, his history of employment and his family support. The fact that he is currently 26 years of age, and that he has been gainfully employed in the motor vehicle trade in various capacities since leaving high school, does not, in my view, advance his case on sentence any material distance having regard to the objective gravity of the offending and his determination to take no public responsibility for his actions. While I accept he has family support and that he came to adverse notice for the first time six months prior to the murder, I am unable, in the absence of any insight into the attitude of the offender, to make any meaningful assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.”

The applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant’s father died in February 2014, after having been unwell for several years. His ill health had prevented him being able to visit the applicant. In February 2011 the applicant admitted to his parole officer that he had caused the deceased’s death. The applicant had also told his mother that he was responsible for the deceased’s death. In recent affidavits, the applicant expressed sorrow for the deceased’s death and for the pain which it had caused his family. The applicant said that he was aged 24 at the time and had a “pretty negative attitude towards life”. He expressed a willingness to do all rehabilitation programs which were offered to him. He expressed a willingness to engage in a restorative justice program. The Court’s attention was drawn to reports on the applicant while in custody. Except for two minor breaches, these were very favourable. In an overall assessment made in November 2014, his performance was described as “excellent reports, good skills and attitude”.
	
	
	By reference to those matters, the applicant submitted that his subjective case was significantly stronger now than when he was sentenced by the primary judge. He submitted that his strong performance whilst in prison indicated good prospects for rehabilitation as did his acceptance of responsibility for the crime and his expressions of remorse.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that a notation made in his prison records, dated 18 February 2011, placed doubt on her Honour’s finding that “having formed the intention to kill he did so with a cold and calculated detachment and not as a result of loss of self control”. The notation in the prison records was:
	


“Whilst he pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence when he entered into custody he now admits to the offence which he attributes to an explosion of rage.”

The applicant submitted that this explanation was more consistent with an impulsive action on his part rather than as characterised by her Honour.


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour had given almost no weight to his subjective case and that this Court when re-exercising the sentencing discretion pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should do so, as well as taking into account the changes to his subjective case which had occurred since he was sentenced.
	


Consideration


	
	Apart from the fact that no challenge has been made to her Honour’s fact finding, I do not agree that an isolated reference to “an explosion of rage” in the prison records can provide a proper basis for overturning or ignoring an important finding of fact by the sentencing judge. This is particularly so when the entry in the prison records does not purport to be a verbatim statement of what the applicant said but at best is a summary.
	
	
	In any event, a proper reading of par [36] where her Honour made that finding, does not bear out the criticism which has been levelled against it. Her Honour found that there was no pre-meditation or planning involved and that the applicant’s decision to drive over the deceased was impulsive and reactive to the circumstances in which he came upon the deceased and Mr Newbold. That is fully consistent with an explosion of rage. Her Honour’s further finding as to the manner in which the applicant brought about the death of the deceased is not inconsistent with the initial reaction having been brought about by an explosion of rage. The point made by her Honour was that having decided “impulsively” to kill the deceased, the applicant went about that task in a cold and calculating manner by driving onto the footpath, directing Mr Newbold to get out of the way and then running over the deceased’s torso and head.
	
	
	The standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty of life imprisonment remain important guideposts for this offence. When taken with the circumstances surrounding its commission, it is clear that this was a very serious example of the offence of murder and well merited an assessment of objective seriousness in the middle of the range for offences of this kind. In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, the objective seriousness of the offence, together with considerations of general deterrence and denunciation, have to play an important part.
	
	
	The applicant’s subjective case at the time when he was sentenced was not particularly strong. While he had had a disturbed childhood, he was still held in high esteem by his family, who provided him with significant support. His drug abuse and alcohol abuse played no part in the offending. There have, however, been important changes to his subjective case between the time when he was sentenced and now. His acceptance of responsibility and expressions of remorse are important and need to be taken into account. His strong performance while in custody and the favourable reports which he has obtained while in prison are also important, particularly from the point of view of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Taking all those matters into account, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	The application for an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	The appeal against sentence is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by Fullerton J on 28 November 2008 is quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years to commence 21 July 2007 and to expire 20 July 2025, with a balance of term of 6 years expiring 20 July 2031.
	



	
	HALL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		28 April 2015",2015-04-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766485,WorkCover v Robertson [2015] NSWDC 367,"SENTENCE


	
	On 28 September 2010 on a building site at 233 Harris Street, Pyrmont Mr Adam Cash and Mr Stephen Holdsworth suffered injuries when a steel scaffolding board dislodged by a roll of blue mesh, protruding from a rising materials lift, fell some 30 metres onto them as they stood near the landing point of the hoist.
	
	
	Mr Cash and Mr Holdsworth were employees of Now Access and Scaffolding Solutions Pty Limited (Now Access) which company had contracted with Buildcorp Group Pty Limited, the head contractor to provide scaffolding and material hoists to the site.
	
	
	The defendant Mr Robertson was at the time the sole director of Now Access and attended upon the site once or twice a week to supervise. Mr Robertson admits that Now Access in contravention of section 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 failed to ensure the health and safety and welfare of Mr Cash and Mr Holdsworth. He pleads guilty to the charge that he, in contravention of section 26 of the Act, being in a position to influence the conduct of Now Access, failed to use all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the company.
	
	
	Now Access sub-contracted the installation of the hoist to Conveyer and Hoist Rentals Pty Limited (Conveyer and Hoist). That company installed the lifting mechanism of the hoist on 20 April 2010, five months before this accident.
	
	
	Because Now Access had not built the landing platform of the roof level, Conveyer and Hoist were unable to complete the works and in particular did not install interlocking gates at each level so as to prevent the hoist from operating unless all gates were closed. It also failed to erect an enclosure at ground level to prevent unauthorised access to the hoist.
	
	
	Employees of No Access were told by Mr Grey of Conveyer and Hoist that they must “sort out” the issues with the scaffolding before Conveyer and Hoist could complete the installation and commission of the hoist.
	
	
	Mr Robertson himself arranged the sub-contract with Conveyer and Hoist and was recorded as the contact person in the contract between the two companies. Although Mr Grey advised employees of No Access on the site that the hoist was not fit for use, a key was left in the control mechanism on the ground floor. Thereafter various tradesmen on the site operated the lift although they were neither trained nor licensed in its operation.
	
	
	On the day of the accident Mr Barton, an apprentice bricklayer then aged 19 and the employee of another sub-contractor operated the hoist to elevate working tools to level 7. Mr Barton was not licensed to operate the hoist and he took no steps to prevent the roll of blue mesh protruding from the hoist platform. He was untrained and uninstructed in the operating instructions of the hoist which required that nothing protrude from the platform.
	
	
	The essential failure of No Access was that it condoned the operation of the hoist by unqualified persons in circumstances where it had cause to know that the installation of the hoist was not complete and the operating mechanism was not enclosed. Confiscation of the key was the reasonably practical precaution that required no effort and no expense and was within the control of No Access.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The falling steel scaffold board struck Mr Holdsworth on his arm causing bruising and minor scarring. It struck Mr Cash on his head and, although he was protected by a safety helmet, he suffered a large haematoma on the left side of his head and fractured thoracic vertebra.
	
	
	Mr Cash suffers from permanent disabilities and psychological sequelae. He is unable to work and is afflicted by anxiety and nightmares. The substantial harm suffered by Mr Cash is an aggravating factor in sentence. The conduct of Mr Robertson and his company No Access fell seriously below the standards of reasonable men. The dangers were plain and the remedy simple. The objective seriousness of the offence falls on the graver side of the spectrum.
	


General Deterrence 


	
	The construction industry is notoriously dangerous and it is necessary that the penalty serve as a warning to others that failure to institute and maintain rigorous standards of safety may result in substantial detriment.
	


Specific Deterrence


	
	There is a limited need for specific deterrence. The defendant’s company has been dissolved and he no longer works in scaffolding. He is employed as a plumber and builder’s labourer.
	


Plea of Guilty


	
	Although the defendant did not offer a plea at the first available opportunity, his plea being offered one week before the matter was set down for a defended five day hearing, it appears that this failure was a consequence of impecuniosity, not having the means to obtain legal advice. I propose to discount the penalty in consequence of a plea of guilty made at the first available opportunity following his receipt of legal advice.
	


Subjective Considerations


	
	The following matters sound in mitigation: Full co-operation with Workcover investigation, persuasive evidence of deep remorse and the absence of prior convictions.
	


Ability to Pay


	
	Section 6 of the Fines    Act 1996 requires that I consider the defendant’s means to pay a penalty. Mr Robertson is bankrupt. He gives evidence that last year he earned a taxable income of $25,000. He says that he has been borrowing money from friends and family to pay his legal costs of this case. The maximum penalty fixed by the statute is $55,000.
	
	
	Although I am urged to grant to the defendant the provisions of section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I do not believe that it is appropriate in the present case.
	
	
	I accept that the defendant’s good character, his antecedents his mental condition and his remorse are factors weighing towards the grant of leniency. However this is not a trivial offence.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the impecuniosity of Mr Robertson a penalty of less than $10,000 would not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of this offence. It is appropriate to discount that amount by 25% in recognition of a plea of guilty.
	
	
	I convict the defendant and fine him $7,500. I order that Workcover have a moiety of the fine.
	
	
	Because an order that Mr Robertson also pay the prosecution costs would impose a disproportionate further penalty upon him I make no order for costs.

		15 February 2016",2015-04-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766494,Ceissman v R [2015] NSWCCA 74,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT:  Mr Adam Ceissman seeks leave to appeal, out of time, against his conviction on counts 8-22 of an indictment alleging 22 offences arising out of a series of robberies between 14 July and 28 August 2008 at bowling clubs and smash repairers in western Sydney. Mr Ceissman was tried before a judge and jury over 16 days in March and April 2010. He was represented at trial, by experienced counsel, but was unrepresented on appeal. The jury acquitted him of the offences relating to the first two bowling clubs (which were at Campbelltown and Ashbury), but convicted him of offences relating to the remaining clubs (at Moorefield, Canterbury and Mount Lewis).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, Mr Ceissman’s convictions are not attended by any of the errors he raises, and his appeal must be dismissed.
	


The 2010 Crown appeal


	
	There has already been a Crown appeal under ss 5F(2) and 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in this matter, which overlaps with one of the grounds of appeal, and which is best addressed immediately.
	
	
	The primary judge acceded to Mr Ceissman’s pre-trial application in March 2010 to sever the 22 counts in the indictment, so as to necessitate five separate trials, and rejected the Crown’s application to introduce tendency and coincidence evidence in the trial. The appeal was allowed:  R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50 (Ceissman). A convenient summary of the background is contained in [3]-[5] of the judgment of Latham J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed:  
	


“3 The 22 offences essentially arise out of five separate criminal enterprises, each one committed by two men (of whom one is the respondent on the Crown case), generally involving the theft of a car from a car yard, using a stolen vehicle to drive to a small to medium sized bowling club in the western district of Sydney in the early hours of the morning, breaking into a part of the club which is not secured by the club's alarm system (such as a toilet or store room), waiting within that area of the club until the arrival of staff in possession of keys to the safe, donning balaclavas before threatening the staff with a firearm (in respect of four of the robberies), robbing the club of cash, and either departing in the stolen vehicle or in the vehicle of a staff member. All of the offences occurred between 14 July 2008 and 28 August 2008.

4 An alleged co-offender, Robert McCarthy, pleaded guilty to the offences arising out of the robberies on four of the five bowling clubs and was sentenced on the basis that he would give evidence in the respondent’s trial to the effect that the taller of the two offenders, either depicted in close circuit television footage or described as such by witnesses, in each case was the respondent. The offences arising out of the robbery on the fifth bowling club (at Moorefields) are alleged to have been committed by the respondent and another man, and are the subject of admissions made by the respondent to Mr McCarthy.

5 The only issue in the trial of the offences is the identity of Mr McCarthy's co-offender in each case and the identity of the taller man in the Moorefields robbery.”


	
	By its judgment in 2010, this Court quashed the rulings of the primary judge as to severing the indictment and adducing tendency and coincidence evidence. The matter returned before the primary judge the following day, 23 March 2010, when the issues were refined. The parties were agreed that what remained after the decision of this Court was an evaluation under s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Counsel for Mr Ceissman maintained his objection, although he conceded that if the evidence be admissible “it would be conceded that the counts ought be heard together” (written submission, 23 March 2010, para 27). He emphasised what he said was the relative weakness of counts 8, 9 and 10, in which the Crown witness Mr McCarthy had not been a participant, but merely gave evidence of admissions by Mr Ceissman.
	
	
	Her Honour admitted the evidence as coincidence evidence, by decision delivered the following day, relying on the fact that directions to the jury as to “the cautious approach they must adopt when determining whether to accept [Mr McCarthy’s] evidence” produced the result that s 101 did not exclude the evidence. This aspect of her Honour’s ruling is not challenged on appeal.
	
	
	In relation to the evidence relating to counts 8, 9 and 10 (a point which is pressed on appeal), her Honour said:  
	


“Mr Averre submitted that I would more readily conclude in relation to counts 8, 9 and 10 that the probative value of the evidence of the related events is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the evidence. I cannot see that the prejudice is any greater than or is different in relation to those counts than it is in relation to the other counts.

I therefore propose to allow the Crown to rely as coincidence evidence on the facts and circumstances upon which he relies to establish each count to prove the accused committed each of the offences.”

Overview of the Crown case at trial


	
	The evidence adduced at trial substantially was as anticipated in the summary reproduced above from this Court’s judgment in 2010. There was no dispute as to the facts of the armed robberies or of the theft by two masked men of a car (either from a car yard or from an employee of the club). The issue at trial was whether the taller of the two robbers was Mr Ceissman. What follows deals only with the robberies in relation to which Mr Ceissman was convicted.
	
	
	In respect of the robbery at the Moorefield Bowling Club, the unchallenged evidence of the eyewitness was that the men wore hooded jackets with scarves wrapped around their heads. In respect of the robberies at the Canterbury and Mount Lewis Bowling Clubs, the witnesses said that the men wore balaclavas. The witnesses said that the robbers wore knitted gloves at the Canterbury Bowling Club, and pink rubber gloves at the Mount Lewis Bowling Club.
	
	
	Much of the extensive CCTV footage tendered at trial and seen by the jury is not included in the appeal books, but some stills from the Mount Lewis robbery were reproduced, which clearly show the men in black balaclavas and gloves (appeal book pages 275-280). Two balaclavas and four pink rubber gloves were recovered from a caravan used by Mr McCarthy in the execution of a search warrant on the day following the Mount Lewis Bowling Club robbery; the DNA obtained from one of the gloves and one of the balaclavas is the subject of the second proposed ground of appeal.
	
	
	As noted at the outset, Mr McCarthy gave evidence in the Crown case, to the effect that he and Mr Ceissman robbed, inter alia, the Canterbury and Mount Lewis bowling clubs, and that Mr Ceissman had told him of the Moorefield robbery on the day it took place.
	
	
	It is convenient to elaborate slightly aspects of each of the Moorefield, Canterbury and Mount Lewis robberies.
	


(a) Counts 8-10 – Moorefield Bowling Club 18 August 2008


	
	In the early hours of the morning of 18 August 2008, two men broke into and entered the Moorefield Bowling Club at Kogarah. They approached a cleaner working at the club, questioning him about the club’s safe. They did not obtain access to the safe.
	
	
	The cleaner gave evidence that the men were armed with a crow bar, and that one of them took two knives from the Club. He was locked in the club’s coolroom. He said that he had started shaking, and was given a can of coca cola. He told the robbers that he thought he was having a heart attack. He said that he told the robbers that they could extract the hoppers from the first five poker machines (the others had been left opened and empty) and explained how they could do so. He said that one of the robbers wanted his car keys but told him “Your car will be left local with the keys in it; we won’t do nothing to it.” Eventually, he found that $1366 had been taken from the five poker machines, and his car taken. He recovered his car about 500 yards from the club in a laneway. One of the knives taken from the club was found in the vehicle. He was not cross-examined on any of the evidence summarised above.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the two men were Mr Ceissman and a third co-offender, Mr Hy Trieu, who was known as “Heath”. Mr McCarthy gave evidence that he met Mr Ceissman at a hotel in Dulwich Hill later on 18 August 2008 where “he was tired as hell”. (The cross-examination based on telephone records suggested that they met around midday; not all of the telephone records were reproduced in the appeal books.) Mr McCarthy said that he was told that “him and Heath went to some place at Brighton Le Sands, bowling club, or there’s a club out that way … they found a club out there and that they actually held the club up.” He said that Mr Ceissman told him that they used a knife and a crowbar, they didn’t get any money but got some “loose coins only” because “the safe was locked”. He said:  
	


“They ambushed the guy inside, the old man inside. … he said they locked him up, locked him up in a fridge or a freezer, I think it’s a fridge. You know, he had a bit of a panic attack. The old man. At that point Adam said he was a little bit worried. They gave him a bit of water or something. Tried to calm him down. They asked – I think they asked the question because I think he turned around and said ‘I’m not the manager, I’m just a cleaner. … I can’t get access to the safe.’ … I asked him how they left. I think they took the car that belonged to the cleaner, the Ford Falcon. Him and Heath left in the Ford Falcon, I think, drove back to Adam’s car and left the scene.”


	
	Mr McCarthy said that he could not be 100% sure that Mr Ceissman was involved in this robbery: “I was not there, so 100%, I cannot say he was involved in that armed robbery. I can only say what he told me.”
	


(b) Counts 11-17 – Hong Kong Smash Repairs, 20 August 2008 and Canterbury Bowling Club, 23 August 2008


	
	The Crown case was that Messrs McCarthy and Ceissman broke into a smash repairer’s yard at Five Dock on or about 20 August, stole a yellow Mitsubishi Evo Lancer vehicle, drove to Dulwich Hill, collected a gun from Mr McCarthy’s caravan and drove towards Campbelltown. On the way they became involved in a police pursuit. Eventually the car was parked at Five Dock.
	
	
	Early in the morning of 23 August 2008, Messrs McCarthy and Ceissman drove to Canterbury Bowling Club and entered the club through a second storey window that went into the men’s toilet block. Mr McCarthy was armed with a sawn off shotgun. They sat there and waited for a couple of hours until two men and a woman arrived at the Club. Each of those three people was detained in the toilet block. One of the three, who had been threatened with the shotgun, “was starting to shake like a leaf and gone pale” so that one of the others pretended to have an asthma attack to distract their attention. The woman was directed to open the safe and the poker machines. Around $2000 in cash and boxes containing money from the poker machines were taken by the two. They took a set of Camry keys from one of the men, locked the employees in the safe, drove away in the Camry which was abandoned at Campsie, and recovered, with some damage, by police a few days later.
	
	
	One of the employees who had been detained in the toilet block said that the taller man had a missing tooth.
	


(c) Counts 18-22 – Mount Lewis Bowling Club, 28 August 2008


	
	The Crown case was that Messrs McCarthy and Ceissman drove the stolen Evo to the Mount Lewis Bowling Club arriving around 4 or 5am on 28 August 2008. They broke into the toilet block where they waited for more than an hour until two cleaners arrived. Again, they threatened these men with a gun, asked about the safe, but were told that they didn’t have keys for it. The safe was locked and the men decided to leave the Club. Mr Ceissman took the keys for a Commodore from one of the men, went outside, drove the Commodore to where they had left the Evo. They dumped the Commodore and drove away in the Evo. No money was taken.
	
	
	Mr McCarthy was arrested the following day, 29 August 2008, and identified the caravan, the gun, his clothes, the pink gloves and the balaclavas as his. He pleaded guilty to the robberies at Canterbury and Mount Lewis (as well as to the robberies at Campbelltown and Ashbury Bowling Clubs in respect of which Mr Ceissman was acquitted). He received a 25% discount for the plea, plus a further 25% discount on his sentence for the promise to assist in the Crown case against Mr Ceissman (all this was disclosed to the jury in his evidence in chief). He said he had a clear memory of committing the Canterbury and Mount Lewis robberies with Mr Ceissman: “Won’t remember all the details. Won’t have everything perfect, but my memory is quite clear that I committed that offence with Adam.”  He also gave a detailed account of being driven to Hong Kong Smash Repairs at Five Dock by Mr Ceissman, where he deliberately set the alarm off, waited for security to arrive and leave, then broke in and took the vehicle. He gave evidence in chief concerning covertly recorded transcripts of his telephone conversations with Mr Ceissman which referred to the stolen vehicle (“We’ll just get the Evo”) and a call in which he said he was telling Mr Ceissman how to disable its alarm and immobiliser.
	
	
	Mr Ceissman gave evidence and was cross-examined. He said that he knew of and had associated with Mr McCarthy, but denied participating in the robberies with him or with Mr Hy Trieu. He accepted that he had met Mr McCarthy on 18 August 2008, but denied admitting that he had robbed the Moorefield Bowling Club earlier that day. He knew of the Mitsubishi Evo, and had driven in it, but denied being involved in its theft.
	


Procedural history


	
	There have been a series of delays in the bringing of this appeal, some of which are attributable to the fact that Mr Ceissman is now unrepresented. He was convicted on 20 April 2010. A series of extensions of time were granted permitting an appeal against conviction by 12 April 2012. A notice of appeal dated 7 June 2012 was received by the Registry on 26 July 2012. A single page of typed submissions was supplied on 26 March 2014, leading to the hearing of the appeal set down on 17 April 2014 being vacated. Mr Ceissman has also served three handwritten pages of submissions dated 10 September 2014 to which were added two additional typed pages which were handed to the Court on 3 March 2015 when the appeal was heard, and marked MFI 1. Mr Ceissman briefly elaborated orally what had been put by him in writing.
	
	
	The handwritten submissions dated 10 September 2014 also annex four grounds of appeal and a trial summary. The submissions are directed to those four grounds of appeal, as are the submissions in MFI 1. They represent a slight narrowing of those identified in the original grounds of appeal filed 9 October 2013. Further, the written submissions in some respects travel beyond the grounds of appeal. Given that Mr Ceissman is unrepresented, what follows addresses all aspects of his challenge, irrespective of when the matters were raised.
	
	
	Although an extension of time is required, and there is no explanation for the series of delays, the essential aspects of the proposed appeal have remained constant and the appropriate course is to grant the requisite extension, so as to deal with the grounds on their merits.
	
	
	In the various documents he has provided, Mr Ceissman complains of four main matters.
	
	
	First, he maintains the submission advanced in the District Court by his former counsel on 23 March 2010, that counts 8, 9 and 10 should have been severed from the balance of the trial (grounds 3 and 5 of the notice of appeal filed 9 October 2013 and ground 1 of the grounds dated 10 September 2014).
	
	
	Secondly, he complains that DNA evidence linking him to material found in the pink rubber gloves and the balaclava should have been held inadmissible (ground 4 of the notice of appeal filed 9 October 2013 and ground 2 of the grounds of appeal dated 10 September 2014).
	
	
	Thirdly, he complains that the cleaner at the Moorefield Bowling Club gave limited identification evidence at the trial, and was not asked whether he could identity Mr Ceissman in the dock (ground 3 of the grounds of appeal dated 10 September 2014).
	
	
	Fourthly, he says that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable or unjust, by reason of the foregoing and also because of the unreliability of the Crown’s major witness Mr McCarthy (grounds 1, 2 and 6 of the notice of appeal filed 9 October 2013, ground 4 of the grounds of appeal dated 10 September 2014).
	
	
	Each of those complaints is addressed below in turn, before turning to some miscellaneous additional matters.
	


The ruling on counts 8, 9 and 10


	
	The outcome of the application for a separate trial of the allegations concerning the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery depended entirely upon the determination of the admissibility of coincidence evidence as provided by s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Section 98(1) relevantly provides:
	


“(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act … on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) …

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.”


	
	The coincidence evidence upon which the Crown relied was summarised in [3] of Ceissman (set out in [4] above).
	
	
	That, for the purposes of s 98(1) the evidence had significant probative value, is foreclosed by the decision of this Court in Ceissman at [16].
	
	
	The remaining question for the primary judge was that posed by s 101(2) of the Evidence Act: did the probative value of the coincidence evidence substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have had on the appellant?
	
	
	The question requires an evaluation of the probative value of the evidence balanced against an evaluation of its potential prejudicial effect. Both evaluations are to be undertaken by the trial judge on the basis of the information available at the time its admission is determined. The first evaluation (of probative value) is to be made on the assumption that the evidence said to constitute coincidence evidence is accepted by the tribunal of fact:  R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228.
	
	
	Even in the absence of the determination in Ceissman, it is clear that the evidence (as summarised in [3] thereof) potentially has very substantial probative value. The argument advanced in the District Court in favour of a separate trial of the counts concerning the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery appears to have been based on the relative weakness of the Crown case in contrast with the strength of the Crown case in respect of the other robberies. Apart from the proposed coincidence evidence, the Crown case, in respect of the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery, depended upon a description of the offender as a tall man with bad teeth (a description fitting the appellant), and the evidence of Mr McCarthy that the appellant admitted to him, on the day of the offence, that he had been one of the perpetrators.
	
	
	In his initial grounds of appeal, the appellant pointed out what he perceived as a distinguishing feature of the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery – that, in contrast with the other robberies, a “black firearm” was not used. Both arguments fail to address the issues that arise under s 101(2). Given the strong probative value of the evidence, the question is whether that probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. That requires focus upon any prejudice occasioned to the appellant by the admission of the evidence.
	
	
	The first thing to observe is that any evidence tendered by the Crown against an accused person can be taken to have a prejudicial effect. That is why it is tendered – to contribute to the proof of his/her guilt of a criminal offence. To be excluded by s 101(2), the evidence must have more than prejudicial effect of that kind.
	
	
	The primary judge held that the prejudicial effect of the coincidence evidence in relation to Counts 8 to 10 was “no greater than or … different in relation to those counts than … in relation to the other counts”.
	
	
	In that, she was correct.
	
	
	It must be remembered that the purpose of s 98 is to permit, where the requisite statutory safeguards are met, the admission of the evidence that proves, or contributes to proving, that two or more events did not occur coincidentally.
	
	
	The two or more events here in question were the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery and the other four robberies the subject of the indictment.
	
	
	There was evidence of a co-offender directly implicating both himself and the appellant in several of the robberies (the appellant was convicted of two of these). The improbability that the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery, having a number of the features of the Hong Kong Smash Repairs and Mount Lewis Bowling Club robberies, occurred coincidentally (but without the involvement of the appellant) was the fact sought to be proved by the tender of the coincidence evidence.
	
	
	That is precisely what s 98 directed to. This was a text book case of coincidence evidence.
	
	
	There was no prejudice to the appellant other than the prejudice that the coincidence evidence was capable of being seen by the jury as powerful evidence of his guilt of the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery.
	
	
	This ground of appeal must be rejected.
	


Partial DNA evidence


	
	This proposed ground turns upon expert evidence identifying DNA samples found, relevantly, in a pink rubber glove and a balaclava taken during execution of a search warrant at Mr McCarthy’s residence. The warrant was executed on 29 August 2008 (the day after the Mount Lewis robbery); the photograph of the balaclavas in evidence was taken at 12.50pm. The uncontroversial evidence was that a black backpack was found on one of the wheels of a caravan where Mr McCarthy spent time, which contained the gloves and the balaclavas. (The DNA evidence at trial also extended to identifying Mr Ceissman’s DNA on a green cap found near the Campbelltown Bowling Club, which Mr Ceissman accepted was his; it may be noted that he was acquitted of counts relating to that bowling club and save to note that it is mentioned in Mr Ceissman’s submissions, it is not necessary to say more about it.)
	
	
	This proposed ground complained that the DNA evidence relating to the pink gloves and the balaclava ought not to have been admitted because, unlike that relating to the green cap, it was a partial profile, in the sense explained below.
	
	
	In his submissions dated 26 March 2014, Mr Ceissman states:
	


“The Crown’s application did not stipulate that only one full DNA profile of the Appellant was recovered (being on 1x green cap) The remaining DNA evidence on said (1x Pink Gloves, 1x balaclava) was a partial profile, also a cross-contaminated DNA profile. The Crown’s application should have stated this to Her Honour Flannery DCJ.”


	
	In his submissions of 10 September 2014, he stated:
	


“Mr Cochrane [the Crown DNA expert] did not compare this D.N.A evidence with the rest of the criminal D.N.A database ... He only compared this evidence with the profiles of McCarthy and the accused, making his testimony to the jury extremely discriminative against the accused and statistical estimation completely bias.” [sic]


	
	In the written submissions supplied to the Court when the appeal was heard, he wrote:  
	


“Forensic biologist & police sergeant Mr Mark Cochrane’s evidence, under oath was in fact irrelevant, (except for the full D.N.A profile of the accused’s on a green cap at Campbelltown bowling club.) Mr Cochrane’s evidence was cogent for jurors and reflects in their verdicts on counts #11 to #22. The remaining D.N.A evidence on a black balaclava and a pink glove were a combination of a partial profile, as well as having less than half a profile it was cross-contaminated.”


	
	This ground must be rejected. First, expert DNA evidence was adduced by the Crown and by the defence (who called Professor Barry Boettcher) without objection. It is clear from the transcript of the trial that the report of the Crown’s expert had been provided in advance to Professor Boettcher. No objection was taken during the trial to the Crown evidence. That decision, made by experienced counsel appearing for Mr Ceissman, is of itself a powerful indication of the difficulties in this ground.
	
	
	Secondly, although Mr Ceissman’s submissions consistently assert that there was a partial DNA profile on the samples obtained from both the pink glove and the balaclava, in fact the profile recovered from one of the pink gloves was not a mixture. Mr Cochrane gave this evidence:
	


“Q:  In relation to the two pairs of rubber gloves, the pink ones, on one of the right gloves, was a profile recovered that was consistent with Adam Ceissman?

A:  The profile recovered from Adam Ceissman matched that profile recovered from that right glove, yes.

Q:  And what was the statistic on that chance happening?

A:  The approximate occurrence in the general population was fewer than one in 10 billion individuals.”


	
	It may be that the confusion is caused by the analysis of DNA taken from the other pink glove, which did reveal a mixture, described as follows:
	


“Q:  And was - because we’ve got four gloves for the two pairs – two left, two right – that was one of the right gloves; was the other right glove tested, and did that profile or did that reveal a profile consistent with Robert McCarthy with traces from at least one other individual that were too low to determine a profile?

A:  That’s correct.”


	
	But that does not undercut the force of the evidence relating to the DNA sample from the other pink glove. Accordingly, the complaint which is based upon the danger of partial DNA samples does not apply to the glove. It might readily be thought that there is little material difference between there being one item or two items containing DNA associated with Mr Ceissman being found on a caravan used by Mr McCarthy on the day after the Mount Lewis robbery took place.
	
	
	Thirdly, it must be said that the DNA obtained from the balaclava was quite different. The result of that analysis was a “mixed profile” from two sources. The process was described in evidence as follows:
	


“Q:  So, the attribution of the DNA mixture to McCarthy and Ceissman is actually based upon the DNA profiles of McCarthy and Ceissman?

A:  Firstly, independently, we check out to see if the mixture appears to originate from how many people. In this case, it appears that it’s originated from two individuals. We can’t differentiate between which person contributes certain DNA profiles to that. So what we do after that, we look at the DNA profiles that we recovered from their reference samples and we check them against the mixture. If they fit into the mixture, we do a statistical calculation based on them being able to fit into that mixture. If they don’t fit into that mixture, we exclude them as being contributors to that mixture. In this case, we could not exclude McCarthy and Ceissman as being contributors to the mixture. So, therefore, we did statistics based on what the weight is that it could be their profile as opposed to it might not be their profile; the mixture originated by chance from other people apart from them.”


	
	The following evidence was given in relation to what could be deduced from a mixed DNA profile:
	


“Q:  Thank you. And were the results a mixed profile which appears to originate from two individuals?

A:  That’s correct; there was a mixture that appeared to come from two people.

Q:  And who – well, was the profile consistent with the profiles - is that the right way to express it, consistent with the profiles of McCarthy and Ceissman?

A:  What we got was a mixture of two people. So, there were obviously two people in there. When we compared that mix of DNA profile, both McCarthy’s and Ceissman’s profile, they appeared to be within that profile. So, when combined together, they looked to be the whole profile, but both people fit into that mixture.

Q:  And what was the statistic for that?

A:  It’s greater than 10 billion times more likely to obtain this profile if it originated from McCarthy and Ceissman than from two unknown, unrelated individuals.”


	
	The point made by Professor Boettcher in the defence case was that the relative unlikelihood of the mixed DNA sample originating from Mr McCarthy and Mr Ceissman, as opposed to from two unknown and unrelated individuals, was much less than the unmixed DNA samples. As Professor Boettcher put it in chief:  
	


“We cannot exclude McCarthy and Ceissman, but we don’t know whose profiles they are. I can give you hundreds of profiles that would fit the mixture, and give you two people, neither of whom would be Mr McCarthy or Mr Ceissman.

Q:  That’s because it’s a mixture -

A:  Yes.

Q:  - rather than several individual bigger pigs which are mentioned about in relation to the green cap?

A:  That’s correct. You can’t separate those pieces of DNA and ascribe them to person A or to person B.”


	
	The Crown expert had merely said in his report that the DNA “could” originate from McCarthy and Ceissman, with which Professor Boettcher agreed. Further, it was common ground that if it were established that McCarthy’s DNA was one of the contributors to the mixture, then with an extremely high degree of likelihood, Mr Ceissman was the source of the other component.
	
	
	However, this goes only to show that Mr Ceissman’s complaint that parts of the DNA evidence were obtained from a “partial profile” is relevant to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility.
	
	
	In a case such as this, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (which prevents points being raised on appeal if they were not taken below) looms large. Leave should not be granted in respect of this ground.
	


Identification evidence


	
	Mr Ceissman’s submission is as follows:
	


“… [A] witness for the Crown in the Moorefields robbery … stated … ‘the robber’s scarf kept falling down, so I happened to see the faces’. Madam Crown refuses to ask the laydown misere question to the witness. With little independent evidence in counts #8, #9 and #10 to corroborate Mr McCarthy’s evidence, her Honour in her summation did not direct the jury correctly allowing the jury to return unjust and unreasonable verdicts.”


	
	This witness was a cleaner at the Moorefield bowling club who saw the two robbers on the morning of 18 August 2008. He said that he could see that one had bad teeth: they were “not white and just not very good teeth”. His evidence was:  
	


“[T]hese gentlemen didn’t have balaclavas or anything on, they had hoods on their jackets but they had a scarf, just a scarf wrapped around their thing and every time they sort of spoke the scarf would fall down. So this is how I happened to see the face.”


	
	The “laydown misere question” which was not asked of the witness and said to give rise to this ground of appeal was whether the face he saw was that of Mr Ceissman, by reference to him sitting in the dock. There are two reasons why this ground cannot be accepted. First, the witness did not claim that he could identify Mr Ceissman; he merely gave a description of the burglars. Secondly, such a question could not properly have been asked by the Crown in any event. There would first have needed to be an identification parade conducted pursuant to s 114(2) of the Evidence Act:  see Aslett v R [2009] NSWCCA 188 at [49].
	
	
	In short, far from being a “laydown misere question” which should have been asked and which could found a ground of appeal if it were not asked, it would have been quite wrong for the question to be asked. Again, although we can understand why Mr Ceissman makes the submission he makes, there is nothing in this point. This ground should be dismissed.
	


Unreasonable verdict


	
	Finally, Mr Ceissman seeks to invoke this Court’s power under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The question is whether it would be open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, “which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”:  Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14]. If leave is granted, it is necessary for this Court to weigh the competing evidence and make its own independent assessment:  SKA at [24]; BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48; 88 ALJR 101 at [31].
	
	
	Some difficulties stand in the way of that course. Mr Ceissman’s submissions on this ground are essentially confined to the unreliability of the evidence of the co-offender Mr McCarthy. However, the trial lasted for 16 days, and much of the documentary evidence (including telephone records and transcripts of conversations between Mr Ceissman and Mr McCarthy as to which there was extensive cross-examination) is not reproduced in the appeal books. The cross-examination had the effect of filling in most of the gaps caused by the loss of evidence, and clarifying what the conversations were. There was uncontested evidence that a number of exhibits had been lost following the conclusion of the trial more than four years ago, but the missing evidence was all tendered by the Crown. There was nothing in Mr Ceissman's submissions that suggested that there was anything in that material that would have assisted his argument with respect to this ground of appeal. Bearing in mind that Mr Ceissman is unrepresented, the appropriate course is to address all of the submissions he has made, and to indicate, to the extent possible, the remaining considerations which make this a case where it would not be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the guilty verdict to stand:  cf SKA at [14].
	
	
	As noted above, the trial judge gave a lengthy warning to the jury about relying upon the evidence of the co-offender Mr McCarthy. It will have been noted that Mr McCarthy’s evidence as to the conversation at the hotel in Dulwich Hill on the same day as the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery bears considerable resemblance to the evidence of the cleaner (especially, the panic attack and the complaint of a heart attack, giving him a drink, and locking him in the cool room).
	
	
	However, even putting to one side the evidence of Mr McCarthy, there was what may fairly be described as a strong Crown case against Mr Ceissman in respect of each of counts 8-22. In relation to the Mount Lewis Bowling Club, there is the DNA evidence relating to the black balaclavas and pink rubber gloves referred to above, found when a search warrant was executed. Mr Ceissman’s explanation that he once wore pink rubber gloves when he worked as a labourer, which were then taken from inside a backpack he kept and then used by Mr McCarthy is one which the jury could readily disbelieve. Moreover, by this time officers in the State Surveillance Branch of the NSW Police Service were following Messrs McCarthy and Ceissman. They were photographed standing together at around 8pm on 27 August 2008.
	
	
	In short, DNA and surveillance evidence powerfully connected Mr Ceissman with the Mount Lewis Bowling Club robbery. As this Court noted in 2010, there was a very close similarity in what occurred at all of the bowling clubs, in terms of the time of the break-in, waiting for staff to arrive, the use of stolen vehicles, and the use of gloves and masks.
	
	
	In relation to the theft of the vehicle from Hong Kong Smash Repairs, in addition to Mr McCarthy’s evidence, there were the transcripts of intercepted telephone calls between him and Mr McCarthy, connecting him with the vehicle, referred to above at [21].
	
	
	In relation to the Canterbury Bowling Club robbery on 23 August 2008, again there were telephone intercepts of conversations between Mr McCarthy and his girlfriend at 11:05pm on 22 August saying that he was “with Adam” and they were in Adam’s car. Telephone records from McCarthy’s mobile phone showed that the call lasted 51 seconds and was picked up from a carrier’s tower in Newtown. There was evidence that calls were made on Mr Ceissman’s mobile phone at 11.06pm, 12.06am and 2.11am that night; the call made at 11.06pm was also picked up from a carrier’s tower in Newtown. Mr Ceissman said that it was possible that he was speaking with Mr McCarthy in the car, then said that he could not remember whether he was present when Mr McCarthy made the call, then denied that he was preparing with Mr McCarthy to rob the Canterbury Bowling Club. But the two calls being made at 11.05pm and 11.06pm, one shortly after another, both picked up from a tower in Newtown, in one of which Mr McCarthy said he was with Mr Ceissman, powerfully incriminated Mr Ceissman in the robbery which took place a few hours later to which Mr McCarthy confessed.  Moreover, one of the employees at the club described the taller of the robbers as having a tooth missing:  “he had a tooth missing, it just stood out”; that matches the description of Mr Ceissman.
	
	
	In relation to the Moorefield Bowling Club robbery, once again telephone records showed Mr Ceissman in contact with Hy Trieu (“Heath”) at the relevant times. Mr Ceissman’s mobile phone made calls at 12.12am, 12.13am and 2.36am. The first two of those calls were to Mr Ceissman’s home. Mr Ceissman agreed in cross-examination that he was not at home when those calls were made. The third was made to Mr Hy Trieu, for 199 seconds. The Crown case was that the pair were arranging to meet and rob the bowling club; Mr Ceissman said “Well, I asked him where he was and what he was doing.” There were further text messages between the two men at 2.40am, 2.45am and 2.50am, for which Mr Ceissman had no plausible explanation. Once again, a witness identified the taller offender having bad teeth. Mr McCarthy’s evidence of the admissions concerning the way in which the break-in occurred were consistent with photographs of the entry doors of the club and the crow bar being located in Mr Ceissman’s car.
	
	
	True it is that Mr Ceissman accepted that he had been in telephone contact, and had met, with Mr McCarthy on 18 August 2008, but denied that he had admitted robbing the Moorefield Bowling Club with Mr Hy Trieu.  However, his explanation, coupled with the numerous calls and text messages between the two men in the early hour before the Moorefield Bowling Club was robbed, coupled with the other evidence mentioned above, is not one which leads to a conclusion that the jury must have entertained a doubt as to Mr Ceissman’s guilt of the offences for which he was convicted, even acknowledging the potential unreliability of the testimonial evidence of Mr McCarthy.
	
	
	For those reasons, having regard to the whole of the evidence insofar as it was available to this Court, this is a clear case where it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Ceissman was guilty.
	


Remaining grounds and orders


	
	One other point was made by Mr Ceissman in oral submissions. It turns on a passage in the (lengthy) address to the jury by the prosecutor and identified an error. At the commencement of the second day of closing submissions, the prosecutor said:  
	


“Thank you, your Honour. Members of the jury, yesterday I addressed you on five of the reasons that I said I would address you on which was the coincidence evidence, the opportunity – being in the right place at the right time, motive for the accused to commit these offences being a financial need, the DNA and fingerprint evidence, and also the general description of the taller man including the teeth matching with the description of the accused.”


	
	True it is that the transcript records what appears to be an error. As Mr Ceissman correctly submits, there was no fingerprint evidence. On the previous day, the prosecutor had made a point of the absence of fingerprint evidence and the fact that Mr McCarthy had given evidence that “we also put gloves on so we don’t leave fingerprints anywhere”. The point that was made by the prosecutor was that the absence of fingerprint evidence was not exonerating.
	
	
	The transcript may not, in this respect be accurate. Even if it is, it is impossible to conclude that the jury could have been misled by the loose reference to what had been said the previous day by the prosecutor. It would have been obvious to all who had been in court throughout the 16 day trial that there was no fingerprint evidence, and a deal of evidence concerning gloves and the DNA material found on them. Accordingly, leave to appeal should not be granted on this ground.
	
	
	The Court’s orders are:
	



	
	To the extent necessary, extend time to appeal and to permit reliance on the grounds of appeal identified in the notice of appeal filed 9 October 2013 and the grounds of appeal dated 10 September 2014.
	
	
	To the extent necessary, grant leave to appeal in respect of grounds 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the notice of appeal filed 9 October 2013 and grounds 1, 3 and 4 of the grounds of appeal dated 10 September 2014, and otherwise refuse leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2766495,BQD v Children’s Guardian and the Department of Family and Community Services [2015] NSWCATAD 88,"REAsons for decision


	
	The Applicant in these proceedings is referred to as ""BQD"". BQD is the applicant's pseudonym used in these proceedings.
	
	
	On 8 January 2015 an order was made under section 64 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 restricting publication of information that will identify the applicant, any victims, witnesses or evidence given and received in the Tribunal hearing or in relation to the proceedings which is likely to identify those persons. In addition an order was made (by consent) joining the Department of Community Services as a party to the proceedings.
	
	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 28 of the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012 ('the Act') is protective and not punitive in nature: Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61]. The purpose underlying the analysis of the evidence is to achieve that protective goal: see sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
	


3 Object of Act

The object of this Act is to protect children:

(a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in child-related work, and

(b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with children check clearances.

4 Safety, welfare and well-being of children to be paramount consideration

The safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation of this Act.


	
	These proceedings arise because on 20 November 2014, the Children's Guardian made a decision to refuse to grant BQD a Working with Children Check clearance. On 22 December 2014 the applicant BQD applied to the Tribunal for a review of the Children's Guardian's decision pursuant to section 27 of the Act.
	


Background


	
	On 1 October 2013 the applicant, applied for a Working with Children Check clearance from the respondent. The applicant requires a Working with Children Check clearance because he and his spouse are the authorised carers of their granddaughter through a formal arrangement arising from orders in the Family Court of Australia and a Kinship Carer Assessment with the Department of Community Services (as it then was). This arrangement has been in place since approximately January 2008. It is this arrangement and its ensuing financial support that brings the applicant within the scope of Act. The applicant resided at the address with his spouse and the granddaughter, but was required to move out of those premises in November 2014 due to the requirement to obtain a working with children clearance from the Children's Guardian. He subsequently obtained a condition stay on the bar which allowed him to return home.
	
	
	Section 10 of the Act provides that an adult person, who resides at the home of an authorised carer, must hold a working with children check clearance or have made a current application to the Children's Guardian for a clearance.
	
	
	The respondent was required under to Act to process the applicant's application for a working with children check clearance, and as a result, in this instance conduct a risk assessment. The matter was referred for a risk assessment under the Act in early 2014. I note that the applicant and respondent liaised a number of times during 2014 concerning the progress and nature of the risk assessment.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that the applicant has been convicted of offences which triggered the respondent conducting a risk assessment to determine whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. (See clause 1(1) (b) of Schedule 1 and Part 3, Division 3 of the Act).
	
	
	On 20 October 2014 the respondent advised the applicant by letter in accordance with section 19 of the Act that it proposed to refuse the application for a clearance. The purpose of this notice was to again give the applicant the opportunity to submit documents to assist in the respondent's risk assessment.
	
	
	On 20 November 2014 the respondent refused the Working with Children Check clearance as the respondent determined that the applicant posed a risk to the safety of children. It is that decision which is the subject of this review before the Tribunal.
	
	
	The issue to be decided by the Tribunal is what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to the material before the Tribunal in relation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation to the applicant: (see section 63 Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.)
	


The working with children legislative scheme


	
	The object of the Act is to protect children by not permitting disqualified persons, without clearances, to engage in child-related work, and by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have working with children check clearances. (See section 3 of the Act).
	
	
	The safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration in the operation of the Act. (See section 4 of the Act).
	
	
	Section 8(1) of the Act prohibits a person from engaging in child-related work, unless the person holds the relevant working with children check clearance or there is a current application by the person to the Children's Guardian for the relevant working with children check clearance. A breach of section 8(1) is an offence.
	
	
	The definition of ""child related work"" includes a ""worker engaged in work in a child related role referred to in subsection (3)."" (See section 6(1) (b) of the Act).
	
	
	A child related role is set out in section 6(3) of the Act. For the purposes of the Act, an authorised carer is a child related role in accordance with section 6 (3) (c).
	
	
	In addition Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act provides for additional persons who must obtain a clearance.
	


10 Adult persons residing with authorised carers or persons providing home care services

(1) An adult person (other than a person who is required under another provision of this Act to, or is exempt from the requirement to, hold a working with children check clearance) who resides at the home of an authorised carer or at a home where a home based education and care service or family day care service is provided must hold a working with children check clearance (of any class) or have made a current application to the Children's Guardian for a clearance.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units, or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.


	
	Section 15(1) of the Act provides that the Children's Guardian must conduct a risk assessment of an applicant for a working with children check clearance to determine whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Section 18(2) provides that the Children's Guardian must grant a clearance to a person who is subject to a risk assessment under Division 3 unless the Children's Guardian is satisfied that the person poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Part 4 of the Act deals with reviews and appeals. Section 27 makes provision for administrative review, by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, of decisions of the Children's Guardian.
	
	
	Section 27 (1) of the Act makes provision for administrative review by the Tribunal of (amongst other things) a decision of the respondent to refuse a working with children check clearance (see section 27 (1)). The section relevantly provides:
	


27 Applications to Civil and Administrative Tribunal for administrative reviews of clearance decisions

(1) A person who has been refused a working with children check clearance by the Children's Guardian may apply to the Tribunal for an administrative review under the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 of the decision within 28 days after notice of the decision was given to the person.

(2) ………...

(3) ………...

(4) An applicant must fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters relevant to the application.

(5), (6) (Repealed)

(7) Section 53 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 does not apply to a decision that may be reviewed by the Tribunal under this section.


	
	Section 30 sets out the factors that the Tribunal must consider in determining a review application. Subsection 30 (1) of the Act provides:
	


30 Determination of applications and other matters

(1) The Tribunal must consider the following in determining an application under this Part:

(a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar,

(b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred,

(c) the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,

(d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim,

(e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person,

(f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child,

(g) the person's present age,

(h) the seriousness of the person's total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred,

(i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition,

(j) any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the application,

(k) any other matters that the Children's Guardian considers necessary.

Burden of Proof


	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective and not punitive in nature: BJB v Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 111 at [110] AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, at [34]; Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61] and R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIRComm 101 at [130].
	
	
	The Act is silent as to where the onus lies in relation to an application for administrative review under Part 4 of the Act. It has been held that neither party bears an onus of proof in relation to an application under section 27 of the Act; BJB v The Children's Guardian (No. 2) [2014] NSWCATAD 164 at [32].
	
	
	An application pursuant to section 27 is a merits review and not a review in which the applicant must show that the decision maker was wrong: Re Control Investments Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (No. 2) (1981) 3 ALD 88.
	
	
	In addition, in this case there is no presumption that the applicant poses a risk to children as there would be if the applicant were a disqualified person seeking an enabling order pursuant to s28 of the Act.
	


Risk to the safety of children


	
	In this application, an issue for determination is whether the applicant, on the balance of probabilities, poses a risk to the safety of children. In that regard, the Tribunal is required to have regard to the matters contained in section 30(1) of the Act in deciding this issue. (See paragraph 22 above). Section 15 (4) sets out the criteria which the Children's Guardian may consider. The Tribunal in its administrative review considers similar criteria in that section 15 (4) and 30 (1) are drafted in similar but not identical terms. An important distinction is the word ""may"" in 15 (4) and ""must"" in 30 (1).
	
	
	The meaning of the word 'risk' was previously considered by Young CJ (in Equity) in Commission for Children and Young People v V [2002] NSWSC 949; 56 NSWLR 476, at [42]. That consideration was made in the context of section 9(4) of the former Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998 ('the Repealed Act'.) At [42], His Honour said:
	


'42 One does not define risk as meaning minimal risk. One would …exclude fanciful or theoretical risk but what one is looking for is whether, in all the circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that is greater than the risk of any adult preying on a child. One, however, must link the word ""risk"" with the words that follow, namely, ""to the safety of children"". ...'


	
	These observations of Young CJ (in Equity) have continued to be cited with approval, by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, in construing the meaning of 'risk' as it appeared in section 33J(1) of the repealed Part 7 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998: see ADV v Commission for Children and Young People [2012] NSWADT 8.
	
	
	The remarks have also been cited with approval in AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, BFC v The Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 90, BFX v Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 115 and also in BJB v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian (No 2) 2014 NSWCAT 164 at [33] before this Tribunal.
	


The Issue


	
	The primary issue before the Tribunal in this application as outlined at paragraph 11 above, is what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to the material before the Tribunal in relation to the granting of a working with children check clearance in relation to the applicant: section 63 Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.
	
	
	The applicant's application was heard on 30 March 2015. He has at all times been legally represented in these proceedings. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision.
	
	
	As outlined at paragraph 26 (above), there is no presumption under section 27 of the Act that the applicant poses a risk to children as the applicant is not a disqualified person (seeking an enabling order) under the Act. This application is for a clearance under section 18 (2) of the Act.
	
	
	The matter referred to in Schedule 1 of the Act which triggered a risk assessment (see paragraph 19 above) was: murder. The offence occurred in the State of Queensland whereby on 14 June 1968 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a 12 year prison sentence. The relevant indictment from the other jurisdiction in force at that time has not been provided to the Tribunal. However it is accepted that the offence would be caught by the terms of subclause 5 (b) of Schedule 1 of the Act which provides that:
	


(5) Subclauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) apply to:

(a) ……

(b) an offence under a law other than a law of New South Wales that is an offence similar to an offence listed in those subclauses


	
	It is therefore uncontroversial that the offence constituted a 'trigger offence' for the purposes of Schedule 1 of the Act. The applicant was an adult at the time of the offence, and the offence was committed against an adult.
	
	
	Due to the commencement of the amendments to the Act brought about by the Child Protection (Working with Children) Amendment Regulation 2014 on 29 October 2014 the ‘trigger offence’ would now be classified under the Act as a ‘disqualifying offence’ in accordance with Schedule 2. However at the time of BQD’s application, the offence (not involving a child victim) was an assessment trigger offence in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Act.
	
	
	Clause 8 of Schedule 1 of the Child Protection (Working with Children) Regulation 2013 (as amended) provides that those amendments do not apply to applications for clearances commenced prior to the amendment. The Clause provides:
	


8 Application of change to disqualifying offences

(1) The amendments made by the Child Protection (Working with Children) Amendment (Miscellaneous) Regulation 2013 to Schedule 2 to the Act do not apply to or in respect of an application for a clearance made by a person before the commencement of that Regulation or to any subsequent application for a further clearance by that person.

(2) The amendment made by the Child Protection (Working with Children) Amendment Regulation 2014 to Schedule 2 to the Act does not apply to or in respect of an application for a clearance made by a person before the commencement of that Regulation or to any subsequent application for a further clearance by that person.


	
	The applicant therefore has not engaged in or been convicted of a disqualifying offence under Schedule 2, (see section 18 (1) ) and that as he was subject to a risk assessment (see section 18 (3) ), then the decision not to grant a clearance by the respondent is based solely on the provisions of section 18 (2) of the Act. That is, that the respondent is satisfied that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	By letter dated 20 November 2014 the respondent determined that:
	


In reviewing your application, the Office of the Children’s Guardian (OCG) has decided to refuse to grant you a Working with Children Check clearance, as the OCG has determined that you pose a risk to the safety of children.

In making our decision, the OCG considered the following information:

(list of 19 items obtained by OCG or provided by applicant).

……………..

In reviewing all of the information used in the risk assessment being disclosed to you, the OCG has decided to refuse to grant you a Working with Children Check clearance, as the OCG has determined that you pose a risk to the safety of children. This decision has been made by reference to the guidelines set out in section 15 (4) of the Act, in particular:

The seriousness of the matter


	
	I note that the decision appears to be based upon was based upon a sole criteria from the range of relevant considerations under section 15 (4) of the Act.
	


The Evidence and Consideration of the Evidence


	
	The applicant relied upon the following material:
	



	
	His affidavit and annexures sworn 7 January 2015 and adopted at the hearing.
	
	
	The affidavit of his spouse sworn 14 January 2015 (and tendered without objection).
	
	
	Copy of Family Court Orders dated 30 December 2009.
	
	
	Written submissions dated 13 April 2015 and filed 15 April 2015.
	
	
	Copies of material provided to the respondent as part of the risk assessment process (Tendered in the Respondent’s section 58 material).
	
	
	The Psychologists Report of Dr C.J. Lennings dated 28 January 2015.
	



	
	In addition the applicant relied on the oral evidence given at the hearing by himself, and Mr Lennings, as well as counsel's oral submissions.
	
	
	The respondent relied upon the following material:
	



	
	The bundle of section 58 documents filed 13 February 2015.
	
	
	The additional bundle of documents filed by the Respondent on 8 January 2015 comprising records obtained from Queensland Police.
	



	
	At the hearing the applicant gave oral evidence and was cross-examined by the solicitor for the respondent.
	
	
	As outlined above in support of his application the applicant filed a report of Clinical Psychologist Dr C.J. Lennings. The applicant called Dr Lennings who gave oral evidence and was also subject to questioning by the respondent's solicitor.
	


Evidence relating to section 30 (1) considerations

(a) The seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of a clearance imposition of an interim bar.

Trigger offences:


	
	Murder (Queensland) The applicant was charged and convicted of committing murder in 1968 in a suburb of western Brisbane. The victim was a police officer.
	


Pattern Trigger Offences:


	
	There is no pattern of trigger offences, mainly due to the fact that the applicant has only three offences in total and other than the trigger offence, the other two are not listed in Schedule 1 of the Act, in part because the victim is not a child.
	


(b) The period of time since those offences occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred.


	
	The applicant has no convictions for offences since 1968 and has not come to police attention in any manner since that time. There is evidence that the application completed both his custodial and supervision periods in a satisfactory manner with no adverse issues. There is no evidence before the Tribunal of any conduct which could be considered ‘adverse’ to the applicant in the last 47 years.
	


(c ) The age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred.


	
	The applicant was a young man aged between 22 years and 25 years at the time of the three offences.
	


(d) The age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim.


	
	There is no meaningful evidence before the Tribunal in relation to this provision. The two assaults were committed against adults, and the victim’s ages are otherwise unknown. In respect of the murder offence, there is no evidence that the victim was vulnerable in any legal sense, and their age is of no consequence in respect of the offending behaviour and any potential risk that the applicant might now pose under the Act.
	


(e) The difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person


	
	The section does not appear relevant to any offences in the applicant's criminal history. On the evidence before me, the difference in age is either unknown or of no consequence. In respect of the trigger offence it was submitted that both the victim and the applicant were approximately the same age.
	


(f) Whether the person knew, or could have reasonably have known, that the victim was a child.


	
	No offences involve children.
	


(g) The person's present age.


	
	The applicant is 72 years of age. The present age is not a consideration of any import on the evidence and material before the Tribunal, however I note that the statistical evidence indicates that the likelihood of an individual offending decreases with age after early adulthood.
	


(h) The seriousness of the person's total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred.


	
	There are three offences in the applicant’s criminal record. All three offences involved violence and occurred during the 1960’s in Queensland. Two offences could be considered of some seriousness as they involve convictions relating to assault with at least one involving a police officer. The conviction for murder in 1968 is an extremely serious offence and also involves a police officer.
	
	
	I note that in the ensuing 47 years the applicant has not come to police attention and on the evidence before the Tribunal has lived in a lawful and productive manner, in many ways leading an exemplary life when one has regard to the responsibilities that he and his spouse took on in respect of the grandchild, and the ensuing circumstances. The applicant has complied with the conditions of his supervision following his release from custody. He has used his time in custody to qualify in occupational areas and has developed his skills. He has married and remained in the relationship for approximately 35 years. He has been a valued employee, volunteer, and also successful small business operator who is highly regarded by those that know him and have provided attestations as to his character (as annexed to his affidavit).
	
	
	The applicant's conduct has been in effect unblemished since the offences, being diligent in obtaining employment, child rearing and care for his family, living in a responsible manner, as well as volunteer work.
	


(i) The likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition.


	
	The applicant relied on the evidence of Dr Lennings Clinical Psychologist. Dr Lennings provided a detailed and comprehensive report and assessed the applicant as having a low risk of engaging in future violence against children.
	


(j) Any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to, the application.


	
	The applicant provided significant written and oral material to the respondent in respect of the working with children clearance process. In addition the applicant did provide the material referred to in paragraph 43 (above) in respect of his application to the Tribunal. Annexed to his affidavit were a number of Annexures ('A' - 'B’ and 4 other ‘annexures’ not marked).
	
	
	Dr Lenning’s report (in addition to the matters outlined at paragraph 57 above) made the following assessment of risk and recommendations for risk management.
	


45. In those circumstances it is hard to see how (BQD) may be regarded as a risk to children in any capacity. There is no realistic scenario where such risk can be imagined. There is thus no requirement to consider supervision of his behaviour when in contact with children. (BQD) has clearly reformed in his character from the person he was in his early adult years.


	
	Dr Lennings gave evidence in chief and was subject to questioning by the respondent’s legal representative. He was also re-examined to clarify aspects of his evidence and was subject to clarification questions by the Tribunal. In addition to his report Dr Lenning’s evidence was that the impact on risk of BQD is based on the frequency of offending, not specifically the nature of the offending. The policy considerations of ‘high risk’ are on the basis of the seriousness of an offence, and are not relevant to any empirical relationship.
	


(k) Any other matters that the Children's Guardian considers necessary.


	
	After making its decision based predominantly on the basis of section 15 (4) (a) of the Act - ‘the seriousness of any matters that caused the assessment in relation to the person’- (Emphasis added) the respondent then submitted at hearing that ‘the Children’s Guardian takes a neutral position in respect of the application to the Tribunal.’
	


Further consideration


	
	The applicant provided approximately an hour of oral evidence at the hearing. He was subjected to extensive cross examination. In my view he gave his evidence in a candid and forthright manner. He did not resile from the questions put to him. Whilst it was clear that the police facts from 1960’s differed in some aspects from the applicant’s recollection and evidence, the applicant's evidence was broadly consistent with the other records, in so far as he was able to recollect in detail the circumstances of the incidents. The trigger offence was the one whereby there was the greatest disparity (particularly noting the applicant’s version that it was an accident arising from his own attempt to self- harm) and that the indictment did not amount to manslaughter. However be that as it may, aspects of his version of events almost 50 years later, were contained within some of the Police Facts from the 1960’s as evidence that he had contemporaneously provided that his single shot rifle had caught on his overall’s under his arm with his back towards the victim.
	
	
	It is clear that alcohol had been a factor in his three offences, but the expert evidence and the applicant’s own evidence was that alcohol is no longer present. In addition the evidence was that (other than his gender) there is an absence of risk factors.
	
	
	There was significant evidence that the applicant has substantially changed his life in the last 35 years, and in effect since the time of his incarceration in 1968. He has obtained educational qualifications, established his own successful business, maintained a supportive long term relationship, and performed a significant amount of paid and unpaid work.
	
	
	I also note that there was evidence before the Tribunal concerning his care for children, and the significant productive role that he held in bringing up and caring for his granddaughter.
	
	
	The Solicitor for the second respondent (the Department) submitted that the placement of the Granddaughter with the applicant and his spouse is a positive one.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	As outlined above, the issue for determination is whether on the material before the Tribunal is whether I can be satisfied that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	For the purpose of these proceedings, in my view on the material before me, the evidence does not establish that the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. In my view the evidence does not establish that there is a real and appreciable risk of harm to children. In my view the evidence indicates that the applicant should be granted a Working with Children check clearance.
	
	
	It follows that the correct and preferable decision is that the orders of the Tribunal are:
	



	
	The decision of the Children's Guardian dated 20 November 2014 to refuse to grant the applicant a Working with Children check clearance is set aside and in substitution the respondent is to grant the applicant a working with children check clearance

	ADAMSON J: The Crown appealed pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against sentences imposed on the respondent by Wells DCJ in the District Court at Lismore on 19 August 2014. The respondent pleaded guilty to four charges which arose from a collision at Stratheden on 4 June 2013. His plea was first entered in the Lismore Local Court on 7 January 2014, as a result of which the matter was committed to the District Court for sentence. Two further offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in the sentence for Count 3. A discount of 25% was allowed for the respondent's pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The overall sentence was a term of imprisonment for four years and seven months commencing on 15 August 2013 and expiring on 14 March 2018, with an effective non-parole period of three years and three months expiring on 14 November 2016. The respondent was also disqualified from holding a licence for a period of five years.
	
	
	The sentences imposed for each of the four counts and the offences taken into account on the Form 1 are set out in the following tables.

The grounds of appeal


	
	The appellant relied on the following grounds:
	



	
	The learned sentencing Judge erred in law by failing to apply the decisions of this Court in R v Gillett [2006] NSWCCA 370 and this Court’s guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 (Whyte).
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge erred in law by taking into account irrelevant matters as “mitigating” factors.
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge imposed individual and total effective sentences that are manifestly inadequate and “plainly unjust”:
	



	
	as a result of a finding that the moral culpability of the respondent for each of the offences was “within the mid-range of seriousness” when the only finding open on the evidence was that the moral culpability of the respondent was very high; and
	
	
	as a result of failing to make the only finding available on all the evidence, namely that the index case was very substantially more serious than that envisaged in the typical case upon which the guideline sentence is predicated in Whyte; and
	
	
	by failing to make required findings that the commission of the offences while on parole was a serious and aggravating factor and indicative of poor prospects of rehabilitation; and
	
	
	having appropriate regard to all the relevant circumstances including the maximum penalties, the guideline sentence promulgated in Whyte, the application of the principle of totality and the criminality for which the Respondent was to be sentenced.
	



	
	Except where otherwise indicated all references to statutory provisions in these reasons are to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


The Facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the Agreed Facts and evidence at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	Shaun Zagar had three children K, Z and J. In 2013 K, a boy of 6 (who would have turned 7 on 5 June 2013), and Z, a girl of 5, attended Casino Public School. J, a boy of 4, had not yet started school. The children’s mother no longer lived with Mr Zagar. Mr Zagar lived with his three children and his new partner Felicity Grayson in a rural property in an area known as Stratheden, which is about half way between Casino and Kyogle. Usually it was Ms Grayson who would drive the older two children to meet the school bus in the mornings and Mr Zagar would stay at home with J as Mr Zagar was disqualified from driving for a period. However, on 4 June 2013, Mr Zagar drove them to the bus stop. That morning they were running late and, by the time they arrived at the intersection of Martins Road and McDonald's Bridge Road, Stratheden, where the bus would stop to pick up the children, the bus had been and gone. Unaware they had missed the bus, Mr Zagar parked on the grassy verge to wait.
	
	
	In June 2013 the respondent was on parole for three offences of driving while disqualified. His sentence was due to expire on 13 August 2013. He was disqualified from driving until 15 April 2030. As a condition of his parole he was required to live with his parents in Kyogle, unless dispensation was given by his parole officer. His parole officer had given permission for the offender to stay two nights a week with his partner, Jodie Boyle, who was also the mother of their three children, T (aged 10), X (aged 4) and A (aged 3).
	
	
	Ms Boyle lived in Dyraaba. She owned a green sedan, which she was licensed to drive. She did not permit the respondent to drive her car. She was prescribed methadone and collected her dose from a pharmacy in Kyogle from which the respondent also collected his prescription drugs.
	
	
	The respondent suffered from epilepsy, which was treated with prescription medication: Valpro (two tablets twice a day) and Kevtam (five tablets a day, including two in the morning). He also took Antenax (Valium/ Diazepam). All three of these medications were endorsed with labels to the effect that the medication may cause drowsiness and warning the user not to drive if affected.
	
	
	On 3 June 2013 the respondent became aware that the gas bottle that fuelled the family’s hot water system was empty. That evening he arranged to meet his father, Roger Harris, at McDonald’s Bridge on McDonald’s Bridge Road at 8am the following morning, for the purpose of being provided with a new gas bottle, some milk and cigarettes. Before retiring for the night at Ms Boyle’s home at Dyraaba, the respondent took his medication, drank two cans of Bourbon and Coke and smoked some cones of cannabis.
	
	
	At 7.50am on 4 June 2013 the respondent woke. He roused Ms Boyle, who was still asleep in bed, and told her that T was unwell and would be staying home from school. When the respondent reminded Ms Boyle of the arrangement to meet his father at 8am, she told him to change the time. She went back to sleep. The respondent took the keys to Ms Boyle’s car and strapped X and A into their car seats. T insisted on staying home. The respondent drove towards the place where he was to meet his father, who was already waiting at McDonald’s Bridge. His taking and driving Ms Boyle’s car was the subject of the first offence on the Form 1 (to be taken into account pursuant to s 32).
	
	
	The respondent was driving east along McDonald’s Bridge Road at a speed of at least 85kms per hour (in a 100km per hour zone) when he veered off the road. The green sedan became airborne and collided into the left side of Mr Zagar’s vehicle. Mr Zagar, K and Z were killed as a result of the impact. The respondent, X and A remained in the green sedan. A suffered serious injuries (accepted to amount to grievous bodily harm), including a traumatic brain injury, broken right arm and a fractured jaw.
	
	
	At about 8.30am, Ms Grayson realised that Mr Zagar had not returned from taking the children to the bus stop. When she heard the sirens, she took J with her to the end of Martins Road to investigate. She recognised her car in the paddock. She was told by police that no one in her car had survived.
	
	
	Immediately after the collision, the respondent, who appeared to be in shock and disoriented, was crying for help. He gave different accounts to witnesses at the scene, including: that Mr Zagar's car had pulled out in front of his; that he did not see the car; that it was the other driver's fault; and that he suffered epilepsy and blacked out. The respondent told an ambulance officer that he had not lost consciousness and told a police officer that he had no memory and must have blacked out.
	
	
	The ambulance officer, who observed that the respondent had difficulty concentrating and spoke slowly, considered him to be under the influence of a substance. The respondent appeared to another police officer to be in shock as well as very confused and dazed. On admission to hospital, the respondent dozed off and slurred his speech. Ms Boyle and friends attended the hospital and said that the respondent’s appearance was consistent with his having suffered an epileptic seizure.
	
	
	The respondent told a police officer and staff at the hospital that he was stationary at the intersection and the other car struck him. He said he had taken his epilepsy medications and consumed two cans of bourbon and cola and some cannabis the night before the offences. The respondent also admitted that he had smoked cannabis earlier on the morning of the collision (the second Form 1 offence).
	
	
	The respondent was arrested on 5 June 2013. In a recorded interview with police, the respondent variously asserted he was stationary at the intersection and the other car struck him and that the other car pulled out in front of him. The respondent admitted he had problems with blacking out but denied that he blacked out at the time of the collision. The respondent said he had attended the Roads and Traffic Authority to enquire about the return of his licence but was told it depended on the type of epilepsy he suffered as he could have a fit while driving and kill someone. The respondent admitted to smoking cannabis the day before but not on the day of the collision. The respondent said he had consumed prescribed medication prior to the collision. The respondent denied he had taken morphine or methadone but, on hearing a recording of his conversation with police prior to treatment with morphine at the hospital, suggested he was affected by morphine.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Reutens, a psychiatrist, that he could not recall the collision and thought he had an epileptic seizure but that he did not usually experience auras warning of an impending seizure. The respondent confirmed he usually experienced a confused state for about 48 hours following a seizure. The respondent told Dr Pulman, a neuropsychologist that he could recall earlier parts of the journey but not the events immediately preceding the collision.
	
	
	Analysis of the respondent's blood revealed the presence of drugs including diazepam, morphine, methadone and cannabinoids. Dr Perl, a pharmacologist, opined the combination of drugs would have impaired the respondent's ability to drive at the time of the collision.
	


The sentence hearing


	
	The matter was listed before the sentencing judge for mention on 10 February 2014, at which time Mr Watts, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, informed the Court that the respondent had pleaded guilty on the basis of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, as opposed to the Crown’s case of driving under the influence. The matter was adjourned for sentence to enable the statement of agreed facts to be prepared.
	
	
	A fresh indictment dated 19 June 2014 was presented on that day. The respondent pleaded guilty to all counts. The proceedings on sentence commenced on 19 June 2014. The Crown tendered a bundle of documents which included: the indictment; the Court Attendance Notices; the Form 1 offences; aerial photographs of the scene post-impact; the Agreed Facts; and the respondent’s criminal, traffic and custodial histories. The victim impact statements of Julie and Andrew Zagar (the parents of Mr Zagar and grandparents of K and Z); Michelle Lehmann (Mr Zagar’s sister); and Kira Newbold (the mother of K and Z) were also tendered. The Crown also tendered photographs of the scene after impact and an expert certificate of Dr Benjamin Rahmel dated 29 May 2014 to establish the injuries to A, who has made a good recovery from injuries that were admitted to constitute grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Mr Watts, who appeared on behalf of the respondent at the sentence hearing, tendered Dr Reutens’ report, dated 10 April 2014, and Dr Pulman’s report dated 17 June 2014.
	
	
	Dr Reutens made the following psychiatric diagnoses of the respondent: probable frontal lobe impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury; dysthymia; generalised anxiety disorder; and substance abuse. She also said in her report:
	


“Mr Harris describes impulsive behaviour and lack of judgement in his decision to drive, which is a characteristic of frontal lobe syndrome. I cannot offer an opinion as to whether Mr Harris suffered from a seizure prior to the impact, and the opinion of a neurologist specialising in epilepsy would be of assistance. There is memory of his being at the scene of the accident, as he described flashbacks and nightmares of the aftermath of the accident and was able to recall some correct details of the accident to the police at the hospital and the following day in his recorded interview with the police. This is at odds with his statement to myself today that he could not recall anything except being in hospital.

His behaviour after the accident was described as confused and aggressive. The ambulance officer Desmond WHITNEY noted he was restless and agitated, his speech was slow and he had to concentrate to understand questions. He later gave conflicting and implausible accounts of the accident. It appears that Mr Harris was in a confusional state. The confusion could be due to a number of conditions including intoxication. His partner stated that he behaved in a similar way when post ictal. It is unlikely that depression or anxiety would account for this presentation.

Of concern is a history of worsening seizure control. Non-compliance with antiepileptic medication as evidenced by the absence of Valproate in his laboratory investigations post-accident is the most likely reason for his worsening seizure pattern. Mr Harris also identified a possible correlation with illicit substance use”.


	
	Dr Pulman reported the respondent’s history that he had been kicked in the head by a horse when he was 18 months old as a result of which he had a metal plate inserted into his frontal lobe. He experienced his first grand mal seizure in 1999 when he was 22 or 23. The respondent reported that fatigue, sunlight or strobe lights, as well as cannabis and alcohol can act as triggers for his seizures. Dr Pulman’s report contained the following expressions of clinical opinion:
	


“Mr Harris has a history of severe traumatic brain injury resulting in loss of brain tissue in his right frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for higher order functions including judgement, planning, reasoning and impulse control. Mr Harris experienced difficulties with learning and behaviour and left school in Year 10. He had difficulties maintaining employment frequently changing jobs and engaging in illicit substance use….[He] developed post traumatic epilepsy in his early twenties. Although taking anti-convulsant medication, there is a history of simultaneous substance use and difficulties in seizure control. He has a history of driving offences and has repeatedly been charged with driving whilst unlicensed. He demonstrates a history of impulsivity, difficulties with planning and comprehending the consequences of his actions consistent with frontal lobe syndrome.

The results of current neuropsychological assessment reveal abnormalities in his cognitive functioning. … His profile is suggestive of a history of both traumatic brain injury and epilepsy resulting from injury to his right frontal lobe.

. . .

Although it is not within my area of expertise to comment on the pharmacological properties of substances or to provide medical opinion, my experience in the assessment of patients with a history of epilepsy and/or traumatic brain injury has revealed patients often display behaviours including confusion and agitation as well as difficulties recalling information or having patchy memories in the post-ictal phase of an epileptic seizure. It remains unclear whether Mr Harris’ behaviours post-accident are attributable to his substance use, possible post-ictal state or a combination of both.”


	
	Mr Watts confirmed that the applicant was not charged with dangerous driving under the influence of drugs, although he accepted that there were a number of drugs found in the applicant’s system. He informed the sentencing judge that the plea of guilty was based squarely on the applicant’s concession that his driving was dangerous because he suffered from epilepsy, which was not controlled by medication. Mr Watts conceded that the respondent was aware that his risk of an epileptic seizure was increased by drugs, alcohol and sunshine.
	
	
	Mr Watts referred the sentencing judge to Whyte and R v Gillett. Mr Watts made submissions as to the various matters referred to in Whyte. He contended that the respondent had expressed remorse to Dr Reutens but accepted that limited weight could be accorded to such expressions since he did not give evidence at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the submissions, the matter was adjourned to 19 August 2014 for the sentence to be passed, that being the earliest time on which the judge and counsel would be back in Lismore, her Honour having adjudged that it would be preferable in the interests of justice that the sentence be passed in Lismore.
	
	
	On the adjourned date, the sentencing judge confirmed with the parties, prior to delivering her remarks on sentence, that it was accepted that the plea was based on the respondent’s suffering the effects of epilepsy or the onset of epilepsy after he left home in the car on 4 June 2013 and that the journey was to be a short distance of 5-10kms.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge recounted the facts which are set out above. Her Honour confirmed that the plea had been entered and accepted by the Crown on the basis that the respondent had suffered from the effects of epilepsy after he left home on the journey which led to the collision.
	
	
	Her Honour summarised the subjective circumstances of the respondent. He was born on 30 October 1976 and was 37 at the time of sentence. He had a record of prior convictions including multiple convictions for driving whilst disqualified. On 16 February 2012, the respondent was sentenced for three offences of driving whilst disqualified to imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 16 February 2012 and expiring on 15 August 2013 with a non-parole period of six months, expiring on 15 August 2012. The respondent was also further disqualified from holding a licence until 15 April 2026. Accordingly, at the time of the present offences the respondent was both on parole and disqualified from holding a licence. The sentencing judge said that, given the respondent's driving history, it was ""difficult to make a favourable finding"" regarding personal deterrence, and identified the need for personal deterrence as a ""significant factor"".
	
	
	The respondent was the eldest of two children. His performance at school was below average. He had difficulty concentrating and reading. After completing Year 10, the respondent left school and was employed in a variety of positions. He was in receipt of a disability pension at the time of the offences. The respondent had been with his partner for 15 years at the time of the offences. However, their relationship had been volatile, particularly shortly prior to the offences.
	
	
	The respondent suffered severe frontal lobe damage when he was kicked in the head by a horse at eighteen months of age. As a result a metal plate had been inserted in the respondent's head. The respondent began consuming cannabis when he was 16 and had continued to use it regularly. Although he had previously used other prohibited drugs, the respondent’s illicit drug use was principally confined to cannabis in recent years. The respondent began suffering grand mal seizures in his early twenties. A CT scan of the respondent's brain during his hospitalisation following the collision disclosed low density of the frontal lobe underlying the area of the craniotomy suggesting significant encephalomalacia (softening or loss of brain tissue, which may be a result of trauma).
	
	
	Her Honour found that the respondent reported that fatigue, sun or strobe light, or substances including cannabis and alcohol could trigger seizures and noted that the respondent said he ceased using cannabis during a period when he was taking anti-convulsant drugs but resumed as he continued to suffer seizures.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that Dr Pulman and Dr Reutens were both of opinion that the respondent's significant brain injury and epilepsy combined to impair his judgment and to cause him to act impulsively. The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent had ""chronic and severe problems"" which interfered with his judgment and impaired his thinking in ""many if not most aspects of his daily functioning"".
	
	
	However, the sentencing judge considered that, as the respondent had previously arranged to meet his father the morning of the collision, he had had the opportunity to consider his decision to drive. The judge noted that the respondent had known for a long time he suffered from his conditions and should not drive. Her Honour noted the respondent's epilepsy was not under control as he had not seen a neurologist since 2012 but continued to suffer worsening seizures and he knew from past experience that use of alcohol and cannabis made his condition worse. Her Honour found that the respondent's use of drugs had not materially impaired his ability to drive but the fact that there was ""some low level"" impairment was relevant as it showed he knowingly consumed them notwithstanding his condition.
	
	
	Her Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offences in the following terms:
	


“It is difficult then to see how his irresponsibility in consciously deciding to drive with his knowledge of his condition and the very good prospect of an epileptic seizure in those circumstances, should to any significant extent reduce his moral culpability. It is difficult to see that what he did by driving in those circumstances was any less dangerous than a driver who had consumed a reasonable quantity of alcohol or drugs and then driven whilst materially impaired. His driving had every prospect of being impaired by a seizure. Even if he had not have understood that by the age of 37, on his own account he had been told that by a person at the RTA.

There are some matters that mitigate the objective seriousness. There is no suggestion at all [of] excessive speed or deliberate erratic driving or material impairment by drugs or alcohol. The length of the journey was not, in the scheme of cases of this kind, a long one by any means. It did not involve travelling to a busy suburban area in the inner city or on a highway, but it was one that was completely and utterly unnecessary.

Taking all of those matters into account with the principles in Whyte, his level of moral culpability remains within the mid-range of seriousness.”


	
	Her Honour noted the early pleas of guilty and specified that he should receive a discount of 25% for their utilitarian value. The sentencing judge found that the respondent’s frontal lobe syndrome and chronic epilepsy would mean his time in custody would be more difficult. The sentencing judge found that he was remorseful.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“The most important consideration is that an innocent young man and his children were killed as a result of this offender’s selfish, senseless behaviour.”


	
	Her Honour referred to the submission made on behalf of the respondent that his frontal lobe syndrome and epilepsy should reduce the weight given to general deterrence but indicated that she was not persuaded that this factor should reduce the sentence significantly. The sentencing judge addressed specific deterrence in the following terms:
	


“As to the need for personal deterrence, it is difficult to make a favourable finding given the offender’s history. Of course the result of his unlawful driving on this occasion has been far more devastating than in the past when he has committed similar offences. His record does not assist him. Personal deterrence here is a significant factor, even though surely this time he has learned his lesson.”


	
	Her Honour refused to find special circumstances and said that a slight adjustment to the statutory ratio would be made solely to take account of the need for concurrency of the sentences imposed.
	


The appeal


	
	It is well established that it is incumbent on the Crown on an appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to demonstrate that the discretion exercised by the sentencing judge was affected by appellable error: R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489 at [12] per Heydon JA, cited with approval by the plurality in CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9 (CMB) at [34]. The Crown must overcome an additional hurdle before this Court will re-sentence the respondent more heavily: it must negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised: CMB at [36].
	
	
	In CMB the plurality adopted Barwick CJ’s dicta in Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 310 as to the purpose of Crown appeals:
	


“On my view of the proper meaning of s 5D in the context of the Criminal Appeal Act, an appeal by the Attorney-General [or the DPP] should be a rarity, brought only to establish some matter of principle and to afford an opportunity for the Court of Criminal Appeal to perform its proper function in this respect, namely, to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.”


	
	It may be that the Crown has, in endeavouring to identify an error such as would overcome the first of the two hurdles specified, felt the need to specify a number of grounds in its amended notice of appeal. However, although the amended notice of appeal contained three grounds, there is, in substance, only one: manifest inadequacy. The other grounds appear to me to form the basis for the substantive ground. The claim of manifest inadequacy is a conclusion and does not depend on the establishment of specific error: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]. Nonetheless the identification of specific error may assist to explain why, if it be so, a sentence is manifestly inadequate. Nothing in CMB supports, in my view, the proposition that specific error must be identified before this Court will intervene, if manifest inadequacy can be established.
	
	
	I propose, in these circumstances, to address the substantive ground, but in so doing I will address the matters raised by the other “grounds”.
	
	
	The starting point for a consideration of a sentence for an offence under s 52A is this Court’s guideline judgment in Whyte. In Whyte (at [204]) this Court identified what it termed a “typical case” of an offence of dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm contrary to s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, which can be identified as involving the following characteristics:
	


(a)   Young offender;

(b)   Of good character with no or limited prior convictions;

(c)   Death or permanent injury to a single person;

(d)   The victim is a stranger;

(e)   No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates;

(f)   Genuine remorse;

(g)   Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.


	
	The guideline given pursuant to s 37A with respect to that typical case is that a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment.
	
	
	The following aggravating factors, which were said to recur frequently (at [216] – [217]), are:
	


(i)   Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted;

(ii)   Number of people put at risk;

(iii)   Degree of speed;

(iv)   Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse;

(v)   Erratic driving;

(vi)   Competitive driving or showing off;

(vii)   Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk;

(viii)   Ignoring of warnings;

(ix)   Escaping police pursuit;

(x)   Degree of sleep deprivation;

(xi)   Failing to stop.


	
	Items (iii)–(xi) were said to impinge directly on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. The Whyte guideline as to the length of the custodial sentence for that typical case, where the offender's moral culpability is high, was that a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors such as the number of victims will also require an appropriate increment to the effective aggregate sentence. By its nature, a guideline judgment is a “guide” or “check”. The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s 21A.
	
	
	It is apparent that the present cannot be regarded as a “typical case”. The respondent was 36 at the time of the offending conduct. He was not of good character and had a lengthy record of prior convictions, principally for driving while disqualified. He was responsible for the death of three people, who were strangers. His own daughter suffered grievous bodily harm. The sentencing judge accepted that he was genuinely remorseful. As his plea of guilty was at the earliest possible opportunity, it was of significant utilitarian value, which was reflected in the 25% discount, which the Crown accepted was appropriate. Accordingly, only factors (d) and (f) applied in the present case and (d) applied only to a limited extent because there was more than one victim and the respondent’s daughter was also a victim. The only respect in which it could be said that the respondent deserved a more favourable outcome than the typical case was that he was entitled to a greater discount for his plea (25% rather than, say, 10-15%).
	
	
	Moreover, there were several aggravating factors, which increased the respondent’s moral culpability: (i) and (ii) (all of the occupants in the other car were killed and his daughter suffered grievous bodily harm); (iv) (his abuse of substances and non-compliance with medication made him susceptible to an epileptic fit); and (vii) (he had been recalcitrant in engaging in driving notwithstanding that he was disqualified and had been warned not to do so because it was dangerous).
	
	
	It follows that, in my view, the guideline judgment is useful only in providing a level below which the sentence imposed on the respondent could not reasonably be set, notwithstanding the difference in discount for the plea. The relevant judgment to be made was how much higher the sentence imposed on the respondent ought be.
	
	
	The Crown challenged her Honour’s finding that the respondent’s “level of moral culpability remains within the mid-range of objective seriousness”. It contended that her Honour’s finding elided two separate concepts: moral culpability (which includes matters personal to the respondent) and objective seriousness (which, as the High Court said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27], must be assessed without reference to matters personal to the particular offender or class of offenders and must be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending). Furthermore the Crown submitted that the respondent’s moral culpability was high as was the seriousness of the offending conduct.
	
	
	Further, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give effect to the findings that:
	



	
	the respondent’s chronic and severe problems that interfered with his judgment and impaired his thinking did not alleviate his moral culpability other than to a “quite limited extent”; and
	
	
	his irresponsibility in consciously deciding to drive, knowing that he had a “very good prospect of an epileptic seizure”, should not reduce his moral culpability.
	



	
	The assessment of the seriousness of the offending conduct is an important part of sentencing: see R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27] per Simpson J, Hall J agreeing and the authorities referred to, including: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]-[72]. The seriousness of an offence also needs to be assessed for the purposes of taking into account the maximum penalty: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 478. However, where no standard non-parole period is applicable to an offence, it is neither necessary nor desirable for a sentencing judge to make an express finding of where on a scale of objective gravity a particular offence lies: R v Sivell [2009] NSWCCA 286 at [2] - [5] and Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [30]-[32] per Howie J, Allsop ACJ and Adams J agreeing.
	
	
	When the respondent made the decision to drive shortly before 8am on 4 June 2013 he knew:
	


a.   he had frontal lobe damage, suffered from epilepsy and had a history of seizures since 1999;

b.   there had been an increase in the number and severity of the seizures from about once every 6 months in 2011 to every 3 or 4 months in the period prior to this collision;

c.   he had used cannabis the night before and the morning of the collision;

d.   he had not properly maintained the regime of anticonvulsant medication that had been prescribed for him;

e.   he had consumed diazepam on the morning of the collision (which had a warning on the label against driving and drowsiness);

f.   he had consumed methadone which had not been prescribed for him;

g.   cannabis and other drugs tended to trigger his seizures;

h.   the RTA had informed him that he could not obtain a driving licence because of the risk of a seizure and a fatal collision;

i.   he was disqualified from driving until 2030;

j.   since 1998 he had been prosecuted for at least 9 offences of driving whilst disqualified;

k.   he had been sentenced for those offences to short fixed terms in 1998 and 1999, suspended terms of imprisonment in 2001, 2004 and 2009, periodic detention in 2009 and three concurrent 18-month full-time terms of imprisonment in 2012;

l.   he was on parole in relation to those three terms imposed in 2012 for offences of driving whilst disqualified when the index offences were committed; and,

m.   his partner had told him shortly before he drove that morning to re-arrange the meeting with his father as he was not permitted to drive.


	
	His decision to drive was a grossly irresponsible one. His moral culpability depended, to a large extent, on whether his judgment to make such a decision was compromised by the mental impairment he suffered as a result of the brain injury he sustained when he was 18 months old. Her Honour found that the respondent’s frontal lobe disorder only had a limited effect on his judgment. That judgment should be accepted. In these circumstances the respondent’s moral culpability must be regarded as high (see R v Gillett at [47]).
	
	
	Although a motor vehicle is a modern convenience when properly handled, it is a deadly weapon when its driver is incapable of manoeuvring it safely. Once the respondent made the decision to drive, he made himself, those of his children who were passengers in his car, and any driver, passenger or pedestrian whom he might encounter on his journey, hostages to fortune. His ability to drive was already impaired to some extent by the drugs he ingested. If the risk of an epileptic response rendering him incapable of handling the vehicle (which was a real risk in light of what he knew as set out above) came to pass, it was a matter of pure chance whether any ensuing collision would result in injuries to himself and the occupants of his vehicle or to others, and whether death would ensue. The respondent decided to take that chance, although the only inconvenience that would have resulted from a decision not to drive would have been that his father would have been left waiting at the meeting place and the respondent might have had to wait a little longer for the cigarettes, gas bottle and milk that were to be handed over.
	
	
	The sentence must reflect the respondent’s moral culpability (which I assess to be high) as well as taking into account his other subjective circumstances. The consequences of his offending (the deaths of Mr Zagar, K and Z and the grievous bodily harm to A) form part of the offences to which he pleaded guilty and accordingly cannot be taken into account separately as circumstances of aggravation.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by her Honour, both individually and in their total effect were, in my view, manifestly inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offences. The applicant’s subjective circumstances do not justify leniency: his recidivism with respect to driving while disqualified displays a long-standing disregard of the law and the safety of others. That he was prepared to drive a car while on parole is another instance of this. The sentencing judge’s remark “surely this time he has learned his lesson” was not a finding but rather a rhetorical expression of hope and in no way diminished the weight to be given to specific deterrence. Her Honour did not find that his mental condition had more than a limited effect on the importance of general deterrence. I am satisfied that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown has surmounted the first of the two hurdles required before this Court will intervene to re-sentence the respondent. I turn now to the second matter: whether the Crown has discharged its onus of negating any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised.
	


The residual discretion


	
	For the following reasons I am persuaded that the residual discretion ought not be exercised in the present case.
	
	
	There has been no relevant delay in either the institution of the Crown appeal or the period within which there is likely to be a resolution of the Crown appeal. The sentence was passed on 19 August 2014. The notice of appeal was filed on 29 August 2014. An amended notice of appeal was filed on 24 March 2015. Although grounds were added, it was, in substance, the same as the notice of appeal and converted that which might be regarded as submissions in support of a manifest inadequacy ground into separate grounds, or sub-grounds. The appeal was heard on 16 April 2015. The non-parole period is not due to expire until 14 November 2016.
	
	
	The appellant did not make any submissions in this Court that are relevantly different from those made to the sentencing judge. The error made by the sentencing judge was not the result of any misstatement of the law or facts or any erroneous submission made by the Crown.
	
	
	In support of his contention that the residual discretion ought be exercised, the respondent relied on his affidavit of 10 April 2015 and an affidavit of Ms Low, the Legal Aid solicitor with carriage of the matter on behalf of the respondent of 10 April 2015. The evidence established that the respondent has suffered additional stress and sleeplessness as a result of the Crown appeal but did not establish that such response was other than one which could reasonably be expected to follow from the prospect that a sentence of imprisonment might be increased.
	
	
	I consider the sentence passed to be manifestly inadequate. Accordingly, in my view a substantial increase is warranted. It is important for this Court to identify elements of offending which may take a particular case outside a guideline judgment.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	In his affidavit referred to above the respondent deposed to his present job in ground maintenance in the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre, which involves mowing the lawn, looking after the garden and removing rubbish. He has enrolled to commence the SMART programme, which is a drug and alcohol rehabilitation programme, but this has not yet commenced. Since being taken into custody in June 2013 he has not had a visit from his partner or any of his three children, which he deposed was “mainly” due to the cost and distance involved. His time in custody will be more onerous because of his epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, although his epilepsy may be better controlled as long as he does not take illicit drugs. His prospects of rehabilitation cannot be said to be good or to have measurably improved since the sentence hearing.
	
	
	I would prefer to re-sentence by passing an aggregate sentence: since all offences arose from the single incident there is nothing to be gained by expressing the degree of concurrence or accumulation, or specifying cascading commencement dates.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


OFFENCE AND SENTENCE

On 25 October 2003 the applicant was convicted by a jury of the murder of Jeffrey Swann (the deceased). The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years.


	
	On 16 December 2005 Mathews AJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years and a balance of term of 9 years. The non-parole period was to commence on 7 June 2003 and expire on 6 June 2018, with the balance of term to expire on 6 June 2027.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence out of time. He relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1 – Her Honour erred “by treating the provision of the standard non-parole period as having determinative significance in sentencing” the applicant.

Ground 2 – Her Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s intellectual and mental disabilities when sentencing the applicant.

Ground 3 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	In June 2003 both the applicant and the deceased were residents of Lowther Lodge, a residential hostel at Brookfield, for people with intellectual handicaps. The deceased had been at Lowther Lodge since it opened in 1983. The applicant had been there for approximately 18 months. The Lodge was under the daily care of Mr Ian Edwards and his wife Christine, who lived in a separate residence on the same property. Representatives of Home Care also attended the Lodge on a regular basis to assist the residents in their normal daily routine.
	
	
	On the evening of 6 June, the residents had retired to their respective bedrooms for the night in the normal manner. The applicant and the deceased had bedrooms in the same section of the Lodge, which they shared with one other person. Sometime in the early hours of the next morning, probably at around 5 o’clock, the applicant went to the communal toilet in that section of the building. The deceased, who was already in the toilet, made some comment to the applicant which for no obvious reason completely enraged him. The applicant pushed the deceased against the wall and punched him around the face and then pushed him down to the ground and started kicking him. The deceased was still able to move and ran back to his room. The applicant also returned to his room.
	
	
	Sometime later the applicant went to the deceased’s room, pulled him out of bed and proceeded to kick him, stamp on him and hit him with a chair. When he realised that the deceased was almost certainly dead, he returned to his room.
	
	
	A little later Mr Edwards came out of his residence. The applicant called him over and said “You’d better come and check Jeffrey”. Mr Edwards went into the deceased’s room and found his body surrounded by a large amount of blood.
	
	
	At a post mortem examination Dr Lee noted no less than 46 signs of recent injury. He concluded that the cause of death was blunt head and neck injury. He made the following observations:
	


“1. The injuries found on the deceased indicate a focused assault on the head, throat and upper chest area. These injuries take the form of multiple blunt force impacts;

2. The degree of head injury was such that a reduction in consciousness would be expected;

3. The degree of damage to the larynx was such that a fatal outcome would be inevitable in the absence of specific therapy.”


	
	When the police arrived at Lowther Lodge and interviewed the applicant, he freely admitted to killing the deceased, as he did in a later electronically recorded interview. When asked why he did it, the applicant could only say that he was so angry and in such a rage that he just had to kill the deceased. He was unable to give any coherent account of what had caused this rage except that it was something that the deceased had said to him in the toilet.
	
	
	At one point he was asked ""Were you thinking clearly"" and he responded, ""Yeah, thinking clearly. I knew exactly what I was doing."" A little later he was asked whether he knew that what he was doing was wrong and he responded ""Yeah I did know. Actually I didn't think about it, I just did it. I just really felt the anger."" Later he was asked again whether at the time of assaulting the deceased he realised that what he was doing was wrong. This time he said, ""No, I didn't actually, no.""
	
	
	The issue at the trial was whether the applicant's liability for murder should be reduced to manslaughter by reason of s23A of the Crimes Act 1900. Under this section a person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if at the time of the offence the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition; and the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
	
	
	The applicant was born in November 1962. He is mildly to moderately mentally retarded, a condition which he has had since birth. His mother suffered from schizophrenia. She and the applicant's father separated when he was quite young and she generally cared for him when he was not in institutions. His father died in 2003. By reason of his disabilities, the applicant is incapable of independent living. He had no significant previous convictions.
	
	
	From the age of 18, the applicant had a series of psychiatric admissions. Many of them related to alcohol abuse and to withdrawal from severe alcohol abuse. A report in the year 2000 raised the possibility that he was suffering from schizophrenia. Dr O'Dea, a psychiatrist called by the Crown at the trial, noted that the applicant's developmental disabilities included problems with both intellectual and social functioning. He appeared to have a longstanding history of at least intermittent problems controlling his anger and impulsive behaviour. Given his family history, the doctor commented that he was at increased risk of developing a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia, but that the symptoms noted in the psychiatric reports which he had seen were not of a typical schizophrenic syndrome. Dr O’Dea considered it probable that at the time of the offence the applicant's ability to control himself was substantially impaired. This impairment arose from his mental retardation which was in turn caused by a defect in the structure or function of his brain, and was thus an underlying condition under s23A.
	
	
	This opinion was shared by the two psychiatrists called in the defence case, Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen. They also considered that the applicant was probably suffering from a form of schizophrenia. They thought that the applicant's capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong might have been substantially impaired so as to bring him within another limb of s23A. Because all three psychiatrists agreed that there was a substantial impairment in his capacity to control himself, this was not explored further.
	
	
	As can be seen, the evidence at the trial was all one way as to the requirements of subs (1)(a) of s23A. It was common ground that the ability of the applicant to control himself was substantially impaired within the meaning of that provision. The issue in contention was whether the impairment was “so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter” as required by subs (1)(b). It was this issue which was decided adversely to the applicant by the jury.
	


PROCEEDINGS ON SENTENCE


	
	Mathews AJ had regard to s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She rejected the suggestion that the applicant’s conduct involved gratuitous cruelty and that the deceased was vulnerable because of his disability. Her Honour reached that conclusion having regard to the applicant’s disability. In relation to mitigating features under s21A, her Honour found that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, that the applicant had no significant criminal record and that he was a person of good character. Her Honour concluded that the killing of the deceased was an unpremeditated action.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s intent, her Honour concluded:
	


“22   … I do not believe that the offender fully understood the consequences of his actions, but the offender's disability and the effects it had on his culpability and will have on his future is the major factor in the sentencing of this offender, so this matter will in any event be taken into account.”


	
	Her Honour noted that all three psychiatrists agreed that the killing of the deceased was the direct result of the applicant’s inability to control himself, which in turn was caused by his disability. She took into account that the applicant was taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs at the time of the killing. Her Honour noted that the applicant had been kept in the Developmentally Delayed Unit in the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay prison since he was taken into custody. There he was receiving high doses of anti-psychotic medication and moderate doses of anti-depressant medication which appeared to have stabilised his condition. The psychiatrists agreed that the applicant would be unable to function without support within the prison system, or live independently after his release. Her Honour concluded that the applicant would need a more structured and supervised environment on his release than that which was provided at Lowther Lodge.
	
	
	Her Honour summarised the application of sentencing principles as follows:
	


“25    Where does this leave us in the sentencing process? First it means that general deterrence should be afforded little or no weight in this case, as the offender, given his disability, is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. Similarly, the offender's subjective culpability for his objectively brutal actions is significantly reduced. On the other hand, the circumstances of this offence, meaningless and brutal as it was, give rise to serious concerns as to his potential dangerousness in the future. Accordingly, individual deterrence and the protection of the public become major factors in the sentencing process. This was precisely the type of situation referred to and discussed by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1996) 84 ACR, page 67.

26    The killing of Mr Swann was, in the words of Dr O'Dea, related to the offender's problems at the time in controlling his anger, aggression, and violent behaviour. These problems were in turn related to his psychiatric diagnosis of intellectual impairment and developmental delay, complicated by a history of problems with alcohol abuse and schizophrenia. Although these problems of anger, aggression, and violence appear to be under adequate control at present, particularly while he is receiving both psychiatric support and high levels of medication, the potential for repetition of some form of violent behaviour can by no means be dismissed. I agree, however, with Mr Fitzgerald that this is not the type of situation envisaged in the R v Veen (No 2). The offender here had no prior history of violent or aggressive behaviour. So long as he receives sufficient care and supervision, one would hope that his condition can be kept under control, thus avoiding a repetition of any serious violence in the future.

27    Clearly, the unusual circumstances of this case, particularly relating to the offender's disability and his need for a structured and supervised environment, constitute special circumstances under s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This offence having been committed in June 2003, the standard non-parole period of 20 years would apply if this offence were in the middle range of objective seriousness for murder. Accordingly, if all else were equal, one would be looking at a non-parole parole period of that order and a total sentence of about 26 to 27 years for this offence.

28    All else is not, however, equal. To summarise what I have already said, the offender's subjective culpability for this offence is significantly reduced by reason of his disability. On the other hand the inexplicable nature of this killing, and the ferocity of the offender's actions, give rise to real concern as to his future management.”

EVENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED AFTER SENTENCE


	
	The applicant has served the past 12 years of his sentence at the Long Bay Correctional Centre, except for a four week period in 2012 when he was transferred to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (MRRC). He has been held in the Intellectual Disability Unit and from October 2006 in the Additional Support Unit (ASU). This is a unit intended for the custody of persons with intellectual disabilities and various forms of mental illness.
	
	
	During that time, the applicant has been involved in breach of discipline matters on four occasions. The only serious breach was in 2010 for fighting with another inmate, whom the applicant said was attempting to “stand over” him. The applicant has obtained five certificates while in custody relating to employment skills, contemporary art and craft, music presentation and participation in learning.
	
	
	A report relating to the applicant’s participation in work and education, dated 12 December 2013, provides an insight into his performance while in prison:
	


“Report from CSI

Inmate Laurie attends work when he feels good. I don’t have a problem with this arrangement. His movements are slow but completes his tasks to the best of his abilities with supervision. Inmate cannot work for a long continuous period. Inmate has no management issues and gets on well with other inmates in the Business Unit and is very respectful.”

“Report from ASU Education

David has always been able to come into my groups and whenever he has, he has done reading, maths and is always at discussion. Unfortunately for David the challenge is for him to be able to concentrate for long periods of time. This is more difficult when he is withdrawing, preferring to do his own thing. David is able to read, now has difficulty writing for extended periods and will have a go at maths. As his attendance has never been consistent, he is often not able in group to complete tasks that enable him to achieve competence in subjects. We did, however, complete an assessment task on the 10.12.13 … On this day was very motivated and answered all questions well and I scribed for him and I was able to do this one-to-one rather in group. He was very positive after and said he should do this more so we will schedule fortnightly one-to-one time just to do written tasks. David has also participated in Art classes in drawing and ceramics and computers, although not completed any certificates since 3.12.2013.”


	
	The applicant continues to receive antipsychotic medication for his schizophrenia by way of fortnightly intra-muscular injection. Justice Health notes indicate that alternative antipsychotic medications have been given to the applicant by injection and attempts have been made to reduce his dose, however, he has subsequently suffered a recurrence of psychotic symptoms and his dose level has been increased. He was found in his cell in May 2011 with a break and dislocation of his right shoulder and a break of his left humerus, which was suspected to have been due to a seizure which he suffered.
	
	
	There have been a number of instances when ASU staff have assessed the applicant as being at risk of self harming and have referred him for closer monitoring in a safe cell environment. The applicant was placed under close observation following his mother’s death by suicide in September 2010. The applicant self harmed by cutting himself with a cup in November 2011 and by swallowing a disposable shaver cartridge in April 2012. The most recent instance of self harm occurred on 15 August 2014 when he cut his left wrist with a shaver.
	


PROCEDURAL HISTORY


	
	On 3 April 2006 the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in relation to his sentence. Legal Aid was refused on 28 August 2006, based on the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.
	
	
	The decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 was handed down by the High Court on 5 October 2011. The decision in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117; 84 NSWLR 328 was handed down on 22 May 2013. The effect of that decision was that an appeal against sentence had to be brought in this Court.
	
	
	On 26 June 2013 counsel advised in relation to an appeal against sentence based on “Muldrock error”. A notice seeking Leave to Appeal Against Sentence out of time was filed on 28 June 2013.
	
	
	Further delay occurred while Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 and O’Grady v The Queen [2014] HCA 38 were considered and decided. Following judgment in those matters, steps were taken to obtain a hearing date for the appeal.
	


DID “MULDROCK ERROR” OCCUR?


	
	I am satisfied that “Muldrock error” has occurred in this matter. When one looks at what the primary judge said at [27] – [28] of her sentencing judgment, it is clear that her Honour took as her starting point the standard non-parole period and then adjusted it by reference to other considerations. This constitutes a clear example of the two-step sentencing process which was expressly disapproved in Muldrock. Accordingly, the applicant has been successful in establishing error.
	


SHOULD AN EXTENSION OF TIME BE GRANTED?


	
	In view of the applicant’s particular circumstances, i.e. his disability, there can be no personal responsibility on his part for any delay. Of necessity he has relied entirely upon his legal advisers to progress the matter.
	
	
	By reference to the procedural history set out above, I am of the opinion that the applicant’s legal advisers have behaved reasonably in taking the steps which they have on his behalf and despite the substantial length of the delay, its occurrence is readily explainable. While the law was as set out in R v Way, the approach followed by the primary judge was unexceptionable and any appeal was doomed to failure. That situation changed following Muldrock. The steps taken by the applicant’s legal advisers following the decision in Muldrock, while not being particularly expeditious were reasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, and also that “Muldrock error” has been established, I am satisfied that an extension of time for the seeking of leave to appeal against sentence should be granted. In accordance with the guidance provided by Kentwell v The Queen, the interests of justice require that an extension of time be granted.
	


IS A LESSER SENTENCE WARRANTED IN LAW?


	
	Since error has been identified in the sentence proceedings, s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies. Explicit guidance was provided in Kentwell as to how s6(3) should be applied in circumstances such as these:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. …

44   … The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody and current mental state, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed by the primary judge failed to give sufficient weight to his intellectual and mental disabilities. In addition, he submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The applicant submitted that the decision in Muldrock, apart from overruling the approach in Way, also provided significant guidance as to how to approach the sentencing of offenders who have an intellectual disability. The applicant submitted that it was clear from the statements in Muldrock that significant weight had to be given to the presence of an intellectual disability because of the impact which it had on moral culpability and therefore the objective seriousness of an offence. The applicant noted that at his trial there was no issue that he was “substantially impaired” at the time that he killed the deceased and that this impairment was causally related to the offence. The applicant drew the Court’s attention to his composite IQ assessment of 64, and the evidence of Dr Nielssen at trial that “he has a child like level of understanding of right and wrong”.
	
	
	The applicant’s submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive is based on the same considerations.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	A submission to the effect that a sentencing judge has given “insufficient weight” to a factor or principle has within it an acceptance that the judge has in fact considered the factor or principle. Once that is accepted, the task of establishing that insufficient weight has been given in that consideration confronts considerable difficulty. As the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27]:
	


“27   … The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. …”


	
	I am not persuaded that the primary judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s intellectual and mental disability. Her Honour carefully recorded the evidence and her application of legal principle was accurate and appropriate. That, however, does not end the matter. As Kentwell v The Queen made clear, the exercise to be carried out by this Court does not involve an analysis of the reasons of the primary judge. Once error has been identified, this Court is required to re-exercise for itself the sentence discretion and to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	The evidence that the applicant has an intellectual disability and suffers from some degree of mental illness is overwhelming. As her Honour appreciated and as has been submitted by the applicant, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation have little weight. The difficulty in sentencing is that the applicant comes within that category of individuals who pose such a high risk of serious offending, apparently without the understanding or the ability to control their own behaviour, that the demands of protection of society must be given considerable weight. There is a real tension between that consideration and the need for the sentence to conform to an appropriate assessment of the moral culpability of the offender.
	
	
	Some assistance on that issue is provided in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at [13] where the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
	


“13   … The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality. ...”


	
	Observations to similar effect were made by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 where his Honour said:
	


“Similarly, in Letteri (NSWCCA, unreported, 18 March 1992) Badgery-Parker J said:

“The principle then is clear enough. It is correctly stated as follows; that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise.”

I emphasise the concluding sentence in that passage.

…

In truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this judgment, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system.”


	
	The reference by Gleeson CJ to the “commencement of the judgment” is to what his Honour said at p69.6 of the judgment as follows:
	


“It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.”


	
	For the purposes of this application, it should be noted that the diminution of the weight attached to, or even the removal of, general deterrence, denunciation and retribution as factors in the sentencing process may, but not necessarily will, lead to a lesser sentence being imposed. Although Gleeson CJ’s comments in Engert concerned persons suffering from a mental disorder, they are equally applicable to persons who have an intellectual disability or as in this case, are affected by both. It follows that the greater weight that attaches to factors such as the need to protect the community and the prospects of rehabilitation which flows from the diminution in weight attaching to other facts, does not necessarily operate in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	It is clear from the Corrective Services notes that the applicant’s time in prison has not led to any significant change in his condition. His response to medication has fluctuated and the instances of self harm are disturbing. On my reading of the Corrective Services notes, I do not detect improvement in the applicant’s condition, most particularly, there does not seem to be any change in the unpredictability in his conduct which was part of the problem facing her Honour. This is despite the fact that the applicant has been living in a very closely controlled environment and has been compliant when taking his medication.
	
	
	Doing the best I can in reconciling those competing considerations, and in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, the orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	An extension of time for the application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	Leave is granted to appeal against sentence and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by Mathews AJ on 16 December 2005 is quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years, and a balance of term of 6 years. The non-parole period is to commence on 7 June 2003 and expire on 6 June 2017, with the balance of term to expire on 6 June 2023.

2766515,R v Pratten (No 15) [2015] NSWSC 573,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Before the Court is a motion, the essential characteristics of which were described in a judgment, which was delivered on 23 April 2015 and contained the reasons for the orders made on 2 April 2015 (R v Timothy Charles Pratten (No 14) [2015] NSWSC 457; hereinafter, “the first judgment on the motion”).
	
	
	On 2 April 2015, on first hearing the motion, I adjourned the motion before the Court, allowed the matter to be relisted on three working days' notice and otherwise listed the matter (including the motion) for trial on 18 May 2015. The first judgment on the motion makes clear that the principles in Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292, as interpreted by the Court of Criminal Appeal and other intermediate courts of appeal in Australia, provide that a person charged with a serious criminal matter is entitled to be represented before the Court in relation to that criminal matter. As I stated in the first judgment on the motion, the Court does not involve itself in the determination of rates or conditions applicable under a grant of Legal Aid. While the Court's jurisdiction is one to protect against an unfair trial, in so doing its capacity is limited to adjourning or staying proceedings that would contravene the principles adumbrated by the High Court in Dietrich v The Queen.
	
	
	The first judgment on the motion contains, at least to the extent necessary, the facts of the situation facing Mr Pratten. For this reason, this judgment ought to be read in conjunction with the first judgment on the motion.
	
	
	There are two developments that are important in dealing with the relisting and re-agitation of this motion. The first is that it is now definite that the Legal Aid Commission has granted Legal Aid to a firm of solicitors and to junior and senior counsel. As is clear from the correspondence before me (and as is known by anyone practising in the criminal jurisdiction) the grant of Legal Aid for junior and senior counsel is, itself, an unusual course.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the issue remains that the amount of time for which the Legal Aid Commission is prepared to pay for the solicitor’s preparation of the matter is ten days. It has been submitted that the evidence before me demonstrates that ten days is insufficient time for a solicitor to prepare properly the proceedings that are before the Court.
	
	
	I have heard, somewhat unusually, from the legal representatives of Mr Pratten who are instructed only on the motion, and also from the junior counsel who is briefed at the re-trial. Notwithstanding the potential conflict that may exist if I were to hear from two counsel for the same party, and the oddity of a bifurcation of a party before the Court, I considered, in the unusual circumstances of this case, that hearing from both sets of legal representatives was the appropriate way of dealing with the issues before the Court.
	
	
	The second development to which I shall refer was the request that had been filed with the Legal Aid Commission by Mr Pratten on 28 April 2015 and which seeks:
	


“An appeal to transfer the grant to Dormer Stanhope and an appeal against the Commission's decision to refuse to increase the grant"".


	
	Mr Pratten, through legal representative on this motion, relies upon the provisions of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW) (“the Act”) in support of a stay of proceedings. That, in turn, depends upon a proper construction of s 56 of the Act.
	
	
	The terms of s 56 (1), (1A) and 1(AA) of the Act, are as follows:
	


“s 56 Appeals 

(1) An applicant or legally assisted person dissatisfied with:

(a) the determination or redetermination, by a person or committee acting in pursuance of a delegation or authorisation under section 69, of an application under section 34 (1),

(b) the variation, by such a person or committee, of a grant of legal aid under section 38 (1),

(b1) the redetermination of a variation of a grant of legal aid, by such a person or committee, under section 38 (1AA), or

(c) a decision, by such a person or committee, to decline payment of the whole or any part of costs under section 47 (4) or (4A),

may appeal to a Legal Aid Aid Review Committee.

(1A) Such an appeal may not be made in respect of the determination or redetermination of an application under section 34 (1):

(a) if the application has been refused as referred to in section 34 (3) (b), or

(b) if the application relates to proceedings in the Local Court with respect to a criminal offence and the applicant is dissatisfied because he or she is required to pay a contribution towards the costs and expenses of the legal services sought by the applicant.

(1AA) Despite subsection (1), an appeal may not be made in respect of the imposition of a condition on a grant of legal aid (whether imposed by way of a determination or redetermination of an application for legal aid, or by way of a variation or redetermination of a variation of a grant of legal aid) if the condition is to the effect that the Commission is to provide the legal aid concerned by any of the following means:

(a) by making available the services of the Chief Executive Officer or members of the staff of the Commission, or

(b) by arranging for the services of the Public Defendants to be made available,

(c) by arranging for the services of private legal practitioners to be made available, wholly or partly at the expense of the Commission.”


	
	An appeal must be lodged with the Legal Aid Commission within a period of 28 days. The Legal Aid Commission itself has the power to allow a longer time. My construction of the provisions of s 56(1AA) leads me to the conclusion that there cannot be, under s 56, an appeal against the decision to arrange the services of a private legal practitioner or, as in Mr Pratten’s appeal, against the identity of that private legal practitioner. That does not mean that within its administrative discretion the Legal Aid Commission is not capable of reviewing that decision, which is a fundamentally different issue. The issue is simply whether s 56 grants the right of such an appeal.
	
	
	The second potential issue that I see in relation to Mr Pratten’s appeal to the Legal Aid Commission is that there is no specific decision of the Legal Aid Commission refusing to increase the grant. Counsel for the Crown submits that the appeal is really an appeal against the grant and is therefore out of time. That may be one way of looking at the application, however, it would fly in the face of the terms of the appeal itself.
	
	
	The third and final issue related to Mr Pratten’s appeal is whether there is a right of appeal against a refusal to vary a grant of Legal Aid. It would seem to me that a proper construction of s 56(1)(b) of the Act would allow an applicant to appeal against a refusal to vary a grant of legal aid, as much as it would allow an appeal against a variation.
	
	
	It does not seem to me that I am required by the provisions of s 57 of the Act to adjourn the proceedings. Even if I were otherwise convinced of the operation of s 56 of the Act, I consider that there are special circumstances that overcome the primary effect of s 57 of the Act, namely, preventing the continuation of these proceedings. I do not, in those circumstances, need to decide finally the operation of the Act.
	
	
	Two further matters need to be addressed. The first of them is the existence, of which I have been informed during the course of these preliminary hearings, of documents in Vanuatu that are in the possession of law enforcement authorities and, as I understand it, to which neither the Crown nor Mr Pratten have access. It would seem to me, on one view, a difficulty for the Crown if such documents exist, since a jury would be entitled to be addressed on the basis that they have not seen all of the relevant documents and they therefore cannot know the proper arrangement between Mr Pratten, the insurance companies, the brokerage firms in Vanuatu and the trust company, nor the manner in which the funds were held in accountants' trust funds.
	
	
	The second matter is the submission from counsel appearing on the motion that as yet there seems to be a lack of confidence by Mr Pratten in the solicitor and counsel who have been allocated the Legal Aid grant. I am told that Mr Pratten has sought an undertaking from the solicitor and counsel that they are able to prepare properly and to conduct properly the proceedings before any such confidence will be forthcoming. My understanding of the operation of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW), and the duties of solicitors and counsel in proceedings, is that they are required by the law to prepare properly and to present properly in all proceedings in which they are acting. Therefore, an undertaking of that kind is an undertaking to do that which is required of a solicitor and counsel in any event. As such, I do not have much regard to Mr Pratten's requirement for such an undertaking.
	
	
	It seems, however, that Mr Pratten’s lack of confidence in the solicitor and counsel for the re-trial returns to the issues that were addressed in the first judgment on the motion, namely whether I can infer that Mr Pratten is conducting himself in a way that hinders the proceedings. I am not prepared yet to draw that inference. I can well-understand, when faced with serious criminal charges, an accused's desire to ensure that the case will be prepared and presented properly. Nevertheless, Mr Pratten’s request for an undertaking gives me some concern as to what, in truth, this motion is about.
	
	
	In the circumstances, and bearing in mind all of the principles to which I referred in the first judgment on the motion relating to Dietrich v The Queen, I am of the mind that a solicitor and counsel having been retained for the re-trial, Mr Pratten is not unrepresented, constructively or otherwise, and I dismiss the motion. I make it clear that the dismissal of the motion does not preclude its re-agitation once solicitors and counsel who are appearing in the re-trial have prepared the matter to the extent permitted by the Legal Aid grant and are aware of what else needs to be prepared. In those circumstances, an application that the matter cannot proceed without a risk to the conduct of a fair trial would be treated significantly differently.
	
	
	The circumstances of these preliminary matters and the lateness of the briefing of solicitor and counsel in the re-trial lead me to the conclusion, suggested by the Crown, that the start date of 18 May should be vacated and the matter listed to commence on 1 June 2015. I will still allow a period of six weeks, which is the original estimate, but the parties should understand that the matter will proceed, subject to applications of this kind, to finality once a jury has been empanelled.
	
	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	



	
	The motion is dismissed;
	
	
	The trial date, being the date of empanelment, of 18 May 2015, is vacated and the matter is listed to commence by empanelment on 1 June 2015;
	
	
	Leave is granted to the parties to approach on three working days' notice in relation to any of the matters I have addressed in these reasons.

		29 April 2016",2015-04-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766516,Kemp v Walker; Kemp v Robbie Walker Transport Operations [2015] NSWSC 490,"Judgment


	
	This is a prosecution in the summary jurisdiction of this court under the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (since repealed and replaced by the Road Transport Act 2013.) The prosecutor, Peter Stewart Kemp, is an authorised officer of the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS). The defendants are Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd (referred to in the material before me as “RWTO”) and that company’s sole director, Robert John Walker. The prosecution arises from a tragic incident on the Mitchell Highway near Bathurst on 14 July 2011. A vehicle and trailer, known as a combination, operated by RWTO, was laden with a number of pre-fabricated steel beams. Part of the load fell from the trailer, colliding with a number of motor vehicles travelling in the opposite direction, causing the death of a woman in one of those vehicles.
	
	
	RWTO, as the operator of the combination, has pleaded guilty to the following offence under the 2005 Act:
	


“that it did contravene s. 56(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 as the operator of a Combination within the meaning of s. 21(1)(a) of the RTG Act, in that on 14 July 2011 on the Mitchell Highway 1km west of Bradwardine Road near Bathurst in the state of New South Wales, a breach of a load restraint requirement occurred, namely cl. 61(2) of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, when part of the Load of five pre-fabricated steel beams fell from the Combination and collided with six motor vehicles travelling in the opposite direction, causing the death of Leonie Darling, an appreciable risk of harm to public safety and a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure.”


	
	Mr Walker, as a director and, as such, a person concerned with the management of RWTO, has pleaded guilty to an offence in the same terms.
	


Facts


	
	There is a detailed statement of agreed facts, which sets out the process by which RWTO was engaged to transport the load. It is sufficient to say that the company was engaged by KGB Protective Coatings Pty Ltd (“KGB”) to transport three large steel beams and two shorter sections of steel fabrication from Newcastle (Gateshead) to a site near Orange. The arrangement was effected through RWTO’s transport manager, David Crighton. The driver was Basil White, who was employed by RWTO through a related entity.
	
	
	The task was undertaken between 13 and 14 July 2011. On 13 July, at Gateshead, the load was placed on the trailer of the combination. That was done by KGB staff, who were not trained in load restraint. They were assisted by Mr White. The process of loading is described in the agreed facts, but I need not recount it. It is sufficient to say that part of the equipment used to restrain the load was “dunnage,” being lengths of softwood timber upon which the load was placed. This was supplied by RWTO. Chains and straps were also used.
	
	
	Mr White was confident that the load was secure before he set off on the journey. He drove to Dunedoo, where he rested overnight. The next morning, he checked the chains and straps to make sure that they were still in place and that the load was still secure. At about 8.30am the vehicle was travelling on the Mitchell Highway west of Bathurst, heading towards Orange, when part of the load fell from the trailer and collided with six vehicles travelling in the opposite direction. As a result, the vehicles and the road surface were damaged. Unfortunately, the driver of one of the cars, Ms Leonie Darling, was killed.
	
	
	After the incident it was discovered that the dunnage supplied by RWTO had compressed under the weight of the load, and that one of the pieces of timber had failed completely due to a defect known as a sap inclusion. Neither Mr Walker nor RWTO was aware of that defect.
	
	
	The agreed facts record that Mr Walker and RWTO had never previously been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence. It is also recorded that Mr Walker and the company co-operated fully with all the investigations by RMS and the police, provided all information and documents requested by them, and Mr Walker voluntarily attended and participated in recorded interviews with RMS.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that Mr Walker was not personally involved in this particular transport operation at any stage. In an affidavit sworn by him for the purpose of these proceedings, he deposed that he was in Wangaratta at the relevant time.
	
	
	Section 56(1) of the Act creates the offence of breach of a load restraint requirement by the operator of the vehicle or combination concerned. Mr Walker’s liability derives from s 178(1), which provides that, where a body corporate commits an offence, a director of that body corporate and any person concerned in its management “is taken to have committed the offence and is punishable accordingly.” The relevant load restraint requirement is to be found in cl 61(2) of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, which provides that a load on a vehicle or a trailer must be secured so that it is unlikely to fall or be dislodged from the vehicle.
	
	
	For the purpose of determining the penalty for breach of a load restraint requirement (among other breaches), s 60(2) of the Act classifies them as minor risk, substantial risk, or severe risk breaches. Subsection (2)(c) sets out a number of factors leading to the classification of a breach as severe risk, including:
	


(i)   an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or the environment, and

(iii)    a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure.

Both those factors are present in this case, so that the breach charged is a severe risk breach. That is a fact bearing upon the determination of the level of fine which might be imposed, but is not an aggravating circumstance as that term is generally understood in sentencing law: Roads and Maritime Services v L & M Scott Haulage Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 107, at [25]-[27].


	
	The breach in the present case being a severe risk breach, and RWTO and Mr Walker both being first offenders, the effect of s 59 of the Act is that the company faces a maximum fine of $27,500 and Mr Walker a maximum fine of $5,500.
	


Subjective case


	
	Mr Walker is now 63 years of age, and he is retired. He had been involved in the transport industry since 1970, initially as an employed truck driver but from about 1976 as the operator with his wife of his own transport business. In 1982 he ran his business through a company known as Robbie Walker (Wangaratta) Pty Ltd (“RWW”). RWTO was incorporated in 1997. It operated in combination with RWW, which owned the fleet of heavy vehicles and employed the drivers or engaged them through sub-contractors.
	
	
	In his affidavit Mr Walker deposed to the increasing size of his transport business over the years and the very large number of loads which his enterprises had transported in the eastern states of Australia. During that whole period there was only one prior incident in which part of a load was dislodged from a vehicle. This was in about 2008, when a piece of fabricated steel fell to the road from an RWTO vehicle, causing damage to a following truck. The incident was not investigated by the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA), as it was at the time, and no charge was laid. Otherwise, it is common ground that during the whole of the period of his involvement in the industry, neither he nor RWTO had ever contravened any road safety legislation or any load restraint regulations or guidelines.
	
	
	From the inception of RWTO Mr Walker’s role had been as a director and manager, responsible for overseeing the operation of the business, including ensuring that the employees were performing their duties properly. A number of full time drivers were employed, as well as operational staff and mechanics. He deposed in the affidavit that prior to the fatal incident it was his practice to closely scrutinise the resumé and experience of any new driver, to ensure that they were capable of operating heavy vehicles and securing loads to be carried. He would make enquiries of their previous employers as to their competence and require drivers to disclose details of their driving history, including particulars of any accidents and of any convictions or traffic offences.
	
	
	Mr White, the driver of the combination on the occasion in question, had been employed on 5 July 2011, nine days before the incident. On 9 July, Mr Walker had personally inspected a combination which he was driving, carrying steel, forklifts and machines, and found that the load was safely secured.
	
	
	Throughout the whole period over which he operated a transport business it was his practice to inspect, on an ongoing basis, the log books of drivers engaged to ensure that hours driven and rests or breaks taken complied with relevant requirements in New South Wales and other States. Over the same period he also personally checked each truck in the fleet to ensure that they were stocked with an adequate quantity of loading and safety equipment, including dunnage and chains to secure a load.
	
	
	After the incident, on 19 July 2011, the RTA sent to Mr Walker, as director of RWW, an improvement notice, pursuant to s 100 of the Act, requiring immediate action to be taken to prevent any further contravention of a load restraint requirement for a heavy vehicle and to provide a summary of that action to the RTA. On 22 July, RWW’s lawyers supplied the RTA with a document setting out a range of new policies and procedures to ensure that there was no repeat of such an incident. A copy of that document, setting out a variety of procedures to which it is not necessary now to refer, is annexed to Mr Walker’s affidavit.
	
	
	Mr Walker retired from the transport industry on 30 September 2013. He has not returned to it and does not intend to do so. Both RWTO and RWW are still incorporated, but the business is no longer in operation. RWW has put its fleet of vehicles up for sale. However, both companies have retained funds in their bank accounts to meet any future taxes and expenses, as well as any fines or costs imposed in the present proceedings.
	
	
	In his affidavit Mr Walker expresses deep remorse for the offence, and heartfelt sympathy for the family of the unfortunate Ms Darling. He adds that he accepts full responsibility for the incident, and is “personally very affected” by it. Indeed, this tragedy was a material factor in his decision to terminate his involvement in the transport industry.
	
	
	Both RWTO and Mr Walker entered pleas of guilty to the charges against them at an early stage and, as noted above, Mr Walker co-operated fully with the police and the RTA in the investigation of the matter.
	
	
	I received testimonials from Mr Walker’s daughter-in-law and from a former employee of his. This material attests to his good character and, in particular, to his sense of social responsibility generally and in the conduct of his business. His daughter-in-law’s letter also speaks of his generosity, his devotion to his wife and two sons, to the depth of his remorse at the death of Ms Darling, and to the effect upon him and his family of the termination of his business. This material, which is unchallenged, is properly to be taken into account on the question of penalty.
	


Penalty


	
	The defendants accept that the breach of the load restraint requirements here amounted to a severe risk breach, on both the bases under s 60(2)(c) referred to above. Section 60(1) provides:
	


“The purpose of this section is to bring to the attention of courts the general implications and consequences of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements when determining the kinds and levels of sanctions to be imposed.”


	
	In The Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Fletcher International Exports Pty Limited [2008] NSWSC 936, Price J considered s 60. At [40], his Honour noted the structure of the section and observed:
	


“The matters to which a court is required by s 60(2) to have regard depends upon the classification of the risk breach as minor, substantial or severe. The matters which a court is required to consider by the Legislature for a severe risk breach are necessarily very different to those for a minor risk breach. The requirement that regard be had to an appreciable risk of harm to public safety is exclusive to sentencing for a severe risk breach: s 60(2)(c)(i). For a severe risk breach it is the seriousness of the risk which distinguishes those matters detailed in subparagraphs (ii)-(vi) from the matters to be considered for a substantial risk breach: s 60(2)(b)(i)-(v). Nothing in s 60 affects any other matter that a court may consider when sentencing an offender such as s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which sets out the purposes for which a court can impose a sentence and s 21A of the same Act which provides for aggravating and mitigating factors.”


	
	In written submissions counsel for the prosecutor, Mr Higgins, set out a passage of the second reading speech of the responsible minister when introducing the Bill for the 2005 Act, which emphasises the breadth of the chain of responsibility imposed by the legislation for breaches of the statutory requirements:
	


“An important concept in the new provisions is the extensive chain of responsibility requirements introduced in the Bill. Under the chain of responsibility prescribed parties including consignors, packers, loaders, or consignees of goods, drivers and operators of vehicles who had control over a step in the process of distributing goods by road may, in relevant circumstances, be legally liable for breaches of road transport laws. These provisions recognise that to date, drivers and operators have generally been the focus of enforcement action for breaches of road transport law … .

Under the new regulatory framework, those other parties in the transport chain who by their actions, inactions or demands put drivers and other roads users at risk and gain unfair commercial advantage may also be committing an offence and be liable to significant penalties. In practical terms, this means that it is essential that all parties to the chain of responsibility – consignors, packers, loaders, operators, drivers and in some cases consignees – need to be aware of the requirements of road transport law particularly relating to mass, dimension and load restraint. They also need to have active systems in place to manage these risks to minimise the chance of road transport laws being breached.”


	
	Counsel for the defendants, Mr Gotting, submitted that RWTO’s offence should be seen as in the mid to low range of objective gravity, and Mr Walker’s in the low range. He noted that neither the company nor Mr Walker was aware of the defect in the dunnage. The driver was confident that the load was secure before his departure from Newcastle, and checked that it was secure the following morning before continuing the journey. Mr Walker was in Wangaratta at the time, and played no part at all in placing or securing the load.
	
	
	Mr Gotting relied upon the fact that neither RWTO nor Mr Walker had previously come under notice for contravention of any road safety legislation or any load restraint regulations or guidelines. He noted the lengthy period over which RWTO had been trading, and the much lengthier period over which Mr Walker had been involved in the transport industry, including as a director of RWW. The incident in 2008 was the only previous occasion upon which a part of a load had fallen from a vehicle while being transported by RWTO, an event which the defendants chose to disclose in these proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Gotting also relied upon the evidence of Mr Walker’s responsible approach to the recruitment of drivers through RWW, and the steps he took personally to ensure compliance by them with regulatory requirements, including those directed to the securing of a load. He also referred to the fact that Mr Walker had personally inspected the load on the vehicle driven by Mr White a few days before the fatal incident to ensure that it was safely secured, and to his prompt and thorough response to the improvement notice forwarded to him after the incident.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Gotting relied upon Mr Walker’s lack of any criminal history, his good character and his deep remorse, as well as his co-operation with RMS and the early pleas of guilty entered by him and RWTO. While he acknowledged the importance of general deterrence for offences such as these, he submitted that specific deterrence has no part to play. Quite apart from Mr Walker’s good record and full acceptance of responsibility for the present breach, it is clear that RWTO has ceased trading and his involvement in the transport industry has come to an end.
	
	
	Mr Gotting accepted that a fine should be imposed upon RWTO, mitigated by all the circumstances to which I have referred, but that Mr Walker should have the benefit of a dismissal under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, if necessary, accompanied by a good behaviour bond. He noted that the Act envisaged that there might be circumstances in which s 10 could be applied, referring to s 187(6). The effect of that subsection is that a person cannot be dealt with under that section for a number of specified offences, including a severe breach of a load restraint requirement, if that person had been given the benefit of the section in the previous 5 years in respect of any one of those specified offences. For completeness, he also referred to similar provisions in s 203 of the Road Transport Act 2013 and s 27F of the Heavy Vehicle (Adoption of National Law) Act 2013.
	
	
	Undoubtedly, Mr Walker has made out a strong subjective case. I accept that he is a person of good character, and that this tragic incident has had a deep and enduring effect upon him. I also accept that there is no prospect of his being involved in an offence of this kind again. However, I am persuaded by the submissions of Mr Higgins that it is not appropriate to deal with him under s 10.
	
	
	General deterrence necessarily looms large in offences such as this. As Mr Higgins pointed out in oral argument, the legislation recognises that this is an industry where “there are a number of different stages at which people discharge a responsibility under the Act,” to ensure the prevention, or at least the reduction, of risk to public safety and to road infrastructure. He emphasised the responsibility cast upon the director of a corporation by s 178(1), a responsibility which is personal rather than vicarious.
	
	
	Part of the load fell from the vehicle not just because of the sap inclusion defect, of which RWTO and Mr Walker were unaware, but also because the softwood dunnage was inadequate to support the load. Mr Higgins referred to the Load Restraint Guide, being guidelines and performance standards for the safe carriage of loads on road vehicles, issued by the National Transport Commission and the RTA. Dunnage is dealt with in section B of the Guide, and contains the following admonition (at p47):
	


“Timber which is used for dunnage should be relatively free of knots and splits. For heavy loads, such as large steel sections that are supported on small areas of contact, the dunnage should be strong enough to prevent it crushing or splitting.”


	
	I cannot accept Mr Gotting’s submission that, on the part of RWTO and Mr Walker, the offence falls into the lower range of objective gravity. Convictions of both defendants should be recorded and fines imposed. However, the fines must reflect the mitigating circumstances of the case and will be reduced by 25% in recognition of the early pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The company which engaged RWTO, KGB, has also faced prosecution because of the incident. It pleaded guilty to similar offences, severe breach of the load restraint requirement, in its capacity as loader of the goods; s 55(1) of the Act, and consignor of the goods: s 53(1). Each offence carried the same maximum penalty, $27,500. Garling J convicted the company of both offences but, taking the view that they encompassed the criminality of one incident, imposed a fine of $18,150 on the first offence only: Kemp v KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 586. His Honour assessed the fine after allowing a 25% discount for the pleas of guilty. It appears that KGB did not present a favourable subjective case such as that made out here. The decision was made available to me after I had reserved my decision in the present case, and it is not suggested that strictly the principles of parity are attracted.
	
	
	But for its plea of guilty, I would have imposed upon RWTO a fine of $22,000. A 25% reduction produces a figure of $16,500. Mr Walker is entitled to a significant degree of leniency in the light of his personal circumstances. But for his plea of guilty, I would have imposed a fine of $1,200. A 25% reduction produces a figure of $900.
	
	
	Accordingly, RWTO is convicted and fined $16,500. Mr Walker is also convicted and fined $900. It is agreed that the defendants should be ordered to pay the prosecutor’s costs, assessed at $20,000.

2766518,R v John Gordon BRADFIELD [2015] NSWDC 57,"Judgment

Reasons for Decision Refusing an Application for Permanent Stay of Proceedings

Introduction   


	
	By way of Amended Notice of Motion, the accused John Gordon Bradfield makes application for a temporary or permanent stay of proceedings on an indictment dated 20 June 2014 containing a total of forty five counts, namely twenty two counts of Making False Statement With Intent To Obtain Money contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, 1900 (NSW), twenty two counts of Make False Instrument contrary to s 300(1) of the Crimes Act and one count of Use False Instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act as those various provisions existed at the time of the alleged conduct. It is alleged that the offending occurred between 1 January 2005 and 1 December 2008.
	
	
	Although the indictment had been filed with the court, it appears that the accused was not actually arraigned on that indictment until the application for the permanent stay came before me when I was sitting in Sydney for the day (I usually preside at Dubbo) on 8 April 2015. The accused pleaded that he was not guilty to each of the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	On 8 April 2015 Mr P Nagle of Counsel appeared for and with the applicant, Mr Bradfield. Mr G Corr, Crown Prosecutor appeared for the Crown opposing the application. I received the amended notice of motion, supporting affidavit and a considerable body of medical material, a great deal of which is duplicated, in the bound bundle, Exhibit 1. Mr Nagle made available a document entitled, “Outline of Submission”, which was marked MFI 1. Mr Nagle also made brief oral submissions. The Crown Prosecutor provided some brief written submissions (marked MFI 2) supplemented by brief oral submissions. Given the amount of medical material to be considered, it was necessary for me to reserve my decision in the matter.
	


The Notice of Motion


	
	The amended notice of motion seeks an order that the proceedings on the Indictment be stayed until further order of the court, no order as to costs and any other order the court deems fit. I understand this to be an application for either a permanent or temporary stay of proceedings on the indictment. The amended notice of motion also seeks findings of fact that the delay in the police investigation has adversely affected the defendant’s right to a fair trial and that the applicant is not medically fit to stand trial for the offences.
	


The allegations


	
	Exhibit A on the application is a Fact Sheet tendered by the Crown. As I made clear on receiving that document on 8 April 2015, that document is to assist me in determining the nature of the allegations against the accused. The following does not purport to be any finding of fact against the accused, rather a summary of what is alleged against him.
	
	
	At all material times the accused was a solicitor, the nature of his practice being mainly conveyancing, wills and probate and limited litigation. He was admitted to practice on 12 May 1967, but relevant to the matters before the Court between 4 April 2001 and 1 February 2006 he was in practice in partnership with Warwick Anderson under the firm name of Bradfield Anderson; after 1 February 2006 until he was suspended from practice on 8 December 2008 he was a sole practitioner, but the firm name remained Bradfield Anderson. On 5 March 2012 the applicant was found by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal to have engaged in professional misconduct and was consequently struck off the roll of practitioners.
	
	
	The applicant in his capacity as a solicitor also managed a mortgage investment service, which was commenced in the 1980s and primarily involved the lending of moneys of existing clients. Paragraph 18 of the Fact Sheet sets out:
	


“… Any investment moneys received were generally deposited directly into the applicant’s National Australia Bank accounts and became part of a general pool of intermingled funds. These funds were either provided to Gordon Nesbitt for development, used as repayment of investor capital or for interest payment to investors. There is no accounting records relating to investment funds dealt with, only deposits into Mr Bradfield’s bank accounts”.


	
	Paragraph 23 of the Fact Sheet sets out:
	


“After 2003 many of the investors, who were elderly clients, were provided with limited documentation regarding their investments. Sometimes they were provided with a covering letter or receipt however the normal practise was for the investor to come into the law practice and collect their Epitomes of Mortgage. Mr Bradfield promised investors they would have a mortgage to protect their investment, however, he failed to inform them it wouldn’t be registered nor did he explain the consequence of an unregistered mortgage in relation to protecting their investment. He also failed to inform his investors that their monies would be used either as repayment of investor capital or for the payment of interest”.


	
	The indictment is complicated in that a number of the counts are numbered but there are counts (a) and (b) pleaded within that count number. The offence numbers on the Fact Sheet do not correspond exactly with the indictment. I will endeavour to as best I can set out the particulars of the allegations against the accused applicant.
	
	
	The accused developed a close friendship with Ivan Markich in the 1960s. In early 2005 the accused applicant approached Mr Markich to loan $200,000 to a Ms Legge. That person was a client of the accused applicant but did not require funds for a purchase of real estate. Mr Markich agreed to advance the money and the cheque was deposited to an account of the accused applicant. The loan was “rolled over”. Count 1(b) appears to relate to the creation of a false Epitome of Mortgage relating to the loan of $200,000. Counts 2(a) and (b) are said to have been committed in June and July 2007. The accused applicant again approached Mr Markich to advance an amount of $230,000 to Mr Gordon Nesbitt, a developer. The money was advanced and paid into an account in the name of Jadlyn Pty Limited. Count 2(b) relates to the creation of the false Epitome of Mortgage document.
	
	
	Counts 3 and 4 are allegations of make false instrument and use false instrument respectively in November of 2008. A total of $300,000 (three sums of $100,000) were obtained from Mr Markich allegedly in respect of an advance by way of mortgage to a Mr and Mrs Schutler for purchased of real estate at Tumbi Umbi. Mr Markich indicated that he would only do so if he had a first mortgage over the property as security. Mr Markich paid the money after receiving a letter from the applicant accused confirming a registered first mortgage. The counts relate to the creation and using of the mortgage document.
	
	
	Ross and Dale Lithgow to whom counts 5(a) and 5(b) relate knew the applicant accused for about 25 years in a professional capacity. On 3 July 2008 Mr Lithgow was in the office of the applicant accused who inquired of him what he was going to do with money received from his (Lithgow’s) late mother’s estate. Mr Lithgow indicated that he was going to put it in a term deposit. The applicant accused told Mr  that he had a friend who needed $200,000 for three months, that he would pay 11% interest and it would be secured by first mortgage. Mr Lithgow eventually agreed and $200,000 was made available. The funds were paid into an account in the name of the applicant accused. Count 5(a) relates to the false statement as to the mortgage and count 5(b) relates to the creation of the false Epitome of Mortgage.
	
	
	Counts 6(a) and 6(b) and 7(a) and 7(b) relate to moneys obtained from Ms Wendy Sifton, who was a client of the applicant accused. At his request Ms Sifton agreed to advance $150,000 to Mr Nesbitt for bridging finance. The money was deposited into account in the name of the applicant accused. Count 6(a) relates to the statements made which on the Crown case were false and count 6(b) relates to the creation of the false Epitome of Mortgage. Counts 7(a) and 7(b) relate to similar conduct several months later when the applicant accused advised Ms Sifton to re-invest the $150,000 and advance a further $50,000. The further sum of $50,000 was advanced but paid into the account of the applicant accused.
	
	
	Count 8 relates to a sum of $100,000 obtained from Mr David Loker, who was a client of the applicant accused. The applicant accused saw Mr Loker in his office one day in June 2008 and inquired of him as to whether he had any surplus funds after the sale of some real estate. Eventually Mr Loker agreed to advance $100,000 which was deposited into the account held by the applicant accused. The applicant accused told Mr Loker that the moneys would be secured by mortgage. This was not the case.
	
	
	In respect of counts 9(a) and 9(b) the accused in 2008 spoke to a Mr and Mrs Rowe about investing money. They agreed to a short term investment of $200,000. In late September 2008 Mr Rowe went to the office of the applicant accused and was handed a signed Epitome of Mortgage that noted that Gordon Nestitt as mortgagor and security was property at Hawks Nest. No other encumbrances were shown and Mr Rowe believed he held a registered first mortgage. This was not the case. When paid over, the money was deposited into the account of the applicant accused. Around Christmas 2008 Mrs Rowe telephoned Bradfield Anderson solicitors but there was no answer. Mr Nesbitt confirmed he was the owner of the relevant property but he was not aware of the loan.
	
	
	Count 10 relates to a false Epitome of Mortgage issued to Mrs Rosina Ciccarelli following her investing money through the firm of the applicant accused. The property offered as security was never registered in the name of Mrs Ciccarelli as first mortgage holder.
	
	
	Counts 11(a) and 11(b) relate to false statements made and the creation of a false Epitome of Mortgage given to Markus Noglik, who had been a long standing client of the applicant accused. In late 2005 he agreed to invest $150,000. The money was paid at the office of the applicant accused through his office manager. The funds were deposited to the account of the applicant accused. Mr Noglik was told that the moneys would be used in respect of a purchase of a unit at Pymble. He was provided with a false Epitome of Mortgage in respect of the property.
	
	
	Mr Robert Eyles is the victim in counts 12(a), 12(b) and 13. He had also been a client of the applicant accused. After Mr Eyles’ wife died, the applicant accused raised the subject of investing funds offering him 10% interest with first mortgage as security. He eventually agreed to invest $100,000. Mr Eyles provided two cheques totalling $100,000, both of which were deposited into the account of the applicant accused. In late November 2008 Mr Eyles received an Epitome of Mortgage in the mail, listing Gordon Nesbitt as the Mortgagor and security on the loan was property at Hawks Nest. Count 13 relates to the creation of a false Epitome of Mortgage in respect of further moneys paid by Mr Eyles. The Fact Sheet notes (par 113) that the documents were generated without the knowledge of Mr Nesbitt.
	
	
	Counts 14(a), 14(b), 15(a) and 15(b) relate to conduct towards Ms Patricia Hollywood. She was introduced to the accused in the early 1990s. In June 2006 the applicant accused told Ms Hollywood that Gordon Nesbitt was having difficulty with the Hawks Nest development and that he needed further funds. She agreed to lend $200,000 with an interest rate of 10% and security by first mortgage. The money was paid by cheque which was deposited into the account of the applicant accused. She received two Epitome of Mortgage documents in respect of Lots 5 and 6, 47 Tuloa Avenue, Hawks Nest. These were false. In October 2006 the applicant accused called upon Mrs Hollywood at her home to discuss borrowing further funds. She agreed to advance a further $150,000. The cheque was paid into the account of the applicant accused. In November 2006 she received an Epitome of Mortgage document. The Crown case is that the Epitome of Mortgage documents were false and the moneys were never advanced to Gordon Nesbitt for development.
	
	
	In early 2006 Robert and Janice Furness made an appointment with the accused to update their will. During the appointment the applicant accused suggested an investment opportunity secured by first mortgage with a return of 10%. After inspecting the development at 30 Tuloa Avenue, Hawks Nest, Mr and Mrs Furness agreed to invest $100,000, paid by bank cheque and which was deposited to the account of the applicant accused. A receipt and Epitome of Mortgage were given to Mr and Mrs Furness. The Epitome of Mortgage documents were false and, again, the moneys were not advanced to Mr Nesbitt. About six months later the applicant accused approached Mr and Mrs Furness about investing further funds, to which they agreed. Again, Epitome of Mortgage documents were handed over. Again, they were false and moneys were not provided to Mr Nesbitt for the development. This is the conduct to which counts 16(a), 16(b), 17(a) and 17(b) relate.
	
	
	Counts 18(a), 18(b), 19(a), 19(b), 20(a), 20(b), 21(a) and 21(b) relate to conduct towards James Manwaring during the period August 2007 and August 2008. The total amount of money involved was $850,000. James Manwaring met the applicant accused in 2006 after seeing an advertisement in the paper to arrange wills for himself and his sick mother. Mrs Manwaring Snr died on 1 August 2007. The applicant accused was responsible for the execution of her will and sale of her property. On settlement the applicant accused spoke to Mr Manwaring about an investment opportunity with Gordon Nesbitt, a developer in Hawks Nest. An interest rate of 10% was offered with security over lots 7,8 and 9 Tuola Avenue, Hawks Nest. Initially $300,000 was provided in late 2007, which was followed by sums of $200,000 in April 2008, $200,000 in May 2008 and $150,000 in June 2008. The moneys were paid into the account of the applicant accused. False Epitome of Mortgage documents were created and provided to Mr Manwaring. Counts 21(a) and 21(b) relate to matters where Mr Ole and Mrs Patricia Schluter were the nominated mortgagors. The Crown case is that the moneys were not advanced to either Mr Nesbitt or Mr and Mrs Schluter. The facts also recite that Mr Manwaring is seeking compensation in the sum of $850,000.
	
	
	Mr Peter Harding is the alleged victim in counts 22(a) and 22(b). He had known the accused for about fifty-five years, going back their respective school days. There was also a professional relationship. It appears from the Fact Sheet that the accused would often include in conversation his keenness to obtain investment funds from those with funds to invest. In 2008 Mr Harding sold an investment property with the accused acting for him on the sale. On completion of the transaction he invested $200,000 on a promise of an excellent return and security by way of first mortgage over property at Hawks Nest. The cheque was deposited into the account in the name of the applicant accused. An Epitome of Mortgage was handed to Mr Harding at the time he handed over the cheque. The documents indicate that Mr and Mrs Harding were to receive the benefit of an interest rate of 11%. The Crown case is that the Epitome of Mortgage was false and moneys were never advanced to Mr Nesbitt, as he had completed 7/30 Tuloa Avenue, Hawks Nest some time earlier and did not require any further funds. Mr and Mrs Harding are also seeking compensation in the sum of $200,000.
	
	
	Counts 23(a) and 23(b) relate to $150,000 advanced to the accused by Ms Elaine Hawkey. This is said to have occurred in February and March 2005. She became aware of the applicant accused through a friend and she made an appointment to see him. Ms Hawkey received from the applicant accused an outline of an investment proposal. She had sold some land and decided to invest $150,000. Mr and Mrs Hawkey were led to believe by the applicant accused that the moneys would be secured by first mortgage over property in Queensland. The cheque for $150,000 was deposited into the account of the applicant accused. An epitome of Mortgage was provided. Mr and Mrs Hawkey would withdraw and add moneys to their investments. Updated Epitome of Mortgage documents were provided. The Mortgagors were Ole and Patricia Schluter, who were not aware of the arrangements between the applicant accused and Mr and Mrs Hawkey. They too are seeking compensation, they having received some moneys from the Law Society Fidelity Fund.
	
	
	Counts 24 and 25 relate to conduct by the applicant accused to Ms Elaine Hills, a person who he known for about sixty years. Mrs Hills attended the office of the applicant accused concerning matters with her late mother’s estate. During the meeting the applicant accused mentioned that he had a friend, George Nesbitt, who was seeking short term finance for a project. The offer was initially declined. On 14 October 2008 the applicant accused spoke to Mrs Hills and indicated he wished to use $150,000 from the estate for a three month loan to George Nesbitt. Mrs Hills said she would think about it. Eventually on 30 October 2008 Mrs Hills withdrew $100,000 and deposited it to the account of Jadlyn Pty Limited. Count 24 on the indictment pleads that the representations included the fact that the loan would be secured by first mortgage. Going to count 25 on 1 December 2008, the applicant accused contacted Mrs Hills and said to her that he had transferred $50,000 of his own money to George Nesbitt for the purposes of the loan and further that he wanted her to urgently transfer a further $50,000. The transfer was made. No Epitome of Mortgage documents were ever received by Mrs Hills. She always took notes of the conversations. It is alleged the moneys were never advanced to George Nesbitt. Mrs Hills is also seeking compensation.
	
	
	The two final counts, namely 26(a) and 26(b) relate to conduct that occurred between 15 May 2007 and 17 July 2008 towards Mrs Mabel Frankish. The accused had acted for Mrs Frankish in drafting Powers of Attorney, Wills and the sale of property bequeathed by an aunt. Around 17 July 2008 Mrs Frankish attended the office of the applicant accused who asked if he could have access to all of the proceeds of her aunt’s property. She received the proceeds of the sale and then handed a cheque for $300,000 to the office manager of the practice. That cheque was deposited into the account of the applicant accused. The Epitome of Mortgage document is allegedly false. She too is out of pocket.
	
	
	Essentially the accused over a number of years approached clients and persuaded them to part with considerable sums of money. The clients were promised significant interest rates and were almost invariably assured that the investments were secured by registered first mortgage. Clearly enough the clients, many of whom had known the accused over a long period of time trusted the accused. The allegations involve a significant breach of trust to a significant number of people. The clients were shown or given Epitome of Mortgage documents that were false. Essentially the Crown case is that the mortgagors as stated on the Epitome of Mortgage documents did not actually receive the money. The total sum involved is $4,029,990, which is very substantial amount. It could not be reasonably suggested that the allegations against the accused are other than very serious indeed.
	


Relevant Principles


	
	Hunt J (as his Honour then was) (Carruthers & Grove JJ agreeing) said in R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337 at 338:
	


“There can be no doubt that the District Court has power to ensure the fair trial of charges to be heard before it and, where necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process, to stay proceedings on the indictment: Barton (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95-6. The onus is upon the accused in such cases to demonstrate that the disadvantage or prejudice which he would suffer during the course of such a trial is in the relevant sense unacceptable to the extent that the trial would be unfair: Barron v A-G (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219.”


	
	Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 at pp 33-34 said:
	


“The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community’s right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial. [References deleted] At the same time the community expects trials to be fair and to take place within a reasonable time after a person has been charged. The factors which need to be taken into account in deciding whether a permanent say is needed in order to vindicate the accused’s right to be protected against unfairness in the course of criminal proceedings cannot be precisely defined in a way which will cover every case….

To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ‘of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences.”


	
	On the issue of “fairness”, Deane J in Jago at p 57 said:
	


“The general notion of fairness which has inspired much of the traditional criminal law of this country defies analytical definition. Nor is it possible to catalogue in the abstract the occurrences outside or within the actual trial which will or may affect the overall trial to an extent that it can no longer properly to be regarded as a fair one. Putting to one side cases of actual or ostensible bias, the identification of what does and what does not remove the quality of fairness from an overall trial must proceed on a case by case basis and involve and undesirably, but unavoidably, large content of essentially intuitive judgment.”


	
	One of the parties (my memory is that it was Mr Nagle on behalf of the accused - I do not have the benefit of a transcript) referred me to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Calleija v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 37. Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) (RA Hulme, Garling JJ agreeing) said at [32]:
	


“In Australia the common law has not recognised the existence of a right to a speedy trial, or even to a trial within a reasonable time based upon any concept of presumptive prejudice. However, there may be circumstances when delay is such that a permanent stay should be granted. When the question of delay is in issue, matters that need to be considered include the length of the delay, the reasons for it, the accused's responsibility for asserting his or her rights and any prejudice suffered by the accused. However, even when those factors are taken into account, ‘a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case and the making of such an order on the basis of delay alone will ... be very rare’: per Mason CJ in Jago at 34.

In Jago, Mason CJ observed at 33:

‘Because there is no constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial, the remedies are discretionary and necessarily relate to the harm suffered or likely to be suffered if appropriate orders are not made.’""


	
	Her Honour went on to say at [35]-[36]:
	


“The category of case in which a stay may be granted is not closed. In Walton v Gardiner at 392-393, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, in the context of an application for a stay of civil proceedings, observed that the court has jurisdiction to grant a stay where its processes and procedures are converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness contrary to their intended purpose of administering justice with fairness and impartiality. Their Honours stated that the categories of cases where a stay may be granted included proceedings which were doomed to failure and the employment of the court's processes in a manner which gave rise to unfairness. Their Honours rejected the notion that a permanent stay may only be ordered where an improper purpose was established or there was no possibility of a fair trial: see Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; 174 CLR 509 at 519-520.

[36] These principles were confirmed by the High Court in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237. The Court confirmed, at 250, [35], that there was ‘no definitive category of extreme cases in which a permanent stay of criminal proceedings will be ordered’: see R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592. Their Honours reconfirmed the need to consider, in the balance, the substantial public interest in having those charged with criminal offences brought to trial. As the plurality (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ) had stated in Williams v Spautz, the confidence in the proper administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring the processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. In Dupas, the Court, at 251, [37], characterised a permanent stay as ‘tantamount to a continuing immunity from prosecution’. It followed that fairness to the accused alone was not the only relevant consideration when determining whether a trial should proceed. Rather, the Court pointed out that the decision whether to prosecute requires an evaluation of the particular circumstances of the case weighed in the context of a number of public interest considerations including public confidence in the administration of justice: see Walton v Gardiner at 395-396; Dupas at 251, [37]; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [172].


	
	More recently, Leeming JA (Adams & Bellew JJ agreeing) in TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174 said at [61]-[64]:
	


[61] “In order to justify an order for a permanent stay of proceedings there must be a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial which is of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do can relieve against its unfair consequences: R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605-6 per Mason CJ and Toohey J; Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 111 per Wilson J; Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34 per Mason CJ.

[62] In R v Edwards (2009) 83 ALJR 717 the High Court articulated the test, by reference to the earlier decision in Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 in the following terms (at 720):

‘.... whether, in all of the circumstances, the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness or whether the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process’.

[63] The categories of circumstance which may justify an order granting a stay of criminal proceedings are not closed, nor are they capable of exhaustive definition. However, it must be recognised that a stay of a criminal trial is an extreme remedy which will be reserved for the most exceptional cases; Barton per Wilson J at 475; Jago per Mason CJ at 582.

[64] The onus remains upon an applicant for an order for a stay to establish a factual basis for the order which is sought: Boulos v R [2008] NSWCCA 119 at [46]. That onus is necessarily a heavy one: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW (2006) 226 CLR 256 at [9].”


	
	Mr Nagle of Counsel on behalf of the applicant accused in his oral submissions emphasised the decision of the High Court of Australia in Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378; 67 ALJR 485. That case involved disciplinary proceedings against medical practitioners where the delay was described as “appalling” and “inexcusable”. The delay in that matter was significantly greater than in the matter presently under consideration. Further, unlike the matters in Walter v Gardiner the allegations in the matter presently under consideration have not been previously litigated. The proceedings that resulted in the applicant accused being struck of the Roll of Legal Practitioners could not, in my opinion, be said to amount to the matters presently under consideration being litigated. In Walton v Gardiner the majority (Mason CJ, Deane & Dawson JJ) said at 494 (of the ALJR report):
	


“As was pointed out in Jago, the question whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined by a weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations. Among those factors and considerations are the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.”


	
	I do not understand the decision in Walter v Gardiner to have in any way modified or changed or impacted upon the principles enunciated by the High Court in Jago, or impact on any of the later cases such as TS v R.
	


Delay


	
	The applicant accused submits that the proceedings should be permanently stayed because of delay. Informing myself from the Court’s file in the matter (there being no other material from either of the parties), it appears that the Court Attendance Notices were created by investigating police on 12 December 2012. The Court Attendance Notices nominated a first return date of 6 February 2013. The Court papers also reflect that that was indeed the first date on which the matters came before the Local Court. Mr Nagle of Counsel has appeared throughout for the applicant accused. The Chronology is as the Crown submits, namely:

	As I understand the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant accused, the issues going to the matter of delay are set out at pars xviii and xix at p 5 of the Outline of Submissions in Exhibit 1, the bound volume of material tendered on behalf of the applicant accused in the hearing before me on 8 April 2015.
	
	
	Those paragraphs are as follows:
	


“If Mr Bradfield had been charged in 2009 or for that matter 2010 as he was in 2013 then Mr Bradfield would have had an opportunity to subpoena the bank statements, taxation returns, financial accounting documents etc. of all the witnesses because it would have been assumed that legal aid would have been granted for the trial. In fact, it was refused for some time for a trial for Mr Bradfield and he had to appeal to get a grant of legal aid (see paragraph… [sic] of Mr Kelvins’s affidavit)

Because of the course of time many witness’ memories would have diminished and the cross-examination of these witnesses and for that matter even the evidence of the chief of Crown Witnesses, if not led, would be tainted and or the veracity of witnesses limited. Mr Bradfield would be, it is submitted, denied a fair trial. This is not a criticism of the police who would have investigated this very difficult and complex matter, but delay in the investigation was, the defence asserts, because all the difficulty that the Crown and Defence now suffer came from the lack of early support to the police from the Law Society”.


	
	It is also submitted that the police “raided” the offices of the applicant accused and that, “Mr Bradfield was for some time denied access to actual documents seized from his office” (see par xxii at p 6 of the submissions). Implicit in that last statement is that the applicant accused now has access to those documents. The Fact Sheet from which my summary of the allegations against the accused is drawn makes numerous references to the Law Society’s Fidelity Fund. There is no specific evidence before me, but it must be uncontroversial that that Fund would keep records. There would also be reports from trust account inspectors, auditors and the person assigned by the Law Society as the administrator of the practice that was conducted by the applicant accused. It is not suggested in the material before me that any of the records relating to the practice have been destroyed or are missing. The accused would be entitled to full and complete disclosure, including of all relevant documents. I cannot find in the material before me that there is any suggestion of the Crown not giving full and complete disclosure.
	
	
	The accused was committed for trial on 22 January 2014. The notations within the court file indicate that the matter has been mentioned on nine occasions up until 8 April 2015 when the stay application was listed. Given the nature of the allegations and the obvious complexities of the matter the delay between the date of charging (12 December 2012) and the date of committal for trial cannot, in my opinion, said to be in any way excessive.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accused maintains that the delay of four years before the accused was charged is excessive. However, this has to be seen in the context of what occurred. So far as I can determine from the Fact Sheet, on 5 November 2008 apparent irregularities in the trust account of Bradfield Anderson Solicitors were reported to the Law Society. On 18 December 2008 the practising certificate of the applicant accused was suspended. On 22 December 2008 the Supreme Court of New South Wales appointed a receiver to the practice.
	
	
	Investigations could only have commenced at or about the time of the appointment of the receiver. Clearly, there would have been a considerable amount of material for investigators to consider. Further, the moneys to which the various counts on the indictment relate were not paid or processed through the trust account but rather, according the Fact Sheet, exhibit A, usually through a passbook account held in the name of the applicant accused. The facts set out that on 5 March 2012 the applicant accused was struck off the roll of practitioners. Clearly enough, the Law Society of New South Wales would also have been conducting its own enquiries about the applicant accused. Logic would dictate that the police would not have been called in to investigate until some after the “irregularities” in the trust account came to light.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor sets out a brief chronology on the second page of the unnumbered submissions, which is extracted above. According to that chronology the Law Society informed the police on 30 April 2009. Further, the Crown submitted:
	


“The length of the delay is not exceptional. The matter is extremely complicated. The initial investigation was by the Law Society. When the matter was referred to the police they had to conduct their own investigation because much of the material with the Law Society was privileged and not available to them and such material as was with them was not in the proper format for a criminal investigation. The accused asserts that material will not be available under subpoena because of the effluxion of time. There is no evidence of any attempt by the Accused to subpoena this material or of any failure of it to be supplied”.


	
	I have no note or memory of any submission being made on behalf of the applicant accused that any material has gone missing through effluxion of time. So far as I can determine, the Crown Prosecutor is correct that the applicant accused has put on no evidence of any attempt to obtain the material or any failure by the Law Society or any other person or body to produce material. It is not suggested in either evidence or submissions that any records held by the Law Society have been lost or destroyed. I agree with the submissions by the Crown Prosecutor in this regard.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, given the complexities involved, the amount of moneys involved and the number and nature of the transactions, noting in particular that most of the moneys were processed through the personal passbook bank account of the applicant accused the records relating to which would not have been immediately available to trust account inspectors or other officials of or appointed by the Law Society or investigators when the matter was originally referred to them, the delay of four years between the irregularities being reported and charging is not so excessive as to justify the extraordinary remedy of a permanent stay of proceedings.
	
	
	Accordingly, so far as the issue of delay per se is concerned, I am firmly of the opinion that the matters raised by the accused do not justify the court permanently or temporarily staying the proceedings.
	


UN Charter on Human Rights


	
	At p 22 and continuing of the Outline of Submissions (MFI 1) and p 6 of the Outline of Submission in the bound volume Exhibit 1 (which appear to be the same submission) counsel for the applicant accused refers to and makes submission on an article by Edward Cole titled “Australian Practice in International Law 1996” published in [1997] AUYrBkIntLaw 9; 18 Australian Year Book of International Law 279.
	
	
	It is no longer controversial that in exercising discretion courts can and should have regard to the international treaties to which Australia is a signatory. Spigelman CJ (Beazley JA - as her Honour then was - agreeing) said in Re Tracey [2011] NSWCA 43 at [27]-[33]:
	


“In the case law to which I will refer, the word ‘discretion’ is not deployed in any technical common law sense. It extends to matters which may more accurately be described as the formulation of a judgment, as distinct from exercising a power to choose. Each of the matters pertinent to the present case, ie, the formulation of a state of satisfaction that it is ‘appropriate’ to vary or rescind an order and the determination of the ‘adequacy’ of the standard of care, fall within the concept of a ‘discretion’ as so understood. (Cf F Bennion ‘Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion’ [2000] Public Law 368; F Bennion ‘Judgment and Discretion Revisited: Pedantry or Substance’ [2005] Public Law 707. See also Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [19]-[21]; Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Limited [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at [37]-[40]; Perpetual Trustee v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 at [34]-[40]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Sami El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154; (2006) 66 NSWLR 93 at [64]-[70]).

[28] By reason of its comprehensive treatment of the circumstances in which an international instrument can have an effect on Australian legal decision-making, and his Honour's subsequent elevation to the High Court, the most frequently cited judgment on these matters is that of Gummow J in Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade v Magno [1992] FCA 566; (1992) 37 FCR 298 (‘Magno’). His Honour states that an administrative decision-maker may have regard to an international agreement or obligation in ‘exercising a discretion’ under a municipal law (at [18]).

[29] Although this particular question did not directly arise in Magno and, accordingly, was not expressly considered by the other member of the majority in that case, it is pertinent to note that the same proposition appears in an earlier joint judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court, in which Gummow J participated (Gunaleela v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1987] FCA 277; (1987) 15 FCR 543 at [50]-[59]) and in another judgment of the Full Court where Gummow J wrote the principal judgment, with which the other members agreed (Heshmati v Minister for Immigration [1991] FCA 387; (1991) 31 FRC 123 at [21]-[22]). In each of these earlier cases, the Full Court of the Federal Court concluded that Australia's international obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was relevant to the exercise of discretions by decision-makers under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).

[30] A particularly apposite application of this line of authority was the acceptance by French J, when a judge of the Federal Court, that the CROC could be a relevant consideration for an administrative decision under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). In Le v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 875, his Honour said (at [59]):

‘There is nothing in s 501 which expressly requires that the Minister have regard to the best interests of the visa holder's children as a condition of the valid exercise of the cancellation power. Nor is there anything in the language of the Act to support an implication to that effect. In the international context, Australia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and therefore is bound, in international law, by the obligation, in legislative, executive and judicial decision-making to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration “In all cases concerning children”. However the existence of that obligation at international law does not, unless incorporated by the Parliament into domestic legislation, give rise to a corresponding substantive obligation which conditions the exercise of statutory powers. The provisions of an international treaty to which Australia is a party may be a relevant consideration in the exercise of statutory discretions (Magno, at [18], Gummow J). Such considerations do not thereby become mandatory.’

[31] French J went on to refer to, and apply, the principle that an international obligation is not a mandatory relevant consideration attracting judicial review for jurisdictional error. His Honour referred to the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Re Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [101].

[32] However, the issue that arises in the present case is not whether Balla DCJ was obliged to take into account provisions of the CROC as relevant considerations. The issue in the present case is whether her Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration by rejecting any reliance on the CROC, as she did explicitly. The relevant jurisdictional error is her Honour's positive statement, in effect, that none of the provisions of the CROC were capable of constituting a relevant consideration.

[33] Although the above line of authority is concerned with the exercise of discretions conferred upon the executive branch of government, there is authority that extends this principle to discretions conferred upon the judiciary. (See, eg, McKellar v Smith (1982) 2 NSWLR 950 at 962 [the exercise of a discretion to admit a confessional statement made by a child or young person into evidence pursuant to the Child Welfare Act 1939] and see generally the cases set out by Bell J in Tomasevic v Travaglini [2007] 17 VSC 337; (2007) 17 VR 100 at [73] fn 49; see also Wendy Lacey, ‘Judicial Discretion and Human Rights: Expanding the Role of International Law in the Domestic Sphere’ (2004) Melbourne Journal of International Law 4.) In my opinion, the principle referred to at [23] above does apply to the exercise of a judicial discretion.”


	
	However, the counsel’s submissions do not refer to any particular treaty, but instead refer to a Statement made on behalf of the Australian delegation on the Fifty-Second Session of the Commission on Human Rights. In part that statement reads:
	


“…In the absence of a binding human rights convention in this area, Australia’s belief is that the rights of persons with disabilities are best assured internationally, for the time being, through the monitoring procedure under the standard rules…Of course this is not intended to derogate from other vital means of human rights protection, for example, through the activities of mainstream human rights treaty monitoring bodies. In this regard Australia encourages the firmer and clearer recognition of disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the major international human rights conventions, in line with similar recognition accorded by the Commission to health and HIV/AIDS status. Australia is pleased to note the specific provisions made for disability in Articles 2(1) and 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and commends the work recently done by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the CEDAW Committee (amongst others) in ensuring the property recognition of disability as a human rights issue within the meaning of ICECR, CEDAW and other major Human Rights Instruments.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant accused then goes on to extract from a speech by H.E. Mr Howard Bamsey to the Fifty-Second Session of the Commission on Human Rights. Relevantly, the last paragraph of the extract reads:
	


“The primary safeguard for the protection of human rights is a democratic society. There are numerous structures which democratic societies may take, and Australia respects the differences that occur from country to country. But five elements are essential to safeguarding individual rights:

▪ Adherence to the rule of law;

▪ An independent judiciary;

▪ A free press;

▪ Freedom of speech and assembly; and

▪ The right to a fair trial”.


	
	No reasonable argument could be advanced to the contrary. The extracts from the speeches to the Fifty-Second Convention on Human Rights are very general, as those types of speeches almost invariably are. That is the nature of international diplomacy. Counsel for the applicant accused does not appear to make any specific submission as to which treaty or part thereof would be breached by the matters against the applicant accused continuing. In the absence of any such specific submission, I infer that and proceed on the basis that the suggestion or submission is that the applicant accused would not receive a fair trial because of the delay and his ill health. It is undoubted that the applicant accused has a number of significant health issues, which will be examined later in this decision. I have already dealt with the aspect of delay.
	
	
	The applicant accused is unwell and perhaps infirm rather than disabled. As I have concluded, the delay in this matter is not exceptional given the issues and the amounts of money and persons involved. Ultimately, I am not persuaded that the continuation of the charges against the applicant accused would entail any breach of Australia’s international treaty obligations. The applicant accused does not succeed on his application for a permanent or temporary stay of proceedings on the basis of any breach of international treaty obligations.
	


Health of the applicant accused


	
	The bound volume of material, Exhibit 1, relied upon by the accused contains a considerable volume of medical reports, many of which are duplicated. There is not the slightest doubt that the applicant accused suffers from a number of medical conditions. However, as the Crown Prosecutor correctly submits (p 1 written submissions, MFI 2) the question is whether the accused is fit to stand trial. In the circumstances of this case the word “physically” should be read immediately before the word “fit”. I do not understand that there is suggestion in any of the reports or submissions made by counsel for the applicant accused that the provisions of Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, 1990 (NSW) are enlivened.
	
	
	The medical practitioners who have provided reports about the medical condition of the accused are (not in any particular order): Dr Margaret Sheridan, Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr Lewis-Enright, General Practitioner, Dr David Gray, Cardiologist, Dr Peter Frederiksen, Dermatologist and Dr Malcolm Ogborne, Consultant Physician in respiratory and sleep disorders. There is also a report from Associate Professor Shumack, dermatologist, who examined the accused for the Crown. Counsel for the accused submitted that all of the medical material should be examined as a whole as it clearly demonstrates a deterioration in the health of the applicant accused over the years since the investigation began.
	
	
	At the hearing on 8 April 2015 the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the accused had failed or neglected to keep appointments with other medical practitioners arranged by the Crown, in particular a psychiatrist. Mr Nagle on behalf of the applicant accused submitted that the accused is willing to keep such appointments. It was submitted that the accused was in hospital. However, no further details were given in this regard.
	
	
	In her report of 9 September 2013, Dr Sheridan says:
	


“In the early weeks of my assessment of Mr Bradfield it became apparent that he was a very self-sacrificing individual, that in his striving to serve the needs of others he was not always paying sufficient attention to the day to day details and there is significant evidence that he may have been operating in a misinformation vacuum which could be considered to be accidental negligence”.


	
	With respect to Dr Sheridan in that part of the report extracted immediately above she has become an advocate for the applicant accused rather than an expert witness and in my opinion her impartiality must be seriously questioned. Her opinions will need to be considered in this light. None of her reports set out to what material, other than information from the applicant accused, she has had access. However, later in that same report Dr Sheridan opines:
	


“It is very noticeable when a legal matter is portending for Mr Bradfield’s concentration and attention in our sessions to be limited, his stress levels to increase, the rash on his legs to increase and there is no way Mr Bradfield could cope with a week in a witness box, let alone months of cross-examination. In my opinion not only would his mental capacity reduce but his general physical capacity would be impaired”.


	
	The matter has its obvious complexities. Any cross-examination of the applicant accused would be lengthy and involved and he would need to be taken to many of the documents. However, appropriate arrangements could be made, as the Crown appropriately submitted, by having shorter hearing days and the taking of regular breaks during the evidence. Dr Sheridan does not clearly opine that the applicant accused is not physically fit to stand his trial.
	
	
	In a report of 28 April 2014 Dr Sheridan says that,
	


“In September and October 2013 Mr Bradfield’s mood deteriorated, I increased his medication with some benefit… His cognitive impairment has deteriorated since the time of his neuropsychological testing with Dr Gilandas. He relies heavily on his diary for small day to day events and his interests are very narrow, he frequently cannot see the bigger picture and is highly reactive to immediate events”.

She goes on to opine that the applicant accused is mentally unable to represent himself fairly in a court hearing and the added stress of this would cause a deterioration in his physical and mental health. On this last point, it is simply not suggested that the accused will represent himself at trial noting what I will be saying later in these reasons on the issue of the grant of legal aid.


	
	Dr Lewis-Enright is the treating general practitioner. In a report of 16 September 2013 he opines:
	


“It is my firm opinion that John Bradfield’s reduced respiratory function will contribute significantly in an adverse manner to his ability to participate in the proposed trial and will also adversely affect his ability to communicate, prepare evidence, undertake cross-examinations – the basis for this opinion is that with reduced functional respiratory capacity Mr Bradfield will tire more easily and will not be able to concentrate on the subject matter as easily as if he were not so incapacitated”.


	
	In a report of 28 April 2014 Dr Lewis-Enright sets out that “Overall there has been a deterioration in John Bradfield’s physical and mental health since my last report”. The doctor in that same report goes on to opine that the applicant accused would require breaks for medical treatment.
	
	
	However, as the Crown Prosecutor correctly submits in his written submissions, in a report of 6 March 2015 Dr Lewis-Enright does not opine that the applicant accused is physically unfit to stand trial. Dr Lewis-Enright in that report is of the firm opinion that the applicant accused could not travel to and from court by public transport. He goes on to opine that Mr Bradfield would require frequent breaks, a toilet break every 60-75 minutes and that court sitting times be reduced to 3.5 to 4 hours per day. A normal court sitting day is five hours. There is no reason why the needs of the accused could not be met by more frequent breaks and shorter sitting days. Given the nature of the allegations and the complexity, it seems to me that this matter would be appropriate to be dealt with by a judge alone, but this is a matter essentially for the accused. If the matter is heard with a jury there would need to be arrangements made for reserve jurors and the jurors would need to be advised at the very beginning of the trial that the sitting days would be shorter and that there will be frequent breaks.
	
	
	Dr Peter Frederiksen is the applicant accused’s treating dermatologist. In a report of 9 September 2013 he says:
	


“This gentlemen [the accused] has a long history of dermatitis affecting his arms and more particularly his legs. I first saw him in December 2010 with a significant problem of lipodermatosclerosis eczema and cellulitis affecting his lower legs. Lipodermatosclerosis is a chronic long term problem caused by longstanding venous incompetence leading to fibrosis of the skin. The fibrosis reflects a situation of very poor circulation which relates to easy inflammation frequent infection and very slow and poor healing. The condition is in essence irreversible and likely to be progressive”.


	
	Further, Dr Frederiksen opines that, “As to his fitness for his committal proceedings and subsequent trial I think it is highly likely that the stress of these events will exacerbate his skin disease”. A little later in the report the doctor sets out that the accused would require frequent breaks from his trial for care of his legs. A similar opinion is given in a report of 7 May 2014. I have already made observations that the court could accommodate breaks within the proceedings for any medical treatment.
	
	
	In his most recent report of 25 February 2015 Dr Frederiksen says:
	


“As I have previously commented, while it is impossible to directly measure the role of stress and disease, Mr Bradfield’s skin disease does seen to be worse during periods of stress and as I would expect with the committal hearing/trial extending for weeks to months there is a very strong likelihood that his skin disease will deteriorate. The management of those exacerbations essentially consists of elevation and bed rest in conjunction with more intensive topical therapy and antibiotic therapy.

I think it highly unlikely that he will manage six weeks of daily hearings without the need for a period of bed rest. As you well know he has recently had quite significant cardiovascular events but I will leave it up to the relevant specialist to comment on that.

His skin condition is always itchy and at times painful. Chronic itch is very distracting making concentration difficult and it also interferes with sleep leading to sleep deprivation with its associated complications. He has struggled with his disease for quite some time and will continue to do so for some time yet. I think it unlikely that his skin disease let alone his many other health problems would allow him to participate in a trial of the length you predict.”


	
	As I have already observed a number of times, there is no reason why the court could not accommodate more frequent breaks in the proceedings. In long trials it is not uncommon for an accused, legal practitioner or juror to become ill such that the trial is adjourned for a day or two.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor also correctly submits that Dr Frederiksen is the only one of the medical practitioners who have provided reports who is of the opinion that the accused is physically unfit to stand his trial. Even so, that opinion appears to me to be qualified to the extent that the accused would require bed rest. Further, as the Crown Prosecutor also correctly submits, there is also the opinion of Associate Professor Shumack of 24 July 2014 who examined the accused at the request of the Crown. His is the only medical report that refers to the Code of Conduct for Expert Witnesses.
	
	
	Associate Professor Shumack says in his report that he believes that Mr Bradfield is, “indeed fit for trial and able to enter a plea. The lipodermatosclerosis along with the eczema/dermatitis involving both lower legs can certainly be treated and whilst it is possible it may flare with stress I believe that, on the balance of probabilities, that this is unlikely to occur”. The Associate Professor goes on say that it would be appropriate to allow the applicant accused to sit in court with his legs elevated. It seems to me that that is something that could be easily accommodated.
	
	
	Exhibit 1 also contains a number of reports by Dr Malcolm Ogborne, Consultant Physician in respiratory and sleep disorders. In a report of 19 September 2013 Dr Ogborne says:
	


“Whilst the nature of his condition certainly falls within the severe range, he is not dependent on oxygen and remains mobile. I believe that as long as he takes his medications as prescribed, does not smoke again and remains under regular medical review his disease will remain fairly stable for some time. I do not feel that the committal proceedings or the trial are likely to have a directly negative impact on his lung disease. As stated these patients are more prone than patients without COPD, to infrequent infective illnesses and flare ups of their disease but I don’t think that his upcoming trial poses a particular risk in this regard over and above that would be expected from his normal day to day activities”.


	
	Dr Ogborne goes on to recommend that the applicant accused use a lift. That is no issue in any of the court complexes in Sydney where the trial would be held. Further, Dr Ogborne sets out that the applicant accused is not dependent on oxygen and his belief was that that situation was unlikely to change in the twelve to twenty-four months from the date of the report.
	
	
	There is a further report from Dr Ogborne dated 26 February 2015. The doctor notes that the applicant accused does not require long term oxygen therapy and goes on to say:
	


“…(T)hat now that the accused has stopped smoking and is compliant with medications, his lung disease will remain relatively stable over the next 12-18 months. I have been asked to offer an opinion about his ability to attend court and fulfil the various obligations and requirements thereof. I have no doubt that this gentleman has significant disability due to his very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He gets short of breath on only mild exertion and cannot walk for more than a hundred yards or so on the flat before he has to stop and rest. He would undoubtedly find all of these duties exhausting and tiresome. There is no doubt that he will find getting to and from court and attending the various hearings exhausting. His ability to participate would certainly be improved with simple measures such as parking assistance, the use of lifts and shorter sessions. I do not believe that his attendance at court is likely to make his lung disease worse. However, it is up to the court to decide I think whether his significant disability to his lung disease disqualifies from appearing…”


	
	There is, at and about the various reports of Dr Ogborne, material and test results from the Hornsby Respiratory Laboratory. In a report of 21 May 2014 Dr Obgborne opines that the accused would now meet the criteria for very severe COPD. That report further notes that the accused has an FEVI of 20% predicted for his age and height and a DLCO which is only 19% predicted for his age and height. I presume that last figure relates to lung capacity. There is no other document that I can find within the volume that is Exhibit 1 that otherwise attempts to interpret any of the results from the Hornsby Respiratory Laboratory. Therefore, the raw figures in the report have little meaning.
	
	
	Essentially, as I understand the reports by Dr Ogborne he does not opine that the accused is physically unfit to stand his trial. Rather, he suggests shorter court sessions and, as the Crown submits, other palliative measures. As I have already observed, in the circumstances of this case, shorter sessions are something that could be very easily accommodated. Likewise, parking nearby the courts in Sydney should not be an issue and again, the court complexes where this matter is likely to be heard have lifts.
	
	
	Dr David Gray is the accused’s treating cardiologist. He too has provided a number of reports. Again, some of those reports are duplicated in the volume Exhibit 1. The most recent report is that of 2 March 2015. That report records that the accused was admitted to the Sydney Adventist Hospital from 9 October 2014 to 23 October 2014 with respiratory failure. He required intubation and respiratory support in the intensive care for a number of days. Dr Gray went on to say that, “there was no convincing evidence for any respiratory infection”. Further, Dr Gray sets out that the most recent echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction between 30% and 35% (normal being 50% to 70%). Then appears answers to specific questions posed by the accused’s legal representatives. Those answers are:
	


“1.   Given that Mr Bradfield has significant COPD and cardiovascular disease, travelling daily by train to and from the District Court from his home at St Ives would be a difficult undertaking for him.

2.   I do not feel sitting with his legs up on a chair for a prolonged period in court would have an adverse impact on his heart problems, provided he remains compliant with his cardiac medications.

3.   When his cardiac and respiratory problems are stable, I believe he does have the capacity to give proper instructions and remain competent. However both his cardiac and respiratory reserve are limited and there would be the potential for him to decompensate reasonably quickly if he contracted an infection or neglected to take his medications.

4.   It is difficult to comment on how his depression might affect his heart during the trial. Firstly, I do not know how significant his depression currently is. Secondly, whilst there is an association between depression and cardiovascular disease, the data relates primarily to worse outcomes in patients who have ischemic heart disease and severe depression. At this stage there is no evidence that Mr Bradfield has ischemic heart disease, rather his problem is that of a cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness).

5.   If the presiding judge were to reduce the hearing time each day to, say a period of three hours, I believe this would be beneficial to Mr Bradfield, reducing both the physical and emotional stress on him.

6.   With regard to the length of the trial, there is undoubtedly the potential for Mr Bradfield to be absent from the court room intermittently if he were to contract a chest infection or if other intercurrent health problems developed.

7.   If Mr Bradfield was needed to be in the witness box for at least five to seven days, it would be advisable for him to have regular breaks as his capacity to cope with both the physical and mental stress of cross-examination would be limited.

8.   I do not feel I can comment on Mr Bradfield’s mental capacity to give proper instructions to his lawyers. I presume he is familiar with the details of the allegations against him but his ability to concentrate for long periods would, I suspect, be limited.

9.   As indicated above, Mr Bradfield has moderately several cardiovascular problems. Many patients with his degree of cardiac disease can function entirely normally provided they take their medications and react appropriately when they notice any change in their health. In my opinion, the more severe medical problem that Mr Bradfield has relates to his significant lung disease and this would be the main contributor to his limited exercise capacity. For this reason, it strikes me as appropriate that any opinion be obtained from Mr Bradfield’s respiratory physician as well.”


	
	Again, it is noted that the doctor recommends shorter sitting days and regular breaks. As I have already said a number of times already, those matters are easily accommodated. Ultimately however, Dr Gray does not opine that the accused is physically unfit to stand his trial.
	
	
	Mr Nagle of counsel in the course of the brief oral submissions made on 8 April 2015 emphasised the need to consider the medical material as a whole and further it was submitted that a thorough examination of the material will reveal a worsening of the health of the accused over the years. The accused is undoubtedly unwell. I have carefully read and re-read all of the medical material contained within Exhibit 1. I agree that the reports do tend to demonstrate that the health of the accused is declining. However, taking the medical material as a whole, I am very firmly of the opinion that the accused is not so physically unfit that he is not able to stand his trial. The measures as recommended by the various treating medical practitioners can be easily accommodated by the court.
	
	
	Further, Mr Nagle urged the court to carefully consider the material from the “SAN”, which I take to mean to be a reference to the Adventist Hospital. There is a report of 30 January 2009 which relates to the attempted suicide by the accused on 22 December 2008 after taking an overdose of Panadeine Forte and Gastrostop. I note that 22 December 2008 was the date on which the Law Society of New South Wales took over the law practice of the accused. The report sets out the treatment given to the accused. I note that the accused has since been consulting Dr Sheridan, consulting psychiatrist. There is a volume of material following the report relating to various procedures and the accounts for those procedures. Given the material relates to late 2008 they do not appear to me to have any relevance to the issue that I am called upon to determine, particularly in light of the numerous and more recent reports mostly from medical specialists.
	
	
	At p 10 (point 3(f) of the submissions contained within Exhibit 1, (the bound volume). Mr Nagle on behalf of the accused submits that, “There is also a problem of potential suicide during the trial (note he has tried it before) and if found guilty and to avoid a prison sentence, he may suicide”. With respect to counsel, who I understand has appeared on a number of occasions pro bono, the submission that he may suicide to avoid a prison sentence is without foundation in the medical material. Further, it is an irresponsible submission for counsel to make.
	
	
	Further, from the Sydney Adventist Hospital is a report of 14 October 2014 addressed to Dr A A Jameson of Hornsby. That report sets out material to which is referred in other reports to which I have already referred that the applicant accused was admitted with respiratory distress to the Intensive Care Unit. Further, the report states that the accused, “…required intubation for Type II hyperbaric respiratory failure the cause of which is not entirely clear. He has tested positive for influenza A and there may have been some infective exacerbation of his airways disease.” However the report goes on to say that Mr Bradfield was successfully intubated and he was mobilised out of bed and about the ward.
	
	
	Given the contents of the more recent reports, i.e. the reports of February and March 2015 it would seem that the applicant accused has essentially recovered, at least as best as he is able to do so, from the malady with which he was inflicted at the time he was admitted to an Intensive Care Unit.
	
	
	The authorities make it abundantly clear that a permanent stay of proceedings is a remedy that should only be granted in extreme cases where - in the words of Mason CJ in Jago at (p 34) - there “is a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences”.
	
	
	In the matter presently under consideration there can be no doubt that the applicant accused is seriously ill. However, considering the volume of medical material within Exhibit 1, I am very firmly of the opinion that the accused is not so ill that he is simply physically unfit to stand his trial. A trial judge is able to make a number of simple accommodations for the accused, such as shorter sitting days, regular breaks and permitting the accused to sit in the floor of the court with his legs elevated. Given what would be the length of the trial, the odd day or two here or there for the purpose of the accused receiving medical treatment would be of little consequence.
	
	
	For these reasons I am not of the opinion that the medical condition and illness of the applicant accused warrants the extreme remedy of a permanent stay of proceedings. For the same reasons I am further of the opinion that those medical conditions and illnesses do not warrant a temporary stay of proceedings.
	


Legal Representation


	
	Norbert Kelvin, solicitor of Leigh Johnson Lawyers who act for the accused in this matter swore an affidavit on 6 April 2015. That is contained within Exhibit 1, the bound volume of material tendered by the accused. A physical check of the Court file reveals that Mr Nagle appears (usually pro bono) at the various appearances before the Local Court. However, the same court file contains a notation that on the first occasion this matter was before the District Court before Blanch J, CDCJ on 14 February 2014 Mr Kelvin appeared. Mr Nagle appears to have been the representative at the vast majority of mentions following that date.
	
	
	Mr Kelvin has then been instructed in the matter for the period of approximately fifteen months while the matter has been before the District Court. Further, it is obvious that Mr Kelvin was acting well before committal. Many of the medical reports within Exhibit 1 (the bound volume) are addressed to either Mr Kelvin or Leigh Johnson Lawyers. But one example is the report of Dr Margaret Sheridan, consultant psychiatrist of 13 October 2013, the date of committal for trial being 14 January 2014.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is curious indeed that par 39 of Mr Kelvin’s affidavit reads as follows:
	


“I am not in a position or qualified enough to do a long and involved fraud trial for Mr Bradfield. Mr Bradfield’s fraud case is very difficult. It is a fraud case, inter alia, with serious allegations of deception and fraud, in that, it is alleged in the police brief that Mr Bradfield misled and gave false information to his clients to obtain money from them to invest and that he made false epitomes of mortgage. On Mr Bradfield’s instructions, a number of these people who are witnesses for the Crown have had their loans repaid to them and their witness statements are untrue and should be tested in cross-examination”.


	
	I note also from the front cover of Exhibit 1 that “Norbert Kelvin Solicitor for and on behalf of Leigh Johnson Solicitors” is the contact name for the applicant in the Notice of Motion that I am considering. Mr Kelvin has been instructed in the matter for a considerable period of time. If the matter is too complex for him then the obvious course of action was for him to make this plain a lot earlier than he has and allow another practitioner with the appropriate expertise and experience to deal with the matter. The affidavit does not appear to set out for how long Mr Kelvin has been practicing as a solicitor or for that matter what experience he has in matters of this sort or criminal matters in general.
	
	
	The following appears at pars (d) and (e) of Point 3 at p 10 of Mr Nagle’s submissions within Exhibit 1:
	


“I would expect this trial will take anything up to six to eight months with legal support. Without legal support and with well over nine thousand pages all the bankruptcy material and Law Society files, a judge will have a terrible time in assisting Mr Bradfield.

If the Crown’s proposal is accepted by the court and the defence that is a trial without a jury, but a judge alone, and the court will sit for about three hours every day, no Counsel will accept legal aid brief on an hourly basis for three hours per day in a difficult fraud case”.


	
	It is my understanding that if legal aid is granted for counsel in a trial such a grant is on the basis of a daily rather than an hourly fee.
	
	
	Annexed to Mr Kelvin’s affidavit are a number of documents relating to the accused’s application for legal aid. The most recent of those documents appears to be the report of 4 June 2013 relating to an appeal against refusal of legal aid lodged on 16 May 2013. The report of 4 June 2013 at p 1 sets out the policy, namely:
	


“7.5 An applicant receiving a Centrelink income support payment at the maximum rate satisfies the income test. All other Applicants satisfy the income test if their net assessable income is $318 or less.

7.11.3 With certain exceptions (see 7.11.4) and discretions (see 7.11.5) a grant of aid will not be made until the means of the applicant have been verified by the officer determining the application”.


	
	At p 2 of that report it is stated that, “the applicant contacted Legal Aid on 25 February 2013 stating that most of the information requested would be provided on 26 February 2013 and further that on 17 April 2013 Legal Aid not received any of the verification documents requested. Legal Aid refused legal aid on that date”. The Report also notes (see bottom of p. 2):
	


“(a) The applicant states that his son, Andrew Bradfield is not FAP. The appellant stays with his son. He refused to provide verification documents in relation to his son;

(b) The applicant states that he also stays with his estranged wife Mrs Kerrie Lynne Bradfield, from time to time;

(c) The appellant provided bank statements held in his and his wife’s name dated between 24 February 2012 and 13 May 2013. Several sums of money (amounting to approximately $16,283) have been deposited into the appellant’s account from an account in the name of Kerrie Bradfield during this period of time;

(d) The appellant has failed to provide verification of his wife, Kerrie Bradfield’s means. She has provided accommodation and large sums of money to the appellant over the last year;

(e) The appellant states only that his wife is prepared to speak to Legal Aid on the phone”.


	
	The following appears at paragraphs (viii), (ix) and (x) at p. 19 of the Outline of Submission (MFI 1):
	


“No legal aid was granted until later in the matter sent up the district court and well after that time.

The poor financial state of affairs of Mr Bradfield, when legal aid was being denied and legal aid was not granted until…2014 and only after an appeal. Consequently, when the time was at the moment to issue subpoenas upon Crown witnesses, Mr Bradfield had no money to pay for competent solicitors and for them to issue important subpoenas upon various witnesses. He was bankrupt. It is common ground to the Crown and the defence that Mr Bradfield was under the charge of a Bankruptcy Trustee.

No legal aid was made available until the learned Magistrate had sent Mr Bradfield to trial before a learned district court judge. That legal aid was first granted for a solicitor only and is now limited to Counsel until an actual trial date is obtained”.


	
	It is obvious from what is extracted in paragraph 91 of these reasons that legal aid has now been extended to the applicant accused. It is also implicit in what I have extracted that legal aid will extend to solicitor and counsel once a trial date is set. Returning to a point I made earlier, neither the submissions nor the affidavit set out the basis, i.e. daily or hourly, on which legal aid has been granted.
	
	
	Reference is made in the submissions to the issuing of subpoenas to Crown witnesses. There should be full and complete disclosure by the Crown. There is nothing within the materials that I have seen that would suggest there is any issue relating to disclosure. Many of the documents sought by the accused would also be available, by subpoena if necessary, from the Law Society or the Trustee in Bankruptcy. There will be adequate time for the issue of any relevant subpoenas.
	
	
	Legal aid has now been granted to the accused. I agree with the submissions by the Crown Prosecutor that it would appear that many of the issues relating to the grant of legal aid arise out of the failure of the accused to comply with requests for documents and information. In these circumstances, the issue relating to legal representation is entirely insufficient to justify a stay of proceedings on either a temporary or permanent basis.
	


Publicity


	
	It is apparent from the submissions of the Crown that the accused also relies on publicity to ground his application for a permanent stay. According to the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions, Mr Kelvin referred to statements by the investigator appointed by the Law Society. However, those same submissions go on to say that there is no evidence as to where these statements were made, whether they were reported and how widely they were disseminated.
	
	
	Essentially it is a matter for the accused if and when this matter goes to trial whether he elects to be tried by judge alone. It seems to me that given the health of the accused and the issues involved, it would be an ideal matter to be dealt with by judge alone. If it is heard judge alone, the issue of publicity is of no consequence. However, even if the matter is heard with a jury, I am not of the opinion that on the material before the court, any publicity this matter has received would justify a permanent or even temporary stay of proceedings. Juries are regularly admonished to put any publicity out of their minds. There are numerous examples of high profile matters that have received considerably more publicity than this matter being successfully concluded by jury trial. Barr AJ (Macfarlan JA Campbell J agreeing) in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at par 36:
	


“…The law assumes, and trial judges are required to assume, that jurors will follow the directions of law given and that they are followed: Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31]; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 336.”

General and concluding remarks


	
	A good deal of the material contained within the Outline of Submission, MFI 1, relates to the strength of otherwise of the case against the accused. However, I do not understand the submissions to extend to a submission that the Crown case is such that it is inevitably doomed to failure and accordingly, a stay of proceedings should be granted. Even if there was such a submission, I am simply not in a position to make any accurate assessment as to the precise strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution case against the applicant accused. I made it plain to both counsel on 8 April 2015 when the matter was before me in Sydney that I was receiving the Fact Sheet, Exhibit A to inform me of the allegations. The matters raised by the accused appear to be matters for the tribunal of fact in a trial proper.
	
	
	It cannot be doubted that the accused is seriously ill. I have dealt with in considerable detail the various health issues and the reports from the various treating medical practitioners. The accused is unwell, but on the whole of the medical material is most certainly not so unwell that he should not stand his trial. The medical issues can be easily accommodated by shorter sitting days and regular breaks.
	
	
	There has been a delay, but in the circumstances of this case and what was involved, particularly noting that most of the moneys were processed through a personal bank account of the accused, the delay is not particularly excessive and for reasons already given, certainly insufficient in my opinion to justify the extreme remedy of a stay of proceedings.
	
	
	Any difficulty with legal aid appears to be largely of the accused’s own making because of his failure to provide relevant documentation to the Legal Aid Commission or the Review Panel of that Commission. Further, there is nothing of a recent nature indicating his status with legal aid.
	
	
	Likewise, any issue relating to publicity for reasons already given is insufficient to justify the extreme remedy sought by the accused.
	
	
	As indicated at an early stage of these reasons, the amended notice of motion also seeks findings of fact that the delay in the police investigation has adversely affected the defendant’s right to a fair trial and that the applicant is not medically fit to stand trial for the offences. It seems to me that such findings would be in the nature of declaratory relief, which this court does not have jurisdiction to grant. I have however, dealt with those issues on the application for the stay of proceedings on the Indictment.
	
	
	The rights and interests of the accused cannot be examined in isolation without also considering the expectations by the community that persons charged with serious criminal offences will be brought to trial. In the matter presently under consideration it is alleged that the accused engaged in systematic and repeated dishonesty towards clients who trusted him and in many instances were well known to him. It is highly relevant to the issue that I am determining that the accused was at all relevant times a practicing solicitor. The alleged breaches of trust are numerous and very serious indeed. On the allegations before the court, those breaches of trust included but were not limited to the creation of false Epitome of Mortgage documents. The clients of the accused, on the allegations before the court, entrusted the accused with very considerable sums of money which was lost, the total alleged amount being in excess of $4,000,000. There is a very real public interest in these matters going to trial.
	


Formal Orders


	
	The application for permanent stay of proceedings is refused;
	
	
	The application for temporary stay of proceedings is refused; and
	
	
	No order as to costs.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

On 22 August 2013 the applicant was indicted before his Honour Judge McClintock SC at the District Court in Sydney on the following charge:

That he on 30 December 2010 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did feloniously slay Wilson Duque Castillo.

This offence is contrary to s18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.


	
	The applicant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour and a jury. The jury retired to consider their verdict on 12 September 2013 and on 17 September 2013 returned a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	On 14 February 2014 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 14 February 2014 and a balance of term of 18 months.
	
	
	The applicant has appealed against that conviction on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The learned trial judge erred in leaving the alleged lies of the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt.

Ground 2 – The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The Crown has appealed against sentence on the basis that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	


THE CONVICTION APPEAL

The Crown case


	
	The deceased Wilson Castillo sustained a head injury during an assault which occurred in Kings Cross shortly after 11pm on 18 December 2010. He died two weeks later in hospital as a result of complications arising from the injury.
	
	
	The applicant was a security guard at “The Trademark Hotel”. This hotel is situated on Bayswater Road, near the junction of Darlinghurst Road on a laneway.
	
	
	The deceased’s brother, Wilmer Castillo, had been refused entry to the hotel by the applicant and other security guards. He reacted by brandishing a paint-scraper, which was a bladed object and which was mistaken for a knife by the security guards. The guards reacted by confronting Wilmer Castillo and then shepherding him away from the hotel down to Darlinghurst Road.
	
	
	Initially the applicant was part of the confrontation outside the hotel entrance. The same security guards followed Wilmer Costillo and the deceased down Darlinghurst Road. At a point Wilmer Costillo ran onto Darlinghurst Road, pursued by one of the security guards. The deceased also ran onto Darlinghurst Road, behind his brother followed by security guards. Moments later a melee developed in the middle of Darlinghurst Road. It was the Crown case that in this melee the deceased was punched by the applicant, sustaining a serious head injury either as a result of the punch or as a consequence of his head hitting the ground.
	


EVIDENCE AT TRIAL

General background


	
	The evidence at trial included that of eyewitnesses who had observed parts of what occurred. These included Wilmer Castillo; Yuli Galindez, the aunt of the two Castillo brothers; Sebastian Gomez-Ruiz, a work companion of the Castillo brothers; and Miguel Gil, also a work companion of the Castillo brothers. A number of bystanders gave evidence, as did some of the security guards. None of the security guards claimed to have witnessed the actual striking of the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown tendered recordings from various CCTV cameras associated mainly with commercial buildings on the Bayswater Road and Darlinghurst Road periphery. The relevant CCTV footage was placed in a compilation which became exhibit G. It was principally from this document that the Crown invited the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck the deceased in the middle of Darlinghurst Road causing the injuries which ultimately led to his death.
	
	
	The background to the offence was largely undisputed. The deceased ran a painting business. On 18 December 2010 he was painting a house at Potts Point in the company of two employees, Miguel Gil and Sebastian Gomez-Ruiz. At about 3.30pm they were joined by the deceased’s brother, Wilmer Castillo, who also worked in the business. All four were wearing distinctive white painters’ clothing. At about 4pm they finished work, walked to a bar in Kings Cross called the Sugarmill and began drinking alcohol.
	
	
	At around 10.30pm they left the premises. They walked to a nearby Mexican fast food restaurant on Bayswater Road called Guzman Y Gomez. By then they had been joined by Yuli Galindez who was in the same age group as the Castillos, notwithstanding that she was their aunt. At this time, the men were obviously intoxicated.
	
	
	The video of Guzman Y Gomez showed that they were all in high spirits and significantly affected by alcohol. There was obvious disinhibition, particularly by the deceased. There was some horseplay between the painters and at one point the deceased was seen to take a paint scraper (which is a sharp blade with a wooden handle) and move onto Bayswater Road.
	
	
	The deceased was dressed in long white pants and a short-sleeved white t-shirt with a blue armband. Wilmer was in short white pants with a long-sleeved white top, with the trademark “Dulux” on it. Sebastian was in short white pants and a short-sleeved t-shirt. Miguel was in a short-sleeved white t-shirt and long white pants. The evidence established that Wilmer also had a paint scraper.
	


The CCTV footage


	
	The following is relatively uncontroversial and is based on what appears on the compilation of CCTV footage (exhibit G). The security guards were wearing dark clothing and can be clearly distinguished from the painters who were wearing white clothing.
	
	
	At about 11pm Sebastian and Wilmer left the restaurant and went to the Trademark Hotel which was only a few metres away. One or both of them wanted to use the bathroom, but they were refused entry. They can be seen leaving the restaurant at about 3 minutes and 30 seconds into exhibit G.
	
	
	At that stage these security guards were at the front door of the Trademark Hotel: Marwen Halbouni (Halbouni), Talalelei Poasa (known as “Fonu”); the applicant, Ezekiel Tupou (Tupou) and Brad Reid (Reid). At about 11.05pm Wilmer can be seen talking to the security guards at the door of the Trademark Hotel and the applicant appears to refuse him entry. Wilmer appears to argue the point and eventually the applicant pushed him away. It was an open handed push which did not cause Wilmer to fall over.
	
	
	At that stage, Wilmer produced a paint scraper and Miguel arrived. Passers by can be seen to be stepping away. The applicant picked up a bollard but placed it between himself and Wilmer rather than using it as a weapon. Wilmer and Miguel can be seen to move away. There was evidence that the security guards and passers by believed that Wilmer was holding a knife at the time.
	
	
	At about 4.43 minutes into exhibit G, Miguel was seen going down to the ground. Wilmer picked up a large outdoor bench seat and attempted to swing it in the direction of the security guards. The deceased came out of the Guzman Y Gomez restaurant and had his arms extended, palms forward, in a pacific stance. At about 4 minutes and 49 seconds into exhibit G, Wilmer raised his right hand which was holding the paint scraper and swung it at one of the security guards.
	
	
	It was common ground that as the deceased and Wilmer left Guzman Y Gomez restaurant, they were confronted by Hasan Fazlilar, a security guard. Although the deceased was attempting to calm the situation, an altercation occurred between him and Fazlilar. Thereafter, security guards Reid, Cummins, Tupou, the applicant, Fazlilar and Halbouni moved relatively slowly along Bayswater Road towards Darlinghurst Road with the deceased and Wilmer moving backwards in the same direction. It was accepted by the Crown that the applicant was not aggressive, being described by one of the security guards as trying to calm things down.
	
	
	A little later Wilmer advanced towards Fazlilar and in an overarm action threatened him with a paint scraper. Wilmer then retreated and the deceased again held out his arms indicating that they should separate. At this time the applicant appeared to slow markedly and lagged behind Tupou, Halbouni, Fazlilar, Reid and Cummins.
	
	
	It was accepted that the applicant appeared to keep the deceased and Wilmer in sight until near the border of Darlinghurst Road, but was not a participant in what was a relentless following of them by the other security guards. The applicant played no part in that activity and dropped back, following at a slower pace. At one point the applicant was close to Gil, who had caught up, but made no aggressive move towards him. It was accepted that the applicant was the last of the security guards in that group to enter Darlinghurst Road and its surrounds.
	
	
	The Castillo brothers backed into Darlinghurst Road followed by some of the security guards. At about 5 minutes and 2 seconds into exhibit G, Wilmer appeared to wrap something around his hand. In his evidence he said that he was wrapping his belt around his hand and he used it to hit one of the security guards in the face. One of the security guards, John Hopoate, said that he was hit with the belt buckle. Wilmer gave evidence that the deceased asked him for the paint scraper and that the deceased took it from his pocket. Wilmer said that this happened before he hit the man with his belt buckle.
	
	
	At about 5 minutes 54 seconds into exhibit G, the compilation DVD showed footage taken from the Flight Centre shop. The footage is of poor quality, the action is some distance away and it is difficult to make out what is happening and who is depicted. It was the Crown case that this footage showed a man dressed in black with long sleeves striking the deceased once. The defence case was that it was impossible to say from the CCTV that the man with long black sleeves struck the deceased or that the man in black sleeves was the applicant.
	
	
	Later the CCTV showed Wilmer being brought to the ground and assaulted (about 6 minutes and 17 seconds into exhibit G). It was not part of the Crown case that the applicant took part in that assault.
	
	
	The police arrived about 6 minutes and 45 seconds into exhibit G. At about 7 minutes and 33 seconds into exhibit G the applicant is shown walking back in the direction of the entrance of The Trademark Hotel in Bayswater Road. He continued to work as a security guard at the door.
	


Further background


	
	The events which gave rise to the offence occurred within a very short space of time in Darlinghurst Road. Although a considerable amount of eyewitness evidence was adduced at trial, I propose to summarise only that which related to the events immediately before and after the deceased was apparently struck and fell to the ground. As might be expected from such a dramatic and violent event taking place over a short duration, the accounts of the eyewitnesses differed substantially. There appeared to be considerable confusion as to the sequence of events and in particular, as to the persons involved in them.
	
	
	Wilmer gave evidence that he and the deceased entered into traffic in Darlinghurst Road followed by Hopoate. He said that the deceased was close to him until the corner of the street at which point he (Wilmer) had taken his belt from his trousers, wrapped it around his hand and was swinging the buckle as a weapon.
	
	
	Wilmer said that at the point when he struck the security guard in the face, he was on Darlinghurst Road. During or just before this event, while on Darlinghurst Road, he gave the deceased the paint-scraper. It was the deceased who asked for the paint-scraper and when doing so he appeared to Wilmer to be very angry. Wilmer said that he could tell this by his face.
	
	
	In his police statement Wilmer said “I saw [the deceased] go forward towards some of the bouncers in front of him, I do not know how he was holding the paint-scraper, I know [the deceased] was right handed”. At trial Wilmer could not recall this but did recall the deceased then running to the left after which he did not see him again. After he had been punched a number of times by Hopoate, he observed some “bouncers” near his brother on the ground. He was unable to describe the bouncers and unable to precisely identify how and when his brother was struck. He was able to indicate that his brother pulled the paint-scraper out and was going to fight with it.
	
	
	When assessing the evidence of Wilmer, one has to keep in mind his advanced state of intoxication which was noted by police who first attended the scene of the incident. Apart from that evidence, Wilmer was of no assistance in identifying how it was that the deceased was struck or by whom. Sebastian and Gil could not give relevant information in respect of the offence.
	
	
	At trial there was no further useful information from the evidence of either the security guards or the painters as to what exactly happened when the deceased was killed. Evidence concerning that matter came from bystanders and it was confused and contradictory. The deceased’s aunt, Ms Galindez, gave evidence of observing a “bouncer punching both of her nephews and girlfriend”. She said Wilmer was on the footpath almost in front of the GNC Live Well Shop. She said the deceased was starting to run on the road and there were two bouncers near him. They were wearing black, one was wearing a suit. They were punching the deceased and after he was punched, he fell to the road.
	
	
	Under cross-examination she said that she saw Wilmer lying on the footpath with Gil next to him. She saw people wearing black over the top of both of them. At that point in time she said the deceased was on the road trying to run. She did not see anything in his hands. When she saw the deceased running she was “maybe 200 metres” away from him. She saw two men throwing punches towards the deceased. They were chasing him. She was certain that at the time she saw this happening, Wilmer and Gil were already on the footpath.
	
	
	In a statement which she made on 20 December 2010 Ms Galindez said she saw the deceased running away from two men who were chasing him and that when they caught him they punched him on the left side of his head near his ear. She described one of the men as wearing a long black jacket, but she was not sure what sort of pants the man was wearing. The second man was also wearing black, but she could not remember further details. She said that she saw the deceased fall onto the road next to a white taxi. She heard police sirens and the two men walked away from the deceased. One of them walked past her and she shouted at him in Spanish. Shortly after witnessing this incident, she was asked by a police officer if she saw what happened. She told him “no” because she was scared. When shown the CCTV footage (exhibit G), she agreed that her memory of who left the restaurant first was faulty. She denied that the deceased was drunk. Both in chief and in cross-examination she said that the security guards were well built and had tanned skin.
	
	
	Miguel Gil gave evidence that he followed a group of security guards, who were following Wilmer and the deceased. When he went around a corner he saw Wilmer and the deceased being hit. Wilmer was being hit by a few guys. They were wearing black mostly. The deceased was on the ground not moving. Then he (Gil) was hit in the face and went to the ground.
	
	
	Under cross-examination Gil said that he did not see anything unusual happen at the door of the Trademark Hotel when he tried to enter. He at no time saw Wilmer with a paint-scraper or swinging a belt. He did see Wilmer pick up a bench outside the Mexican restaurant. He agreed that he told police “I can’t say that any of the people involved in hitting Wilmer or myself were the security guards from the Trademark Hotel”. He confirmed that he did not see what happened to the deceased.
	
	
	Christopher Ball gave evidence of having caught a taxi to Kings Cross with a friend, Ryan Richards. He saw four or five people having an argument, two people backing down the street and two people going towards them. Two of the people were dressed in white and two or three were dressed in black. The two persons dressed in white were backing away down the road.
	
	
	Mr Ball saw one of the men in white flick something shiny or reflective at one of the men in black. After that one of the men in black chased the guy into the second lane of the road and punched him. It was a right hand punch to the head. The man who threw that punch was wearing a black, long-sleeved shirt and long black pants. At the time the man who was punched was facing the man who was punching him. The man who was punched fell to the ground and did not move. The man who threw the punch walked to the side of the street. Mr Ball described this man as being around six foot, solid build and of Islander appearance. Mr Ball saw only one punch thrown.
	
	
	After that, Mr Ball saw another fight break out. He saw a person in black of similar build, perhaps a little bigger, become involved in a fight with a man in white in which multiple punches and kicks were thrown. The man in white fell to the ground and was dragged to the side of the street. When he saw these things, Mr Ball was standing still on the other side of Darlinghurst Road. He said that the traffic had stopped at the time.
	
	
	Mr Ball made a statement to the police on 3 January 2011. He approached the police because of what he had seen on TV. He said that the first incident had started and finished before the second incident occurred. He agreed that when he made his statement to the police, he did not say that the person wearing black in the first incident had long sleeves.
	
	
	When asked about the difference between what he said in his statement and what he had said in evidence, he said:
	


“Q. I think you gave a description in your evidence of the man in black that hit the man with the shiny that flicked the shiny object as having long sleeves. Black long sleeved top?

A. I think it was black long sleeved. It was all black. Yeah, it was all black there was no colour, yeah.

Q. But you are not sure about that, about the length of the sleeves?

A. I'm pretty sure it was long sleeve, yeah.

Q. Do you agree that there's no mention in your statement of that? There's no mention in your statement to police about the man having --

A. I haven't really read it that well.

…

Q. Do you agree that the description you gave of the man who chased the male who flicked the shiny object is wearing black pants and a black top?

A. Correct.

Q. Do you agree that - have a look at the rest of the statement if you like and just satisfy yourself that there's no further description?

A. Yep.

Q. Is that right?

A. That's right, yeah.

Q. And you told the truth in that statement, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. To the best you could remember?

A. Yeah.

Q. You made the statement at a time when the events were fresh in your memory, do you agree with that?

A. Yeah, it was sort of it was still a few weeks after, yeah.

Q. Certainly much fresher than today?

A. Correct.” (T.263.39 – T.265.21)


	
	Ryan Richards accompanied Mr Ball to Kings Cross. He saw a man running wearing light coloured clothing, chased by another man wearing all black clothing. The first man was holding a metallic object, swinging it towards the man chasing him. The other man punched him with his right fist, a strong punch to his face. He was wearing tight-fitting black clothing, long black pants and a short-sleeved shirt. He did not recall what this man did after he punched the first man.
	
	
	Mr Richards said he saw a second man running after another man in light clothing. The man in light clothing turned and looked unsteady. The man chasing him was wearing black clothing, short-sleeves, tight-fitting black pants and black shoes. He punched the second man in the face and then twice more. He said that man was much bigger in height and weight than the man who threw the other punch.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Richards said that there were approximately 5 – 10 seconds between the two assaults with the assault on the man with the metallic object occurring first in time. He said that the first man in white appeared to be trying to connect with his pursuer, using the metallic object. He said the second man in lighter clothing was holding something like a lanyard with something metallic on it like keys. He was hit by a man wearing long black pants and a short-sleeved black shirt, who was of a bigger build than the first man wearing black.
	
	
	Tasmin Page was at Kings Cross on the night of 18 December 2010 with Christopher Maloney. When they were under the “Coke” sign, he saw at least two men running towards him pursued by men who looked like security guys. He said the security guys were dressed in dark clothing. When the security guys caught up with one of the men in white, he was thrown onto a taxi and hit, kneed and kicked. The other man in white was hit by several guys. In cross-examination he agreed that not all the security guys were involved in the fighting the whole time. Some of them were observing more than participating.
	
	
	Christopher Maloney said that he saw three men dressed in white, backing out of Bayswater Road. They were followed by five or six men who appeared to be bouncers from the Trademark Hotel. These men were dressed in black, some were wearing t-shirts, but two or three had long-sleeved shirts. There was an exchange of punches between the men in white and the men in black. One of the men in white ran onto the road. He was punched several times and kneed. He saw this man stumble back onto a taxi. Two men in black assaulted this man.
	
	
	Alborz Ajeli was the front passenger in a car near the Coca-Cola sign with the sign on his left (i.e., the vehicle was travelling south). He saw a fight start and then spill onto the street. There was a man dressed in white and an individual in black. The man in white turned to confront his pursuers and somebody landed a really good hit on his head. He was getting pummelled until the police arrived. The man in white fell onto the road. Mr Ajeli was short sighted, but was not wearing his glasses that night. He recorded part of the fight on his iPhone. This vision became part of exhibit G.
	
	
	Some still photographs from this footage were tendered and became exhibit L. Mr Ajeli thought there were four assailants, but could not describe the man who threw the good punch. He said that there were three or four men kicking the man on the ground. Exhibit L included a photograph of a police officer, standing over the body of the deceased on the road. Behind the police officer is a security guard wearing a long-sleeved black top. The security guard is clearly the applicant.
	
	
	Sergeant Hutchins was rostered at Kings Cross on 18 December 2010. He heard a radio message that there was an incident under the “Coke” sign in Darlinghurst Road. He went there and spoke to a security guard, Neil Cummins. Mr Cummins said “These guys just tried to stab us. The knife is lying on the ground”. He pointed to a paint-scraper and a belt next to the deceased. Sergeant Hutchins took a photograph of the deceased, the paint-scraper and the belt. That photograph became exhibit N. It showed the paint-scraper and the belt lying on the roadway in close proximity to each other and the deceased.
	
	
	Constable Fleming gave evidence that he was working with Constable Dong at Kings Cross on the night of 18 December 2010. He was walking south of the “Coke” sign in Darlinghurst Road when a male yelled out to him. Constable Fleming and Constable Dong ran towards the “Coke” sign where Constable Fleming saw two people in white, one lying motionless on the road and another person struggling with two people on the footpath. He saw a paint-scraper near the man lying on the road. The person struggling on the footpath was Wilmer.
	
	
	Constable Dong gave evidence that when he and Constable Fleming ran to where a fight was taking place before the “Coke” sign in Darlinghurst Road, he saw three South Americans in white overalls, one in the middle of the road and two in scuffles on the footpath. He went to one of the men in white who had his back on the ground and who was being held down by two security guards. One of them said “he’s got a knife, he’s got a knife”. He saw a spatula on the footpath. The two men in white on the footpath were identified as Wilmer Castillo and Miguel Gil.
	
	
	“Witness “A”” was a member of the Australian Army who was entitled to have his identity protected under Commonwealth legislation. He was in the Kings Cross area when he saw three men in white running towards him. They were dressed in paint-spattered white clothes. He saw a man in white standing between lanes of traffic. A large man in black hit him several times in the back of the head and the upper torso. He was hit at the back of a vehicle which looked like a Toyota Corolla. He said that a second man in black then set upon the man in white. The man in white slumped to the ground and then both men in black stomped on his head and upper torso. One of the other men in white ran past him and another man in white was pushed over and the men in black piled into him. Witness A described the man who first got to the man on the road as dressed in dark clothing, about 6 foot 2 inches, very stocky build with his hair in a ponytail or bun. The person who joined him was wearing dark pants, a dark grey shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbow and short neat hair. In cross-examination Witness A said that his clear recollection was that the man dressed in white, who was assaulted behind the car, was assaulted by two men.
	
	
	Robert Hunt gave evidence that he saw a group of men dressed in black chasing three men dressed in white. He saw one man in white on the ground and a man dressed in black standing over him. He was not able to describe his clothing in any more detail, except that he appeared to be all black.
	
	
	Mark Alam gave evidence that he saw a person he described as a “big Islander guy” hit a man dressed in white in the face. He said that the “big Islander guy” only struck him once. He was dressed in dark clothing.
	
	
	A statement of Joshua Lamb was read since Mr Lamb was in Afghanistan at the time of trial. He was with Witness A when he saw two men dressed in white clothes running from Bayswater Road. There were between 6 and 10 men running behind them. He saw the first male in white run onto the road and then start swinging his fists towards the men in black. He swung four or so times, but four or five of the men in black overwhelmed him. One of them drove him into a taxi. He fell down between two taxis and did not move. He just lay there on the ground. About four or five of the men in black began stomping and kicking the man on the ground. A third man in white came over and verbally tried to stop the assault. The men in black grabbed the second man in white and forced him against a shopfront and then onto the ground. At that time a number of police arrived.
	
	
	Benjamin Simpson gave evidence as to what happened outside the Trademark Hotel. He did not see subsequent events. He saw a man in white brandishing a paint-scraper three or four times. He said that when he first saw the paint-scraper he thought it was a knife.
	
	
	A statement of Wairangi Cassidy was read. She said that she was on the terrace of the Piano Room at Kings Cross. She looked out to Darlinghurst Road and saw a person wearing white clothes being assaulted by one person, with another person nearby. The person initially assaulting the person in white was wearing black clothes, black pants and black T shirt, formal black clothing. This person began to knee the male wearing white to the head. This was happening at the back of a taxi. Then Ms Cassidy saw three males in dark formal clothing assaulting another man dressed in white. The male being assaulted at the back of the taxi stumbled away but then Ms Cassidy saw the other man in white lying on the road.
	
	
	There were other eyewitnesses but their evidence added nothing to the issues, the subject of this appeal.
	
	
	Dr Irvine was the forensic pathologist who prepared the post mortem report. She said that his blood alcohol level was .24. On arrival at hospital, he was suffering from an acute traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. She found that the cause of death was complications of blunt force injuries to the head and associated medical treatment. Dr Irvine said that she examined photographs taken of the upper body and head of the deceased shortly after his admission to hospital and that she could not see any marks, such as bruises, abrasions or cuts. She agreed that the fracture to his skull could have been caused by a single blow to the head.
	
	
	Detective Tearne gave evidence that he was the officer in charge of the matter. Through him a timeline of the CCTV footage (exhibit S) was tendered. Video exhibits were played including exhibits C, U and V. Detective Tearne gave evidence as to how a number of people were dressed on the night of the incident. He had watched the CCTV footage from all sources for many hours before preparing exhibit S.
	
	
	John Hopoate was wearing white pants and a grey T shirt. Hassan Fazlilar was wearing a short-sleeved black collared shirt and black pants. Ezekiel Tupou had a white bandage on his right wrist and forearm and there was a black cast on the outer edge of his arm. Mr Talalelei Poasa was wearing a short-sleeved, black collared, button up business shirt with a three-quarter length black T shirt on underneath it and black jeans or pants. Neil Cummins was wearing a tight fitting, dark coloured T shirt and dark jeans.
	
	
	Detective Tearne spoke to Miguel Gil on the night of the incident and asked him what had happened but Gil said he did not know. Detective Tearne asked Wilmer Castillo what happened on two occasions, but he was unable to give an intelligible answer. Detective Tearne assessed that he was too intoxicated to be interviewed that night. He asked Ezekiel Tupou and Hassan Fazlilar if they knew what had happened to the guy lying on the road and each of them said “no”.
	
	
	It was through Detective Tearne that two pages from the Incident Register at the Trademark Hotel for 18 December 2010 were tendered and admitted as exhibit X. The first page of the Incident Register was written and signed by the applicant:
	


“A male wearing white shorts and white T shirt try [sic] to enter the venue, I told him he cannot enter due to intoxication and dress regulations, he then became aggressive and violent by threatening to attack me with a silver sharp blade, his friend also approach me in [+] a threatening manner so I stepped back and grabbed the bollard next to me to protect myself then other security ran over to help me. Then the male picked up a chair and throw it at us so we backed off. A third male teamed up with them heading towards our Piano Room security, so we walked to Piano Room entrance [sic], enough guards were there so I came back to Trademark entrance.”


	
	The Crown relied upon this exhibit as evidence of a lie i.e., that the applicant had only walked as far as the Piano Room entrance, which in turn was evidence of consciousness of guilt on his part. The case for the applicant was that this evidence was not evidence of consciousness of guilt because to so use the evidence, the jury had to assume what the Crown had to prove which was that the applicant was involved in the assault on the deceased.
	
	
	The second page of exhibit X was written by Talalelei Poasa. This read:
	


“Two males approach front door Trademark already showing signs of RSA. They were refused entry for dress code and RSA. Male was told to leave front door for dress code and RSA then turned on security with a sharp silver blade. Security then moved the two males on towards the Piano Room door, one male with white T shirt and white pants then turned on security with his friend.”


	
	The following security guards gave evidence. John Hopoate, Talalelei Fonu Poasa, Marwen Halbouni, Laga Toomata, Brad Reid, Hassan Fazlilar and Neil Cummins. None of their evidence implicated the applicant in any violent conduct. The common theme was the aggressive behaviour of some of the painters when trying to enter the Trademark Hotel at the beginning of the sequence of events, the belief of most of the guards that one of the men in white had a knife and the decision by a number of the guards to follow the men in white when they left the entrance to the Trademark Hotel. The following pieces of evidence, however, were relevant to the issues before the Court.
	
	
	Mr Hopoate said that he tried to move two of the men in white down the road away from the Trademark Hotel. One of the men was holding a blade and the other was swinging a belt buckle. The one with the belt buckle hit him with the belt buckle on the side of the head. The man he fought with ended up on the footpath. He did not see what happened to the other man who he thought was holding a knife.
	
	
	Mr Poasa with Mr Reid restrained one of the men in white. This was not the man who had the belt. After he grabbed the man’s arm he saw a blade on the ground. He did not see the applicant involved in anything in Darlinghurst Road.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial. The issues in the case were whether the Crown had established that the applicant struck the deceased and whether (assuming the Crown was successful on the first issue), the Crown had excluded defence of another and lawful arrest.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that the alleged lies of the appellant could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt.


	
	To understand this ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out some further factual material.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon what it alleged was a lie, or lies, by the applicant in the Incident Register, exhibit X, (see [66] hereof). The applicant, while accepting that the entry was admissible, argued that it should be admitted only as a matter going to the applicant’s credibility (as in Zoneff v R [2000] HCA 28; 200 CLR 234) and not as evidence of consciousness of guilt (as in Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193).
	
	
	The basis for the applicant’s submissions at trial was elaborated in the course of an exchange with the trial judge as follows:
	


“DEFENCE COUNSEL: …    But what he says is Piano Room entrance. Now the Piano Room entrance is all the way around the corner, as your Honour has heard, and on Darlinghurst Road. But again the jury would have to be satisfied that he was involved in the incident on Darlinghurst Road before they could find that there was a lie, or an omission which amounted to a lie. I respectfully suggest that there is an element of circularity there. …

…

HIS HONOUR: Isn't that what the Crown is saying, he's omitting his role in an incident in Darlinghurst Road?

DEFENCE COUNSEL: But you see what I'm saying is that that's the $64,000 question in this trial, is what is his role? Again I refer to that point that I make about circularity of reasoning because in order to be able to use this as a lie the jury would have to accept that he was involved, rather than just being there. Because there's no real issue, your Honour, in the trial that he was in the vicinity of the Piano Room entrance, there's no issue about that. We haven't made an issue about that, there's been no cross examination to suggest he wasn't in or around the Piano Room entrance.” (T.842.11 -843.2)


	
	The Crown in its closing address said:
	


“Now if you accept that the accused was on the road, if you’re satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the things that I suggest you would be on the evidence I’ve referred to, then what he’s done there is at the end is clearly omit to include what if anything he had done on Darlinghurst Road. He’s clearly omitted that. Well what use can you make of that? Well the Crown points to that as evidence of a lie. It’s a lie by omission the Crown says. If you think it is a lie then you are entitled to use it in this way. That he told that lie because telling the truth might reveal his involvement in respect of this particular charge that he now faces. That’s how you can use it if you accept that it is a lie.

There’s other things though that you’ve got to take into account and his

Honour will give you directions about this, but the Crown with respect echoes what his Honour will say that you must exercise a great deal of care before you would use that omission in the way I’ve suggested because you’ve got to be satisfied that it is a lie, that he knew what the truth was then and he didn’t put it in. You’ve also got to be satisfied that he didn’t omit that for some other reason, like protection of someone else or something like that. So you can see that you need to exercise some care about it. The Crown says it’s open to you to use that omission as an independent piece of circumstantial evidence which can be joined with the other circumstantial evidence which would lead you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt.” (T.11.9.2013, 19.40 – 20.10)


	
	His Honour then directed the jury in relation to the alleged lie or lies of the applicant. The applicant does not challenge the correctness of the direction.
	


“I also will now give you a direction in respect of the matter raised during the addresses and address by both counsel which is the issue, I think it is in respect of exhibit X which was I think the recording of incidents outside the - yes, the incident register and it is said by the Crown that that provides additional material in relation to its case and it concerns that evidence. The Crown says that the entry into the incident register is a lie by omission. First, of course, you must be clear about what a lie is. A lie is to say something untrue knowing at the time of the making of the statement that it is untrue. If a person says something which is untrue but does not realise at the time that it is untrue, then it is not a lie. The person is simply mistaken or confused or possibly as was suggested not incorporating every event because of various reasons advanced. If the person later comes to realise that what he said or she said was incorrect, that does not transform the statement into a lie. To be a lie, the person must say something that the person knows at the time of making the statement is untrue.

In this case the Crown says Mr Matia knew that he had participated in events on the roadway and that he was being untrue by deliberately leaving it out. If you find that Mr Matia made the statement to which I have referred to you and you find it was a lie, then I must give you direction about the care with which you must approach the task of deciding what significance, if any, it has. You may take this lie into account as evidence of the accused’s guilt but you can only do that if you find two further things which I will refer to shortly. When I say you can take it into account as evidence of the accused’s guilt, I am not suggesting to you that it could prove the guilt of the accused on its own. What I mean is that it can be considered along with all the other facts that the Crown relies upon and which you find established on the evidence in considering whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, and as I understand the Crown case, the Crown says this is a circumstance, one circumstance you can take into account in the circumstantial case against the accused.

The Crown did not suggest as I have already indicated that on its own it could prove the guilt of the accused. Apart from the fact that the accused made the statement and that it amounted the Crown says to a deliberate lie, before you could use it as some evidence of the accused’s guilt, you must find two further matters. First, you must find that what the accused said amounts to - to a lie - that relates to an issue that is relevant to the offence that the Crown alleges that he committed. It must relate to some significant circumstance or event connected with the alleged offence. The Crown says it is relevant because in effect he is denying his presence at Darlinghurst Road and denying his participation in an assault.” (SU 22-23)

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the asserted omission could not in fact be regarded as a lie. He submitted that the Incident Register report relied upon by the Crown stated that “we walked to the Piano Room entrance …”. The unchallenged evidence was that the Piano Room entrance was in Darlinghurst Road. It followed, he submitted, that his statement could not be regarded as a lie.
	
	
	In the alternative, the applicant submitted that the asserted omission, which was the failure to mention his participation in an assault, gave rise to a circularity of reasoning. There was no evidence that he was involved in the assault of anyone other than the deceased. It followed, therefore, that the only evidence that he participated in an assault was the evidence that he had assaulted the deceased. The applicant submitted that the difficulty with leaving this submission to the jury was that the only evidence that he was lying was the evidence that he had in fact committed the offence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the danger created by leaving the Crown’s submission to the jury was that the jury would reason as follows:
	


“We are satisfied (on a standard less than beyond reasonable doubt) that the applicant was involved in the assault on the deceased because he was wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt on the night of the incident and Mr Ball (the witness) says that the person who struck the deceased was wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt. We are satisfied of that because of evidence that the applicant’s omission of mentioning that matter was because of a consciousness of guilt. As a result of those two findings, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant is guilty of the offence.”


	
	The applicant submitted that a similar problem arose in Regina v Wang (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 February 1994). The facts of that case were that Wang was charged with two counts of the murder of his two flatmates. His defence was that a gang of four men talked their way into the shared house, murdered his flatmates and took him with them to dispose of the bodies. Thereafter, the gang released him. He did not report the matter to the police because he thought the gang would kill him. The jury were told that if they found his account (which was referred to as “the big lie”) was a lie, and the only explanation for it was his guilt, the lie could be used to infer his guilt.
	
	
	Finlay J (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J agreed) held that this was a misdirection:
	


“In my view this last direction above, that the statements of the accused to the police that it was the gang of four who killed the two people was available to be considered as a lie revealing consciousness of guilt, was an error. The appellant’s story of the Gang of Four being responsible was inextricably interwoven with the appellant’s denial of his own guilt. In the circumstances of this case it was necessary for the jury to find that the appellant had committed the murders in order to find that his “Gang of Four” statement was a lie. To suggest that his story in that regard was false was to suggest that his denial of his guilt was false. Any suggestion that the denial by an accused person of his guilt can in some way be found to be a lie which may assist a jury to find him guilty is obviously a circulatory argument and is erroneous. As Young CJ said in Regina v Perera (1982) VR 901 at 905:

“Of course a mere denial by an accused of the charge laid could not be used to indicate a consciousness of guilt any more than it could be used to afford corroboration of the allegation of a prosecutor.””

Consideration


	
	There was evidence to which the Crown referred in its address to the effect that the applicant, together with other security guards, moved from the Trademark Hotel entrance and followed the deceased and his fellow painters past the Guzman Y Gomez restaurant and past the Red Berry Café towards the Piano Room.
	
	
	What exhibit L made clear was that the applicant went beyond the entrance to the Piano Room. He had moved to a position near to where the deceased was struck and collapsed. He can be clearly seen in the background to where the deceased’s body is shown in exhibit L. Of course the iPhone footage, from which exhibit L was created, came into existence some minutes after the deceased was hit because police officers were depicted at the scene. Exhibit L did not establish that the applicant was in that location when the deceased was struck. It did, however, place the applicant approximately 20 – 25 metres past the Piano Room entrance some minutes after the incident.
	
	
	Leaving aside the question of whether the applicant was the only security guard with long sleeves, exhibit L made it clear that exhibit X was inaccurate by omission in that the applicant walked beyond the Piano Room entrance by approximately 20 – 25 metres. Accordingly, it was open to the Crown to submit that the applicant had told a lie when he said in exhibit X “so we walked to Piano Room entrance, enough guards were there so I came back to Trademark entrance”. It was also open to the Crown to submit (with the qualifications and restrictions identified by the trial judge in his direction) that this detail was omitted because of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It was well open to the Crown in its closing address to say “what he’s done there at the end is clearly omit to include what, if anything, he had done on Darlinghurst Road”. He clearly omitted the detail that he had walked some distance past the Piano Room entrance. There is nothing circulatory in that proposition. The jury did not have to be satisfied that he had struck the deceased before they could be satisfied that he had told a lie in that he had gone well beyond the entrance to the Piano Room before coming back to the Trademark Hotel entrance.
	
	
	Of course, as the Crown pointed out in the second part of its submissions on this issue at trial (at [74]), and as his Honour pointed out in his direction (at [75]), there were a number of other perfectly reasonable explanations for why the applicant would have said nothing about going beyond the Piano Room entrance to a location near to where the deceased was struck. He may have been afraid that to do so would make him an object of suspicion. Alternatively, although he was not involved, he may have seen who struck the deceased and have been seeking to protect him (a scenario suggested by the Crown). Being aware that a man had been killed, it was quite reasonable for the applicant to try to place himself at a location where it could not be thought that he had anything to do with causing that death.
	
	
	It is unfortunate that his Honour at the conclusion of his direction said:
	


“The Crown says it is relevant because in effect he is denying his presence at Darlinghurst Road and denying his participation in an assault.”


	
	That is not an entirely accurate summary of the careful way in which the Crown put its submission. If his Honour had added the word “therefore” or “thereby” before the word “denying” what his Honour meant would be clearer. What the Crown was saying and what his Honour intended to make clear was that the consequence of the applicant saying that he did not go beyond the Piano Room was that he could not have participated in an assault on the deceased. Just because his Honour could have made the position clearer does not mean that the direction was wrong or misleading. Counsel for the applicant at trial did not think so or she would have asked his Honour to clarify the direction.
	
	
	The scenario here is quite different to that which occurred in Regina v Wang. In Wang it was necessary for the jury to find that the appellant had committed the murders in order to find that his “Gang of Four” statement was a lie. That is not the case here. The jury could have found that the applicant was telling a lie by omission when he said that he did not go beyond the Piano Room without it being inevitable that they should also find that he had struck the deceased. As indicated, there were a number of exculpatory reasons why the applicant would have recorded what he did in exhibit X which were not consistent with him having struck the deceased.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The applicant made the following submissions.
	



	
	Although there were many eyewitnesses to the assault on the deceased which led to his death, not a single one of them identified the applicant as being the person who struck the deceased. That included both the witnesses associated with the deceased and those associated with the applicant.
	
	
	No forensic evidence connected the applicant to the striking of the deceased.
	
	
	There was no evidence of any admissions by the applicant. Even if the jury accepted that the applicant told a lie in relation to whether he went past the Piano Room, that did not necessarily connect him to the offence.
	
	
	The CCTV footage was not of sufficient quality for the Crown to say that the jury could identify the applicant as the person who had struck the deceased.
	
	
	The only possible connection between the applicant and the person who apparently struck the deceased is that there was a man wearing long dark sleeves next to the deceased when he went down, that Mr Ball said that a man wearing long, dark sleeves punched the deceased and that the applicant was wearing a top with long, dark sleeves.
	



	
	The applicant challenged the proposition that a person in a long-sleeved, black shirt punched the deceased. He submitted that the only witness who gave evidence to that effect was Mr Ball. He submitted that none of the other nine witnesses who apparently saw the assault, gave evidence to that effect and that there was no good reason why the evidence of Mr Ball should be preferred to their evidence.
	
	
	Yuli Galindez said that two bouncers chased the deceased onto the road and punched him until he fell to the ground. Ryan Richards described two assaults on two men wearing white. In each case the assailant was wearing black but with short sleeves. Tasmin Page saw one man in white at the rear of a taxi who was hit a couple of times by a security guard and was kicked and “kind of hit the ground”. He was not sure whether there were one or two security guards who hit this man. Christopher Maloney saw two bouncers pursue a man in white onto the road and punch him several times causing him to fall down. The man stumbled back into the back of a taxi. Albarz Ajeli (who was short sighted and without his glasses) saw a man in white receive a very good hit to the head causing him to fall down. This man was hit by more than one person. “Witness A” saw a man in white in the middle of the road between traffic lanes. He was hit a number of times by a large man wearing black. A second man dressed in black then set upon the same man in white. Both men in black stomped on the head of the man in white after he fell to the ground. Joshua Lamb saw four or five men in black overwhelm a man in white, punching him in the head causing him to collapse by the side of a taxi. A number of men in black continued to stomp and kick his head. Wairangi Cassidy, who was on the balcony of the Piano Room, saw three men wearing black attack a man wearing white on the road. When he collapsed onto the road, they left him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the only witnesses to suggest that a person with long sleeves was involved in the assault on the deceased were Mr Ball and Ms Galindez, who described one of the men as wearing a long, black jacket which was longer than a suit jacket. He submitted that apart from that apparent similarity, the other details provided by Mr Ball and Ms Galindez concerning the person or persons who assaulted the deceased were different. The applicant noted that Mr Ball only gave evidence about a person with long sleeves for the first time at trial and had made no mention of that fact when he made his statement to the police. He submitted that there was another difficulty in that Mr Ball described a man running onto the road, flicking something white, which was more consistent with what Wilmer Castillo was doing with his belt than with what the deceased may have been doing with a paint-scraper. He submitted that Mr Ball’s description of the security guard striking the deceased with his right fist was not borne out by the CCTV footage, which showed the person in long sleeves with his left arm extended.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that the only security person wearing long sleeves was the applicant. He submitted that unless the Court could be satisfied as to that issue beyond reasonable doubt, he must succeed under this ground.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no conclusive evidence that he was the only person wearing a black, long-sleeved shirt, working at either of the venues on the night. He noted that Marwen Halbouni, the owner of the security company, gave evidence that in addition to the security guards at the Bayswater Road entrance, there were other security guards working at the Piano Room on the night of the incident. He referred to the list of names given to Detective Tearne, which included a further nine security guards who were working at the Piano Room. These persons were not interviewed, nor was any information obtained as to their clothing. There was no evidence as to whether any of the security guards working at the Piano Room became involved in the confrontation with the painters.
	
	
	In the alternative, the applicant submitted that the escalation in violence was at every point initiated by Wilmer Castillo or the deceased and that at no time was a security guard seen to resort to the use of weapons. He submitted that if the jury were satisfied that the applicant had struck the deceased, it was not open to them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting in self defence or in the defence of another or others.
	


Consideration


	
	The task of this Court where such a ground of appeal is raised is well established and well known – M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question is ultimately whether notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, nevertheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand (M at [492]) or, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	In making that assessment, the Court is obliged to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses.
	


Was the applicant the only security guard with long sleeves?


	
	On my analysis of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the only security guard on the night of 30 December 2010 to be wearing a dark coloured top with long sleeves.
	
	
	The initial confrontation at the entrance to the Trademark Hotel and the subsequent movement of security guards to Darlinghurst Road was picked up by a number of CCTV cameras. These included cameras from the Hotel, the Guzman Y Gomez restaurant and various other business premises culminating in the film taken from the Flight Centre shop. There was also the video material on the iPhone of Alborz Ajeli. What the CCTV cameras showed is contained in the compilation video, exhibit G, and the still photo compilations in exhibit S, with its accompanying timeline, and exhibit L.
	
	
	The video clip and the still photograph compilations, although of varying quality, allow the identification of all of the security guards who moved from the entrance to the Trademark Hotel and followed the painters to Darlinghurst Road. It is clear that the security guards so depicted were those stationed at the entrance to the Hotel. There is no evidence of any security guard from the Piano Room, following the group or otherwise, being involved. That is not surprising given that the catalyst for the guards following the painters was the aggressive behaviour of Wilmer and perhaps Gil in producing what the guards believed was a knife and then subsequently attempting to swing a large outdoor bench seat towards them. Not only was there no evidence of any other security guards being involved, there was no reason for them to do so.
	
	
	I am further persuaded to that conclusion by the fact that the security guards moved towards the painters and Darlinghurst Road as part of a group, albeit in a rather loose formation. The CCTV material reveals the applicant to be part of that group, albeit at the rear of the group and moving more slowly than the main body. While the evidence of the bystanders is contradictory in a number of respects, there is no evidence to the effect that any other security guard or group of security guards joined the group moving from the entrance to the Trademark Hotel at any time.
	
	
	I have concluded that the suggestion that there may have been another security guard from the Piano Room wearing a top with long, dark sleeves is speculative at best. There was, of course, no issue that the applicant was wearing a top with long, dark sleeves. That is clear from exhibits S and L, in which he can be clearly identified.
	


The incident


	
	Once that issue is decided adversely to the applicant, the CCTV footage taken from the Flight Centre shop takes on considerable importance. Although the precise actions of the persons depicted are difficult to discern, it is clear that a security guard wearing a top with long, dark sleeves was next to the deceased as he appears to be falling and that the security guard had his left arm fully extended. For the reasons already stated, that security guard can only be the applicant.
	
	
	Despite having watched the CCTV footage on many occasions, I have not been able to actually see any contact between the fist of the security guard and the deceased. The movement of their bodies, however, is fully consistent with the applicant having struck the deceased causing him to fall at the location where his body was subsequently found. The CCTV footage in effect places the applicant next to the deceased at the very time when he appears to be falling towards the ground. Another security guard and a painter can be seen nearby, but that is almost certainly Hopoate and Wilmer. That other painter is not seen to fall at that time or in that location.
	
	
	Once one is satisfied that the applicant was the security guard depicted in the CCTV footage, that footage of itself is sufficient to establish that it was the applicant who struck the deceased. While none of the conflicting eyewitness accounts are completely consistent with what is shown on the Flight Centre CCTV footage, most can generally be reconciled with it. Certainly none of the descriptions, given the circumstances in which the observations were made, is such that it would negate what the CCTV footage appears to show.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the observations of Mr Ball were to be preferred to those of other eyewitnesses because they were the most consistent with what was shown on the CCTV footage. His description is of a one-on-one confrontation and a single punch causing the deceased to fall. Not only is that observation consistent with the CCTV footage, it is consistent with the injuries observed to the deceased when taken to hospital.
	
	
	Some eyewitnesses referred to the deceased, or someone who might be the deceased, being attacked by two security guards, i.e. Ms Galindez, Mr Maloney, Mr Ajeli, Witness “A” and Ms Cassidy. Apart from the fact that these events happened very quickly and that there was more than one incident occurring at the same time, these observations can be explained by the emergence onto Darlinghurst Road of the deceased and Wilmer, followed by Mr Hopoate and the applicant. Two separate fights appear to have developed with more security guards assisting Mr Hopoate and attacking/restraining Miguel when he became involved. If as seems likely, the deceased was knocked to the ground behind the taxi by one blow, it would have been comparatively easy for bystanders who were not familiar with the painters to become confused as to which of them was being hit at any particular time, particularly when they appear to have been significantly outnumbered by the security guards who were present.
	
	
	It is true that if the only evidence available was that of the observations of the bystanders, it would have been insufficient to convict the applicant. By the same token, however, the failure of the eyewitness observation evidence to be fully consistent with what appears on the CCTV, does not establish a reasonable doubt to the effect that it was not the applicant who struck the deceased and caused him to fall behind the taxi.
	
	
	Just because there was no eyewitness, who specifically identified the applicant as the deceased’s assailant, and because there was no forensic evidence or unequivocal admissions to that effect, could not prevent the jury being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue. Similarly, just because the numerous eyewitnesses gave different accounts and the CCTV material did not perfectly identify the image of the assailant, did not preclude the jury being so satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As the conduct of the trial makes clear, the applicant did not directly run a “self-defence” case. His case was that he was never at the location where the deceased was struck. Nevertheless, it is also clear from the evidence of the eyewitnesses, and from the fact that the deceased had armed himself with a paint scraper, that self defence was sufficiently raised. The Crown did not submit otherwise.
	
	
	A difficulty for the applicant is that there was no evidence from him to explain his conduct or its reasonableness. It is also important that the deceased’s possession of the paint scraper had only come about after the pursuit had been commenced and towards its end. Once Wilmer and the other painters had been refused entry to the Hotel and had moved away, there was no good reason why the security guards should have pursued them. In the absence of any other explanation, the most probable inference was that the guards intended to exact retribution for what the painters had done.
	
	
	It is in that context that one has to take account of the applicant’s physique, his position as a security guard and his knowledge of the previous conciliatory conduct of the deceased.
	
	
	To cause the damage which it did, the force in the applicant’s punch must have been substantial. Against the background of the unlawful pursuit of the deceased by the applicant and his companions, his act of striking the deceased with such a forceful punch, even if committed in self defence or the defence of another, was not a reasonable response in the circumstances. Accordingly, it was open to the jury to make a finding to that effect beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I am satisfied on my assessment of the evidence that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt not only that it was the applicant who struck the deceased but that when he did so it was not a reasonable response in the circumstances.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


CROWN APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	As already indicated, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown appealed against the sentence imposed on the applicant by McClintock DCJ on 14 February 2014. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 14 February 2014 and expiring 13 August 2015 with a balance of term of 18 months expiring 13 February 2017. The sentence proceedings took place on 13 December 2013 and his Honour handed down sentence on 14 February 2014.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon a single ground of appeal. The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years and there is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Because the applicant was convicted after a trial by jury, it was necessary for his Honour to make findings of fact on which to base his sentence. A number of factual issues, which were not in dispute, have already been set out in the factual background to the conviction appeal. It is not necessary to repeat them. His Honour made the following additional findings of fact.
	
	
	Following the confrontation at the entrance to the Trademark Hotel, a number of security guards followed the painters, including Wilmer and the deceased. The applicant was one of those guards but in doing so he was walking more slowly and lagged behind the other guards. Up until the entry into Darlinghurst Road the applicant maintained visual contact with the painters but was not a participant in “what was a relentless following of [the deceased] and his brother by others”. At one point the applicant was close to Miguel but did not engage in any aggressive actions towards him. He was the last of the security guards to enter the Darlinghurst Road area.
	
	
	After the deceased and Wilmer had reached Darlinghurst Road, the deceased obtained a paint scraper which had previously been in Wilmer’s possession. At about the same time Wilmer removed his belt and wrapped it round his wrist with the buckle being lose. Wilmer then used the belt as a weapon and struck one of the guards, John Hopoate, in the face. Hopoate then pursued Wilmer into the traffic on Darlinghurst Road which was at that stage at a relative standstill and tackled him. A struggle then ensued.
	
	
	His Honour set out what he saw depicted by the CCTV:
	


“The Flight Centre video starts at 23:04:13 on its clock. It shows Wilmer and Hopoate running into the centre of Darlinghurst Road. Hopoate again appears to be in all white, possibly because of the quality, the lighting or both.

Wilmer appears to fall. Hopoate appears to fall or jump on top of him. Both disappear behind a taxi and out of view. Wilson appears running towards Hopoate and Wilmer. He is only a short distance behind. His arm or arms are raised. [The applicant] appears behind Wilson. [The applicant] is then next to [the deceased]. [The deceased] appears to partly turn to face him although this is indistinct. [The applicant] appears to strike [the deceased]. These events all occur within two seconds on the counter clock.

By this stage Halbouni and Cummings are directly behind [the applicant]. [The deceased] appears to fall behind the taxi. [The applicant] remains on his feet, remains for a short time and the police arrive.

Other security guards pour in. There is a disturbing frenzy of violence between the security guards (other than [the applicant]) and Wilmer and also Gil. [The applicant] does not take part. Apart from the single punch he does not do anything else on the video. He moves away from behind the taxi.

The iPhone witness video which I have referred to earlier shows [the applicant] in the area at the time that the police arrive or the police have arrived. It shows [the deceased] on Darlinghurst Road not moving. Next to him appears to be a belt used by Wilmer. The paint scraper is also next to him.

[The applicant] returns to the Trademark Hotel. At a point later he strikes his hand into his palm seemingly imitating a punch.” (ROS 22.9 – 23.8)


	
	On the basis of those images from the CCTV footage, his Honour made the following finding:
	


“Wilmer ran towards the centre of the road followed by Hopoate. [The deceased] ran out following Hopoate and holding the paint scraper in his hand. It can be inferred that his purpose was to confront Hopoate to assist his brother. His conduct was no longer placatory. Wilmer fell and Hopoate landed on top of him. [The deceased] ran, about to join the fight to defend his brother. [The applicant] ran to [the deceased] who appears to start to turn. [The deceased] was armed, [the applicant] struck [the deceased]. He struck him only once but he did so with very considerable force. He did so to prevent, I find, [the deceased] attacking Hopoate. I find to the requisite standard that he believed that his conduct was necessary to defend another. That conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances. That finding is consistent with the jury verdict.

[The applicant] had been the subject of significant provocation by Wilmer at the door of the Trademark Hotel and had acted in self-defence by picking up the bollard and shepherding Wilmer away from the doorway. He had replaced the bollard and then followed behind the forefront of the security guards, him not being in the forefront of any of the confrontations after the Guzman y Gomez and had not demonstrated any animosity to either Wilmer or [the deceased]. In the light of all the circumstances the decision to become involved in the physical altercation appears to have been made only after Wilmer struck Hopoate.

…

The verdict is consistent with the finding that the offender was acting to defend another and the action of [the applicant], given his physique, his position, his knowledge of the previous conciliatory conduct of [the deceased], in striking [the deceased] with such a forceful punch was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived him. I do not find the offender was in any way engaging in any lawful process of arrest; the second “defence” that was left to the jury apart from self-defence.” (ROS 26.5 – 27.6)


	
	His Honour then reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. His Honour noted that the applicant did not provide a statement to police, nor did he give evidence either at the trial or on sentence. In making findings as to the applicant’s subjective case, his Honour relied upon a medical report from Dr Lennings.
	
	
	The applicant was born in New Zealand, although he was of Samoan heritage. His father was a factory worker and his mother was a nurse. There was some domestic violence in the home by his father directed to his mother. The applicant was the fulltime carer of his mother, who had suffered kidney failure as a result of diabetes. The applicant used to take her to dialysis three times a week.
	
	
	The applicant came to Australia at the age of 13 in about 1989. He initially commenced work as a forklift driver and after some years obtained a security licence. He had been working in security for about 2 years when these events occurred. There had never been any trouble in respect of his work in the security industry previously. His security licence was revoked when he was charged. Since then he had been unable to obtain regular employment.
	
	
	The applicant had been in a steady relationship since 1992 and was the father of a 16 month old son when sentenced. Thirty testimonials were provided to the court attesting to his good character, notwithstanding the finding of guilt by the jury. All of these attestations were to the effect that the offence was out of character. His Honour took these matters into account.
	
	
	Dr Lennings found that the applicant had expressed a genuine sense of sadness and remorse for what had occurred. Dr Lennings concluded that the applicant was struggling to deal with the emotion that he felt about the effect on both his own and the deceased’s families. He felt that the current offence was most uncharacteristic. Dr Lennings assessed the risk of future serious violence as low. Dr Lennings suggested a lengthy parole period to minimise the destructive impact of incarceration and the anti-social effect which prison might have on the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour applied sentencing principles as follows:
	


“It is an important principle that a sentence must fit the offending and must have regard to the objective seriousness of that offending. The offender must be adequately punished for his offending. At the same time the sentence must be proportionate to the crime.

The offender is to be sentenced for manslaughter. The jury found the offender guilty of a category of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. The elements of that offence are that the punching of the deceased was the act of the offender which caused the death of the deceased. The act was deliberate, the act was both unlawful and dangerous. The finding of unlawful is consistent with a finding by the jury that the offender acted in excessive self defence of another.” (ROS 32.4)

“As I have already indicated the finding that the offender acted in self defence of another indicates that the offence is significantly less serious had that factor not been present. I find that the decision to intervene was spontaneous and took place where there was little opportunity to calmly reflect on the possible consequences in a dangerous and fluid situation.

There was accordingly, in my view, no relevant premeditation as any form of aggravating factor.

The offender had been placed under significant stress by the conduct of Wilmer in brandishing a blade at him at the entrance to the hotel. I take that provocation into account but only to a limited degree. It is relevant to comprehending [the applicant’s] state of heightened emotions at the time, however it was not a motivator for the events that followed.

The conduct involved a very brief episode of violence. The act was an isolated act of violence on his part and nothing he did afterwards suggests any identification or participation with the savage beatings that followed, perpetrated by other security guards. The Crown ultimately conceded that there was only one act of striking; after that he gradually withdrew.

The material in the offender’s case demonstrated that he is otherwise a gentle man who contributes to his community and is highly regarded. I accept the finding that he has low criminogenic risk; he is unlikely to re offend. The childhood record and the youthful record, in my view, are not of particular significance in the sentencing exercise although they do deny him a minor amount of leniency. The material demonstrates that he is otherwise a man essentially of good character. The material demonstrates that he had some empathy for the victim.

I accept the findings of Dr Lennings in respect of his genuine remorse and his genuine contrition, notwithstanding the plea that he entered in respect of the trial.

…

I have regard to the principle of general deterrence. The Crown made a submission that there should be incorporated in the sentence a factor to deter others, particularly security guards, from assaulting persons in the course of their employment. Such a factor could have been relevant absent the findings that I have made but in the circumstances it has no apparent relevance to the acts of the offender as I found them.” (ROS 35.3 – 36.8)

His Honour found special circumstances.

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that this Court is entitled to intervene so as to increase the sentence imposed on the applicant because the sentence imposed was so disproportionate to the offending as to afford the foundation for concluding that in some way the sentencing discretion of the primary judge had miscarried. The Crown submitted that the punishment was manifestly inadequate because it simply failed to mark the seriousness of the offending. The Crown submitted that the factual findings by the sentencing judge were generous and from the resulting sentence, it was clear that each was accorded too much weight in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that very little weight should have been given to his Honour’s finding that the applicant had acted to defend another person. Implicitly the Crown submitted that it was not open to his Honour to find that this made the offence “significantly” less serious than if that factor had not been present.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the deceased was trying to de-escalate the confrontation. He was pursued by the security guards for no good reason beyond the perimeter of their club and after his brother had retreated. A total of seven security guards were involved. Thereafter, the deceased and his brother had not posed any real threat to any of the security guards, yet they were still pursued and the confrontation escalated by reason of the fact that they were pursued.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour gave too much weight to his finding that the applicant’s decision to intervene was spontaneous and took place when there was little opportunity to reflect calmly and that there was no relevant premeditation as to any form of aggravating factor. The Crown submitted that rather than the attack being “spontaneous” and therefore sounding in mitigation, it arose from an intention to retaliate so that the applicant might revenge himself upon the deceased and those with him.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a sentence of 3 years was inadequate to a significant degree because it manifestly failed to mark by way of deterrence and denunciation the objective seriousness of the offence which took the life of another human being.
	


Consideration


	
	A foundational difficulty for the Crown in this appeal is that it has not challenged (nor could it) his Honour’s factual findings and accordingly is bound by them. It is no answer to that circumstance to submit that his Honour gave excessive weight to these findings. Having made the findings which he did his Honour, as he was obliged to, gave effect to them. This approach by his Honour does not give rise to any ground of appeal, either patent or latent.
	
	
	His Honour made a specific finding of fact based on his observation of the CCTV footage that immediately prior to the confrontation between the deceased and the applicant, the deceased had moved towards Hopoate with the paint scraper in his hand, and that this was the trigger for the intervention of the applicant. Accordingly, there was no basis for the Crown’s submission that his Honour erred in finding that an offence which occurred against that background was significantly less serious than if that factor had not been present. The existence of that factual background constituted an important ameliorating circumstance.
	
	
	While the deceased initially tried to de-escalate the confrontation, it is apparent from his Honour’s findings that this was not the situation when the confrontation between him and the applicant occurred. By that stage, which was confirmed by Wilmer, the deceased had become very angry. He had armed himself with a paint scraper and was moving towards Hopoate with an apparent intention of involving himself in the struggle between him and Wilmer. It was at that point that the applicant intervened, albeit it with an excessive use of force. That the death of the deceased ensued was tragic and avoidable and the applicant has been convicted of the offence of manslaughter as a result thereof. Despite those consequences, the Crown remains bound by his Honour’s factual findings and in the absence of any challenge to those findings, it is not entitled to traverse them.
	
	
	It is somewhat trite to observe that there is no single correct sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Moreover, a Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27]). As was also pointed out in Markarian (at [25]) “If specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust?” It is this last kind of error that is usually described in an offender’s appeal as “manifest excess” or in a prosecution appeal as “manifest inadequacy”.
	
	
	In view of his Honour’s findings of fact, it cannot be said that this sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	In the conviction appeal, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
	
	
	In the Crown’s appeal against sentence, the appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the reasons and conclusion of Hoeben CJ at CL in relation to ground 1 of the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	As to ground 2, my own review of the evidence leads me to conclude that there was no scope (beyond speculation) to find that there was another security guard involved in the overall incident who was wearing a long-sleeved dark shirt as the applicant was.
	
	
	In relation to the CCTV footage, the learned trial judge gave the jury a very firm direction about having an open mind; taking great care; scrutinising such material carefully; keeping firmly in mind the presumption of innocence; and not assuming to be true what one or the other party suggested could or could not be gleaned from the footage. His Honour also cautioned the jury to avoid being influenced by suggestion or what he said was sometimes referred to as ""anchoring or wishful thinking"". I have kept his Honour's sage advice in mind as I independently viewed the CCTV compilation footage, and particularly that from the Flight Centre, quite a number of times. It was particularly assisted by the techniques suggested by the Crown with the instructions in Exhibit BB. In the end I found myself in respectful agreement with Hoeben CJ at CL as to what the footage does and does not reveal.
	
	
	Upon my assessment of the evidence overall I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the charge of manslaughter had been established. I agree that leave to appeal against conviction should be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	I also agree that the Crown appeal against sentence should be dismissed for the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I have read in draft the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and conclusions in relation to ground 1 of the conviction appeal and in relation to the Crown appeal against sentence.
	
	
	In relation to ground 2 I am satisfied from my own review of the evidence that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of manslaughter. In the first place, it may be accepted that there were differing accounts from the various witnesses concerning precisely the course of events as well as the description of those persons involved. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from a review of the CCTV evidence that it was reasonably open to the jury to conclude that the applicant was the only security guard dressed in a long sleeved black or dark shirt.
	
	
	I am also satisfied from the evidence of Christopher Ball, and to a lesser extent from Ryan Richards, when taken together with the CCTV footage, especially that from the Flight Centre, that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who punched the deceased on Darlinghurst Road. I agree that leave to appeal against conviction should be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	I also agree with the reasons for Hoeben CJ at CL in relation to the Crown appeal against sentence.

2766534,"Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency v Black, Robert [2015] NSWLC 9","​judgment


	
	​Mr Robert Black, the accused, has been charged with performing a manipulation of the cervical spine when he was not registered in an appropriate health profession and was not a student or trainee in an appropriate health profession on 23 October 2013 at Wagga Wagga. If such manipulation occurred, and as alleged by the prosecuting authority, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (""AHPRA""), then the procedure amounts to a breach of s 123(1) of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) (""National Law""). That section is in the following terms:
	


""123   Restriction on spinal manipulation

(1)  A person must not perform manipulation of the cervical spine unless the person—

(a)  is registered in an appropriate health profession; or

(b)  is a student who performs manipulation of the cervical spine in the course of activities undertaken as part of—

(i)  an approved program of study in an appropriate health profession; or

(ii)  clinical training in an appropriate health profession; or

(c)  is a person, or a member of a class of persons, prescribed under a regulation as being authorised to perform manipulation of the cervical spine.""


	
	The maximum penalty for a breach of this section is $30,000. The significant penalty that can be imposed is reflective of the purpose of that subdivision which is “practice protections”. The protection is for those persons who seek out such services, and to ensure that only qualified and registered personnel undertake specified procedures.
	
	
	The phrase “manipulation of the cervical spine” is defined in s 123(2) of the National Law and “means moving the joints of the cervical spine beyond a person's usual physiological range of motion using a high velocity, low amplitude thrust.” 
	


It is this definition which occupied three days of hearing time and a considerable degree of technical discussion around its precise meaning at law, and execution in clinical practice.


	
	The accused entered a plea of “not guilty” on 12 March 2014. Mr Black does not contend that he was registered, or that he was a student in an approved program of study, or that he was a person otherwise prescribed under regulation as being authorised. The accused asserts that what he performed on a patient (who covertly recorded the procedure) was not a manipulation as defined in s 123(2) of the National Law. Necessarily, this judgment is a decision about whether the accused performed a ""high velocity, low amplitude thrust"" to the cervical spine beyond the person’s usual physiological range of motion.
	
	
	I understand that the prosecution is a novel one, at least in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, there is little in the way of settled judicial opinion with respect to the proper construction of the phrase “manipulation of the cervical spine”. The National Law is part of a Commonwealth approach to regulation of certain health professions, including the chiropractic and osteopathic professions.
	


What is clear from a brief reading of Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) is that Parliament has, over the years, grappled with the definition as well. The current definition is the most recent formulation attempting to describe the procedure to the spine that trained chiropractors undertake.


	
	The accused cites on his resume that he graduated from the Sydney College of Osteopathy in 1968. From 1964 until 2012 he was in private practice as an osteopath, a chiropractor, as well as a number of other descriptions which included, relevant to these proceedings, practice as a “naprapath”.
	
	
	There were two witnesses for the prosecution. One of them was the expert witness, Mr John Kelly. Mr Kelly has a Diploma of Chiropractic from the Sydney College of Chiropractic dated 1979. He has been in private practice as a chiropractor since that date. Mr Kelly has been a lecturer at Macquarie University in chiropractic philosophy and principles, and he is a regular presenter to professional audiences on chiropractic matters. Despite coming under some criticism from the accused, I had no difficulty in accepting his expertise.
	
	
	Mr Kelly explained that the cervical spine is that portion of a person’s spine that goes from their skull to the top of the shoulder region. It consists of seven vertebrae that are described as C1 to C7 respectively, going on to the thoracic spine starting with T1.
	
	
	Mr Kelly further explained that a person’s usual physiological range of motion can be divided into two segments. One is called the active range of motion, and one is called the passive range of motion. The active range of motion with respect to the head is a person’s maximum ability, unaided, to turn their head. Mr Kelly continued, 
	


“it consists of the amount of range you can turn to the right using your own musculature, or for that matter intra flexion, bending forward, or extension, bending backwards, or bending sideways, ear to shoulder, both directions. That is the active range of motion. The passive range of motion is the motion available beyond the active range which is obtained by a third, or a second party, turning the neck beyond that range. Passive range is to go beyond that range that the muscles will give by a third person doing the movement for you.”

Mr Kelly said that the joints of a person’s cervical spine might be moved beyond the usual physiological range of motion by the application of force at the end of the passive range which allows for ligament stretch to let the joints separate a bit further and then come back to their normal position.


	
	Mr Kelly also gave evidence in relation to the clinical understanding of what is described in the legislation as a ""high velocity, low amplitude thrust"". Disarming the careful work of Parliamentary draftsmen, he said that high velocity means “quick”, and low amplitude means “short”. 
	


“So a high velocity low amplitude thrust is a quick movement applied at the end of range over a short distance”, he added.


	
	In chiropractic practice it is sometimes the case that when such a manoeuvre is performed a cracking or popping sound is heard. The chiropractic term for that phenomenon is “cavitation”. Mr Kelly said that cavitation occurs when two adjoining services of the vertebra are momentarily moved apart. This creates a negative pressure inside the joint, and a gas bubble is formed which comes from nitrogen being drawn out of the synovial fluid and then rapidly collapsing. 
	


Cavitation, however, is not always the end result of a manipulation of the cervical spine. It is possible, according to both the accused and Mr Kelly, that manipulation of the cervical spine can occur without causing cavitation.


	
	The prosecution’s other witness was a private inquiry agent who had been retained to undertake covert surveillance within the accused’s home where he also undertakes his practice. The product of this surveillance was a video (or ""DVD"") which was played in these proceedings. The video was provided to Mr Kelly to prepare a report on, and it was tendered as an exhibit purporting to show the accused performing high velocity low amplitude thrusts resulting in a manipulation of the cervical spine. The investigator, Mr Mark Penny, was engaged by Lancaster Global Investigations to conduct this surveillance. He made an appointment with the accused, and attended upon his room on 22 October 2013 for the purpose of receiving treatment.
	
	
	The video footage showed a number of preparatory actions by the accused, none of which would infringe the National Law. There were two episodes, however, during the course of the video in which the accused performed procedures on and around Mr Penny’s neck which attracted comment from Mr Kelly, and which the prosecution relies upon as evidence of a breach of s 123(1) of the National Law.
	
	
	The difficulty arises in respect to one of the episodes; that is, where the accused is standing on the left side of Mr Penny, and his body occludes any clear view of the manipulations performed. It is for that reason that the prosecution principally relies upon those manipulations which are visible when the accused is standing on the right side of Mr Penny. The prosecution contends that what is seen at this point is the accused performing two high velocity low amplitude thrusts to the cervical spine of Mr Penny in quick succession. The accused denies that they are high velocity low amplitude thrusts within the meaning of the National Law and says that he was performing another manoeuvre which is part of his naprapathic practice.
	
	
	Mr Kelly, in his report dated 4 April 2014, observed that the first manipulations on the video were occluded by the body of Mr Black. He refers then to Mr Black changing sides and says that the positioning of Mr Black’s arms and hands are obvious. His report continues: “two rapid movements are seen to take place which are consistent with the manipulative procedure commonly referred to as a cervical supine reverse rotation thrust.”
	
	
	In his brief report, Mr Kelly gives his opinion that having viewed the video he believes that Mr Black performed a manipulation on the cervical spine of Mr Penny. The reasons for his opinion included that Mr Penny was placed in a position consistent with the way in which a patient would be positioned for manipulation of the cervical spine, Mr Black assumed the position beside the table consistent with the positioning required to perform such a manipulation, and Mr Black is seen on video applying short rapid movements to the neck of Mr Penny which could be described as being high velocity and low amplitude in nature.
	
	
	Mr Kelly does not, in his report, make any specific reference to the manipulation going beyond the usual physiological range of motion, apart from making an observation that the presence or absence of a cavitation sound would be inconclusive as to this aspect.
	
	
	I have referred to there being two relevant manipulation episodes. The first episode lacks the assistance of any visual representation on the video given that the accused's body blocks any perspective. While the prosecution did not abandon that evidence, it was clear in closing submissions that the prosecution preferred to focus on that which was recorded on video, and which I describe as the second episode. Even if that were not the case, I would consider it unsafe to convict on the evidence that was presented with respect to the first episode. For that reason, this decision will be largely confined to an examination of the second episode. Having said that, Mr Penny did hear a “pop, crack sound” with respect to the first episode and experienced “a couple of cracking sensations around my neck area.” This is interesting in so far as it provides a comparison to what occurred during the second episode.
	
	
	During the second episode, Mr Penny described that his face had been turned to the left again and it had been turned “as far as it could naturally go”. He said that there were another couple of quick jerks to the left again. Importantly, he was asked how far his head had moved to the left at that point. Mr Penny responded, “I couldn’t be exactly sure how far but it was just like a quick jerk and then it was back”. He was then asked whether he felt any sensations at that time in his neck and he responded, “just the jerking motions that time.” When asked if he heard anything he responded, “not the second time, no”.
	


Mr Kelly said that his expert report was limited with respect to the first episode, but added that the two rapid movements that he saw, being the second episode, are consistent with the manipulative procedure.


	
	The accused cross-examined Mr Kelly and asked him to give a scientific definition of ""velocity"". Mr Kelly said, “it is simply the speed over time, the time that you would apply a high velocity thrust is measured in milliseconds. In the neck, somewhere between 80 and 150”. In this matter, there was no proposition with respect to the actual speed of the thrusts performed and, indeed, that would probably be an impossibility. But it underlines the difficulty of applying such a general definition in a legal environment.
	
	
	The accused raised many aspects in his defence. He represented himself and relied on his knowledge of chiropractic, osteopathic and naprapathic procedures over many years to test the prosecution case. Much of that argument had limited relevance to the proceedings, but it was possible to excise that which was relevant to the allegation of a breach of s 123(1) of the National Law.
	
	
	Amongst the accused’s many arguments was an assertion that the manipulations performed were not “high velocity”. With respect to amplitude, the accused pointed to potential vagueness around the phrase “low amplitude”, likening it to “the length of a piece of string”. Further, the accused denied that Mr Penny’s treatment operated beyond the physiological range, and belatedly, asserted that the manipulation was performed on the thoracic spine rather than the cervical spine. The latter assertion was made at a late stage of the proceedings and was not something that was put to either Mr Penny or, more particularly, Mr Kelly. The prosecution’s submission that that aspect of his evidence was recent invention had resonance, and it reflected my overall view that Mr Black was conducting his defence in a manner akin to throwing as many darts at the dartboard in the hope that one might hit the bullseye. This is perhaps understandable in the context where Mr Black was representing himself. Whatever his tactical approach might have been, it did not alleviate the prosecution of its obligation to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It became clear to me in the proceedings that the real issue, on these facts and on the evidence before the Court, was whether the second episode included a thrust beyond the physiological range. Even Mr Kelly had to be reminded that a breach of that section would require an extension beyond the physiological range; under cross-examination, Mr Kelly asked to review the provision to enquire if it required a movement beyond the usual physiological range of motion. It is in this aspect that his report is also less forthcoming; understandably so, as it is not something that he could say with certainty on a viewing of the video. 
	
	
	In examination in chief, Mr Kelly did say that he saw some pre-tensioning of Mr Penny’s neck during the second episode and that he then saw a short quick thrust delivered with the hands in order to effect the manipulation of the neck. Mr Kelly concluded that a manipulation of the cervical spine had occurred during the course of the treatment of Mr Penny. Such an opinion could not be conclusive on any objective standard as to whether or not the physiological range had been extended, but it was Mr Kelly’s professional opinion that there had been a manipulation of the cervical spine.
	
	
	The accused said that he informed Mr Penny that his treatment would be a naprapathic manipulation as he had retired as a chiropractor. In evidence he said, “I also said the treatment consisted of a deep naprapathic massage followed by naprapathic manipulations and ligament and tendon stretching. I also said that the naprapathic manipulations were similar to chiropractic but for obvious reasons it can’t be called chiropractic.” The accused described the manoeuvres that he performed as “naprapathic releases”.
	
	
	This is what the accused said about the second episode: 
	


""I then picked up his head in my two hands raising his head to bring into play the upper T1 to 2 joint on Mr Penny’s spine and then digitally fixing the cervical segments so they would not move as outlined in any decent manual osteopathic or naprapathic articulation, which is never adjust a bone unless you have a problem with it, I then used a reverse supine side bending articulation without impulse which I repeated twice. Now when I’m on Mr Penny’s left hand side I bent his head away from me which is towards his right shoulder as evidenced on the DVD. The neck was not taken to full side bend in this procedure and the neck was not taken to full rotation, therefore there can be no infringement of the National Law with or without digital fixation of the cervical segments. It was a pure and simple articulation procedure. I only used the procedure twice which Mr Penny described as stretching, which it is, and well within Mr Penny’s physiological range of motion in both left lateral rotation and right side bending. The medium velocity reverse rotation component introduced is to assist longitudinal ligaments stretching and to prevent facet jamming.""


	
	The accused also queried why there were two successive manipulations if he was in fact using high velocity low amplitude adjustments when all of the professional literature indicates that you would not use two such adjustments in rapid succession on the one cervical segment on the one patient in the one treatment session. The prosecution submitted that just because the procedure is performed unprofessionally or against clinical benchmarks does not mean that it did not occur.
	
	
	The accused sought to describe his articulations as being of medium velocity. He made reference in later submissions to some American literature which delineates medium velocity from high velocity, however this was never produced to the Court. I suspect that it does not exist. I was quite satisfied that high velocity means “quick”. The manoeuvres which I observed on the DVD could not be described as slow, and if there is a middle ground to be applied to such manoeuvres, I am of the view, consistent with Mr Kelly’s observations, that the thrusts performed by the accused had moved well beyond any middle ground.
	
	
	The accused said that the articulation procedures utilised on Mr Penny took 24 seconds in total. He said that when he was a practising chiropractor each one of these “HV LA” adjustments took approximately 10 seconds each to set up and to complete. This might be compared to what he describes as “performing nine procedures on Mr Penny’s T1 and connecting ligaments in 24 seconds.”
	
	
	The accused explicitly denied that he moved Mr Penny’s head to the end of the passive range of motion saying “no, nowhere near it”. And he denied that he went beyond the usual physiological range of motion. He denied that he was seeking to mobilise the C7 vertebrae saying that there was no contact and that he was only “digitally locking” on the cervical vertebrae.
	
	
	The interpretation difficulties are one aspect. There were also difficulties about the evidence of Mr Penny. In summary form, there was a lack of precision about his testimony, and documents that may have assisted the prosecution in its case were lost by the investigating company. The lack of precision might be explained in that Mr Penny has no chiropractic qualifications, or indeed any health related qualification, although has had cause to see a chiropractor in the past. He was really unable to give much more than a salutary observation about some of the things he heard, some of the things he saw, and some of the things he felt. Those observations provided Mr Kelly with some useful information, but they could not, on their own, come anywhere close to a convincing portrayal of a breach of s 123(1) of the National Law.
	
	
	For example, Mr Penny said that in his initial conversation with the accused he said he “needed some chiropractic – or something on my back and sciatica.” He did not press the accused when the accused told him that he could not claim his receipt. He was unable to recall with any precision as to what any of the signage or certificates hanging in the accused’s entry room referred to. He said that he thought one was a schedule of fees and that there were other certificates that he was unable to read properly.
	


When the accused said to him that he does not call it chiropractic “for obvious reasons”, Mr Penny did not ask the accused what those obvious reasons were. The receipt that was issued to him, and the photocopy of suggested exercises that was provided to him by the accused at the conclusion of the consultation, were both lost by the retaining company.

Mr Penny said that the couch he was lying on had a hole in it for your face to go through, however the accused’s evidence was that there is no hole in the couch and that towels are used to support the neck.

The phone number that was quoted by Mr Penny as being the phone number on the receipt issued was incorrect, and conceded by him to be “possibly a type error”.

In his statement, Mr Penny refers to a cracking or popping in his back, but it was put to him that it was only in his testimony before the Court that he referred to a popping sound during manipulations to his neck.


	
	Mr Kelly also differed in his observations of the video from what Mr Penny said he experienced. During the first episode, Mr Penny said that his neck was “jolted” five times, however Mr Kelly said that he saw three short sharp manipulations, and not five.
	
	
	Putting aside the evidence retention difficulties of the investigating agency, and the difficulties in recollection of the investigator, it is also evident that there are inherent difficulties in utilising a layperson to garner evidence of a professional procedure. In particular, a procedure that is governed by a statutory definition, and which introduces its own complexities. This is not the situation in which you send a punter into a brothel to determine whether certain services are being offered. In this case, it is not only a question of whether it is a chiropractic service, but further whether it is a service that comprises a manipulation of the cervical spine using a particular procedure that has a specific statutory definition which refers back to clinically understood manoeuvres. This is the realm of the qualified expert, and short of sending such an expert onto the patient’s table, or of extracting certain concessions from the errant practitioner, it is difficult to envisage how a breach of s 123 of the National Law might be successfully prosecuted.
	
	
	The accused alleged bias on the part of the expert Mr Kelly on the basis that the accused had had some part in writing an adverse report in the past. While that was a matter of continuing professional torment for the accused, Mr Kelly could not remember the particular proceedings, or any involvement with Mr Black. I was satisfied that there was no apparent bias on the part of Mr Kelly and, as I have indicated, he was appropriately qualified and a competent and impressive witness.
	
	
	The accused made it quite clear that his relationship with the chiropractic community was not a happy one. He made a point of repeatedly attacking the credibility of Mr Kelly, an attitude that did not impress the Court and attracted no sympathy. The accused’s attempts to ambush and embarrass the expert were futile, and seemingly borne more of professional rivalry than any forensic utility.
	
	
	Legitimate questions of the accused as to why he had failed to maintain treatment notes and to produce them in these proceedings were met with the rather hollow response that they had been destroyed as a result of a computer virus. This may well have been the case, but the assertions lacked the attendant minutiae of truth. I have already commented on the belated defence posture that the manipulations were on the thoracic rather than the cervical spine, but for the reasons that I set out in this decision, that distinction and late assertion is of little import in the determination of this matter.
	
	
	Returning then to the critical aspects to be determined. During the second episode of treatment upon Mr Penny, did the accused perform a high velocity low amplitude thrust, at least once, to the cervical spine which went beyond Mr Penny’s normal physiological range?
	
	
	Was it a ""high velocity"" thrust? Yes, it was quick. Semantics around low, medium and high velocity are just that. To the lay person and the professional observer, the thrust is demonstrably a quick thrust and that satisfies, in my view, the requirement that it be high velocity.
	
	
	Were the thrusts ""low amplitude""? Yes, they were. The two thrusts observed in the second episode were short.
	
	
	Were the thrusts to the cervical spine? Mr Kelly is quite confident that the placement of the hands and the positioning at the table are consistent with a manipulation to be performed on the cervical spine. The accused’s earlier evidence suggested that he was focusing on the cervical area rather than the thoracic area. His later suggestion that he was referring to the linkage between the C7 and T1 was unconvincing. I am satisfied on the strength of Mr Kelly’s evidence that the manipulation was to the cervical spine.
	


But that is not enough.


	
	Section 123 of the National Law requires that the manipulation be one in which there is movement beyond the person’s normal physiological range. The prosecution has not been able to prove this aspect beyond reasonable doubt. Neither the evidence of Mr Penny or of Mr Kelly, or of them both combined, go so far as to conclusively or even persuasively suggest that Mr Penny experienced movement into the paraphysical range during the second episode.
	
	
	Section 123 of the National Law is fraught with difficulty in terms of its construction, and application in the clinical and legal environments. I have already referred to the inherent difficulties of mounting a prosecution where a breach is alleged. Even without the hurdles such as the view of the procedure being occluded, evidence being lost, and lay recollection of a vague and ad hoc nature, interpretation of the section and the mustering of evidence which might substantiate a breach presents formidable challenges to any authority seeking to enforce it.
	
	
	It follows that the charge is not made out and it is dismissed.

		23 July 2015",2015-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2766538,Louise v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 63,"Judgment: Offer of amends


	
	These are my reasons for refusing the plaintiff’s application for the determination of the defence of offer of amends (s 18 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (“the Act”)) be made by the judge and not the jury.
	


The roles of judicial officers and juries in the Act


	
	The roles of judicial officers and juries in defamation proceedings are defined in s 22 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) as follows:
	


“22 Roles of judicial officers and juries in defamation proceedings 

(1) This section applies to defamation proceedings that are tried by jury.

(2) The jury is to determine whether the defendant has published defamatory matter about the plaintiff and, if so, whether any defence raised by the defendant has been established.

(3) If the jury finds that the defendant has published defamatory matter about the plaintiff and that no defence has been established, the judicial officer and not the jury is to determine the amount of damages (if any) that should be awarded to the plaintiff and all unresolved issues of fact and law relating to the determination of that amount.

(4) If the proceedings relate to more than one cause of action for defamation, the jury must give a single verdict in relation to all causes of action on which the plaintiff relies unless the judicial officer orders otherwise.

(5) Nothing in this section:

(a) affects any law or practice relating to special verdicts, or

(b) requires or permits a jury to determine any issue that, at general law, is an issue to be determined by the judicial officer.”


	
	Section 22 allocates only two issues to the “judicial officer”. These are the assessment of damages and the determination of any issue, at general law, that is an issue of law to be determined by the judicial officer.
	
	
	The s 18 defence does not fall within either of these categories. Mr Evatt does not put this application forward on such a basis. He submits that the careless drafting of the Act renders the identity of the decision maker being, contrary to the offer of amends provisions under the previous legislation applicable in New South Wales, accidentally transferred to the judge rather than the jury, in much the same way that Simpson J noted, in Kermode v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 852, that the language of s 26 of the Act was at variance with what appeared to be the legislative intention (see also Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode (2011) 81 NSWLR 157).
	


The defence of offer of amends


	
	Section 15 of the Act sets out the contents of an offer of amends and s 17 explains the effect of the acceptance of the offer. Section 17 confers upon the “court” a power to pay “expenses reasonably incurred” (s 17(2)(a)), including an order for costs on an indemnity basis (s 17(2)(b)). Section 17(3)(a) provides that these powers are exercisable by “the court in those proceedings” if proceedings have been commenced, but s 17(3)(b) warns that “except as provided in paragraph (a)” of s 17(2), only the Supreme Court has such power. (If this is designed to prevent the award of indemnity costs by the District Court, it is contrary to s 40 of the Act, and another example of careless drafting, but that is irrelevant to the issue before me.)
	
	
	However, an offer of amends which is refused changes its nature entirely. Where an offer of amends is refused, a defendant may rely upon that refusal as a defence, if it can be established that the offer to make amends was “reasonable”:
	


“18 Effect of failure to accept reasonable offer to make amends

(1) If an offer to make amends is made in relation to the matter in question but is not accepted, it is a defence to an action for defamation against the publisher in relation to the matter if:

(a) the publisher made the offer as soon as practicable after becoming aware that the matter is or may be defamatory, and

(b) at any time before the trial the publisher was ready and willing, on acceptance of the offer by the aggrieved person, to carry out the terms of the offer, and

(c) in all the circumstances the offer was reasonable.

(2) In determining whether an offer to make amends is reasonable, a court:

(a) must have regard to any correction or apology published before any trial arising out of the matter in question, including the extent to which the correction or apology is brought to the attention of the audience of the matter in question taking into account:

(i) the prominence given to the correction or apology as published in comparison to the prominence given to the matter in question as published, and

(ii) the period that elapses between publication of the matter in question and publication of the correction or apology, and

(b) may have regard to:

(i) whether the aggrieved person refused to accept an offer that was limited to any particular defamatory imputations because the aggrieved person did not agree with the publisher about the imputations that the matter in question carried, and

(ii) any other matter that the court considers relevant.”


	
	The defendant in these proceedings made an offer of amends which has been refused, and accordingly is entitled to rely upon a defence of offer of amends. The question is whether that issue should be left to the jury, or determined separately by me.
	


A preliminary issue: delay in bringing this application


	
	I first note the delay with which this application is made. If the defence should be determined separately by me, it would be preferable that the defence be considered at a time separate to, or even well before, the determination by the jury of the other defences. The point that litigation has reached relative to a trial when the application of this nature is made must be taken into account, as an application which might otherwise have been granted runs the risk of being refused, in the exercise of the court’s discretion, if brought at such a late time: Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175 (“Aon”) at [102]-[103].
	
	
	If what Mr Evatt says is correct, the application should have been brought at the earliest opportunity. It should not have been brought at the trial. If the defendant had been successful in the offer of amends defence, it could have been the end of the litigation without the expense of a jury trial. The case management principles which underlie both the Act and the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) should be given their due weight in this regard.
	
	
	I make these observations because the offer of amends system is an important early resolution procedure which should be used both fairly and effectively by parties to resolve litigation.
	
	
	Although the lateness of the application alone would warrant its dismissal, I also propose to consider the issue on its merits. Both parties essentially adopted the same submissions as were made to me in Hunt v Radio 2SM Pty Ltd (No 2) (2010) 10 DCLR (NSW) 240 (“Hunt”), and I have accordingly only briefly summarised them.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	Mr Evatt’s brief submissions consisted of the same issues he raised in Hunt (at [11]-[16]). He first submits that in determining whether an offer to make amends is reasonable for the purposes of s 18(1)(c) a “court” must have regard to any correction, as well as to “certain other matters” (which would include disputed issues of fact). The section refers to the “court” (which Mr Evatt submits is the trial judge, not the jury) as being designated to determine whether the offer is reasonable.
	
	
	The only other reference to “reasonable” in the Act occurs in s 30(3) (qualified privilege), which has generally similar wording to s 18(1)(c) and 18(2). Section 30(3) provides that a court may take into account whether the conduct of the defendant in publishing the matter is “reasonable”. Thus, both defences - the offer of amends (s 18) and qualified privilege (s 30) - require the court to decide, respectively, whether the offer was reasonable or whether the conduct of the defendant in publishing was reasonable (see the references to the role of the judge in this regard in Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2008) 71 NSWLR 606; [2008] NSWSC 699). Mr Evatt submitted that reasonableness was thus a concept that judges should determine, not a jury.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Evatt submits that there is no other reference to “the court” determining any issue in any of the other defences in the Defamation Act. This reference to “the court” must mean the judge, as otherwise s 18 would refer to the jury.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Evatt submits that the nature of the inquiry by the jury into these issues would require them to consider issues of quantum of damages, which s 22 makes clear is not part of their role.
	
	
	Dr Collins QC repeated the submissions made in Hunt, and submits that the defence of offer of amends, like all other defences, should be determined by the tribunal of fact at the trial, which in the present case is the jury. He points out that s 18 differs from other defences in a vital respect: it first permits an early and summary resolution of the whole of the claim if the offer of amends made by the defendant is accepted by the plaintiff. It is only if the offer is rejected by the plaintiff that the issue of reasonableness falls to be determined by the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	It is by reason of this dual nature that s 18 appears in a separate section, namely Part 3 Division 1 of the Act, but that does not mean that s 18 cannot function as a complete defence, or that it should be determined by a different tribunal of fact from that determining other issues of fact at trial in relation to the other defences.
	
	
	Section 22 makes clear the obligation of the tribunal of fact (in the present case, the jury) to determine the defences. Once the offer of amends is refused, it becomes a defence which must be considered by the same tribunal as that which considers the other defences pleaded by the defendant.
	
	
	Nor is it correct for Mr Evatt to say that the jury, in doing so, is determining damages. They are considering disputed issues of fact in relation to the offer of amends made, not awarding damages.
	


An issue for the jury, and not for the trial judge


	
	For the reasons set out by me more fully in Hunt, I am satisfied that the issues (including disputed issues of fact) arising from a s 18 defence are matters for the tribunal of fact at the hearing, which in the present case is the jury.
	
	
	As I noted in Hunt, these problems in the interpretation of ss 18 and 30 arise from the copying across of provisions for the offer of amends and qualified privilege defences from the repealed sections in the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). There was never any doubt that the offer of amends system under the repealed section (despite the rarity of its use) was a matter for the jury. While s 18 could certainly be better drafted, s 22 must be given its full import, and s 22 makes it clear that issues of defences are matters for determination by a jury where a jury has been empanelled.
	
	
	One of the evils that the uniform legislation intended to overcome was the proliferation of mini-trials caused by the s 7A separate jury trial for issues of publication and defamatory meaning. The perils of separate trials of the issues in proceedings are well known. If the offer of amends defence is not a matter for the jury, when and in what circumstances should a judge determine the defence, and why should that judge be the trial judge? Would the offer of amends defence need to be determined before, during or after the jury findings? These are issues of complexity that should not be triggered by obscure legislative drafting.
	


Orders


	
	Application for the defence of offer of amends to be taken from the jury refused.

		14 May 2015",2015-05-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766540,R v Feuerstein [2015] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: The respondent, Michael Feuerstein, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment charging 25 counts of sexual offences committed against boys. He was found guilty of 21 of them. He also pleaded guilty to 2 charges on a separate indictment, referred to in this court as the second indictment. These were possessing and disseminating child abuse material. The sentence passed for the first of those charges, possessing child abuse material, took into an account an offence of possessing prohibited weapons on a Form 1.
	
	
	For the 2 offences on the second indictment he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 2 ½ years and 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 December 2011. For the 21 offences of which he was found guilty at trial he was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 14 years, comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 1 June 2012. The total sentence, then, was imprisonment for 14 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 9 ½ years.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against those sentences, asserting that they are manifestly inadequate and were affected by specific errors in the trial judge’s approach. I should record that there was a further matter on a s 166 certificate, for which the respondent was convicted without penalty, but that is not the subject of appeal.
	


Facts


	
	It is necessary to summarise the facts of this unusual case at some length. In relation to the offences of which the respondent was found guilty at trial, this is best done by reference to the trial judge’s findings expressed in his remarks on sentence, which include his assessment of the gravity of the offences.
	


The trial offences


	
	These offences were committed over a 20 year period, between 1991 and 2011. The offences were the following:
	



	
	counts of aggravated sexual assault: s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment;
	
	
	12 counts of aggravated indecent assault: s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment;
	
	
	2 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16: s 66C(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;
	
	
	1 count of sexual intercourse without consent: s 61I of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.
	


Some of the later offences under s 61J and s 61M of the Act also carried standard non-parole periods: 10 years under s 61J and 5 years under s 61M.


	
	There were seven complainants, aged between 10 and 16 years at the relevant times. For the purpose of sentence, his Honour accepted tendency evidence admitted at the trial which established that:
	



	
	The respondent was sexually interested in young boys and motivated to act on that interest.
	
	
	There was a pattern of behaviour whereby he would befriend young boys, reward them “with such things as jobs, washing cars, small amounts of money, treats, playing with his guns, which he used as a security guard, dressing up and things of that nature, and providing them with pills and other drugs, including alcohol.”
	
	
	He would punish some of them by beating them with a cane or other items, and recorded details of this activity in notebooks.
	
	
	He photographed the boys in sexual poses where possible, and “indecently assaulted or sexually assaulted them if the opportunity arose.”
	



	
	As to the various counts, his Honour expressed his findings in his remarks as follows:
	


“Counts 1 and 2 [ss 61J and 61M] involved the complainant JC. All are said to have occurred at Rosemeadow in 1991. JC said that when he was about 12 or 13 he was a regular visitor to the offender’s home at Romeo Crescent, Rosemeadow. ... . JC, as a boy, would stay overnight. He would drink and take pills given to him by the offender. One night after drinking and taking a ‘red pill’ he woke in the offender’s bed to find the offender sucking his penis. He then passed out. JC said the next time he woke the offender had ejaculated on him and was rubbing the ejaculate into his chest with his hand. … .

JC spoke of another incident when after a massive drinking session or bender he woke to find himself naked in the offender’s bed. The offender was beside him also naked. He was rubbing JC’s chest and crotch. This touching was an assault. What was done, particularly to a young boy who was semi‑conscious, was indecent. JC was at the time aged 13, the offender 31. The offender exploited the complainant’s violent relationship with his own father. He exploited the child’s vulnerability by offering him work and a refuge and then taking advantage of him while he was a guest at Rosemeadow. There appear to be only two incidents during the many years that the offender had contact with JC.

I am prepared to accept that the offender also took an interest in other aspects of JC’s welfare; this was a common factor with many of the complainants. Whether that was genuine or simply to further his sexual desires I am unable to determine. I suspect that in his mind, both were present, despite their obvious incompatibility. The two offences involved the offender taking advantage of the fact that JC, a child, was drunk on liquor made available to him by the offender.

Count 3, an offence of sexual intercourse without consent knowing he was not consenting, involves GS. GS was then 16 or 17. He stayed at the offender’s Rosemeadow home. … . One night while watching TV on a lounge GS was given pills. He woke to find the offender sucking his penis. … . There was no consent because GS was asleep or knocked out by the pills. The offender was well aware of this as he had given him the pills. GS was 17, the offender 35. GS was a vulnerable young man with family problems who welcomed the opportunity of work and refuge at Rosemeadow.

Here the sexual act appears to be an isolated one in the context of a long relationship which continued after the event and well into GS’s adulthood. That relationship, as with others, had within it elements generically described as ‘grooming’ but part of that relationship also involved the complainant allowing the offender to take pleasure from the company of an attractive young man in exchange for gifts and other support.

                                                                                                             …

Such relationships can as here involve mutual interdependence. Something the offender, I believe, cultivated or instilled in the witness while he was young and vulnerable. The act itself, the subject of count 3, was a serious crime. GS was given pills; he was deliberately rendered helpless so the offender could sexually assault him.

Counts 4, 5 and 6 involve JD. Counts 4 and 5 involve s 66C(2) Crimes Act offences, sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and 16 [having the victim fellate him]. Count 6 is a s 61J(1) Crimes Act offence of sexual intercourse while a person was under authority.

In relation to Counts 4 and 5, I note the offender invited a troubled young man into his home. The offender became his foster carer for a short time but then asked JD to leave. After leaving the house JD returned and with friends broke in and stole a significant amount of property from Mr Feuerstein. The offender later ‘arrested’ JD and took him to police. JD was charged and convicted. On arrest he made a complaint the offender had forced on him anal intercourse. This complaint was unfortunately not followed up by the police; this was not JD’s fault.

The offender knew JD had a drug problem. He knew how old he was. He offered him money to suck his penis. The young man did this and was paid for what he did. … . JD was then under the accused’s authority. Count 5 relates to an almost identical allegation a few weeks later.

In relation to Count 6, as with Counts 4 and 5, money was offered to the complainant while he was living with the offender and after the offender had taken on the duties as his foster carer. This time the money was offered and accepted to engage in anal sex. After that intercourse commenced the complainant said ‘Stop. It’s hurting; I don’t want to do it.’ The offender said, ‘It’s all right. It will be all right’. He kept going despite continued protests until JD pulled away after about 30 seconds.

JD was a particularly vulnerable young man, aged 14, homeless, with a drug problem. The accused took him in and was paid to be his foster carer. He knew JD needed money for drugs. He exploited that need, JD’s obvious vulnerability, and his position of authority. Each offence involved a humiliating and degrading experience for the young boy. The intercourse, the subject of count 6, particularly so. While there was a form of consent, in the circumstances here the offender gains little in mitigation from it, given the objective facts and the method used by the offender to exploit the young man to gain his consent.

Counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 involve DH. Counts 7 and 8 are s 61M(1) Crimes Act offences. They involve incidents where the offender caned DH. DH’s evidence dealt with two specific incidences of caning which establish count 7 and 8. When DH was about eight years old in school Year 3 he was in the games room and was told to pull down his pants, bend over a stool and allow the offender to hit him on the bare buttocks using a cane. During the incident he was called a “sook” and his hair was pulled. Later, he said he was given $50 and dropped off home. He described another incident when he was in Year 5 when he was given a US $100 note after the offender hit him six times on the bare buttocks after he had got him to lean over a stool in the red room at Rosemeadow.

                                                                                                           …

Counts 9 and 10 involve s 61J(1) Crimes Act offences involving DH. On occasions when DH slept over at Rosemeadow he was given pills. He was told they were Valium. One time when he was in Year 5 he woke to a weird sensation and found the offender sucking his erect penis. He was told to relax and the offender kept going. This event started and continued without consent. As he was asleep when it started there could be no consent. A few weeks later DH was on the couch at Rosemeadow. Again, he woke to find the offender sucking his penis. This ‘freaked’ him out but the offender kept going, he said, for 15 minutes.

Count 11 involves an offence of indecency from 2001, s 61M(1) Crimes Act. One night at Rosemeadow the offender masturbated DH’s penis over his clothes, there was no skin on skin contact. DH was then in Year 6. This occurred on the couch in the red room.

DH was the youngest of the complainants. He was caned from when he was nine years old and while the offence period covers three years his association with the offender continued until he was a young adult. His association with the offender followed the now familiar pattern. He was young, with a difficult home life. He was drawn to the offender by the apparent security of the home at Rosemeadow and also the jobs, gifts and money that were provided to him. Again, in relation to count 10 he was given a pill and woke to find the offender sucking his penis. Later incidents did not appear to involve pills.

Again, each offence resulted in serious interference with the physical integrity of the child. While I am prepared to accept the canings were not as harsh as described in the notebooks they still involved the infliction of pain. They were part of a grooming process and had the capacity to cause DH significant long term emotional and psychological harm. Again, the child was groomed to play a part in the offender’s ongoing fantasy and sexual interest in young boys. That interest went well beyond fantasy. He recruited DH into acting out those fantasies, taking advantage of and exploiting his youth and naivety.

The next matter is count 16. It involves EC. It is a s 61M Crimes Act matter said to have occurred in 2001. EC was another young man who would hang around the office of the accused’s security business. On one occasion he was taken to a separate office and told to ‘drop his trousers’. He was caned on the bare buttocks by the offender who then touched the spot that had been caned. … . EC said he used to hang around the office but did not return after this. This matter appears to be, so far as this one complainant is concerned, an isolated incident.

Counts 17 through to 23 involve JK. They are all matters charged pursuant to s 61M(1) Crimes Act. They all occurred in 2007. JK lived in a house that was built in front of the offender’s home at Rosemeadow. … . Counts 17 to 23 all involve allegations of assault and an act of indecency on JK when JK was under the age of 16.

Count 17 involves a bet JK had with the offender about a firecracker. He lost the bet and so was hit on the buttocks. He was not sure in evidence if they were bare or not, when he was hit with a cane or a strap but he said he was hit five to eight times. … .

Count 18 involves an offence that occurred in the study room. The offender was sitting on the computer chair and he pulled JK over his lap, pulled his pants down and hit him multiple times on the bare buttocks with a wooden flute until it broke. JK said that he ended up with a lot of purple bruising. … .

Count 19 involves an offence where JK was caned or strapped on the bare buttocks when he bent over a pool table after he lost a game of pool. He was in Year 7. … .

Count 20 involves caning of JK because he was ‘sooking’ about bruises from an earlier caning. … .

Count 21 involves an incident where JK was handcuffed and bent over a black chair and caned.

Count 22 follows another bet between JK and the offender in which JK first caned the offender. He lost the bet and the offender then ‘Made me pull my pants down and caned me on the bare backside.’

Count 23 occurred before a trip that JK and the offender took to the town of Harden. He was caned, apparently to prevent him misbehaving on the trip. JK could not remember the exact circumstances of the caning.

Each allegation occurred while JK was under 16. Each relates to a separate and specific act of caning, each involved an assault; each involved an act of indecency because of the circumstances, particularly those involving the caning on the buttocks of the child. More so, where those buttocks were bare. … .

The offender actively sought out JK, the son of his next door neighbours. JK was not as vulnerable as the other complainants but the offender successfully exploited his youth and immaturity. He offered him jobs, holidays and gifts. He gradually introduced JK into his own fantasy world and induced him to act some of those sexual fantasies out. JK was intelligent and mature enough to end his association with the offender prior to there being any further escalation of indecent activity. These crimes, however, involved a significant abuse of a young child and while the offender may pretend to himself that JK was his friend, the relationship was exploitative and wrong.

When I examine each of these matters individually I do form the view that they fall, however, well below the middle of the range of objective circumstances. Individually, they are not mid-range offences. When I come to impose a sentence I must impose individual sentences for each matter but the collective impact of this series of offences cannot be underestimated.

Counts 24 and 25 involve matters involving sexual intercourse between the offender with JC, while JC was under the authority of the offender. They are the most recent allegations.

The offender had been employed as a security officer for many years. It then appears he was for a period unemployed. He sought and obtained a job as a youth caseworker with a reputable youth support agency. The offender abused that position by first, bribing JC and then because of those bribes and pressure, that is by abuse of his position and authority, made JC suck the offender’s penis while in the lounge of the agency’s home at Canyonleigh: count 24. While the child obeyed the direction and did not protest there was no consent; that is, conscious and voluntary agreement. The offender knew this was the case as demonstrated by his own words and actions towards JC, as JC described them to the jury.

It is not in dispute JC was a child under 16, so each element of the charge was well established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence. So far as Count 25 is concerned JC’s account must be accepted. One night he woke to find the offender had placed his penis inside his anus. He did so for only a short period as JC soon, and understandably, objected. As JC was asleep he could not consent, and as the offender was staying at the home overnight as part of his job of caring for the child it is beyond reasonable doubt that JC was under his authority. Given the description of how JC was lying on the bed the event must have happened in the room he moved to after a fire at Canyonleigh, that is, after 17 August 2011.

The events of 2011 indicate the offender’s criminal behaviour had escalated to another level. I can only find that he had one motive for taking the position with the youth support agency and that was the access it gave him to young boys. He got the job because he presented as a person of good character with a genuine interest in the welfare of young people. Both were lies.

JC was in his care and under his authority. The offender owed a special responsibility to JC by virtue of his position. He had read JC’s extensive file. He knew his vulnerabilities and I suspect believed that JC was unlikely to complain and that if he complained, unlikely to be believed. The offender used his position to compel the intercourse of count 24 and sexually penetrated the sleeping child under his care, count 25. While this was a relatively brief episode it was a gross violation of the child’s physical integrity.”

The complainant JC in counts 1 and 2 is not the same person as the complainant JC in counts 24 and 25.


	
	As to these offences generally, his Honour said:
	


“It is well recognised that sexual crimes can lead to psychological upset, confusion and difficulties later in life. Here each child was in their own way vulnerable. All looked up to the offender. He preyed on their vulnerabilities, which were known to him. He, I find, presumed that confusion, shame and embarrassment would inhibit complaint and that because of his position and their vulnerabilities they would not complain. He was right.

Sexual abuse of children was and remains of grave concern to the community and the courts. Children should grow up free of such crimes. Serious and repeated sexual interference with children calls for substantial punishment, particularly where, as here, trust and in some cases a position of authority was abused. Had some of the indecent assault matters occurred in isolation a gaol sentence might have been avoided but these offences did not occur in isolation. They were part of a pattern of offending involving exploitation of multiple child victims over two decades.

While the offender will only be punished for the crimes specifically before the Court for sentence his behaviour in securing the compliance of his victims deserves condemnation. There is, for offences which involve such a manipulation of children, a community expectation that they merit severe punishment. That said, however, a proper purpose for the criminal law is not to give effect to the irrational prejudices of ill informed public opinion, see Justice McHugh in Ryan v R (2001) 206 CLR 267 cited in Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [40] ((sic) [42]).”


	
	Later, his Honour said:
	


“Each complainant in evidence exhibited obvious distress, not only in regard to what was done to them at the time but also at having to return to what was for them clearly a distasteful and disturbing event Their disgust at the accused’s denials of committing offences toward them was palpable as they gave their evidence.

While the offender is not to be punished for exercising his right to trial the continuing impact of his offending behaviour of each of his victims should never be underestimated. A Court in sentencing any offender must recognise the harm that their offending caused.”

The second indictment


	
	As I have said, the second indictment charged two offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty: possessing child abuse material and disseminating child abuse material, each an offence under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	There was an agreed statement of facts, which can be summarised relatively briefly. On 1 December 2011, police executed a search warrant at the respondent’s home, then at Glen Alpine. A large variety of child abuse material was found. On computers a large number of photos and videos amounting to child pornography were found. As to the photos, there were over 7,000 images containing child pornography or child abuse material. A large number of them depicted young boys, both clothed and naked, being caned. There were 280 videos containing child abuse material. The photos and videos embraced material of a gravity within each of the five categories of the Child Exploitation Tracking Scheme (CETS).
	
	
	Police also found a little over 2,500 printed photographs depicting young boys, naked or in various stages of undress. Some showed the boys being caned or spanked. Some of these photos had been downloaded from the internet, but others had been taken by the respondent, including photos of victims of the trial offences.
	
	
	Police also found 13 written “stories”, describing in explicit detail the sexual pleasure to be derived from caning young boys, particularly on the naked buttocks. Some went on to describe sexual experiences subsequent to the caning, ranging from homosexual experiences between boys to anal intercourse between adults and boys, as well as boys being tied and caned and subjected to sexual abuse. Most of these stories were within category five on the CETS scale, as they depicted sexual sadism. Others were categorised as two to three on the scale.
	
	
	Also found were two books described as “punishment books”, detailing chastisement of boys with a cane, strap or paddle for various “offences”, such as disobedience, stealing, talking in class, and smoking. In addition, three personal diaries were found providing additional detail about the incidents in the punishment books, and describing the respondent caning particular boys, fondling their genitalia, being himself caned by boys, and generally fantasising about the boys in the punishment books. As I understand it, this material included the notebooks recording the caning of boys referred to in relation to the trial offences. Finally, police located a “consent form” purporting to be available for signature by boys prepared to agree to a variety of corporal punishments set out in the document.
	
	
	All this material, apparently accumulated over many years, constituted the child abuse material the subject of the first count. As to the second count, disseminating child pornography, police located email communications between the respondent and a man in America in the later part of 2006. There were multiple emails, including photos, of a sexual nature, demonstrating a homosexual interest in boys in their early teens, including caning. In these communications the respondent pretended to be a teenage boy.
	
	
	The offence on the Form 1, taken into account on sentence for the first count, was possession of prohibited weapons without a permit: s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act. During the search of the respondent’s home police also found six handcuffs and an extendable baton. He had no licence or authority to possess those items.
	
	
	In the light of the material found at his home, his Honour was satisfied that the respondent derived sexual pleasure from the corporal punishment inflicted on the victims of the relevant trial offences. The respondent conceded in evidence at the trial that he fantasised about the administration of corporal punishment, to which, he acknowledged, there might be a sexual element. His Honour accepted that some of the written material relating to corporal punishment was the product of fantasy – in particular, the stories to which I have referred – but was satisfied that other material recorded real events. He acknowledged the policy of criminalising acts of fantasy of this kind, referring to the judgment of Howie J in Jarrold v R [2010] NSWCCA 69, but added:
	


“I do not regard fantasy communications or fantasy documents as being as serious as those involving actual children but even fantasies produce a distorted view of reality in which sex with children is somehow seen as appropriate.

Here my main focus must be on the number and type of images of real children possessed by the offender, and the number and nature disseminated by him.”


	
	His Honour had regard to the matters relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences of possessing or disseminating child pornography considered by R A Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140, 201 A Crim R 243, at [81]-[95] (257-261). He emphasised the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for crimes of this kind, noting that prior good character is entitled only to limited weight as a mitigating factor. He discounted the sentence for each count by 15% in recognition of late pleas of guilty.
	


Subjective case


	
	Born on 20 September 1962, the respondent was aged between 28 and 49 over the period of his offending (from June 1991 to December 2011). He is now 52. He has a minor criminal history, relating to his failure to maintain a firearms register (presumably arising from his involvement in the security industry). His Honour treated him as a person of prior good character. He added, however, that that factor was not entitled to significant weight, given the pattern of repeat offending over a period of time during which he “used his position in the community to further his own sexual gratification.”
	
	
	As I have said, the respondent’s employment at relevant times was as a security officer. He had formerly been an officer of the Australian Federal Police. Because of that background, and the nature of his offences, he had been on protection in conditions of “non-association” and “limited association.” His Honour noted that they are harsher regimes for any prisoner, and found that he would probably spend the bulk of his sentence in some form of protection. His Honour also accepted that a fear of physical attack upon him because of his status as an ex-police officer and a child sex offender would continue “to prey upon him.”
	
	
	His Honour also took into account evidence that the respondent has a number of medical problems, which were likely to increase during his time in custody.
	


Other sentencing issues


	
	His Honour considered the related issues of accumulation, concurrence and totality, with reference to relevant authority. He recognised the need for at least partial accumulation in a case where an offender stands for sentence for “separate and discrete criminal acts.” He added:
	


“Courts must always be cautious in accumulating sentences because of the compounding impact of long sentences. Each year in gaol has a greater impact on any person than the year preceding it. Sentences should not crush any hope or desire for rehabilitation that a prisoner might belatedly feel … .

The impression, however, should never be given that there is some kind of discount for multiple offending … . A court must maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed.”


	
	His Honour related that last sentence to a case, such as the present, involving multiple offences against different victims. Turning to the issue of the non-parole period, he said:
	


“The aggregate non-parole period here must reflect the minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the crimes call for such a detention … . All the purposes of sentencing relate both to the parole and non-parole portions of a sentence but these purposes are given different weight because the parts of a sentence themselves serve different purposes … .”


	
	His Honour had regard to the age of the offences, and the changes in the sentencing regime over the long period during which they were committed. The first seven offences, committed between 1991 and 1999, were subject to the Sentencing Act 1989. The remaining offences were governed by the current legislation, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which came into force in April 2000. (The eighth offence, committed between January 2000 and December 2001 spans those periods.) That said, with the exception of counts 4 and 5, under s 66C(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, which has since been replaced, the maximum sentences have not changed. The remaining offences (counts 9 to 25), committed between 2001 and 2011, are either aggravated sexual assault under s 61J(1) or aggravated indecent assault under s 61M(1). Of those the last nine, committed between 2007 and 2011, attract a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In the District Court the respondent was represented by Mr Scragg of counsel, who also appeared in this court. His Honour noted Mr Scragg’s submission that a number of the trial offences were “historical”, requiring the imposition of a lesser sentence than might be expected now. Reference was made to the judgment of Button J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50, a case involving sentences for historical sexual offences, albeit very much older than those in the present case. Button J dealt with this issue at [82] ff. In this court Mr Scragg focused upon the following passage at [127]-[129]:
	


“[127]   The fifth factor is judicial memory. Bell JA referred to it in Featherstone v R, when her Honour said at [45]:

‘[T]his review of a small sample of cases involving broadly similar sexual offences does support the applicant's submission that there has been a significant upward trend in the length of sentences for offences of this character in recent years. It is an impression that accords with my recollection of the pattern of sentencing for sexual offences before the introduction of the Sentencing Act.’

[128]   RS Hulme J referred to it in PWB v R, when His Honour said at [68]:

‘Although as I have said, the Applicant was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards applicable at the time of his offending, in the case of the second offence, 1991, it is not easy to determine what those standards were. I have no difficulty in accepting that they were more lenient than at present. This has been recognised in Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71 at [45]; McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48 at [62]; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147 at [176] and accords with my own recollection of events. However, such recognition provides no indication of what the standards were.’

[129]   My impression is identical to that of Bell JA and RS Hulme J: sentences have indeed increased for serious sexual      offences over the past quarter century, in some cases markedly. The concession made in this Court by the Crown Prosecutor, who happens to be a most experienced practitioner in the area of criminal law, lends support to my recollection.”


	
	His Honour accepted Button J’s analysis, while adding that it did not convey that categorisation of an offence as “historical” necessarily meant that a lesser sentence was required. However, relevantly for the present case, he perceived a general increase in sentences in respect of offences for which a non-parole period had been prescribed, citing a passage from a Judicial Commission publication in 2010, Impact of Standard Non-Parole Periods, Research Monograph 33:
	


“Generally the impact of these provisions on sentencing has been to increase both terms of sentence and non-parole periods for standard non-period offence.”


	
	His Honour found special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the ratio between sentence and non-parole period, although acknowledging that it should only be “relatively modest.” Special circumstances were found because of the measure of accumulation of sentence which he proposed, together with the need to help the respondent adjust to normal community life after a lengthy period in custody. His Honour noted that he would need sex offender programs while in custody and, upon his release, would “also need to be closely supervised and, in my opinion, the longer the better.”
	


The appeal


	
	The principal ground of the appeal is that the total sentence, including the effective non-parole period, is manifestly inadequate. The other grounds are for the most part particulars of that ground. In summary, they assert the following:
	



	
	The aggregate sentence for the trial offences is manifestly inadequate, having regard to the totality of criminality involved, and the non-parole period is inadequate to reflect the criminality of those offences.
	
	
	Each of the sentences for the offences on the second indictment is inadequate, noting that the sentence for the first count had to reflect the offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	The 15% discount for the pleas of guilty to the offences on the second indictment is excessive, given the timing of those pleas.
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding special circumstances, so as to ameliorate the total effective non-parole period.
	
	
	The degree of accumulation of the aggregate sentence upon the sentences for the offences on the second indictment is inadequate, failing to reflect the totality of the criminality of all the offences.
	


The aggregate sentence


	
	As to the aggregate sentence, the Crown prosecutor in this court submitted that the indicated sentences for the various offences conveyed that his Honour had not given appropriate consideration to the maximum penalty and, where applicable, the prescribed standard non-parole period for each of them. He acknowledged that the indicative sentences were not themselves appellable, but relied upon authority that a sentencing judge must assess the criminality of the individual offences and that an erroneous approach demonstrated in an indicated sentence may reveal error in the aggregate sentence: R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, per Grove AJ (with whom Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreed) at [17].
	
	
	I do not understand the Crown prosecutor to have argued that his Honour failed to have regard to the maximum sentences or applicable standard non-parole periods. His Honour said in his remarks, “Careful attention to maximum penalties and where applicable, standard non-parole periods, is always required.” He went on to develop that proposition, referring to Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2006) 228 CLR 357. Rather, the Crown prosecutor’s argument was that his Honour appears to have given inadequate weight to those factors in arriving at the indicative sentence for each offence.
	
	
	That argument was not developed by reference to the indicative sentences individually. They are to be found in the table set out at [10] above. They range from 6 months (for several of the offences of indecent assault by caning the victims) to 8 years for anal intercourse with the last of the victims. Non-parole periods are also indicated for the offences carrying a standard non-parole period, ranging from 9 months (for a caning offence) to 6 years (for the anal intercourse). In my view, an examination of the indicative sentences in the table demonstrates careful attention to the gravity of each crime, having regard to the widely varying circumstances of them. None of them appear to me to demonstrate an erroneous assessment of their criminality.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this court provided Judicial Commission statistics of full time custodial sentences imposed for the trial offences. He did so acknowledging the caution which this court has consistently urged in the use of that material, reiterated recently by Bellew J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreed) in MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183, particularly at [44]-[46]. The statistics relate to the offences under the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act: s 61J(1) and s 61M(1) (both before and after the introduction of the relevant standard non-parole periods), s 61I and s 66C(2). The Crown prosecutor relied upon these figures in respect of all the offences, even though they cover the period from 2007 to 2014, embracing only counts 16-25.
	
	
	There are statistics for head sentences and non-parole periods in respect of all offenders. However, for the offences which do not carry a standard non-parole period only the head sentences are relevant. I do not propose to summarise these figures. As one would expect, they show a wide range of sentences for each of the relevant offences and, in relation to the offences carrying a standard non-parole period, an equally wide range of non-parole periods. There is also a considerable variety in the number of cases upon which they are based.
	
	
	These figures provide no useful guidance in assessing his Honour’s indicative sentences. I might add that, with three exceptions, all those sentences fall within the ranges disclosed by the statistics. The three exceptions are counts 20, 21 and 23, indecent assaults by caning the complainant. For each of those the indicative sentence was 6 months. However, there is force in Mr Scragg’s submission that those offences in isolation would not necessarily have warranted a full time custodial sentence.
	
	
	The question remains whether the aggregate sentence, including the non-parole period, adequately reflects the overall criminality of the trial offences. To this I shall return.
	


The child pornography offences


	
	Turning to the child pornography offences, it will be recalled that for the possession offence, taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 ½ years, and for the dissemination offence a fixed term of 1 year and 3 months. In this court the Crown prosecutor treated both terms as equivalent to the non-parole periods of sentences which might otherwise have been imposed. Noting the 15% discount for the pleas of guilty, he pointed out that the undiscounted figures would have been 3 years and 1 year and 6 months respectively. Given the level of criminality of both offences and the maximum sentence for each of them of 10 years imprisonment, and noting that the sentence for the first count embraced the criminality of the offence of possessing prohibited weapons, he argued that each sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor took issue with his Honour’s observation (quoted at [18] above) that he did not regard fantasy communications or documents as seriously as those involving actual children, citing Jarrold v R (supra). That case involved charges, among others, of producing child pornography arising from internet communications between the offender and other men in which he described sexual activity between himself and children. The sentencing judge had found that this material was the product of fantasy rather than real events (although he recognised the gravity of the dissemination of perverted material of that kind). It was in this context that Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) made the observation at [53]:
	


“Whether or not the material discussed in the communications was the result of fantasies or accounts of actual events was irrelevant. If there was evidence to prove these events actually happened, other charges might have been brought against the respondent. If his Honour’s finding was made in order to diminish the seriousness of the offences, then he was in error.”


	
	Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124 was an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case in respect of child pornography offences. Some of the material comprised text messages sent by the applicant to another man describing his fantasies of engaging in sexual acts with boys. As in the present case, the sentencing judge had expressed the view that those communications were not as serious as they would have been if they described real events, although they remained serious because they produced a distorted view of reality in which sex with children was seen as appropriate. In the Court of Criminal Appeal the leading judgment was given by Beech-Jones J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed). In relation to this issue Beech-Jones J said at [54]-[55]:
	


“[54]   However, the applicant also contended that the ‘fantasy’ nature of the material meant that its production and dissemination was less serious than the material depicting sexual activity involving actual children, and the fact that it was it was only a communication between two persons via SMS meant that ‘other people’ would not be likely to view it.

[55]   In relation to the former contention it was one that his Honour accepted in this case although his Honour noted that a different approach was adopted by Howie J in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [53]. I see no error in his Honour's characterisation of the material in this case. However each case depends on its facts. There are undoubtedly situations in which the production and dissemination of material that does not involve the depiction of real children can still constitute an extremely serious breach of s 91H(2).”


	
	Both those cases were concerned with the dissemination of child pornography and, plainly enough, communication to others of material of this kind is a serious matter even if it is the product of fantasy. In the present case it appears to me that his Honour’s observation about fantasy was directed primarily, if not entirely, to some of the material the subject of the possession charge. While his Honour’s observation about fantasy was expressed to relate to “communications or fantasy documents”, it was made early in the remarks on sentence before he turned to the facts of the child pornography offences and it has the character of a statement of general principle. Later, when considering the facts of the offences, he said of the respondent:
	


“I accept he did fantasise about caning and he did invent the stories in the ‘punishment books.’ Given the diaries included ordinary events, however, I do not accept his assertion that those parts relating to caning and which could be regarded as admissions were in fact fantasy. They, like the captions on the photographs in the punishment books, may have been in part fantasy but they also held a kernel of truth.”


	
	That said, the emails the subject of the dissemination charge did describe homosexual activity with teenage boys which included caning. Whether his Honour’s finding about a measure of fantasy extended to those communications is unclear. However, even if they did, the statement of Howie J in Jarrold should not be understood as one of universal application. I respectfully agree with the flexible, case by case, approach expressed by Beech-Jones J in Martin.
	
	
	In relation to these offences also, the Crown prosecutor sought to support his submission that they are inadequate by reference to Judicial Commission statistics in relation to offences under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. These again focus on cases in which full time custodial sentences were passed, but here after a plea of guilty. They cover the period from January 2009 to March 2014. Head sentences range from 6 months to 6 years (a sample of 46 cases), and non-parole periods from 6 months to 2 years (a sample of 19 cases). Here also, the figures do not assist in evaluating the sentences passed in the present case. Certainly, given that those fixed terms should be viewed as equivalent to non-parole periods, the figures do not demonstrate that either of them is manifestly inadequate.
	


The pleas of guilty


	
	In relation to the child pornography offences, the Crown prosecutor also submitted that the discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty is excessive. Those pleas were not entered until the day fixed for trial. Reference was made to the familiar passage from the judgment of Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, 195 A Crim R 1, at [31] (9):
	


“As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range.”


	
	His Honour found the pleas to have had “some utilitarian value.” It seems that the fact that they were entered so late arose from their inclusion in the same indictment as the trial counts but, in my view, nothing turns on this. The fact remains that what Howie J had to say in Borkowski was no more than a guide to the exercise of an undoubted discretion and is not prescriptive. There is no basis on which it could be said that the discount applied by his Honour was beyond the bounds of the legitimate exercise of his discretion.
	
	
	In this court the Crown prosecutor submitted that the discount should have been no more than 10%, without conceding that it should have been that high. The practical effect of this dispute is a difference of no more than a matter of months. This ground of appeal is without substance.
	


Special circumstances


	
	In relation to the aggregate sentence for the trial offences, the Crown prosecutor challenged his Honour’s finding of special circumstances and the extent of the reduction of the non-parole period from the statutory proportion of that account. He acknowledged that the accumulation of the aggregate sentence on the sentences for the child pornography offences justified some reduction, but only such as would maintain a proportion of 75% between the effective non-parole period and the total sentence. That reduction would be modest because the accumulation was only by 6 months. In fact, the total sentence of 14 ½ years and the effective non-parole period of 9 ½ years left a period of parole eligibility of 5 years.
	
	
	The application of the 75% ratio to the total sentence would have produced an effective non-parole period of about 10 years and 11 months, leaving a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months. The Crown prosecutor noted that, apart from accumulation, his Honour found special circumstances in the respondent’s need to adjust to community life after a lengthy period in custody and to be closely supervised for “the longer the better.” He referred to cl 218(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulations 2014, which limits the period during which a parole order may require an offender to be subject to supervision to 3 years. Thus, he argued, the application of the statutory proportion would provide a period of eligibility more than sufficient to meet the purpose of supervision.
	
	
	However, as Mr Scragg pointed out, the respondent’s parole would not come to an end when supervision was terminated. For the remainder of the balance of his term he would still be subject to the sanction of parole, whereby his rehabilitation and the protection of the community would continue to be fostered. There is ample authority for the proposition that a finding of special circumstances, and the measure by which it is reflected in the length of the non-parole period, are matters of discretionary judgment although, of course, guided by principle: see, for example, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, 53 NSWLR 704.
	
	
	That said, in Simpson Spigelman CJ reminded us at [63] (718) that “there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.” The Crown’s primary complaint in the present case is that the effective non-parole period does not achieve that end.
	


Accumulation/Manifest Inadequacy? 


	
	It is the issue of accumulation that gives rise to the Crown’s primary complaint about the total sentence. The asserted inadequacy of that sentence is said to arise from the lack of an appropriate measure of accumulation. The Crown prosecutor argued that the 14 year aggregate sentence for the trial offences is the result of inadequate accumulation of the indicative sentences. He noted that the sentences for the child pornography offences were directed to be served concurrently, and that they were accumulated upon the aggregate sentence for the trial offences only by 6 months. He submitted that there should have been partial accumulation of the sentences for the child pornography offences and a greater measure of accumulation of those sentences upon the aggregate sentence. The result, he argued, is an overall sentence inadequate to mark the totality of the respondent’s criminality.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor referred us to two decisions of this court dealing with sentence for offending of this kind, again acknowledging the line of authority, also referred to by Bellew J in MLP at [40] ff, that reference to other cases can only be of limited assistance. These were R v Woods [2009] NSWCCA 55, 195 A Crim R 173 and, more importantly, R v Gommeson [2014] NSWCCA 159, both of them Crown appeals. In both cases the respondent had pleaded guilty. The Crown prosecutor did not take us to the facts and circumstances, or the reasoning of the court, in either of those cases, but relied upon them generally as some indication of an appropriate range of sentence.
	
	
	In Woods the respondent had committed a large number of sexual offences, of varying degrees of gravity, upon three boys during two discrete periods in 2005 and 2007. He had also shown the boys pornographic films. A Crown appeal succeeded and sentences totalling 9 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 6 ½ years were passed, but after a discount of 40% for the respondent’s early pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities in the investigation of the matter.
	
	
	In Gommeson the respondent was dealt with for 19 sexual offences committed against seven boys, aged between 9 and 16, over a period between early 2005 and late 2011. There were 11 further offences of that kind on a Form 1. In relation to some of the boys the charges were representative counts, being part of a continuing pattern of abuse. He also showed the boys pornographic videos. He was also dealt with for a charge of possessing child abuse material, being photographs he had taken of his victims. In the District Court he had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 8 ½ years. Re-sentence after a successful Crown appeal led to an overall sentence of 17 years with an effective non-parole period of 12 years.
	
	
	The error found by the Court of Criminal Appeal was an inadequate measure of accumulation of the individual sentences. Johnson J, with whom Harrison and Garling JJ agreed, reviewed authority on the issue of accumulation at [106] ff. In particular, at [114] his Honour referred to the need in cases involving several victims to ensure a proper level of accumulation “to guard against a view that, in reality, there is virtually no penalty at all imposed for sexual offences committed against one or more victims”: citing his own judgment in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302.
	
	
	Neither Woods nor Gommeson involved the use of the aggregate sentence procedure under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the present case it was used. As I have said, the indicative sentences ranged from 6 months to 8 years. Plainly enough, there was a significant measure of accumulation to arrive at the aggregate term of 14 years. It should also be noted that Gommeson did not involve “historic child sex offences being dealt with long after the commission of the offences”: Johnson J at [88]. In the present case a number of the earlier offences did fall into that category and, as I have said, his Honour took that matter into account.
	
	
	Woods and Gommeson turned on their own facts, as does the present case. I have referred to his Honour’s remarks on sentence comprehensively, including quoting significant passages from it, to demonstrate the thoroughness with which he approached the matter. The remarks betray a careful assessment of the objective features of the case, and an equally careful examination of the sentencing issues which arose with reference to relevant principles. This included the issue of accumulation in which, of course, the question of totality loomed large. This was a difficult sentencing task, involving a determination of the appropriate punishment for offences extending over a lengthy period, affected by different sentencing regimes and patterns of sentence.
	
	
	All this the Crown prosecutor fairly acknowledged. Nevertheless, he maintained his submission that the total sentence and the effective non-parole period are inadequate. I am not so persuaded. Since preparing these reasons I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Schmidt J, and I acknowledge the force of her Honour’s observations about the gravity of these offences. Nevertheless, the sentencing outcome is a substantial overall sentence and effective non-parole period. It may fairly be seen as lenient, but I remain of the view that it does not call for this court’s intervention on a Crown appeal. Schmidt J has referred to the recent decision of the High Court in CMB v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] HCA 9. The well established principles governing Crown appeals were restated in that case by French CJ and Gageler J at [35], and need not be repeated here.
	
	
	I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	PRICE J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the draft judgments of Hidden J and Schmidt J. I agree with Hidden J that the overall sentence and effective non-parole period may be regarded as lenient, but as his Honour points out that does not call for this Court’s intervention on appeal. After profound deliberation, I am not persuaded by the Crown that there is an appealable error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Accordingly, I find myself in disagreement with Schmidt J’s conclusion of manifest inadequacy of the aggregate sentence for the trial offences, the sentence for the child abuse material offences and the overall sentence.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In this case I find myself in disagreement with Hidden J, who has come to the conclusion that there was no error in his Honour’s assessment of the criminality involved in any of Mr Feuerstein’s individual offences, in the aggregate sentence imposed for the trial offences, or in the overall sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was sentenced for 23 separate sexual offences against young boys, having been charged with 25 counts, of which he was found guilty at trial of 21 and having entered a late plea to 2 others: one count of possessing child abuse material and another of disseminating such material. The earliest of his offences was committed in 1991. They came to light after execution of a search warrant at his home in December 2011, after the latest and most serious of his sexual abuse offences, involving anal intercourse while his victim was asleep.
	
	
	In CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9, Heydon JA’s observations in R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at [12], in relation to Crown appeals were referred to with approval at [33] - [34]:
	


""if [the Court of Criminal Appeal] is to accede to the Crown's desire that the respondent be sentenced more heavily, it must surmount two hurdles. The first is to locate an appellable error in the sentencing judge's discretionary decision. The second is to negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised.""


	
	The purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence. As discussed in CMB at [35], Crown appeals should be brought only to establish some matter of principle, which is to be understood as “encompassing what is necessary to avoid ... manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards” (drawn from Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; (1994) CLR 295 at 300) and to afford an opportunity for this Court to perform its proper function in laying down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts.
	
	
	In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, it was observed at [42], however, that cases might arise where the Court concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked, that it amounts to ""an affront to the administration of justice"" which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case the Court is justified in interfering with the sentence. Whether this is such a case here arises for consideration.
	
	
	This appeal raised manifest inadequacy in the context of the imposition of an aggregate sentence imposed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for a considerable number of child sex offences committed against 7 victims, over the course of some 20 years and in respect of the sentences imposed for offences involving possession and dissemination of child abuse material, a significant amount of which fell into the highest categories of seriousness.
	
	
	The eight grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown raise inadequacy in the aggregate sentence imposed for the 21 trial offences; an inadequate total non-parole period for the totality of the offending; error in granting a 15% discount for the late plea; manifestly inadequate sentences imposed for the child abuse offences; error in providing only a 6 month partial accumulation for the sentence imposed for child abuse material possession offence; error in making the sentence for the dissemination offence completely concurrent with that imposed for the possession offence; error in the finding of special circumstances; and manifest inadequacy of the overall sentence.
	


The parties’ cases


	
	The Crown’s case was that while a significant total sentence of 14 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months, was imposed, because of a number of errors in this complex sentencing exercise, the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate, given the totality of the criminality of Mr Feuerstein’s offending.
	
	
	Neither party challenged his Honour’s factual findings in relation to the trial offences, but Mr Feuerstein did not accept all of his Honour’s conclusions as to the objective seriousness of various of his offences.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s case was that his Honour had properly applied all the applicable sentencing principles which bound him; that the indicative sentences were not unduly lenient; and that both the aggregate sentence and overall sentence imposed were the result of the proper exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. It was also relevant that some of his individual offences would not have attracted a custodial sentence, had they been standalone offences.
	
	
	On Mr Feuerstein’s case there was no error in his Honour’s fact finding and that the sentence imposed properly reflected the totality of the criminality involved in his offending, as well as paying proper attention to the evidence of his subjective circumstances. The total sentence was proportionate to the total criminality of his offending and was the result of the proper application of the principle of totality. The sentence imposed was well within sentence patterns revealed by the statistics and individual indicative sentences were within the available ranges. Matters of accumulation and concurrence were within the sentencing judge’s discretion and there had been no error in his Honour’s approach, warranting the Court’s intervention on appeal, including in relation to the question of special circumstances and the need for supervision.
	
	
	On Mr Feuerstein’s approach, in the circumstances of his case, even if error were established the Court would exercise its residual discretion, particularly given the difficult circumstances under which he must serve his sentence. The Court would not tinker with the lengthy sentence already imposed upon him and in the circumstances, even if error were found, the Court would exercise its residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed upon him.
	


There was error in this sentencing exercise


	
	What reveals manifest inadequacy of a sentence which is out of the range of sentences that could have been imposed for particular offending, is a consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence (see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [60]).
	
	
	In Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 it was explained at [227] that when an aggregate sentence is imposed:
	


“... it must be remembered that the indicative head sentences cannot be the subject of an appeal to this Court. It is only the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of an appeal. It follows that it is not a matter of this Court analysing each indicative sentence and determining whether it is erroneous. Rather, it is a matter of looking at the whole of the sentencing structure in order to determine whether the aggregate sentence can stand or not.”


	
	Nevertheless, an erroneous approach at the stage that specific indicative sentences are set, may reveal error in the aggregate sentenced reached (see R v Clarke [2013] NSWCCA 260 at [56]).
	
	
	In this case, after giving indicative sentences for the 21 trial offences, Haesler DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence of 14 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years, commencing on 1 June 2012 and expiring on 31 May 2021. The sentence expires on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	I consider that this aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate, for reasons which I will explain.
	
	
	That aggregate sentence was then partially accumulated on the sentence imposed for the possession of child abuse material offence, for which a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months was imposed after a 15% discount, taking into account the Form 1 weapons offence. That sentence commenced on 1 December 2011 and expired on 31 May 2014. The sentence for the dissemination of child abuse material offence was a wholly concurrent term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 December 2011 and expiring on 28 February 2013. Those sentences were accepted on appeal as reflecting the non-parole period imposed for each of those offences.
	
	
	Given the gravity of the child abuse material possession offence, I consider that the sentence imposed for that offence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein was the result of his Honour’s application of the principle of totality and the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I also consider that his Honour erred in the application of the principle of totality. The result of his approach to questions of concurrence and accumulation was that for the entirety of the applicant’s objectively grave offending, a non-parole period totalling only 9 years and 6 months and a total sentence of 14 years and 6 months was imposed. That was only 6 months longer than what was already an erroneously lenient aggregate sentence, for the 21 trial offences.
	
	
	The result was that the overall sentence was also manifestly inadequate and below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for these offences, consistently with applicable sentencing standards (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [24]).
	


The aggregate sentence


	
	In my view, the conclusion which Haesler DCJ reached failed to give effect to the sentencing principles which he was bound to apply, even though his Honour made extensive reference to those principles, including those which apply to historical sexual offences discussed in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50. As Button J there observed at [82], that judgment “says nothing about appropriate sentences for such offences committed today, or in the more recent past”.
	
	
	His Honour proceeded on the basis that there was a notable increase in sentences imposed after the introduction of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) and a general increase after the introduction of standard non-parole periods for some offences in 2003. The earliest of Mr Feuerstein’s offences were committed in 1991.
	
	
	His Honour noted that many of the trial offences had come to light after police found the material which became the subject of the child abuse material charges at Mr Feuerstein’s home and investigated what was thereby revealed. His Honour considered that the jury had accepted the Crown case on each count to be overwhelming. He found that while individual sentences had to be imposed for each offence, the collective impact of the offences on the victims could not be underestimated and that the Court had to recognise the harm which this offending had caused them.
	
	
	His Honour noted that each offence had occurred on a separate occasion; that where a sentence for one offence can impact the criminality of another, the sentences should be served concurrently, but that otherwise there should be at least partial accumulation to reflect the separate and distinct criminal acts committed. Care had to be taken, however, because of the compounding impact of long sentences. Nevertheless, the impression could not be given that there was some kind of discount for Mr Feuerstein’s multiple offending.
	
	
	These were undoubtedly difficult considerations to reconcile in this case. As his Honour also observed, in a case of multiple offences and different victims, the approach discussed in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 must be adhered to. That is, the final aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence, must result in a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved. That was not achieved in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The evidence at trial to which Haesler DCJ referred in his sentencing remarks, which shed light on the criminality involved in Mr Feuerstein’s offending, revealed that he had a sadistic sexual interest in young boys. His youngest victim was aged 8 years. His offences took place between 1991 and 2011. In 2011 he came to the attention of police who investigated, with the result that there the child abuse material was discovered, which led the police to other victims.
	
	
	By that time, the seriousness of his offending had increased to the point where Mr Feuerstein’s last offence involved anal intercourse with a sleeping child. The 21 trial offences had each involved young boys, who Mr Feuerstein knew to be vulnerable for various reasons. He manipulated his victims in various different ways, in order to put them into the position where he was able to commit serious offences upon each of them. Many of these offences involved caning, some resulting in physical injury. That was an aspect of those offences which had to be taken into account on sentencing. In some cases the young victims were given alcohol. In others they were drugged. Mr Feuerstein kept written and in some cases photographic records of what he did to his victims. He also wrote stories fantasising about what he had done and wished to do. From those records it would appear that there were other victims.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was at one time a police officer. For many years he worked as a security guard. He finally obtained work as a youth case worker with a reputable youth support agency, in order, his Honour found, to gain access to young boys, he having lied about his good character and interest in the welfare of young people. It was then that the offences against JC, his final victim, were committed. In 2011, while JC was at Mr Feuerstein’s home, in abuse of his position and the result of pressure and bribes, he made JC suck his penis (count 24). On a later night JC woke to find that Mr Feuerstein had placed his penis inside his anus, albeit for only a short period, because he objected (count 25).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for both these s 61J offences was 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10. In R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, the effect of the introduction of the standard non-parole period was explained generally to be increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies. They became one of the statutory guideposts which had to be taken into account in the case of such offences, together with the maximum penalty for the offence (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]).
	
	
	For the fellatio offence the indicative sentence was 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. By comparison, for the anal intercourse offence the indicative sentence was 8 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years. The latter was a very lenient a sentence in the circumstances, given the victim’s age; the breach of trust involved in the abuse of Mr Feuerstein’s position of authority; and that it has long been recognised that an offence of this kind is further aggravated by the degrading nature of anal intercourse, even though such an offence, in any circumstance is, of its nature, always degrading. (see R v Russell (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 21 June 1996 unrep) These were all factors which had to be taken into account in assessing where this particular sexual assault offence lay on the spectrum or scale of seriousness (see Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447).
	
	
	There were six other victims involved in Mr Feuerstein’s 19 other trial offences. The indicative sentences imposed for those offences ranged from 6 months, for three offences committed in 2007, when Mr Feuerstein caned JK (counts 20, 21 and 23), to 5 years for the anal intercourse offence against JD in 1998 (count 6) and 4 years for the first fellatio offence committed against JC (a different victim), in 1991 (count 1).
	
	
	There were no standard non-parole periods applying to Mr Feuerstein’s offences, before those committed in 2007. Counts 1 and 6 each attracted maximum penalties of 20 years. The 1991 offence against JC, then aged 12 or 13, occurred when he stayed overnight at Mr Feuerstein’s home. He was given drink and a “red pill” and later woke to find Mr Feuerstein sucking his penis. He passed out and when he woke again, found that Mr Feuerstein had ejaculated on his chest. The 1998 anal intercourse offence, involved Mr Feuerstein paying JD, then aged 14.
	
	
	The caning offences against JK each attracted a maximum penalty of 7 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. They included counts 19 and 22, when JK was caned on his bare buttocks, a sentence of 1 year, with a non-parole period of 9 months were imposed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed also encompassed 19 other offences, involving 4 other victims, for which the indicative sentences ranged from 4 years to 6 months.
	
	
	The result of his Honour’s approach was that, notwithstanding the indicative sentences given for these 21, separate offences involving 7 different victims, an aggregate non-parole period of only 9 years and a total sentence of 14, was imposed. Given the criminality involved in all of this offending; the serious criminality involved in some of the individual offences, reflected in the higher indicative sentences given; and Mr Feuerstein's significant moral culpability for what he did, notwithstanding the evidence as to his subjective circumstances, the conditions under which he would serve his sentence and the conclusions which his Honour reached as to special circumstances, the error in his Honour’s conclusion as to that aggregate sentence is, in my view, manifest.
	
	
	As his Honour observed, the total non-parole period finally imposed had to reflect the minimum period of actual incarceration that Mr Feuerstein had to spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his crimes and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629).
	
	
	The 9 year non-parole period was in my view an insufficient minimum period of incarceration, for the overall criminality involved in this serious offending. That error was compounded by his Honour’s approach to the sentences imposed for the two offences to which pleas were entered and to the application of the principle of totality, in arriving at an overall sentence for the entirety of Mr Feuerstein’s offending.
	


The child abuse material offences


	
	In his sentencing remarks, his Honour did not refer to the agreed facts, which revealed how very serious the two offences to which Mr Feuerstein entered his late pleas were.
	
	
	The agreed facts revealed that the electronic material found at Mr Feuerstein’s home in December 2011 included some 37,000 still images and 800 videos falling into every category of the Child Exploitation Tracking Scheme, including category 4, (depicting penetrative sexual activity between children and adults) and category 5, (depicting sadism, bestiality or humiliation).
	
	
	The print material was some 2,507 images of boys aged between 8 and 12 years in various stages of undress or naked, taken at Mr Feuerstein’s residence. Some of these images had been downloaded from the internet. Others were taken by Mr Feuerstein and had notations written on them, with dates and descriptions. There were photos of boys with their penises and buttocks exposed, some with welt marks from caning. Some were taken without the children being aware.
	
	
	The bulk of the 13 written stories found by police were categorised as level 5, the rest 2 and 3. There was also a punishment book found, recording punishment Mr Feuerstein had administered, listing 29 different boys ranging from 9 to 18 years, but mainly aged 12 to 13. It recorded the number of cane strokes administered and where. One was dated from December 1999 to February 2009. The other from January 2001 to February 2009. Three personal diaries provided further information about these incidents, including fondling boys’ genitals, as well as fantasies about the boys in the punishment books. The agreed facts provided examples of these entries. A consent form designed to be signed by boys who were to be caned, was also found.
	
	
	The dissemination charge related to email communications of a sexual nature between August and September 2006 to a male in the United States, in which naked pictures of identified victims and others were provided.
	
	
	The Form 1 weapons offence related to six handcuffs and an extendable baton also found at Mr Feuerstein’s home. Ten canes of varying lengths and thicknesses were also found there, but were not the subject of this charge.
	
	
	For the late plea entered to these two offences a 15% discount was given, Haesler DCJ concluding that “there was still some utilitarian value in them”. That was plainly a very favourable result, given that it was observed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2009] NSWCCA 309 at [65] per Spigelman CJ at [154] - [156] and [160] that there should be a discount towards the bottom of the range for late pleas such as those entered on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. There was nothing of that kind here.
	
	
	His Honour considered that these two offences were of considerable gravity and moral culpability, noting that there were actual children used in the depictions, with over 1000 falling within the two worst categories. He considered that general deterrence was important in sentencing for these offences. He also considered it relevant that some of the material was fantasy, which was not as serious as that involving actual children. That observation was directed at parts of the written material the subject of the charge, not the images.
	
	
	Despite these conclusions, the result of his Honour’s approach was a sentence for the very serious possession of child abuse material offence, with an effective non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and for the dissemination offence an effective non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. That period had to adequately reflect Mr Feuerstein’ moral culpability for his offending (see GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96 at [12]; McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [28] - [29]). The sentence imposed did not do so.
	
	
	Proper regard was not paid to what had been discussed in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [41] - [44], as to the particular need for deterrence, in offences of this kind. Given the very serious nature of many of these images and videos, it had to be borne in that:
	


“41    In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material.

42    What makes the crime callous is not just that it exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes.

43    And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.

44    It is for that reason that this is a crime in respect of which general deterrence is of particular significance. In my opinion the sentencing judge too readily dismissed from consideration the need to convey the very serious manner in which courts view possession of child pornography.”


	
	The conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate is reinforced when consideration is given to the role which the Form 1 offence had to play in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	That offence had to be taken into account with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate. As discussed in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42], that had to be done firstly, by greater weight being given to the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the possession offence indicated. Secondly, by giving greater weight to the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for Mr Feuerstein’s serious offences.
	
	
	The 2 years and 6 months non-parole period imposed for the possession offence revealed that these considerations were also not given sufficient weight.
	
	
	The sentence was, in my view, manifestly inadequate, given the objective seriousness of this offence, Mr Feuerstein’s moral culpability for his offending, the account which had to be taken of the Form 1 offence and the role which both general and specific deterrence had to play in this sentence.
	


The overall sentence


	
	When these errors are considered together with his Honour’s approach to the principle of totality, which resulted in the sentence for the dissemination offence being made totally concurrent with the sentence for the possession offence and all but 6 months of that sentence being made concurrent with the already inadequate aggregate sentence, the manifest inadequacy of the overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein is stark.
	
	
	The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship between individual sentences and severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence, as his Honour observed (see R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15] - [18]). Nor should a crushing sentence that will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release be imposed on an offender (see MAK at [17]). What such a sentence is, must be determined, however, by reference to the offences committed, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality (see Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; (2011) 219 A Crim R 104).
	
	
	Questions of accumulation and concurrency must be determined by reference to the question of whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of another offence (see R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] and [13]). Relevant considerations include the number of victims and whether the offences committed against each occurred on separate occasions (see Van Der Baan v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 5 at [117]).
	
	
	Here, the criminality involved in the child abuse material offences was not comprehended by the offences dealt with at trial. Certainly the images included some images of victims of the trial offences, but given the number and nature of those images and what was involved in these offences by comparison to those dealt with at trial, there was no question of double punishment for common elements of Mr Feuerstein’s offending of the kind considered in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [40].
	
	
	The sentencing discretion, in my view, miscarried, with the result a manifestly inadequate sentence for the criminality involved in the entirety of Mr Feuerstein’s offending. In the result the appeal must be upheld.
	


The residual discretion


	
	The sentence imposed being erroneously lenient, consideration must, nevertheless, be given to whether the residual discretion should be exercised in this case. The Crown accepted that it had to establish that the residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein, should not be exercised. Mr Feuerstein’s case was that it had not satisfied that onus.
	
	
	It is not only the considerable inadequacy of the sentence which must be considered at this point, but also other matters, such as the delay since Mr Feuerstein was sentenced, although there was here no delay by the Crown in lodging the appeal (see R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [60]; R (Cth) v Cheung; R (Cth) v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244; (2010) 203 A Crim R 398 at [151]; R v Hersi [2010] NSWCCA 57 at [55]). The fact that the sentences for the child abuse material offences has already expired, is also relevant (see Hernando at [30]).
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s subjective circumstances, particularly while in custody, about which further evidence was received on appeal, must also be considered. In determining whether to exercise the discretion, the Court is not required to put itself back in the position of the sentencing judge at the moment of conviction, but must take into account this further evidence (see R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154 at [19]; R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562).
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s release on parole is not imminent. He was sentenced on 28 November 2013 and the appeal was lodged in December 2013. One ground was then advanced: manifest inadequacy. The grounds were amended on 3 November 2014, to raise 7 additional grounds. The appeal was heard on 24 November 2014. Further evidence was then received. An affidavit sworn on 11 December 2014 by Mr Michie, a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the conditions of Mr Feuerstein’s custody, dealt with in the affidavit which he had sworn on 20 November 2014, was received in December 2014. Further submissions were received in March 2015.
	
	
	The sentences imposed for the child abuse material offences commenced on 1 December 2011. They have both expired, the possession sentence on 31 May 2014, long before the hearing of the appeal. The aggregate sentence for the other 21 offences commenced on 1 June 2012 and is due to expire on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	The 9 year non-parole period imposed on Mr Feuerstein for the trial offences commenced on 1 June 2012 and is due to expire on 31 May 2021. His sentence expires on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	Haesler DCJ’s finding of special circumstances rested on his conclusion as to the accumulation of the sentences imposed and the period Mr Feuerstein would require to adjust to normal community life on release, while under close supervision for “the longer the better”. His Honour took into account his subjective case, which included evidence of health problems which might increase while he remained in custody and to evidence that as a convicted sex offender and former police officer, he would spend time in protection, which his Honour found imposed harsher regimes for any prisoner, especially in respect of non-association, lockdowns and the ongoing fear of physical attack. The evidence led on appeal shed further light on the conditions under which Mr Feuerstein would serve his sentence.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was aged 52 when he swore his affidavit, where he attested to the conditions of his custodial history, protective custody while on remand and movement to a segregation unit after conviction. He referred to circumstances of a disciplinary charge and complaints he had made to the NSW Ombudsman, his removal from protective custody and threats received from other inmates, given his past professions, one of which resulted in a physical attack. He was then housed in protective custody with other sex offenders, with little access to training programs. His health problems continued.
	
	
	Mr Michie’s affidavit, to which was annexed relevant records, confirmed relevant aspects of this account. There was in the result no issue between the parties that the conditions of Mr Feuerstein’s custody will be harsher than that of other prisoners.
	
	
	Bearing all of these matters in mind, I have come to the conclusion that while the overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein is so inadequate that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice”, the residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed in relation to the child abuse offences should be exercised. That conclusion follows from the delay, which has had the result that Mr Feuerstein has already served the entirety of the sentences imposed for those two offences.
	
	
	The same conclusion is not available in relation to the aggregate sentence for the trial offences which, in my view, must be set aside and Mr Feuerstein resentenced. To do otherwise in all of the circumstances I have discussed would, in my view, result in an affront to justice.
	


Resentencing


	
	Section 68A(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) prohibits the Court from imposing a less severe sentence on an appeal such as this, than would otherwise be considered appropriate, because of any element of double jeopardy involved in a respondent being sentenced again, or on the basis of any distress and anxiety suffered by a respondent (see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49).
	
	
	In this case, on resentencing, it is necessary to take into account that it has long been considered that safety while in prison is a relevant consideration on sentencing(see York v The Queen [2001] HCA 60; (2005) 225 CLR 466); that every year in protective custody is equivalent to a longer loss of liberty under ordinary conditions of imprisonment (see AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; (1999) 198 CLR 111); and that custody for former police officers will involve a greater degree of hardship than might otherwise be the case (see R v Jones and Kelly (1985) 20 A Crim R 142).
	
	
	The evidence received on appeal from Mr Feuerstein, corroborated by that led by the Crown, sheds further light on the considerably difficult circumstances under which Mr Feuerstein will continue to serve his sentence, given his former occupations. That evidence must be taken into account, by ameliorating the sentence which would otherwise be imposed upon him.
	
	
	I will not reiterate the circumstances of the trial offences, which I have earlier discussed, or all of the other relevant matters I have earlier referred to. I agree with Haesler DCJ’s conclusion that Mr Feuerstein should have an extended period of supervision once released on parole, given his need for strict supervision when so released.
	
	
	For the trial offences, I would resentence Mr Feuerstein to a total non-parole period of 11 years and a total term of 16 years. This reflects indicative sentences which do not depart from those indicated by Haesler DCJ, but with less concurrency than his Honour concluded was appropriate, resulting in an inadequate aggregate sentence for that total criminality involved in those 21 offences.
	
	
	I also consider that in the circumstances, for reasons already explained, that the application of the principle of totality should not result in any concurrency between the fixed term sentences imposed for the child abuse offences, the last of which expired on 31 May 2014, with the result that the aggregate term should commence on 30 May 2014, with the non-parole period expiring on 29 May 2025. The sentence would then expire on 29 May 2030.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons given, the orders I would make are:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by the District Court on 28 November 2013 for the trial offences are set aside.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein is resentenced to an aggregate sentence for the trial offences commencing on 30 May 2014 with a total term of 16 years, expiring on 30 May 2030 and a non-parole period of 11 years expiring on 30 May 2025.

2766542,Alexander v Parole Authority of New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 800,"Judgment (Ex tempore)

The Nature of the Proceedings


	
	The applicant Christopher Alexander, by proceedings filed on 11 February 2015, seeks that a direction be given to the first respondent, the State Parole Authority, pursuant to s 155(1)(b) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 to which I will refer to as ""the Act"".
	
	
	Pursuant to s 157 of the Act I granted leave to Mr Alexander to appear on his own behalf and make submissions. The Authority, the first respondent, filed a submitting appearance. The Attorney General was granted leave to intervene in the proceedings and the Attorney was joined as second defendant. Ms Sullivan, solicitor advocate of the Crown Solicitor, appeared on behalf of the Attorney.
	
	
	The application is opposed by the Attorney General whose contention is that the application should be dismissed. The grounds for that opposition and contention have been the subject of detailed written submissions on behalf of the Attorney General by Ms Sullivan dated 28 April 2015 supplemented by her oral submissions and reply submissions. Mr Alexander has made submissions by videolink and I will refer to the matters raised by him shortly.
	


The Evidence


	
	The evidentiary materials relied upon by Mr Alexander as applicant comprise material contained in Exhibit A, which is a letter written by his mother, Bonnie Hume, addressed ""To whom it may concern"", and documents contained within a folder of documents entitled ""Applicant's material"", Exhibit B.
	
	
	Exhibit B contains a number of documents behind guide cards 1 to 6. Amongst the documents which I have examined in Exhibit B is a hand written letter by the applicant dated 17 December 2014. That hand written document makes reference to observations contained in a pre-release report by Ms Sartor and also some cross references to the judge's sentencing remarks, and throughout the document dot points by way of, as it were, responses by the applicant to the matters within the particular paragraphs of the pre-release report and the sentencing remarks.
	
	
	Two other documents to which Mr Alexander makes reference specifically contained in Exhibit B are a document relating to alcohol use entitled ""Know the facts"" as well as an article prepared by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing entitled ""Quick Reference Guide to the Treatment of Alcohol Problems"", and Mr Alexander made some submissions about that aspect.
	
	
	I have also noted other documents contained within Exhibit B including hand written documents by the applicant. One in particular behind guide card 5 dated 17 April 2015 deals with a number of wide ranging matters partly reaching back to investigations and matters that arose on sentence which I do not consider to be relevant to the present application. On page 3 of that document are a number of dot points Mr Alexander has made. One refers to ""need to address offending behaviour - need for psychiatric report""; another dot point states, ""alcohol played no part in my alleged offence because I did not drink at all""; the next dot the point states, ""have you acquired my custodial medical file?, I am not medicated""; a further dot point states, ""need for post release accommodation Villawood"". On the next page there is reference to psychometric indicators and I need not detail what is said about that.
	
	
	Some of the dot point matters are said to arise, by reason of Mr Alexander's submissions, in particular in relation to matters concerning alcohol consumption and the need for the question of alcohol in his case to be assessed, as well as the issue of the psychiatric report, which is said by Ms Sartor to be one matter that is required for the purposes of assessment on the issue of parole.
	
	
	The Attorney General relied upon evidence by way of three affidavits, firstly the affidavit of Mr Cosman dated 15 April 2015, and two of Mr Vasiliou dated 15 and 24 April 2015.
	
	
	Attached to Mr Cosman's affidavit was a folder of documents comprising exhibit RAC-1 to his affidavit. One key document contained within RAC-1 is the pre-release report of Theresa Sartor, Senior Community Corrections Officer, dated 6 November 2014 which is supplemented on page 7 of that report by a short statement of Joanne McKenzie, Unit Leader.
	


Background


	
	The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 19 August 2013. A copy of the remarks on sentence of her Honour, Judge Tupman, was included in RAC-1 at Tab C.
	
	
	The applicant entered guilty pleas to three counts on the indictment as follows: Count 1 – detaining for advantage contrary to s 90A of the Crimes Act 1900. Counts 2 and 3 – aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, first count relating to 15 May 1999 and the second to 16 May 1999, contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. The offences under s 61J carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Her Honour on the date to which I have referred imposed the following sentences: Count 1, terms of imprisonment of five years commencing 2 February 2009 to expire on 1 February 2014. Counts 2 and 3, non-parole periods of three years, six months commencing 2 August 2011 to expire 1 February 2015 with parole period of two and a half years commencing 2 February 2015 to expire 1 August 2017. The overall term of imprisonment was a term of six years commencing 2 August 2011 to expire 1 August 2017.
	
	
	On 26 November 2014 the State Parole Authority made a decision to refuse parole. The Notice of the Decision addressed to the applicant set out the reasons on page 1. Those reasons were stated to be:
	


“Risk of re-offending, limited participation in relevant programs; needs to address offending behaviour (therapeutic) [needs to participate in therapeutic program to address sex offending (CUBIT)]; needs to address offending behaviour [needs to participate in program]; (2) and address alcohol and other drugs problems; needs a psychiatric report (a comprehensive cross-sectional psychiatric report including file review diagnosis and current treatment plan); and need for post release accommodation (no suitable post release accommodation).""


	
	The Authority identified the source documents before it that were considered and expressed a conclusion in the following terms:
	


“Until such time as the offender addresses his offending behaviour, has suitable post release accommodation and a psychiatric report is available, the State Parole Authority do not believe release to parole is appropriate. Copies of reports in other documents used by the State Parole Authority in reaching its decision have been forwarded to the Community Corrections along with the forms and notices. Community Corrections also provide you with a copy of these reports and/or documents for your records.""


	
	On 9 December 2014 the applicant applied for a hearing to review the refusal of parole. On 15 January 2015 the authority considered the application for review. The authority on 15 January 2015 determined that a review hearing was not warranted given that the application did not address grounds on refusal, ""The decision to refuse parole on 26 November 2014 is to stand for the following reasons"", and there then is set out the reasons which appear to be the same or similar to those that have appeared in the decision of 26 November 2014.
	


Legislative Provisions


	
	Under Part 6 Division 2 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 the Act sets out provisions that relate to the making of parole orders. Section 135(1) states that:
	


“The Parole Authority must not grant parole for an offender unless it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest.""


	
	Subsection (2):
	


“In deciding whether or not the release of an offender is appropriate and in the public interest the Parole Authority must have regard to the following matters.""


	
	There is then set out specific matters in subparagraphs (a) to (k).
	
	
	Section 155(1)(b) of the Act provides:
	


“if the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information the offender may, in the accordance with the Rules of Court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.""


	
	Section 155(3) provides in an application:
	


“The application is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.""


	
	Section 155(4) provides:
	


“This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority's decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1).""


	
	It has been necessary in my view, in the approach that I have taken, that I review all of the materials that have been adduced in evidence in order to understand the basis for the application and to determine the extent of evidence that has been adduced that addresses the relevant issues requiring consideration under s 155 and for the purposes of making a determination as to whether the evidence relied upon by the applicant is cogent and/or probative of matters asserted by way of challenge. In other words, I have embarked upon the full hearing notwithstanding that, at the end of the day, the evidence of a particular case may indicate the evidence does not support the application or, if there is no evidence to support the application the proceedings may be shown to be an abuse of process.
	
	
	A number of propositions and principles have been worked out in the various case law authorities. I do not intend to refer to all of the case law. It has been very conveniently summarised and referred to in the written submissions for the Attorney-General. It is sufficient to say that an application for a direction under s 155(1)(b) is not an appeal. In particular, it does not constitute proceedings involving a hearing of the merits or the weight to be given to particular matters that were considered by the Authority in its decision making. It is not the function of this Court in such an application to concern itself with the reasoning processes that have been followed by the Authority in arriving at its decision.
	
	
	In one of the well-known authorities in this area, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Naudi [2003] NSWCCA 160, Simpson J emphasised, firstly, the need for an applicant to produce evidence to support assertions made, in particular as to false or misleading challenges or assertions: at [26]. Secondly, that an application must establish that the Parole Authority decision was ""made on the basis"" of either false, misleading or irrelevant information.
	
	
	In other words, the information challenged must have a particular character being that referred to in s 155(1)(b) and, furthermore, that, at least in part, forms the foundation for the Authority's decision. Putting it differently, that the challenged information was relied upon by the Authority in coming to its decision.
	
	
	The applicant, therefore, must produce evidence in these proceedings, firstly, to establish that the information in question is information before the Authority in relation to its decision making (that is the first decision) and their decision on review, was false or it was misleading information or it was irrelevant. Secondly, it is necessary to show that such information impacted upon the Parole Authority's decision or determination.
	
	
	Before turning to the material relied upon by the applicant it is necessary to say something about the source material reports that were before the State Parole Authority in refusing parole and its further decision affirming that decision upon the review application.
	
	
	The pre-release report dated 6 November 2014 being part of exhibit RAC‑1 provided information on a range of topics or issues or subject matters. It is not necessary here to detail all of the material on those matters other than to identify that certain of the specific matters addressed were, firstly, the issue of what is referred to as immigration, referring to the fact that the applicant had been identified as having a New Zealand nationality. Secondly, education and training; thirdly, alcohol and other drugs; fourthly, offender attitudes; fifthly, the victim and her family; sixthly, behaviour in custody; seventh, program services; and, eighth, psychological including sex offender programs.
	
	
	In the material in relation to the issue of alcohol, one of the matters to which the applicant has made submissions, the pre-release report at page 2 of 7 noted that:
	


“The applicant admitted at the time of the offence he was consuming excessive amounts of alcohol but failed to see the relationship between alcohol abuse and the offence and, indeed, conceded his behaviour was immature. He denied use of illicit or non-prescribed substances.""


	
	In relation to the issue of alcohol and other drugs, the author of the report referred at page 3 of 7 to the “Getting Smart” program and noted that on 23 October 2013:
	


“The applicant was offered a place in the program which he initially accepted but withdrew from the program a week later without an excuse.""


	
	The report stated that:
	


“He had not attempted to enrol in any further programs to address the concerns raised about his level of alcohol abuse. In an attempt to discuss concerns about unaddressed alcohol related issues, he stated his alcohol issues were resolved and it was no longer a problem.""


	
	On page 6 of 7 of that report it was noted that on 23 October 2013 that the matter to which attention was drawn, (the “Getting Smart” program) was a matter said to be of concern.
	
	
	On the issue of alcohol the submission by the applicant was that there was a failure to identify the fact that the alcohol consumption by him as referred to in the reports was only temporary. In his submissions Mr Alexander said it was in fact a decision not unlike a drug taker, that he had not been properly reviewed and assessed for suitability for programs. He took issue with the Parole Authority's decision which in part was based on the proposition that he had not participated in a program or programs.
	
	
	The issue of alcohol consumption was addressed in a pre-sentence report, which is to be found behind guide card 3 in exhibit RAC-1, a report apparently prepared for the sentence hearing to which I have referred. The sentencing report stated on 19 January 2010:
	


“The offender has indicated he has spent the last 10 years living on the street consuming excessive quantities of alcohol, assuming aliases in attempts to avoid police.""


	
	Page 2 of that report under the heading ""Alcohol and drugs Issues"", the report states:
	


“The offender was adamant that he had not consumed alcohol prior to this offence and he has never used illicit substances. He claims that since the offence his daily consumption of alcohol is at least a four litre cask of wine which often resulted in memory loss and loss of consciousness""

Et cetera.


	
	The issue raised in the considerations addressed in the pre-release report is an assessment that, whatever alcohol was consumed at the date of offences, the fact remains that the risk associated with the applicant has been assessed as linked potentially, at least, to a past problem of alcohol consumption and is one that needs to be assessed for the purposes of assessing his suitability for parole.
	
	
	I turn to a further issue the applicant has raised, and that is what he referred to as a misapprehension of causation in terms of treatment and the like. By that, as I understood it, Mr Alexander was meaning by that, that there had been no re-appraisal of his case, his character or his behaviour in order to remove an alert so that he could participate in programs. In other words, Mr Alexander's contention was that as a matter of causation it was not his behaviour or conduct that can be seen as the cause or reason for him not having participated in courses or programs, but the reason is to be found in the failure by those, whilst he has been in custody, to reassess and make the necessary enquiries for his participation in programs.
	
	
	I do not see this as an issue that advances the application. Firstly, there is no evidence which establishes a factual foundation for the contention as to causation that Mr Alexander makes, but, contrary to that, there is strong material in both the pre-release report and other documents which indicates a failure by the applicant himself to co-operate or participate in the various programs to which the documents before the Parole Authority refer. I do not consider that there is any evidence in other words to support that proposition.
	
	
	Before moving to the next issue, it must be said that there is no evidence which would indicate that the information relied upon by the Authority so far as the issue of alcohol is concerned was in any respect false, misleading or irrelevant.
	
	
	As Simpson J said in the case to which I have referred, as to evidence most likely to be required to establish the issue of information being either misleading or false, it may well be possible to determine whether the information before the Parole Authority was relevant or irrelevant from the materials that were before the Authority when making its decisions. It is clear that the information on the question of alcohol strongly supported the need for that to be properly assessed, and there is no basis at all in the evidence and none was led indeed to establish that the information relied upon in relation to the question of alcohol and other associated risks was false or irrelevant. That is a highly relevant matter in assessing risk.
	
	
	The next issue which was the subject of some submissions by the applicant related to the question of psychiatric assessment. It is necessary to consider the material that was before the Authority in relation to the decision about which a direction is sought. The Sentencing Remarks (page 14) contain an observation made by the sentencing judge:
	


“Some of the facts, together with my observations of the offender, leave me with a fairly clear impression that, even then and certainly now the offender is a person who can well suffer from a psychiatric illness. There is no evidence of that before the Court, and in due course I will deal with that by making recommendations for treatment.""


	
	Towards the end of the remarks on sentence, pages 12 to 13 her Honour said:
	


“I recommend that the offender be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. I recommend further that this parole be subject to supervision by Probation and Parole and referral for a psychiatric assessment and treatment.""


	
	In the decision of the State Parole Authority refusing parole reference is made to the sentencing judge's observations to which I have referred. At the conclusion to that decision of 26 November 2014 it was stated:
	


“Until such time that the offender addresses his offending behaviour, has suitable post-release accommodation and a psychiatric report is available, the State Parole Authority does not believe that release to parole is appropriate.""


	
	The Written Submissions on behalf of the Attorney address in detail a number of the issues that were raised in documents generated by the applicant. It is not necessary to refer to all of the issues that have been analysed in the Written Submissions. On my count there were 12 separate matters addressed in those submissions based upon contentions or assertions made by the applicant.
	
	
	One relates to the issue of alcohol abuse, to which I have already referred. Another relates to access to Justice Health records.
	
	
	In para 62 of the Written Submissions the assertions of the applicant are set out, in which he states, amongst other things, that he did not refuse access to Justice Health records.
	
	
	The submission, which I accept, in para 64 is:
	


“Other than the applicant's assertion that he did not refuse access to his health records, which is otherwise unsupported by evidence.


	
	There is no basis to doubt the correctness or accuracy of the account referred to by Ms Sartor in the pre‑release report or to suggest the information is false. Indeed, the presentence report dated 26 February 2010, which was also before the Authority, refers to the applicant adopting a similar stance by refusing to release certain psychiatric health information at that time. Nor is there any suggestion that the information was misleading or irrelevant in any respect.
	
	
	In para 65 of the Written Submissions it was stated:
	


“To the contrary, the extent to which the applicant facilitated access to necessary health information to ultimately permit the Authority to gain insight into his psychiatric status (having regard to the remarks of the sentencing judge to the effect that the offender ought be examined as to the possibility of his suffering psychiatric illness) was clearly a relevant matter for the Authority to have regard to, given its statutory duty pursuant to s 135 of the Act.”


	
	The submission for the Attorney-General was that there was no substance to this ground of complaint. I accept that submission.
	
	
	There are two other matters which Mr Alexander raised, which he relied upon in support of his application. The first related to the question of the application of s 135 criteria, which is (2)(a) the need to protect the safety of the community: Section 135(2)(a) of the Act. In that respect, the applicant stated that though a matter relied upon by the Authority, it is not a matter that would apply to him as, given his New Zealand nationality, it would be either possible or likely even that he would be deported once released to parole, and therefore there is no need to protect the safety of the community in this State or country, as I understood his submission. However, there is no evidence again to support this proposition. It has not been demonstrated that there was any information relating to the question of immigration, a matter to which the pre‑release report does advert, to the likelihood that the matters which the applicant has endeavoured to forecast will eventuate or that there was any information before the Authority on that matter which was false, misleading or irrelevant.
	
	
	The second matter relied upon is Exhibit A, and that is the letter or statement from his mother, which was relied upon as evidence that, as I understood it, in effect, new evidence, that his mother had been diagnosed with invasive basal cell carcinoma that required surgical excision and treatment, and his mother's health is a matter that ought to be taken into account. However, that is information that cannot be said to have been material that was required to be considered by the Authority, but in any event there is no evidence to suggest that the material was available and no material to suggest that the Authority ought to have pursued this information as a basis for its decision-making.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I have concluded that the applicant has not discharged the onus; indeed, has not produced evidence to support the fundamental requirement before a direction can be made, that is to say that any information before the Authority was either inaccurate, erroneous or incomplete; no evidence that any such information challenged by or asserted by the applicant to have been wrong in any respect was in fact erroneous; and no evidence to support that any erroneous material or interpretation occurred or impacted in any way upon the decision of the Authority.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find that this application does not have any evidentiary foundation at all, nor any issue raised that could attract the operation of s 155(1)(b). In those circumstances, the application must be dismissed, and I so order.

		19 June 2015",2015-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766545,"DUNCAN, Paul Parepano v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 84","Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: This is an appeal against a conviction by a jury in 2003. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) requires this Court to allow an appeal against conviction on a variety of specified grounds, one of which is “that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. The history is somewhat unusual, and will be set out below. The appeal is based upon assertions of fact about the manner in which the trial was conducted by the trial judge. The appellant asserts that, within the meaning of s 6(1), there was a miscarriage of justice because the judge was asleep for significant periods during the course of the trial. He further asserts that that fact had two important consequences: one, that the judge failed to discharge his duty of supervision and control of the trial, and two, that the jury were aware of the judge’s indisposition, and were distracted by it and failed to treat the trial with the seriousness it deserved. I have read in draft the judgments of Hall J and Campbell J. I agree that the appeal must be dismissed. I prefer to state my own path to arriving at that conclusion. I propose to state what I see as the relevant facts, and my reasons for reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	The trial of the appellant and a co-offender, Adam Perre, began on 24 February 2003 in the District Court, before Dodd DCJ and a jury. On 24 March the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of two of the four counts on the indictment, of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (on one victim), and affray (in respect of which a different victim was named). The appellant was represented by Ms L McSpedden of counsel; the co-accused by Mr R Greenhill SC. The Crown prosecutor was Ms N Adams.
	
	
	Both offenders were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment.
	
	
	In 2004 both offenders appealed to this Court against the convictions (“the 2004 appeals”), and sought leave to appeal against the sentences. In each case, the conviction appeal was dismissed; in each case the sentence appeal was allowed in part, and the sentences reduced: R v Duncan; R v Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431. The facts and circumstances of the offences are comprehensively set out in that judgment and need not be repeated. They are irrelevant to the issues raised in the present appeal.
	
	
	The grounds raised in the 2004 appeals were confined to evidentiary rulings and directions given to the jury by the trial judge. No question concerning the conduct of the trial by the trial judge was raised.
	
	
	In 2004 the same judge presided over the trial of Rafael Cesan and Ruben Mas Rivadavia in respect of Commonwealth drug offences. Cesan and Mas Rivadavia were convicted. Each appealed to this Court against his conviction. In each case one ground of appeal was that the trial judge had been asleep during significant parts of the trial. By majority, the appeals to this Court against conviction were dismissed: Cesan v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth); Mas Rivadavia v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 273; 174 A Crim R 385. On the basis of evidence adduced in the 2007 appeals, all members of the Court found, as a fact, that from time to time during the trial, the judge was “nodding off” and on occasions was “actually asleep” (per Basten JA at [63], [65], Grove AJ at [189], Howie J agreeing). The extent and detail of the evidence concerning the judge’s conduct of the trial is set out extensively in both judgments. I will not repeat it.
	
	
	Cesan and Mas Rivadavia were granted special leave to appeal to the High Court. The evidence established, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that there had been a substantial failure of the judicial process. On 3 September 2008 the High Court allowed the appeals, and ordered that the convictions be quashed and that there be a new trial: Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 (hereinafter referred to as “Cesan”).
	
	
	Two different approaches can be discerned in the judgments of the High Court. The Chief Justice identified four separate factors relevant to the determination of whether there had been shown the reality or appearance of a failure by the trial judge to perform his or her duty. The fourth was:
	


“Whether the jury appeared to have noticed or to have been distracted or otherwise affected by the judge’s conduct.”

French CJ said:

93.  If, by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	The other members of the Court appear to have placed greater emphasis on the impact of the alleged conduct on the jury, and less on a failure to maintain supervision and control the trial. Their focus was on the consequences of any demonstrated episodes of sleep. Gummow J said:
	


“105.  The superintendence of the trial by the trial judge required him to ensure that the jury was not distracted from paying full attention. The evidence which was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal showed both that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and that the very source of the distraction was the sleeping judge.

106.  The consequence was that in respect of each appellant there was a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.” (italics added)

Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said:

“112.  There was, in these cases, ‘on any other ground whatsoever … a miscarriage of justice’ because the trial judge did not exercise that degree of supervision of the proceedings which would ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that the jury paid attention to all of the evidence as it was given. The occasion for this departure from the proper conduct of the trial was the trial judge falling asleep. (The trial judge was later diagnosed as suffering from severe obstructive sleep apnoea.) But for present purposes, attention should focus upon the consequences of the trial judge falling asleep.” (italics in original)

Heydon J agreed with the reasons of Gummow J and of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.


	
	Thereafter the appellant, or Ms Linda Machan, acting on his behalf, sought the intervention of various bodies and institutions. In 2005 Ms Machan made a complaint to the Judicial Commission of NSW about the conduct of the trial judge. Inter alia, she said:
	


“I believe that Paul Duncan and Adam Perre suffered a miscarriage of justice due to Judge Dodd dozing off and even snoring during the trial so he would not have been able to pay attention to evidence given and so was not in a position to come to a fair and just decision.”


	
	Under the heading “Details of Complaint”, Ms Machan said:
	


“Judge Ian Dodd was appointed to preside over the trial of Paul Duncan and Adam Perre. However as Judge Dodd was constantly dozing off while the prosecution was able to influence the jury [sic]. Along with key evidence being ignored for the defence, while Paul’s complaint and mine being shrugged off even though the panel of jurors were shaking the [sic] heads in disbelief at judge asleep and snoring. This was happening every day. The first time I noticed Judge Dodd asleep he had his hands clasped together on his chest and his head drooped down and I could hear him snoring so I mentioned it to Paul’s barrister Linda McSpedden and solicitor Heidi Muggenthaler and Linda McSpedden said to me ‘Oh yes my dear the judge has sleep apnoea and does this all the time’ …

What concerned me a great deal that when Judge Dodd was summing up, he left out any curcial [sic] evidence for the defence and when he was directing the jury he completely confused them and when the jury asked for the transcript so they could make a decision he Judge Dodd refused it to them and when he sentenced the two young men he was grossley [sic] excessive …”


	
	Attached to this complaint document were a number of documents. These included a statement of Perre’s father, and statements of two solicitors who had been involved in representing the appellant. Also attached was a letter written by Ms Heidi Muggenthaler to the Chief Executive Officer of the Judicial Commission, and affidavits of the appellant and Ms Machan. Ms Muggenthaler identified herself as “the solicitor on the record” for the appellant in the trial. (The complaint to the Judicial Commission went into abeyance on the retirement of the judge at some time in 2005.)
	
	
	On 30 November 2009, pursuant to s 76 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), Ms Machan petitioned the Governor of NSW, Professor Marie Bashir (as she then was). She referred to the decision of the High Court in Cesan, and concluded:
	


“THIS THE PETITIONER THEREFORE ASKS that on consideration of this Petition for the exercise of Her Majesty’s mercy having reference to the conviction of the Petitioner on information, the Minister may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.”

On 17 June 2010 the Governor replied to Ms Machan, advising that the Executive Council had determined that the applications for clemency should be declined.


	
	On a date not disclosed in the evidence, the appellant, under s 78 of the Appeal and Review Act, sought, in the Supreme Court, an inquiry into his conviction. On 26 June 2014, pursuant to s 79(1) of the Appeal and Review Act, Button J ordered that “the whole case” be referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal against conviction under the Criminal Appeal Act. That is the proceeding that is before this Court.
	
	
	Two grounds of appeal were identified on the appellant’s behalf. They are:
	


“1.  The Appellant did not receive a fair trial and as such his conviction was the result of a miscarriage of justice due to the fact that the learned Trial Judge was asleep from time to time during the trial.

2.  The lawyers representing the Appellant failed in their duty and their obligations and as such a miscarriage of justice resulted.”


	
	I have mentioned the various earlier proceedings, not because they are relevant to the outcome of the present appeal, but because it was through the tender of these applications and their supporting documents that the appellant sought to prosecute his appeal and provide the evidentiary basis for the grounds of appeal. I will in due course refer to the contents of those documents that were admitted into evidence.
	
	
	Both grounds, as they were presented to this Court, necessitated proof of matters concerning the conduct of the trial. The essential factual matter upon which both grounds rested was the assertion that the trial judge was asleep from time to time during the course of the trial. If that fact is established, and if it is further established that, as a result, the jury was distracted from paying full attention to all of the evidence then a miscarriage of justice is established: Cesan [96], [105], [119]. It will be seen that three separate questions arise:
	



	
	does the evidence establish that the trial judge in this case was asleep from time to time during the trial?; and
	
	
	if so, does the evidence establish that the periods of sleeping were such as to distract the jury from its task of listening to the whole of the evidence and absorbing the submissions put to it by counsel?; or
	
	
	if the first question is answered affirmatively, does the evidence establish that the judge substantially failed to discharge his duty of supervision and control of the trial process?
	


On the authority of Cesan, the second and the third are the salient questions. An affirmative answer to the first may provide the explanation if an affirmative answer to the second or third is given. Axiomatically, should the conclusion be reached that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, Ground 1 of the appeal must succeed.


	
	The “duty and obligations” of the lawyers referred to in Ground 2 were said to be the duty and obligations to take up with the trial judge the asserted deficiencies in his conduct of the trial. The proposition that such duties and obligations exist is based also upon the judgment in Cesan: see [93], [120].
	
	
	The second ground depends upon a further factual proposition: that the appellant’s legal representatives at trial knew of, but did not raise with the trial judge the issue of his asserted inattention by reason of periods of sleep, or take any other steps to avert the consequences of that asserted inattention. That they did not take such steps was not in issue. There was no suggestion that either counsel or any of the solicitors involved drew the judge’s attention to the conduct that is now alleged. As it was argued, this ground depends entirely upon affirmative factual findings and conclusions in relation to the question that underlies Ground 1, but also upon a factual finding that the legal representatives were (or any of them was) aware of the trial judge’s inattention. That any of them was so aware is not established on the evidence. As I have said, should the questions underlying Ground 1 be answered affirmatively, Ground 1 must succeed, and there is no need to proceed to Ground 2. If, however, Ground 1 fails at either of its steps, there can be no basis for concluding that counsel failed in their duty or obligations. Ground 2 is therefore otiose.
	
	
	I return to the two questions that underlie Ground 1. The facts relevant to those questions were very much in issue in this appeal.
	


The evidence in the appeal


	
	The evidence was presented in somewhat chaotic form. An “Evidence Book” was filed. It contained a large number of documents, some of which were the various applications, petitions and supporting documents referred to above. Ultimately, the evidence sought to be relied on on behalf of the appellant was identified as:
	



	
	the complaint made by Ms Machan to the Judicial Commission (April 2005);
	
	
	an affidavit sworn by Ms Machan on 6 February 2009;
	
	
	an affidavit sworn by the appellant on 30 November 2008 (Document 6);
	
	
	a medical report of Dr Peter Dodwell (p 86 of the Evidence Book);
	
	
	a letter written by Ms Heidi Muggenthaler to the Chief Executive Officer of the Judicial Commission on 16 May 2005.
	


Initial reliance on other documents was abandoned. The evidence tendered on behalf of the appellant can be divided into three broad categories. The principal category is evidence that, in fact, the trial judge was, from time to time, asleep (Ground 1). The second category is evidence of the effect of that sleeping (if the evidence of sleeping be accepted) on the jury (also Ground 1). The third category is evidence that, during the course of the trial and thereafter, various people drew the attention of others, including the legal representatives of the two accused, to this asserted fact. It is not entirely clear what was sought to be achieved by evidence in this category. Conceivably, it could go to enhancing the credibility of the appellant and Ms Machan, as prior consistent statements supporting their evidence in this appeal. However, the occasion for tendering evidence for that purpose does not arise unless and until a proper foundation has been laid for the admission of the evidence: see Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 102, s 108. An alternative basis for admission of evidence in the third category might be in respect of the complaint contained in Ground 2 of the appeal, at least so far as it is said that the attention of the legal representatives was drawn to the assertions.


	
	It is to be observed that no evidence was tendered, nor any identification of any part of the record of the trial made, to support a proposition that the judge failed to discharge his duty of supervision and control of the trial. Indeed, no such submission was made.
	
	
	During the course of the hearing, on objection by the Crown, the letter of Ms Muggenthaler was rejected, with reasons reserved. I deal below with the reasons for rejecting that document. A ruling on the admission of the report of Dr Dodwell was reserved (with counsel acknowledging that the appellant suffered no prejudice by reason of that course being taken).
	
	
	The appellant and Ms Machan gave oral evidence and were cross-examined.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon affidavit evidence of Ms McSpedden, Mr Greenhill, Mr Michael Stollery, Ms Natalie Adams and Ms Janet Bremner. Mr Stollery was the solicitor who instructed Ms Adams in the trial. Ms Bremner was a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Of these, only Mr Stollery was required to attend for cross-examination.
	


The rejected evidence


	
	Before going to the content of the documents and the oral and affidavit evidence, it is convenient to deal with the reasons for rejecting the letter of Ms Muggenthaler to the Chief Executive Officer of the Judicial Commission dated 16 May 2005, and for reserving the question of the admissibility of the report of Dr Dodwell.
	


(i)  Ms Muggenthaler


	
	Ms Muggenthaler identified herself as the solicitor “on the record” for the appellant in the trial. In the letter she said (inter alia):
	


“I am aware that a complaint has been made by Ms Linda Machan, that Judge Dodd had been asleep during the trial.

Ms Machan was a witness in the matter and she gave evidence during the latter part of the proceedings. I do not know if she was present in court before she gave evidence or only after.

I am aware that Mr John Perre, the father of the co-accused Adam Perre was in court most days if not all, but not from personal observation.

I am also aware that both Ms Machan and Mr Perre raised the matter of Judge Dodd falling asleep during proceedings at a chance meeting with Ms Kluss during the time of the trial. [Ms Kluss had previously held the brief to represent the appellant.] I was not present during that meeting.

…

As I indicated on the telephone, I was present at court on few occasions and heard, rather than observed who I thought to be the judge make noises that were a mixture of a snort or half choke on a couple of occasions. I did not keep a note of the time or date. During trials my focus is mostly on the jury and on witnesses rather than the judge. Now and then I observed the judge to be leaning back in his chair, apparently with his eyes closed, but I cannot say that I know that he was asleep. On one or two occasions he supported his head with his hand, with the elbow on the bench and appeared to be leaning forward. I cannot say that he was asleep.

I am aware that Ms Machan was concerned about her observations, but cannot remember when and how she raised them. It could have been by speaking to Ms McSpedden or Mr Wong [a part-time employee of Ms Muggenthaler’s firm] or indeed myself.

…”

The purpose for which the letter was tendered was stated by counsel to be to prove that complaints were made. It may be assumed that it was tendered also to prove the fact that the judge had slept during the trial.


	
	Objection to the admission of the letter was taken on behalf of the Crown. Senior counsel for the appellant pressed the tender, relying on s 69 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The letter clearly contained hearsay statements. Hearsay evidence, by s 59 of the Evidence Act, is not admissible unless the evidence is brought within one or more of a number of exceptions provided by the Evidence Act. Section 69, set out in the judgment of Hall J, provides one of those exceptions. Section 69 proceeds on the basis that the evidence in question is relevant to an issue in the proceeding: Evidence Act, s 56.  Applicability of s 69 depends, first, upon the document being properly categorised as a “business record” within either para (i) or (ii) of s 69(1)(a) and s 69(1)(b) - that is (relevantly):
	



	
	that it forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business (s 69(1)(a)(i)). (“Business” is defined to include the practice of a profession such as the profession of law.); and
	
	
	that it contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business (s 69(1)(b)).
	


If the document falls into that category, evidence of the representation contained in it is not excluded by the hearsay rule, provided that the representation is made by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the fact asserted in the representation (s 69(2)(a)) or on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by such a person (s 69(2)(b)).


	
	Although I have reservations concerning whether it was intended that s 69 extend to a letter written by a solicitor on behalf of a client containing factual assertions derived from the client’s instructions, and thus become evidence of the truth of those factual assertions, such letters do appear to fit within the language of s 69(1). It is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on that question, because analysis of the content of Ms Muggenthaler’s letter reveals that neither of the possible purposes of the tender would be served by its admission. It therefore fails the relevance test imposed by s 56 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	So far as the letter could be said to contain “representations” that the judge was sleeping during the trial, it fails in two respects. First, what Ms Muggenthaler said of her own observations did not prove, and could not contribute to proving, that fact. Ms Muggenthaler very fairly said that she could not say that the judge was asleep. Her description of her observations fell well short of raising even to prima facie level a case that the judge was asleep.
	
	
	Further, there is nothing in the letter to identify the source of the information contained in the representations - that is, the representations fail to satisfy s 69(2)(b) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	So far as the letter purports to record reports potentially relevant to Ground 2 of the appeal, there is nothing in it that could establish that any such reports were made to the appellant’s legal representatives in the trial. The only person named in the letter as a recipient of the complaint is a counsel who had formerly represented the appellant. The final paragraph extracted above contains pure speculation.
	
	
	In the end, the letter was rejected, not for s 69 reasons, but as failing the relevance test (Evidence Act, s 56), and by reason of the credibility rule (s 102).
	


(ii)  Dr Dodwell


	
	The report of Dr Dodwell (dated 14 July 2005) was tendered on the same basis, that is, under s 69 as a business record. Objection was taken on behalf of the Crown. On its tender, the Court deferred ruling on its admission: see transcript p 15. At the conclusion of the appeal, the Court returned to consider the issue. The position then taken on behalf of the appellant was equivocal: see transcript p 66. Counsel acknowledged, however, that he was not prejudiced by deferral of the ruling.
	
	
	Given the equivocal position taken on behalf of the appellant, it is as well to determine the issue.
	
	
	Dr Dodwell’s report is on the letterhead of “HealthQuest: Workforce Health Management”. Dr Dodwell is identified as an occupational physician. He recorded that the trial judge had been referred to HealthQuest for assessment for his fitness to continue in judicial office. Included in the documents provided to Dr Dodwell for the purposes of his assessment were several reports of a Dr David Jankelson (described as a “sleep physician”). Dr Dodwell recorded that, on 1 September 2004, Dr Jankelson diagnosed the judge as suffering from severe obstructive sleep apnoea. The last report of Dr Jankelson to which Dr Dodwell referred was dated 9 June 2005, from which Dr Dodwell quoted in the following terms:
	


“He continues to use CPAP regularly and derives significant benefit from it. Data downloaded from his Autoset machine shows that he has been using CPAP regularly over the past 8 days with average use 8:20 hours/day … Obstructive sleep apnoea is well controlled … [The Judge’s] license [sic] [that is driving licence] has been suspended by the RTA while awaiting this data which objectively shows that he is compliant with therapy and treatment is effective …”

(The document does not explain what “CPAP” is.)


	
	Dr Dodwell expressed his own conclusions as follows:
	


“His obstructive sleep apnoea, on the evidence provided, is well under control and no longer poses a direct medical problem in terms of his work. The associated and predisposing conditions (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus), on the information available, are coming under control and I note in particular that his weight is down to 124 having apparently previously been as high as 150kg …”


	
	It was accepted on behalf of the Crown that Dr Dodwell’s report was, for the purposes of s 69, a business record.
	
	
	As was the case with the letter from Ms Muggenthaler, the fact relevant to the appeal that the appellant sought to establish through Dr Dodwell’s report was that during the trial the judge fell asleep from time to time. Dr Dodwell’s report was not capable of achieving this directly. It seems to me that the appellant sought to use Dr Dodwell’s report in the following way:
	



	
	to establish that the trial judge suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea; and
	
	
	to establish that, therefore, from time to time during the trial, he fell asleep.
	



	
	For the purposes of s 69, “the representation” contained in Dr Dodwell’s report is that the trial judge did suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea. That representation is contained, not in any statement made by Dr Dodwell relying on his own observations, but by reference to the reports of Dr Jankelson. Dr Jankelson’s reports that are not in evidence.
	
	
	The position is further complicated by this circumstance. Whether the trial judge suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea is a fact. However, that fact is to be proved by a medical diagnosis, which is itself an expression of opinion. Section 76(1) of the Evidence Act provides:
	


“76  The opinion rule

(1)  Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.”

Sub-section (2) provides for a presently irrelevant exception.


	
	A further exception is provided by s 79, which excludes the operation of s 76 where the opinion is expressed by a person having specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, and the opinion expressed is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
	
	
	Thus, the representation contained in Dr Dodwell’s report is that Dr Jankelson was of the opinion that the judge suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea. There is here no question that Dr Jankelson held the necessary specialised training to express the opinion, and thereby to prove the fact. If Dr Jankelson’s report were in evidence, the present difficulty would not have arisen.
	
	
	It is not at all clear to me that the fact that the judge suffered from sleep apnoea could be proved indirectly, by proof that Dr Jankelson had an opinion to that effect. It may be supposed that Dr Jankelson’s opinion was based on information derived from either or both of two potential sources: (i) objective medical testing carried out or evaluated by himself; (ii) a history given to him by the judge.
	
	
	I have said that a medical diagnosis is an expression of opinion. That appears to be the assumption made by the High Court in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 at [37]. However, depending upon the circumstances, a medical diagnosis may come very close to the boundary that lies between an expression of opinion and a statement of fact. By way of illustration, where it is based upon objective evidence such as an x-ray, it may more closely resemble a statement of fact. But where it is based upon conclusions drawn from a range of symptoms (as to which conclusions medical practitioners may differ) it is more likely to be seen as the expression of opinion. Here, it may reasonably be inferred that Dr Jankelson’s diagnosis falls into the latter category.
	
	
	If Dr Jankelson’s opinion was based upon objective medical testing, and conveyed to Dr Dodwell through Dr Jankelson’s report, the republication made by Dr Dodwell would come within s 69(2)(b) - that is, it would be made on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who might reasonably be supposed to have knowledge of the asserted fact.
	
	
	On the other hand, if Dr Jankelson’s opinion was based on a history of symptoms provided to him by the judge, Dr Dodwell’s representation would not come within s 69(2)(b), because the information would be supplied by Dr Jankelson, who could not reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of those facts.
	
	
	The source of information upon which Dr Jankelson’s opinion was based is not identified. It has, therefore, not been shown that either of the tests of admissibility imposed by s 69(2)(a) and (b) has been met.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 69(2), Dr Dodwell’s report was capable of proving, as a fact, that Dr Jankelson had the stated opinion. It was not capable of going the further step and establishing the fact the existence of which is sought to be proved by the expression of that opinion: Evidence Act, s 76(1).
	
	
	The tender of the report was objectionable on other bases. There is nothing in the report that explains the effect of obstructive sleep apnoea. Specifically, there is nothing in the report from which any inference could be drawn that, because the judge suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea, he was likely to fall asleep from time to time while on the bench. If there were such references in the report, it would be capable of giving support to the observations of the appellant, Ms Machan, and others who made complaint.
	
	
	Further, the history recorded by Dr Dodwell includes that during 2004 the judge became aware that he was tired, but that he was not aware of falling asleep on the bench, and that the first complaint was lodged on behalf a defendant in another case in June or July 2004. It was then that the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnoea was made by his general practitioner.
	
	
	It is not reasonably possible to extrapolate from that that in February 2003 - more than a year earlier - the judge had suffered from the same complaint. For these reasons I am of the view that Dr Dodwell’s report should not be treated as part of the evidence in the appeal.
	
	
	Having disposed of those matters, I now turn now to deal with the admitted evidence upon which the appellant relied to establish that the judge’s supervision and control of the trial process was compromised, or the jury was distracted, in the way described in Cesan.
	


The evidence for the appellant


	
	In his affidavit, sworn 30 November 2008, the appellant deposed:
	


“2.  On the second day of my trial, I noticed that his Honour was sitting with his arms folded and eyes closed with his chin resting on his chest. It appeared to me that he was clearly sleeping.

…

6.  During the course of the rest of the trial which last some four weeks, I observed him sleeping on a number of other occasions.

7.  I distinctly remembered [sic] that on more than one occasion His Honour was snoring when evidence was being led before the jury.

8.  At the time of my appeal, at which I was represented by Ms Muggenthaler and Sue Kluss QC [sic] of counsel I informed Ms Muggenthaler that I wanted the issue of Judge Dodd sleeping during the trial to be raised as part of the appeal.

9.  I was advised that because I did not have a list of precise times and durations during which His Honour had been sleeping that nothing could then be done about it and so the matter was not raised as part of the appeal.

…

11.  Although I am unable to provide precise timings as to when the incidents of sleeping occurred, it was clear to me and to all those present including the members of the jury, that the incidents of sleeping were of significant duration and sufficiently frequent to cause me concern as to the fairness of my trial.

12.  It was clear to me that the members of the jury were very much aware of these incidents as I saw them smiling, nudging each other and rolling their eyes as if it were a matter of some amusement to them.

13.  Anyone present in court would have been able to observe this happening and would have shared my concern that the jury members were being distracted from their task of listening carefully to the evidence which was being presented to the court.”


	
	In her affidavit, sworn 6 February 2009, Ms Machan deposed:
	


“2.  On the second day of the trial, I noticed that his Honour was sitting with his arms folded and eyes closed with his chin resting on his chest. It appeared to me that he was sleeping. On some occasions he seemed to be in a deep sleep because his head would hang to one side and you could hear him snoring.

…

6.  During the course of the rest of the trial which lasted some three to four weeks, I observed him sleeping on a number of occasions.

7.  I distinctly remember when Detective Kelly was giving evidence, the Judge was asleep and the jury were laughing and looking at each other and shrugging their shoulders at the judge being asleep …

8.  On another occasion when the tape of the house search of Paul Duncan was being played on the 11th of March 2003 at the same time that Detective Kelly was giving evidence, the jury were distracted by the judge sleeping. The Judge could not even remember when the tape was played …

9.  I distinctly remember that on more than one occasion His Honour was snoring when evidence was being led before the jury.

10.  At the time of Paul Duncan’s appeal at which Paul was represented by Heidi Muggenthaler and Sue Kluss of counsel, I informed Ms Muggenthaler that Paul wanted the issue of Judge Dodd sleeping during the trial to be raised as part of the appeal.

11.  I was advised that because we did not have a list of precise times and dates and durations during which His Honour had been sleeping that nothing could then be done about it and so the matter was not raised as part of the appeal.

…

13.  Although I am unable to provide precise timings (apart from my recollections of points 7 and 8 of this affidavit) as to when the incidents of sleeping occurred, it was clear to me and all those present and more importantly the members of the jury, that the incidents of sleeping were of significant duration and sufficiently frequent to cause me concern as to the fairness of the trial.

14.  It was clear to me that the members of the jury were very much aware of These incidents as I saw them smiling, nudging each other and rolling their eyes as if it were quite funny that the judge was having a sleep. The jury were distracted and did not pay attention to the evidence presented by witnesses because when it came time for the jury to make their deliberation, they asked for the transcript - it was refused by the judge …”

Ms Machan’s complaint to the Judicial Commission was also admitted. Its relevant contents have been set out above.


	
	The very noticeable similarities in the affidavits of Ms Machan and the appellant may be explained by Exhibit A, tendered in the appellant’s case. Exhibit A was a letter written by Ms Machan to the appellant on 11 November 2008, nine days before he swore the affidavit. The purpose of the letter was stated to be to provide him with an “affidavit form” and to give him advice about formal procedures, as well as the information to be included in the affidavit. Inter alia, Ms Machan said:
	


“In your own words what you remember about the trial and the judge sleeping, and what steps we took and very importantly how you felt throughout the trial while the judge slept.” (bold in original)

After reminding the appellant of some factual matters (for example, the names of legal representatives) Ms Machan said:

“You must remember to include that you instructed Heidi Muggenthaler to include as one of the grounds of appeal was the judge sleeping through your trial.” (bold in original)

The evidence for the respondent Crown


	
	Ms Adams made it clear that she had first been asked to recall the events of the trial (which took place in 2003) late in 2014. However, she said that she had occasion to recall the trial because of subsequent publicity concerning the trial judge.
	
	
	Ms Adams said:
	


“8.  Insofar as my observations of [the trial judge] are concerned, I remember that a number of legal arguments arose during the trial that required determination by the trial judge. I recall that his Honour was attentive during all legal arguments and made appropriate rulings on each occasion. I considered him to have a sound grasp of the relevant factual and legal considerations at all times. I have recently re-read the decision of this Court [that is, the Court of Criminal Appeal] in R v Duncan and Perre … and been reminded of some of the legal issues that arose during the trial.

9.  I recall that there were a number of times during the trial that I saw the judge had his eyes closed. I cannot now estimate how many times I saw the judge with his eyes closed but during the one month trial I saw it perhaps 5-6 times, possibly more. On the occasions I observed this it occurred for some time periods measured in seconds rather than minutes. There is one occasion I can recall when the judge had his eyes closed and whilst I was wondering whether he was asleep he rejected a question whilst his eyes were still closed. I specifically recall this instance as it satisfied me that even if the judge’s eyes were closed he was still properly supervising the trial. Overall, I formed the view that closing his eyes for short periods of time was just something this judge did and it didn’t affect his ability to preside over the trial. Although my recollection is that defence counsel were also aware that the judge would close his eyes for short periods I do not now recall if we ever discussed it but we possibly did. I do not recall either defence counsel raising with me any concerns regarding the trial judge’s conduct of the trial.

10.  For most of the trial I was either adducing evidence from the large number of witnesses called in this matter, taking notes of what they said in cross-examination or cross-examining defence witnesses. Most of the time my attention was focussed on the evidence rather than the judge. It was during legal arguments or other times that I was addressing his Honour that I had the best opportunity to observe him and I do not recall him ever closing his eyes during those times. I cannot now recall what was happening in the trial when I saw the judge with his eyes closed …”


	
	Ms Adams further deposed that the circumstances of the trial and the court were such that she would not have been able to see more than four or five jurors when addressing the court or examining or cross-examining witnesses. She had no recollection of seeing any sign of the jury demonstrating amusement or distraction.
	
	
	Mr Stollery made two affidavits. In the first, sworn 17 November 2014, he said:
	


“14.  I recall that the issues in the trial were vigorously contested and that the trial was well supervised by [the trial judge] and was a very fair trial. Throughout the trial his Honour demonstrated that he was listening to and fully understanding the evidence.

15.  On a few occasions during the trial, I am unable to say on which days, I observed His Honour with his eyes closed and his head bent forward. He gave the impression that he might have been dozing. However, his conduct demonstrated to me that he was in fact listening very carefully to what was being said and often interjected or corrected an error in what had been said.

16.  I did not observe his Honour sleeping during the trial nor did I observe him sleeping and snoring.

17.  On the few occasions when I observed His Honour with his eyes closed I did not observe any corresponding reaction from the members of the jury. I do not recall the jury appearing to be distracted by his Honour’s conduct.

18.  At no time during the trial did I feel that there was any reason to be concerned about his Honours conduct. During the trial I was satisfied that he was discharging his obligations diligently and was giving the matter full and proper attention. I have no recollection of anyone making any comment during the course of the trial about His Honour appearing to be dozing. I first became aware of the suggestion in about March 2010.

19.  At no stage during the trial did I feel any sense of unease or any sense of disquiet in relation of the conduct of the trial. Throughout the trial His Honour demonstrated that he was listening and fully understanding the evidence.”


	
	Mr Greenhill SC deposed:
	


“3.  On occasions during the trial I noticed that his Honour had his eyes closed and appeared to be dozing. He did not noticeably snore.

4.  I did not form the opinion that his Honour was sleeping at any time during the trial.

5.  The trial involved many factual and legal issues …

6.  Whenever a point arose during the trial, whether of fact, of procedure or of law which necessitated his Honour’s attention he immediately opened his eyes, if they were shut, and promptly and effectively dealt with the issue. The manner in which his Honour so dealt with the multitude of issues which arose in this strenuously contested and difficult trial convinced me that, despite appearances, his Honour was indeed concentrating at all times during the trial.

…

9.  … I do not recall seeing any noticeable or objectionable re-action of the jury in this particular trial in relation to his Honour’s appearance on the Bench which caused me any concern.”


	
	Ms McSpedden deposed:
	


“6.  The trial continued and I had no cause for concern as to the judge being asleep, although there may have been times when he appeared to close his eyes for periods of time. The physical appearance of the judge was that he had a plump face and wore a totally ungroomed and wild red beard and moustache which in combination with his bushy eyebrows meant that little of his face was visible other than the top of his cheeks and eyes.

7.  I have no recollection of observing any reactions from the jury such as shaking of heads in disbelief, laughing and looking at each other and shrugging their shoulders or rolling their eyes, or apparently reacting to the judge in any way. Had there been such a reaction observed by me I would have had concern and considered what action ought to have been taken … I did not hear the judge snoring or snorting.

…”

Ms McSpedden expressly denied the words attributed to her by Ms Machan in her complaint to the Judicial Commission (see [11] above).

Ms Bremner annexed a copy of the transcript of the trial. It was highlighted to identify any occasion on which the trial judge engaged with counsel, whether for the purpose of dealing with objections to evidence or otherwise.


	
	Mr Stollery deposed to another aspect of the trial, of which no issue was made in this appeal. This evidence was (apparently) directed to the evidence in the appellant’s case concerning the conduct of the jury, particularly observations of the jury appearing to be amused, or smiling or “smirking”, attributed on behalf of the appellant to the conduct of the judge, but by Mr Stollery to another cause. Mr Stollery described the jury as “unusually attentive, good humoured and enthusiastic” throughout the trial. He did, however, observe that the foreman of the jury was sketching during the trial, and on numerous occasions he observed other members of the jury glancing in his direction while he was sketching. They smiled and on occasions appeared to be “very amused” by what they observed.
	
	
	Mr Stollery said that, after the trial and after the discharge of the jury, the court officer showed him two of the sketches that had been made by the jury foreman. One was a very detailed caricature of the trial judge, which Mr Stollery described as “expertly drawn and very humorous”. He related this to the smiling and smirking he had observed on the part of the jury during the trial. The second sketch was of an exhibit table which had been used for the purpose of storing exhibits in the trial, and which, it appeared, was inadequate in size for the task.
	


Findings of fact in the appeal


	
	The area of factual conflict in the evidence is as to the extent (if any) to which the judge was sleeping during the trial, and if he were, the consequences of that. The essential question, however, is the extent, if any, to which the jury was distracted by any established episodes of sleeping. The preliminary question is therefore whether this Court should find, as a fact, that the trial judge did fall asleep from time to time. Ordinarily, it is not open to one person to say that another is asleep. However, the appearance of sleep can be so compelling that it would border on absurdity not to accept some observations as establishing the fact. But that is not this case. The appellant’s witnesses were, on the whole, astute to avoid saying that the judge was asleep. Rather, they properly framed their evidence in terms of what they observed, and the conclusions they drew from those observations.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence was that, on the second day of the trial, it appeared to him that the judge was “clearly sleeping”. He observed this “on a number of occasions” during the trial. He distinctly remembered more than one occasion when the judge snored during the evidence. He thought the episodes were “of significant duration”, and were sufficient to cause him concern about the fairness of the trial (although he did not specify in what respect those concerns arose). He said that it was clear to him that the jury were aware of the circumstances, and appeared to be amused.
	
	
	As has been pointed out by Hall J, and as can be seen in the paragraphs extracted below, the affidavit of Ms Machan was, in many respects, virtually identical with that of the appellant. She, however, gave evidence of two specific instances of apparent sleep on the part of the judge. On one occasion, she said, the jury were laughing, and shrugging their shoulders; on the other they (appeared to be) distracted.
	
	
	This evidence is to be contrasted with that given on behalf of the Crown.
	
	
	Ms Adams saw that the judge had his eyes closed, perhaps five to six (possibly more) times during the month long trial. The episodes were to be measured in seconds rather than minutes. On one of these occasions, when the judge’s eyes were closed, he rejected a question. This reassured her that, notwithstanding the appearance of sleep, the judge was maintaining his concentration and supervision of the trial. Specifically, Ms Adams could not recall the judge ever closing his eyes during submissions by counsel. Mr Stollery’s evidence was along similar lines. He considered that, throughout the trial, the judge was listening to and fully understanding the evidence. He acknowledged that there were occasions when the judge appeared to be “dozing”, but said that the conduct of the trial demonstrated that he was, in fact, listening very carefully, and he often interjected or corrected errors. He did not observe any reaction from the jury.
	
	
	Mr Greenhill noticed that on occasion the trial judge had his eyes closed and “appeared to be dozing”, but said that he did not noticeably snore. He said that when a point arose that necessitated the jury’s attention, he promptly and effectively dealt with it. He also noticed no reaction by the jury. Ms McSpedden’s evidence was similar.
	
	
	It is difficult to reconcile the evidence. In my opinion, this Court should find, as a fact, that there were occasions when the judge at least appeared to be sleeping. So much is uncontroversial. I would infer, on the evidence, that there were occasions when he did in fact fall asleep. That this interfered with his supervision and conduct of the trial is not established. The highlighted transcript of the trial annexed to Ms Bremner’s affidavit was available to the appellant’s legal representatives. The attention of this Court was not drawn to a single instance that evidences lack of concentration, or failure to apply his mind to issues promptly as they arose on the part of the trial judge. The next and most important question concerns the consequences of some sleep episodes having occurred. (Cesan [112], [118]). It is in respect of this question that the conflict in the evidence becomes important. It is the observations of the appellant in para 12 of his affidavit, and of Ms Machan in para 14 of hers, and Ms Machan’s statement in her initial complaint to the Judicial Commission, that are the high point of the evidence for the appellant. To be contrasted with that is the evidence of Ms Adams, Mr Greenhill, Ms McSpedden and Mr Stollery.
	
	
	The evidence of the appellant and Ms Machan must be treated with some circumspection. That is not because of any reservations arising from observations of their demeanour. I found Ms Machan, in particular, to be a witness genuinely attempting to tell the truth. And I observed nothing in the demeanour of the appellant to cause me to doubt that he was also attempting to tell the truth. My reservations arise because of the manner in which their affidavit evidence was prepared. They are framed, in many paragraphs, in virtually identical language. When cross-examined about this, both gave the explanation that they had seen and heard the same things. That does not explain the uniformity of language in which they expressed their observations. I cannot escape the conclusion that their evidence is the result of collaboration. That does not apply, however, to Ms Machan’s complaint to the Judicial Commission, made in 2005, in which she raised concerns about the jury.
	
	
	By contrast, experienced counsel and solicitors made no observations of any jury distraction, at least by reason of the judge sleeping. (In adding the rider, I refer to the evidence of Mr Stollery concerning the artistic activities of the foreman.)
	
	
	On balance, I am not satisfied that any episodes of sleep by the trial judge adversely affected the jury’s attention to its duty. In saying this, I would accept that there was, or might have been, some mild amusement exhibited by members of the jury. But it was not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that they paid less than due attention to the evidence and the issues. I am mindful of Mr Stollery’s observation that this was an “unusually attentive, good humoured and enthusiastic” jury.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal. Ground 2 does not arise for consideration.
	
	
	Before making final orders, it is necessary to set out the events that have occurred since the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	The appeal was heard and judgment reserved on 2 February 2015. On 16 March the then Registrar of the Court received an email communication from the appellant’s legal representatives. The communication was in the following terms:
	


“We refer to the above matter and confirm our previous correspondence in regards to the appeal proper. We can advise that we request that no determination of the matter be made as we have advice from Mr Borck [sic] QC that the hearing should be re-opened as there is further material that is now available which may assist the Court of Criminal Appeal in the matter. This may necessitate one further hearing day in the matter.

We will revert to you very shortly with the further materials and submissions.

Please advise the presiding bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal in regards to the above matter and confirm that this is amenable to their Honours at your earliest convenience.”


	
	The Registrar sought the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) with respect to the request. The response was received in 18 March and was as follows:
	


“The Crown’s position is that it is a matter for the Bench as to whether they are amenable to delaying the publication of Judgment in this matter pending further particulars as to the reasons for this unusual request.

Our preliminary attitude is that the matter was extensively argued at the hearing and that insufficient information is presently available for the Crown to form a concluded view.

We reserve our position as to the merits of any application to re-open that may be filed in due course.”


	
	The appellant’s communication was also referred to the members of the Court who constituted the Bench. At the direction of the Bench, the Registrar wrote to the appellant’s legal representative on 20 March in the following terms:
	


“I refer to your email sent on 16 March 2015 in which you requested that no determination be made in these proceedings by reason of advice received from Senior Counsel that the hearing be re-opened. This advice was said to have been given ‘as there is further material that is now available which may assist the Court of Criminal Appeal in this matter’.

In order that your request may be considered, I require that you advise:

(1)  What is the nature of the material to which you refer in your email?

(2)  In what respect is it suggested that the material ‘may assist’ the Court?

(3)  When did such material become available to the appellant or his legal representatives?

(4)  Is it suggested that the material to which you refer was not available prior to the hearing before the Court on 2 February 2015.

I request that information on the above matters be supplied on or before 5:00pm 27 March 2015.” (italics in original)


	
	The response was received on 27 March, and was as follows:
	


“We can confirm that Counsel Mr Borick QC has requested that we respond to your letter and the specific questions posed therein as follows:

QUESTION 1: What is the nature of the material to which you refer in your email?

(a)  Expert evidence relevant to the ability of the foreman of the jury to properly concentrate on the evidence given at trial when he was making the drawings;

(b)  Expert evidence from Dr David Jankelson relevant to Judge Dodd’s physical and mental condition at the time of the trial.

QUESTION 2: In what respect is it suggested that the material ‘may assist’ the Court?

1.  Both issues referred to in our answer to Question 1(a),(b) are directly relevant to key aspects of the appellant’s case and the decision to make this application directly results from issues raised by the Court of Criminal Appeal during the hearing of the appeal.

QUESTION 3: When did such material become available to the appellant or his legal representative?

1.  In relation to Question 1(a) above subsequent to the appeal hearing;

2.  In relation to Question 1(b) above prior to the appeal hearing, but contact details became available subsequent the appeal hearing.

QUESTION 4: Is it suggested that the material to which you refer was not available prior to the hearing before the Court on 2 February 2015?

1.  No

Furthermore in relation to Question 1(a) above we have endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain the said drawings. In our respectful submission the Court should use its own resources to obtain those drawings according to Counsel and to enquire as to how the drawings became available to Mr Stollery.

In relation to Question 1(b) above, we are doing what we can to contact Dr Jankelson, and in our view his evidence is directly relevant to the issue of admissibility and relevance to the HealthQuest report dated 14 July 2005 and whether Judge Dodd was suffering from conditions as at the time of trial which would impact on an assessment of the appellants case on appeal. We will advise the Court by Thursday 2 April 2015 whether we are indeed able to make contact with Dr Jankelson.

Cousnel [sic] further advises that he wishes to make it clear that this approach to the Court is made to ‘assist the Court’ and is not intended in any way to shift the appellant’s basic position that the lawyers involved during the trial process should have instituted a proper inquiry irrespective of their own personal views in order to assess the consequences and that they failed to do so and accordingly a miscarriage of justice has occurred.

It is in this context that the public view of the administration of justice is vital in the determination of the appeal.”


	
	The Registrar again sought the views of the DPP who replied on 31 March:
	


“The view of the Crown is that the appeal is complete and we are awaiting judgment.”


	
	On 7 April, at the direction of the Bench, the Registrar wrote to the appellant’s legal representative, saying:
	


“Before dealing with your request, the Court has directed that you:

1.  File and serve an application setting out:

(i)  The precise orders you now seek, and

(ii)  Any additional ground or grounds of appeal on which you propose to rely.

In relation to (ii), you should bear in mind the terms upon which the case was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal;

2.  File and serve a short statement of the reasons for the application;

3.  File and serve copies of any reports or statements on which you will seek to rely; and

4.  File and serve a written submission identifying any findings of fact or conclusions for which you will contend.

The Court has not decided to re-open the hearing. Should the Court agree to re-open the appeal, it does not envisage that there will be a further oral hearing. The present view of the Court is that any application can be dealt with on the papers.”


	
	On 17 April the appellant’s legal representative replied:
	


“We refer to your letter of 7 April 2015, and advise that Counsel Mr K Borick QC has requested the following response be provided in relation thereto:

1.  The Appellant requires the Court to deal with our request.

2.  The Appellant will not file or serve any further application.

3.  The precise orders the Appellant seeks are clear:

i.  The appeal be allowed;

ii.  The conviction be set aside;

iii.  An order of acquittal be entered.

4.  There are no additional grounds of appeal.

5.  The fundamental issues involved are related to the administration of justice, not procedure.

6.  The Appellant files the following additional material:

The Affidavit of Mr Robert Arthur Coombs dated 19 February 2015.

7.  Dr David Jankelson has not responded personally to any approach the legal representatives for the Appellant have made, despite email requests and telephone communications with his office.

8.  In addition to our request the Appellant identifies the following findings of fact which the Court should make:

[there followed a little over two pages of factual matters the subject of item 8 of the communication]”

It is unnecessary to comment on the discourtesy of this communication.


	
	Annexed to the letter was a copy of an affidavit apparently sworn by a Robert Arthur Coombs. The content of the affidavit is as follows:
	


“1.  I have been retired for just over two years. I was employed as a Graphic Artist for John Fairfax and Sons working on The Sydney morning Herald, The Sun and the Illawarra Mercury. My total length of service was 38 years and part of my job description was court artist which included attending the trials of Ivan Milat, Graeme Potter and Brian Corrigan.

2.  I have been requested to give my professional opinion as a Graphic artist in the above matter currently before the courts.

3.  In regards to the Jury Foreman making a series of sketches, one being a detailed representation of the exhibits on the bar table and the other of the Judge with exhibits hanging from his wig, it is my opinion from my experience that you cannot complete detailed illustrations whilst giving the witnesses, barristers and judge 100% of your attention during the trial at the same time.”


	
	On 21 April the Registrar, at the request of the Bench, replied to the appellant’s legal representative as follows:
	


“Thank you for your response to my communication of 7 April 2015, which has been handed to all members of the Court. The Court notes that you do not propose to proceed to file any further application in these proceedings. In those circumstances, the Court will proceed to deliver judgment in due course.”


	
	In these circumstances, there is no basis for the re-opening of the appeal.
	
	
	It is well established that, once a proceeding (whether appeal or at first instance) is concluded and judgment reserved, leave is required before any further submissions are made, or evidence filed: see, for example Re Application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic) [2005] HCA 18; 214 ALR 422; 79 ALJR 881; Bale v Mills [2001] NSWCCA 226; Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322; Kendirjian v Ayoub [2008] NSWCA 194.
	
	
	As will be seen below, the factual matter to which the affidavit of Mr Coombs purportedly goes is potentially one of substance. However, it is not the subject of either of the existing grounds of appeal. It is not the subject of any application for leave to re-open, or any proposed amendment to the existing grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Both the Court, and the DPP, have sought to make clear to the appellant’s legal representative that leave is necessary before the Court could embark upon a consideration of any issues raised by the evidence. Leave cannot, and will not, be granted without an application. But the appellant’s legal representatives intransigently and discourteously decline to make the necessary application.
	
	
	On 24 April the Court afforded a further opportunity to the appellant’s legal representatives to apply for leave to re-open the appeal. The Registrar wrote to the appellant’s solicitor in the following terms:
	


“The Court is in a position to deliver judgment in this matter.

In order to give you an opportunity to consider your position, it will defer doing so until 4 May 2015.”


	
	A response was received on 30 April, in which the Registrar was told that the appellant’s legal representatives would not be present to take judgment due to other commitments, and added:
	


“Also we have taken instructions from Counsel and he is of the view that there is nothing further that is required to be submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal in regards to the Appeal prior to the decision being handed down.”


	
	The Court has no alternative but to proceed to judgment on the basis of the appeal as it concluded on 2 February of this year. I propose the following order:
	


Appeal against conviction dismissed.

 


	
	HALL J: These proceedings concern an appeal by Paul Parepano Duncan against his conviction on charges heard in the District Court of New South Wales. The appellant and his co-offender were each charged on indictment with a number of offences. Count 1 alleged that on 3 November 2001, at Wollongong, the appellant and his co-offender maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon one Christopher Wilson with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him, an offence pursuant to s 33 Crimes Act 1900. Count 2 related to an alleged offence of affray pursuant to s 93C of the Crimes Act, and Counts 3 and 4 alleged offences of causing malicious damage to property pursuant to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act.
	


Background


	
	The trial proceeded in the District Court between 24 February 2003 and 24 March 2003 before Dodd DCJ and a jury of twelve.
	
	
	On the latter date the appellant and his co-offender were found guilty of two offences, namely, the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act, and an offence of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The relevant factual circumstances concerning the offences are recorded below. In summary, the appellant and his co-offender were involved in a fight that erupted between two groups of young men in the vicinity of Stuart Park near Wollongong. During the fight, a number of assailants, armed with poles, a machete, and a wheel brace attacked the victim, Christopher Wilson, resulting in his permanent disability.
	
	
	On 18 August 2003, the appellant and his co-offender were sentenced. With regard to the first offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, the appellant was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years, each to commence on 30 November 2002. The head sentence was to expire on 29 November 2019, and the non-parole period was to expire on 29 November 2014. A concurrent fixed term of 2 years was imposed for the offence of affray.
	
	
	In 2004 the appellant and his co-offender appealed against their convictions to this Court and also sought leave to appeal against sentence. It is noted that no issue of the judge having fallen asleep during the trial was raised as a ground of appeal. The grounds that were relied upon in the 2004 appeal against conviction were identified in the Crown’s Written Submissions at [11] as follows:
	



	
	Permitting the Crown to cross-examine the witness Stephan Siljanoski pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act and in doing so his Honour failed to consider s 135-7 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of questioning the appellant in the course of a search warrant
	
	
	Directions to the jury regarding evidence of identification
	
	
	Directions to the jury as to lies
	
	
	Directions as to specific intent and the alternative available to the first count
	
	
	Directions to the jury as to the evidence of Steven Siljanoski
	



	
	On 8 December 2004, this Court delivered its judgment in the appeal: R v Duncan and Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431. The appeal against conviction was dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence with regard to the offence of affray was refused. Leave to appeal against the sentence with regard to the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent was granted, and the appeal against that sentence was allowed. The appellant was re-sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment of 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, each to commence on 30 November 2002. The head sentence expires on 29 November 2015, and the non-parole period expired on 29 November 2011.
	


Complaint to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales


	
	In April 2005, Ms Linda Machan, the mother of the appellant’s then girlfriend, made a complaint on the appellant’s behalf to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales about the judge’s conduct in the trial. A copy of this complaint was tendered (Exhibits “A1” and “A2”). In summary, the complaint alleged that the trial judge fell asleep on a number of occasions during the course of the trial. Ms Machan claimed that she heard him snoring and that she had mentioned this to the appellant’s solicitor and counsel.
	
	
	In a sworn declaration supporting the abovementioned complaint, Ms Machan claimed that she had reported her observations to the appellant’s legal representative but that they were “shrugged off”, stating, “… even though the panel of jurors were shaking the [sic] in disbelief at judge asleep and snoring. This was happening every day …”
	
	
	Subsequently, an application was made by the appellant pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for referral of his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The application was heard by this Court in its Common Law Division (Button J). The hearing was on the papers and on 26 June 2014, his Honour delivered judgment. On the application his Honour made an order pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that the whole case be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal against conviction under the Criminal Appeal Act. The present appeal was heard on 2 February 2015.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Notice of Appeal filed 16 July 2014 pleaded two grounds of appeal as follows:
	


Ground One – The appellant did not receive a fair trial and as such his conviction was the result of a miscarriage of justice due to the fact that the learned Trial Judge was asleep from time to time during the trial


	
	The Particulars of Ground 1 were as follows:
	


“a.   The Conduct of the learned Trial Judge in sleeping, dozing off, resting his chin on his chest with his eyes closed, leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed, supporting his head with his hands with his elbow on the bench, his eyes were shut, and his head would fall forward and even to one side and rest on his shoulder, snoring, snorting and half choking thus resulting in the appellant not receiving a fair trial;

b.   The learned Trial Judge was asleep and not cognisant of his immediate surroundings from time to time during the trial, throughout most of the trial, mostly every day, mostly in the afternoon at trial;

c.   The jury were distracted by the judge sleeping, and dozing off from time to time during the course of the trial;

d.   The appellant and the co-accused Mr Adam Perre observed the learned trial judge sleeping during the course of the trial;

e.   Eyewitness observations of the learned trial judge sleeping were made by Ms Linda Machan, Ms Heidi Muggenthaler, Mr John Perre, Ms Renae Perre, Ms Lucianna Rossi, Ms Tiana Simicic, Mr Michael Stollery;

f.   Expert evidence from Professor Leon Lack establishes that the learned trial judge’s dozing and sleeping would have resulted in a loss of attention and cognisance of the immediate situation, namely the trial itself;

g.   Expert evidence from Associate Professor Nick Antic establishes that the likely explanation for the choking/snorting noises thought to have been made on occasions by the learned trial judge was that they were the noise made by a sufferer of obstructive sleep apnoea recommencing breathing after an episode of sleep apnoea and further that during such episodes there would have been some inattention by the sufferer;

h.   The learned trial judge showed a total lack of respect for the judicial system during the course of the trial;

i.   The learned trial judge suffered from sleep apnoea at the relevant time during the course of the trial.”

Ground 2 – the lawyers representing the Appellant failed in their duty and their obligations and as such a miscarriage of justice resulted


	
	These grounds raise the following matters for consideration:
	



	
	The evidence concerning the alleged conduct of the trial judge during the trial;
	
	
	Whether the conduct of the trial judge during the trial required the legal representatives of the parties to respond by raising such conduct with the trial judge;
	
	
	The impact or the effect, if any, upon the jury of any inappropriate conduct by the trial judge.
	


The Factual Background to the Offences


	
	The nature of the issues raised in the present proceedings are such that a detailed analysis of the factual circumstances constituting and surrounding the offences upon which the appellant was convicted is not required. Accordingly, what follows is a summary of certain factual matters established at trial by way of background.
	
	
	On the evening of 2 November 2001, five young men, including one Christopher Wilson, drove from Sydney to the lighthouse in Wollongong where they met three young women.
	
	
	That group of young persons drove in two cars to nearby Stuart Park where there was a beach and a hut. All except Christopher Wilson left the two cars and went to the hut.
	
	
	The appellant and his co-offenders had been attending a party at another venue that night.
	
	
	In due course the appellant and his associates left the party and travelled to Stuart Park. Sometime later a confrontation occurred between a Mathew Michael, who had been with Christopher Wilson and his friends, and the appellant and another male.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant grabbed Mathew Michael’s phone and left with it. A large group of the appellant’s associates, about 15 in all, appeared in response to a signal given by the appellant. A violent confrontation then occurred.
	
	
	At one point, the appellant began to drive a vehicle erratically in the car park, causing Mathew Michael and his friends to scatter in order to avoid the car. The evidence was that the appellant drove at them, spun the car around doing ‘wheelies’, ‘burnouts’ and ‘spins’, reversing the car suddenly and generally driving in a dangerous manner.
	
	
	During the confrontation, Christopher Wilson was attacked with objects used as weapons by a number of the members of the group with which the appellant was associated. The events in this respect were summarised in the Crown’s Written Submissions as follows:
	


43.   When the weapons were produced the offenders yelled: ""You Lebbos —Get out of here!"" Matthew Michael and his friends managed to run away, not all without injury. Christopher Wilson was not so successful. He had been talking to one of the three young women, Jovana Ljubojevic, in a car in the car park. He was, therefore, not with the others of his group when the phone was taken.

44.   Chi Binh Nguyen (nicknamed ""Jap"") wielding the machete attacked him (T 192.22). The machete struck his hand and nearly amputated his right little finger no doubt in an attempt by Christopher Wilson to defend himself. He was then hit to the back of the head, which felled him to the ground. He was then surrounded by a group of young men including Chi Binh Nguyen (Jap), Chi Tarn (Big Chi) (T 480.5) and Adam Perre who struck him repeatedly with weapons and kicked and punched him. Perre used one of the legs of the ""For Sale"" sign he had taken from the boot of Tracey Saye's car to beat the victim, including his head, to the extent that the stick kept breaking into the shorter lengths ultimately found at the scene of the crime by police.

45.   After a number of people jumped in cars Carla Busuttil saw that one group remained. She gave evidence she saw the victim lying on the ground with Jap striking him with the machete. She also saw the appellant on top of him punching him, then get up and start kicking him in the stomach. She said the appellant then took the machete from Jap and started hitting him with it (T 543.43). Jap then started smashing car windows belonging to the Wilson group and returned to the victim to pull the appellant off the man (T 544.30). She then observed the appellant walk over to the cars and start smashing the windows (T 544.31).

46.   The victim suffered appalling injuries. Fragments of his skull and brain matter were found on the ground (T 751). The ambulance officer who was later to arrive, Mr Ryan, described Christopher Wilson having 6 to 7 head wounds, one on top of his head with exposed brain tissue coming from the wound. He had severe swelling to one of his eye orbits and a couple of welt marks to his legs (T 746). The right little finger was partly severed. Jovana Ljubojevic begged his attackers to stop but they would not, several times returning to the attack. One of his attackers told her to ""fuck off.” (Crown Submissions at [43]–[46])

The Evidence in the Appeal Proceedings


	
	The appellant relied upon the following evidence in the present appeal:
	



	
	Affidavit of the appellant, Paul Parepano Duncan sworn 30 November 2008;
	
	
	Affidavit of Linda Marian Machan bearing date 6 February 2009 but apparently sworn on 30 November 2009;
	
	
	Complaint made by Linda Machan to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales dated (Exhibits “A1” and “A2”);
	
	
	Petition of Linda Machan to the Governor of New South Wales dated 30 November 2009 (Exhibit “B”);
	
	
	Letter of Linda Marian Machan to the appellant dated 11 November 2008 (Exhibit “A” in the appeal proceedings, re-marked as Exhibit “C”);
	
	
	Handwritten notes of the appellant made on an unspecified date in 2008 – (initially marked as Exhibit “B” in the appeal proceedings, re-marked as Exhibit “D”).
	



	
	The Crown relied upon the following evidence:
	



	
	Affidavit of Natalie Jane Adams SC, Crown Advocate, affirmed 12 November 2014;
	
	
	Affidavit of Robert Patrick Greenhill SC sworn 13 November 2014;
	
	
	Two affidavits of Michael John Stollery, solicitor employed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, respectively sworn 17 November 2014 and 29 January 2015;
	
	
	Affidavit of Linda Margaret McSpedden affirmed 19 November 2014, and
	
	
	Affidavit of Linda Bremner sworn 19 November 2014.
	



	
	The appellant, Ms Machan and Mr Stollery were the only witnesses required for cross-examination.
	
	
	The nature of the grounds of appeal necessitated evidence being called during the hearing of the appeal in this Court.
	
	
	On 6 August 2014, an “Evidence Book” was filed on behalf of the appellant. Not all of the material within it was admissible. It is necessary to make some brief observations in relation to the material contained in the book.
	
	
	At the outset of the hearing of the appeal on 2 February 2015, Senior Counsel for the appellant was requested to identify the documents in the evidence book that were relied upon for the purposes of the appeal. Mr Borick QC, who appeared with Mr D Moen of counsel for the appellant, identified a number of documents at T 2-21. The Crown opposed the tender of many of the documents identified by Mr Borick, some on several grounds. Mr Moen indicated in respect of Document Number 1 (the Complaint to the Judicial Commission), and Document No 18 (the Petition of Linda Machan), that it was proposed to establish their admissibility during the course of Ms Machan’s evidence and following which he would tender the documents: at T  6.
	
	
	Ms Machan was called for cross-examination on 2 February 2015 and gave evidence as recorded at T 29-44. Ms Machan gave oral evidence in chief at T 29-31. She was taken by Mr Moen to several documents in the Evidence Book.
	
	
	The first document in this respect was Document No 1, her complaint to the Judicial Commission. The questions put to her were limited to her identification of the handwritten complaint and the typed version of it, both contained in the “book”. The handwritten and the typed versions were tendered and were before this Court, marked as Exhibits “A1” and “A2”. Ms Machan was then taken to Document No 18, the Petition by Ms Machan under a power of attorney given to her by the appellant. She identified the document which was tendered. The document was marked as Exhibit “B”. Ms Machan was then shown a document that was initially marked as Exhibit “A” in the proceedings, bearing the date 21 November 2008. The document has been re-marked as Exhibit “C”.
	
	
	In relation to the other documents that had been tendered at the outset of the hearing, the Court was advised by Mr Moen, at T 23, that the only other document the appellant would seek to tender was Document No 5 in the evidence book, a letter by Heidi Muggenthaler solicitor, to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. The tender was later rejected with reasons to be given in the final judgment of the Court on the appeal: T 28:40-45.
	
	
	There is conflict in the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant and the Crown as to the trial judge’s conduct and control of the trial. Accordingly, it falls to this court to resolve disputed matters. In making the necessary findings of fact, the reliability of the appellant and Ms Machan is critical.
	


Rulings on Evidence

Document No 5


	
	Document No 5 in the Evidence Book was tendered by Mr Moen on behalf of the appellant at T 23:35-42.
	
	
	The tender relied upon the provision of s 69 of the Evidence Act 1995 which is an exception to the hearsay rule in s 59 of the Evidence Act. 
	


“69 Exception: business records

(1)   This section applies to a document that:

(a)   either:

(i)   is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business; or

(ii)   at any time was or formed part of such a record; and

(b)   contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business.

(2)   The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made:

(a)   by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact; or

(b)   on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact.

(3)   Subsection (2) does not apply if the representation:

(a)   was prepared or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, an Australian or overseas proceeding; or

(b)   was made in connection with an investigation relating or leading to a criminal proceeding.

(4)   If:

(a)   the occurrence of an event of a particular kind is in question; and

(b)   in the course of a business, a system has been followed of making and keeping a record of the occurrence of all events of that kind;

the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that there is no record kept, in accordance with that system, of the occurrence of the event.

(5)   For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person's knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).”


	
	The onus of demonstrating the conditions of admissibility of evidence under the Evidence Act provisions lies with the tendering party: Lithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36; 281 ALR 223 at [17].
	
	
	Section 69 creates an exception to the hearsay rule in relation to business records. I proceed upon the basis that the letter written by Ms Muggenthaler and addressed to Mr Schmatt of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, dated 16 May 2006, was a business record within the meaning of s 69. However, as has been observed, s 69 does not render business records as such admissible. It concerns representations in a document which forms part of a business record within the meaning of s 69(1): Lithgow City Council v Jackson, supra, at [17]. The representation in question is admissible if s 69(2) is satisfied. In that respect, it is necessary to identify the ‘asserted fact’ and whether the same was something about which the person who made the document had personal knowledge.
	
	
	In relation to Document No 5 the following matters are noted:
	



	
	In the fourth paragraph there is reference to Ms Machan and Mr John Perre having raised the issue of the trial judge’s conduct. However, it is clear from Ms Muggenthaler’s letter that she did not have personal knowledge of either person having done so as she stated that she was not present at the meeting with the appellant’s legal representatives where Ms Machan and Mr Perre were said to have raised that matter.
	
	
	In the sixth paragraph of the letter Ms Muggenthaler referred to a comment she had made to Mr Schmatt of the Judicial Commission by telephone of having heard noises on “a couple of occasions” which she describes in the letter. However her statement or account is not one that asserted unequivocally that the noise was in fact one made by the trial judge. Her observation of having heard the noise to which she referred was not said to have been specifically based on her seeing or hearing the trial judge (as distinct from someone else present in the courtroom) make the noise.
	
	
	The sixth paragraph of the letter contained reference to observations Ms Muggenthaler said she made herself as to the trial judge leaning back in the chair “now and then” and a statement “…I cannot say that I know that he was asleep” having previously made a statement to the effect, not that the trial judge in fact closed his eyes, but that he “apparently” did so.
	



	
	As to (1) above, it is clear that whatever was said by Ms Machan and Mr John Perre was not said in her presence. Accordingly Mr Muggenthaler had no personal knowledge of what either may have said to others.
	
	
	As to (2) above, “personal knowledge” of a fact can only be derived from seeing or hearing an event: Lithgow City Council v Jackson, supra at [17]. Ms Muggenthaler’s statement does not assert that she saw and/or heard the trial judge make the noise on the two occasions to which she referred. The onus on the appellants of establishing the provisions of s 69 were met was not discharged.
	
	
	Even if that not be correct, the statement in question should not, in my opinion, as a matter of discretion be admitted, as Ms Muggenthaler’s account of hearing the noise leaves open the possibility that it was someone in the courtroom, not being the trial judge, who made the noise: s 135 Evidence Act. Additionally, I note that no affidavit from Ms Muggenthaler was produced and there was no suggestion that she was unable to be called to give evidence. Had she been called, her lastmentioned statement could have been tested and clarified.
	
	
	As to point (3), Ms Muggenthaler’s express statement that she could not say the trial judge was asleep evidences the limited nature and extent of her observations as to the trial judge’s appearance or conduct. It is a statement of a negative and her evidence is not probative of the fact as to whether the trial judge was in fact asleep at the point in time to which her statement relates.
	


The HealthQuest Report


	
	During the hearing of the appeal, a significant amount of time was spent on arguments concerning the admissibility of a document, annexed to Document No 23 in the Evidence Book, referred to as the ‘HealthQuest Report.’ The report was prepared by a Dr P Dodwell and is dated 14 July 2005. The report sets out a number of issues relating to the trial judge’s personal health, based essentially on a series of other reports and documents listed on page 1 of the report under the heading ‘Document Review’. It appears from the report that Dr Dodwell examined the (now retired) judge on an unspecified date. The report then sets out conclusions and recommendations.
	
	
	Dr Dodwell could not be located by the appellants to provide further evidence in the appeal: T 5:5.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the tender of the report on the following grounds:
	



	
	That the report was not in the form of an expert’s certificate: T 7:16.
	
	
	That the report had no relevance because it was directed to the trial judge’s condition in 2005 rather than 2003: T 9: 15-20.
	
	
	That the Crown had no opportunity to cross-examine Dr Dodwell due to his absence: T 9:45.
	
	
	That Dr Dodwell’s qualifications were not identified: T 10:20-24.
	
	
	That the document contained inadmissible material, particularly hearsay: T 9:22-25.
	



	
	The appellant submitted that the report should be admitted, regardless of Dr Dodwell’s hearsay reliance on other reports, because it formed part of a business record within the meaning of s 69 of the Evidence Act (T 13:42-45).
	
	
	While the Crown effectively conceded that the Report was capable of forming part of a business record of HealthQuest (T 8: 28-35), its admissibility was disputed on the ground of relevance.
	
	
	The HealthQuest report, in my opinion, should be rejected on the basis that it could not rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in these proceedings: Evidence Act, s 55. The report does not contain any observations, findings or opinions that are capable of affecting the assessment of a fact in issue concerning the trial judge’s conduct of the trial in 2003.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant submitted during the appeal hearing that the report was tendered to prove that at the time of the appellant’s trial, that is, between February and March 2003, the trial judge was suffering from a sleeping disorder or sleep apnoea. However, nothing in the report addresses or deals with the trial judge’s health in 2003. The report, which was prepared over two years after the appellant’s trial had concluded, was, as earlier noted, based, in part, upon a series of reports by other medical practitioners made on various dates between 1 September 2004 and 6 July 2005. The appellant submitted that references made by Dr Dodwell to these reports, as well as a reference in the report itself to the trial judge having been diagnosed with sleep apnoea on or about June or July 2004 went to the question of the trial judge having suffered from that condition at the time of the appellant’s trial over twelve months earlier: T 13:10-42. That submission, for the reasons stated above, must be rejected.
	
	
	Neither the report of Dr Dodwell nor the report of Dr Jankelson (referred to by Dr Dodwell), contains any opinion or assessment of the trial judge’s state of health or condition as at the period of the trial. The report is not admissible as it is not relevant to the issues with which this appeal is concerned: Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 at [31]
	


Evidence in the Appellant’s Case

Affidavit Evidence of Mr Paul Duncan


	
	The appellant’s affidavit evidence of 30 November 2008 was that the trial judge on the second day of the trial appeared to be sleeping. He said he brought this to the attention of his counsel, Ms McSpedden. He said that he observed the trial judge sleeping on other occasions and snoring “on more than one occasion” (at [7]).
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence on these observations were set out in the following paragraphs of his affidavit:
	


“2.   On the second day of my trial, I noticed that his Honour was sitting with his arms folded and eyes closed with his chin resting on his chest. It appeared to me that he was clearly sleeping.

3.   At the morning tea break I brought this to the attention of the instructing solicitor Heidie Muggenthaler and Linda McSpedeen QC [sic] of counsel.

4.   The advice given to me at that time was that I should not worry about it, that his Honour had the condition known as sleep apnoea, and that there was nothing that could be done about it.

5.   I felt frustrated and extremely anxious about the situation and thought that it was most unfair and was not consistent with the requirements of a fair trial.

6.   During the course of the rest of the trial which lasted some four weeks, I observed him sleeping on a number of other occasions.

7.   I distinctly remembered that on more than one occasion his Honour was snoring when evidence was being led before the jury.

…

11.   Although I am unable to provide precise timings as to when the incidents of sleeping occurred, it was clear to me and to all those present including the members of the jury, that the incidents of sleeping were of significant duration and sufficiently frequent to cause me concern as to the fairness of my trial.

12.   It was clear to me that the members of the jury were very much aware of these incidents as I saw them smiling, nudging each other and rolling their eyes as if it were a matter of some amusement to them.

13.   Anyone present in court would have been able to observe this happening and would have shared my concern that the jury members were being distracted from their task of listening carefully to the evidence which was being presented to the court.”


	
	Particular matters concerning this evidence will be considered below.
	


Affidavit Evidence of Ms Machan


	
	In paragraph [2] of her affidavit of 6 February 2009, Ms Machan stated that on the second day of the trial the trial judge sat “… with his arms folded and eyes closed with his chin resting on his chest”. She added:
	


“He appeared to me that he was sleeping. On some occasions he seemed to be in a deep sleep because his head would hang to one side and you could hear him snoring.”


	
	Ms Machan stated (at [3]) that at the morning tea break on that day she brought this to the attention of both the appellant’s solicitor, Ms Muggenthaler, and his counsel, Ms McSpedden. Whilst Ms McSpedden in her evidence acknowledged that Ms Machan made reference to the trial judge sleeping, she did not corroborate affidavit evidence of Ms Machan having reported hearing the trial judge snoring. Ms Machan, in her affidavit at [9], referred to the judge snoring on other occasions. At [6], she referred to having observed the trial judge sleeping “on a number of occasions”. It is noted that her statement as to having seen the trial judge asleep is an account in the nature of a conclusion without reference to the particular facts upon which that conclusion was based. Ms Machan earlier, in paragraph [2], referred to what “appeared” to her to be the judge sleeping. This stands in contrast to her statement to the effect that the trial judge was sleeping “on a number of occasions”.
	
	
	On the evidence of Ms Machan to the effect that she saw the trial judge “sleeping” on occasions during the trial and hearing him snore, the following matters are noted:
	



	
	There is evidence from witnesses who gave evidence at the hearing of the appeal that the trial judge on a number of occasions sat with his eyes closed.
	
	
	The question in relation to that evidence is whether on such occasions the trial judge was in fact asleep or whether on some, most, or all of them he was listening to and following the evidence with eyes closed. The distinction between the appearance of the judge sleeping based upon the fact of him having closed his eyes whilst adopting a posture as described in evidence, and whether he was in fact actually asleep on the evidence is one requiring consideration in this case.
	


Similarities in the Evidence of the Appellant and Ms Machan


	
	In his oral evidence in chief the appellant said that he wrote notes by hand setting out his recollection of certain trial events in 2003 when he was in Wellington Correctional Centre in the year 2008. A copy was tendered which became Exhibit “B” (subsequently remarked as Exhibit “D”). He said that Ms Machan had requested him to put down in writing his recollection of his observations of the trial judge during the trial. He said he sent a copy of his handwritten notes to Ms Machan who at the time was assisting him in relation to the present proceedings.
	
	
	Extracted below is the letter sent by Ms Machan to the appellant (Exhibit “C”). That letter reads as follows:
	


Dear Paul,

I have enclosed an Affidavit form for you to complete and send back to me.

Make sure you sign it in the presence of a Justice of the Peace, and sign where I have indicated.

Before you begin filling the details of your statement of what I mention in the paragraph below, write out what you want to say on a blank sheet of paper and then copy it, so you can pick up any mistakes you make. Then you get the Justice of the Peace to witness your signature.

In your own words what you remember about the trial and the judge sleeping, and what steps we took and very importantly how you felt throughout the trial while the judge slept. 

You begin with the date of your trial which started on 25th February 2003 and finished on or about the 20th March, 2003.

The Instructing Solicitor for the Trial was Heidi Muggenthaler. The Barrister for the Trial was Linda McSpedden and also present was a Solicitor named Sasha Wong. 

The Barrister who did your appeal was Sue Kluss.

You must remember to include that you instructed Heidi Muggenthaler to include as one of the grounds of appeal was the judge sleeping through your trial.

After you have completed filling in the form send it back to me as soon as possible.

Yours [sic] other mum,

Linda Machan


	
	In his affidavit, the appellant set out observations that he said he had made of the trial judge having fallen asleep on occasions during the trial. He said that he observed the judge snoring on a number of occasions. However, in his handwritten notes, Exhibit “D”, he referred to remembering the judge snoring “on one occasion”.
	
	
	When asked in the course of cross-examination if he could provide an explanation for the latter inconsistency, he indicated that he was not in a position to do so: T 53:15-20.
	
	
	As to Ms Machan and her role or involvement in assisting the appellant, she stated in her affidavit (at [1]) that she was present in court on every day of the trial except for one morning.
	
	
	In cross-examination by the Crown Ms Machan acknowledged:
	



	
	That her daughter had been the appellant’s girlfriend;
	
	
	That the appellant had, for a period, resided in Ms Machan’s home during a ten-month period whilst on bail: T 31;
	
	
	That she had had a very close relationship with the appellant and presently was “… his support person, I keep in touch with him every day”: T 32;
	
	
	That she had assisted the appellant in pursuing the present proceedings;
	
	
	That a number of the paragraphs in her affidavit were in similar in terms to paragraphs appearing in the appellant’s affidavit.
	



	
	In cross-examination Ms Machan gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   In fact, in terms of the affidavit, you spoke to Paul a lot about what was in his affidavit, didn’t you?

A.   Well, in what way do you mean?

Q.   You had contact with Paul before he made the affidavit, didn’t you?

A.   Yes, I did.

Q.   And I take it you spoke to him about what was going to go in the affidavit?

A.   Well, he needed to know information which he didn’t have and I had to remind him of what he needed to do.

Q.   You in fact I suggest reminded him of things that happened in Court, didn’t you?

A.   That’s right.” (T 32:26-39)


	
	Ms Machan, in her affidavit, (at [2]) set out observations she said she made of the trial judge on the second day of the trial. In that respect she stated:
	


“… I noticed that His Honour was sitting with his arms folded and eyes closed with his chin resting on his chest. It appeared to me that he was sleeping …”


	
	That evidence is in identical terms to the account given by the appellant in paragraph 2 of his affidavit save for the fact that he added the word “clearly” before the word “sleeping” which does not appear in Ms Machan’s affidavit. Ms Machan added to her observations in paragraph 2 of her affidavit the additional sentence, “On some occasions he seemed to be in a deep sleep because his head would hang to one side and you could hear him snoring.”
	
	
	Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Ms Machan’s affidavit are in identical terms to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the appellant’s affidavit.
	
	
	Paragraph 5 of Ms Machan’s affidavit concludes with the words “… not consistent with the requirements of a fair trial”. Those nine words also appear in paragraph 5 of the appellant’s affidavit.
	
	
	Similarly, in paragraph 6 of Ms Machan’s affidavit she stated “I observed him sleeping on a number of other occasions”. Those words are identical to the appellant’s statement in paragraph 6 of his affidavit, i.e., “… I observed him sleeping on a number of occasions”, except for the word “other”.
	
	
	Both Ms Machan (at [9]) and the appellant (at [7]) state in identical terms (except that the appellant uses the word “remembered” rather than “remember”):
	


“I distinctly remember that on more than one occasion his Honour was snoring when evidence was being led before the jury.”


	
	In this aspect, as noted above, the appellant’s affidavit evidence is inconsistent with his handwritten notes (Exhibit “D”), further discussed below.
	
	
	There are other paragraphs of the two affidavits containing similar or identical word formulations. See in this respect, paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the appellant’s affidavit, and paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Ms Machan’s affidavit.
	
	
	It is apparent from the above discussion as to the similarities of the contents in the affidavit evidence of both the appellant and Ms Machan as to the observations each is said to have made as to the conduct of the trial judge, that their evidence must be treated with caution. The close similarities in the affidavit evidence to which reference has been made above suggests that either Ms Machan or the appellant wrote the identical or near identical paragraphs and the other simply adopted what the other had written. The appellant in cross-examination denied that Ms Machan had told him what to put in the affidavit and denied being in close discussion with her about the preparation of his affidavit: T 49:19-21. In cross-examination the appellant also denied having a copy of Ms Machan’s affidavit when he completed his affidavit: T 49:10-15. Whilst it is always possible that one person may adopt another’s recollection of events as accurately reflecting his or her own recollection, there remains a risk that one of the two has been inappropriately influenced by the account of the other in recalling past events. That risk I consider exists in this case and is one that has materialised in this case. This applies, in particular, to the account given by each having heard the trial judge snoring on multiple occasions. As earlier noted, in the appellant’s handwritten notes (Exhibit “D”), the appellant referred to only one occasion on which he heard the trial judge snoring:
	


“… throughout the rest of the trial which went for … a further 4 weeks I observed him on a number of occasions falling asleep and distinctly remembering on one occasion when he was snoring when evidence was being presented to the jury …” (at p 1). (emphasis added)


	
	The appellant’s handwritten notes (Exhibit “D”) suggests that apart from the one occasion referred to by him in the notes, he did not otherwise have a recollection that the trial judge snoring “on more than one occasion” as stated in paragraph 7 of his affidavit, and as also recorded in Ms Machan’s affidavit. I am satisfied on the evidence that the probabilities are that the appellant has simply adopted what Ms Machan said in that latter respect in paragraph 9 of her affidavit.
	
	
	In so concluding, I do not consider that Ms Machan set out to deliberately or dishonestly influence the appellant in formulating his affidavit. That was not a proposition raised by the Crown. In cross-examination, Ms Machan frankly conceded that she provided assistance and support to the appellant in preparing for the present proceedings and that she has indeed been supportive of the appellant during the trial and thereafter.
	
	
	It is clear that Ms Machan was very motivated to help the appellant as far as possible but being a layperson and without the assistance of a lawyer in the preparation of affidavit evidence, it is likely that she inadvertently influenced him in adopting her version of events as to whether the trial judge was snoring rather than his own more limited recollection as recorded in Exhibit “D”.
	


Evidence in the Crown’s Case


	
	By way of preliminary observation I note the following matters:
	



	
	The evidence of Mr Greenhill and Ms McSpedden does not take issue or dispute the evidence in the appellant’s case that the trial judge was seen on occasions to close his eyes during the trial.
	
	
	Their evidence was to the effect that whilst his Honour at times closed his eyes, he was not in fact asleep on all or even most of the occasions when that occurred. In this respect, the evidence of counsel for the Crown, and for the appellant and his co-offender, established that the trial judge demonstrated, by his intervention and what the evidence indicates were appropriate rulings, that he was in fact listening to, and following the evidence notwithstanding that immediately before such interventions he, at times, had his eyes closed.
	
	
	The contention that the judge was snoring during the trial and that his conduct overall distracted the jury, was strongly disputed by all trial counsel and by Mr Stollery. Mr Stollery’s evidence is consistent with the appellant’s note in Exhibit “D” that if the trial judge did snore at all it was most likely limited to a single, isolated occasion.
	


Evidence in the Crown Case

Evidence of Linda Margaret McSpedden


	
	Ms McSpedden stated that she was briefed to appear for the appellant in his trial, instructed by Muggenthaler and Associates.
	
	
	Ms McSpedden’s evidence was that there was an occasion at some early point in the trial when, during an adjournment, Mrs Machan said words to the effect “That judge is sleeping. He shouldn’t be doing that”. As Ms McSpedden was focussed on the witnesses giving evidence she said she had not, at that point, noticed whether the trial judge was sleeping. She said she recalled saying to Ms Machan “I think he has narcolepsy – he has nodded off on other cases I have seen”. She said she did not believe that, as at 2003, she was aware of the term “sleep apnoea”.
	
	
	In her affidavit, Ms McSpedden stated:
	


""6.   The trial continued and I had no cause for concern as to the judge being asleep, although there may have been times when he appeared to close his eyes for periods of time. The physical appearance of the judge was that he had a plump face and wore a totally ungroomed and wild red beard and moustache which in combination with his bushy eyebrows meant that little of his face was visible other than the top of his cheeks and his eyes.

7.   I have no recollection of observing any reactions from the jury such as shaking of heads in disbelief, laughing and looking at each other and shrugging their shoulders or rolling their eyes, or apparently reacting to the judge in any way. Had there been such a reaction observed by me I would have had concern and considered what action ought to have been taken. I was intent on cross-examination of a number of young witnesses, many of whom had been under the influence of alcohol at the time they witnessed events. The reaction of the jury to the course of the evidence was a matter that was relevant for me to take into consideration. I did not hear the judge snoring or snorting.

8.   After the trial was considerably progressed I recall that Mrs Machan again spoke to me about the judge only on one further occasion. I do not know whether this was when Detective Kelly was giving evidence on day 12 of the 16 days of evidence but it was certainly towards the end of the trial. I recall that a conversation took place between Mrs Machan, Mr John Perre, the father of the co-accused, and Mr Greenhill SC, my instructing clerk Sascha Wong and me. I do not know if Mr Greenhill’s solicitor was present. Mrs Machan and Mr Perre expressed concern that the judge was falling asleep. I do not recollect the precise terms of that conversation. I had not noticed the episode they were referring to. I instructed Mr Wong to take particular note of the judge for the balance of the trial and to immediately draw to my attention any occasion when he appeared to go to sleep. From that point on my attention was also directed to making observations of the judge.

9.   I myself observed during the balance of the trial a number of occasions when his Honour closed his eyes, and I also observed that very quickly after that His Honour would interject in such a manner as to indicate to me that he was well and truly aware of the evidence. Mr Wong reported to me that while there were times he thought the judge had closed his eyes, he could not be definite because of his face being obscured by his facial hair.

10.   During the balance of the trial I do not recall any actions by the jury members that could be attributed to a reaction to the judge.”

Evidence of Robert Patrick Greenhill SC


	
	Mr Greenhill, as earlier noted, appeared for Adam Perre in his joint trial with the appellant. Mr Greenhill’s evidence dealt with both the issue of the trial judge’s superintendence of the trial and the question of the impact, if any, of the judge’s conduct on the jury.
	
	
	Mr Greenhill stated in his affidavit:
	


“2.   As I recall, the trial lasted for about one month.

3.   On occasions during the trial I noticed that his Honour had his eyes closed and appeared to be dozing. He did not noticeably snore.

4.   I did not form the opinion that his Honour was sleeping at any time during the trial.

5.   The trial involved many factual and legal issues as can be seen from this honourable Court’s judgment in the Appeal of Duncan and Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431 and in the transcript of the trial.

6.   Whenever a point arose during the trial, whether of fact, of procedure or of law which necessitated his Honour’s attention he immediately opened his eyes, if they were shut, and promptly and effectively dealt with the issue. The manner in which his Honour so dealt with the multitude of issues which arose in this strenuously contested and difficult trial convinced me that, despite appearances, his Honour was indeed concentrating at all times during the trial.

7.   At some stage Perre’s father raised with me as to whether the Judge was sleeping and I told him that, in my opinion, he was not. I doubt that I told him that the Judge had sleep apnoea as I believe that I did not know that to be the case at the time.

8.   Without intending any criticism of Perre’s father, understandably he was very much affected by the conviction, and sentence, of his son.

9.   As to the alleged behaviour of the Jury, during my lengthy practice as a defence lawyer I habitually and closely watch the jury in any trial in which I appear for the Accused. I do not recall seeing any noticeable or objectionable reaction of the jury in this particular trial in relation to his Honour’s appearance on the Bench which caused me any concern.”

Evidence of Natalie Jane Adams SC


	
	Ms Adams has been New South Wales Crown Advocate since 28 November 2011. Between 2002 and 2011 she was a Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	Ms Adams was the Crown Prosecutor briefed in the prosecution of the appellant along with his then co-accused, Adam Perre.
	
	
	Ms Adams set out in her affidavit details of the circumstances in which she came to swear her affidavit in these proceedings, including the fact of having read the judgment of his Honour Button J in the appellant’s application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the nature and extent of her recollection of the prosecution and trial itself.
	
	
	Ms Adams’ recollections of the trial judge’s conduct during the trial specifically addressed, amongst other matters, his Honour’s superintendence and control of the trial as it appeared to her. She stated that a number of legal arguments arose during the trial. His Honour, she recalled:
	


“… was attentive during all legal arguments and made appropriate rulings on each occasion. I considered him to have a sound grasp of the relevant factual and legal considerations at all times” (at [8]).


	
	Ms Adams stated:
	


“9.   I recall that there were a number of times during the trial that I saw the judge had his eyes closed. I cannot now estimate how many times I saw the judge with his eyes closed but during the one month trial I saw it perhaps 5-6 times, possibly more. On the occasions I observed this it occurred for time periods measured in seconds rather than minutes. There is one occasion I can recall when the judge had his eyes closed and whilst I was wondering whether he was asleep he rejected a question whilst his eyes were still closed. I specifically recall this instance as it satisfied me that even if the judge’s eyes were closed he was still properly supervising the trial. Overall, I formed the view that closing his eyes for short periods of time was just something this judge did and it didn’t affect his ability to preside over the trial. Although my recollection is that defence counsel were also aware that the judge would close his eyes for short periods I do not now recall if we ever discussed it but we possibly did. I do not recall either defence counsel raising with me any concerns regarding the trial judge’s conduct of the trial.”


	
	Ms Adams explained the practical circumstances which prevented her from maintaining continuing observations on the trial judge. These included the need for her to focus on the evidence and taking notes of the evidence in cross-examination. Her best opportunity to observe the judge, she stated, was in the course of legal arguments: at [10].
	
	
	As to the assertions made by Ms Machan to the effect that the jurors were shaking their heads, nudging each other, laughing and rolling their eyes at various times throughout the trial, Ms Adams’ evidence was that the first time she became aware of such an allegation was when she read assertions to that effect as recorded in the judgment of Button J: at [12].
	
	
	Ms Adams described certain physical features of the courtrooms in the Downing Centre District Court. Ms Adams estimated that if the Crown Prosecutor stood facing straight ahead towards the witness box or the judge, he or she would probably be able to see four or five jurors out of his or her peripheral vision.
	
	
	To see the rest of the jury, she said, would require the Crown Prosecutor to turn and face the jury. The jury box is less than a metre away: at [13].
	
	
	Ms Adams stated that it was her practice to only look directly at the jury when delivering her opening and closing address or if watching whilst an exhibit was being handed around or when the jurors filed in or out of court, or when commencing an argument or calling a witness.
	
	
	In paragraph 15 of her affidavit, Ms Adams states;
	


“I do not now have any recollection of seeing or hearing any jurors doing anything to suggest they were distracted by the trial judge. Nobody ever brought any such concerns to my attention during the trial. If anyone had brought to my attention concerns about any of the jurors being distracted I would have requested my instructing solicitor or anyone else present in court associated with the prosecution team to be on the lookout for any such matters and I would try to do so as well. This has occurred in other trials I have conducted over the years. If I was satisfied that any member of the jury was consistently distracted I would have spoken to defence counsel and either raised it with the trial judge or sought instructions from Director’s Chambers about it.”

Evidence of Michael John Stollery


	
	Mr Stollery is a solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a position he has held since October 1990.
	
	
	Mr Stollery had the care, control and management of proceedings relating to the appellant and his co-accused.
	
	
	Mr Stollery said he was present in the courtroom with Ms Adams throughout the trial and paid close attention to the proceedings. He took detailed notes and reviewed the daily transcript.
	
	
	In his first affidavit, Mr Stollery stated:
	


“10.   I recall the jury, they were unusually attentive, good humoured and enthusiastic throughout the trial. I observed the foreman of the jury sketching during the trial.

11.   On numerous occasions during the trial I observed members of the jury glancing in the direction of the foreman, whilst he was sketching. They smiled and on occasions appeared to be very amused by what they observed.

12.   At the conclusion of the trial, I recall being in the courtroom when one of the court officers showed me two sketches. I was told that the sketches had been compiled by the foreman of the jury and that he had asked the court officer to give one of the sketches to Judge Dodd. That sketch was a very detailed caricature of Dodd DCJ. The sketch was expertly drawn and very humorous. I immediately appreciated why some members of the jury had smiled and smirked at regular intervals during the trial.

The second sketch was of similar size to the one of Dodd DCJ, it was about A3 size on what appeared to be butchers paper. The second sketch depicted a very small table at the bottom of the page, it was titled ‘The Exhibit Table’, and each exhibit tendered during the trial was drawn, marked with the exhibit number and appeared stacked on the little table so that the little table was stacked to overflowing with exhibits.

13.   I recall being quite astonished by the skill, detail and good humour of the sketch. As with the first sketch, as soon as I saw it I immediately appreciated why some members of the jury were smiling and smirking during the trial.” (at [10]-[13])


	
	Mr Stollery said that the issues in the trial were vigorously contested. He said:
	


“… the trial was well supervised by his Honour Judge Dodd and was a very fair trial. Throughout the trial His Honour demonstrated that he was listening to and fully understanding the evidence.” (at [14])


	
	Mr Stollery stated:
	


“15.   On a few occasions during the trial, I am unable to say on which days, I observed his Honour with his eyes closed and his head bent forward. He gave the impression that he might have been dozing. However, his conduct demonstrated to me that he was in fact listening very carefully to what was being said and often interjected or corrected an error in what had been said.

16.   I did not observe His Honour sleeping during the trial nor did I observe him sleeping or snoring.

17.   On the few occasions when I observed His Honour with his eyes closed I did not observe any corresponding reaction from the members of the jury. I do not recall the jury appearing to be distracted by His Honour’s conduct.

18.   At no time during the trial did I feel that there was any reason to be concerned about His Honour’s conduct. During the trial I was satisfied that he was discharging his obligations diligently and was giving the matter full and proper attention. I have no recollection of anyone making any comment during the course of the trial about His Honour appearing to be dozing. I first became aware of the suggestion in about March 2010.

19.   At no stage during the trial did I feel any sense of unease or any sense of disquiet in relation to the conduct of the trial. Throughout the trial His Honour demonstrated that he was listening and fully understanding the evidence.

20.   I am aware of the High Court decision in Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358.

I have read the decision and can say without reservation that at no stage during the Duncan Perre trial did I observe His Honour Judge Dodd conduct himself in anyway similar to that described in the decision of Cesan.” (at [15]-[20])


	
	In his second affidavit Mr Stollery stated:
	


“On numerous occasions during the trial I observed members of the jury glancing in the direction of the foreman. From time to time the hand movements of the foreman suggested to me that he was sketching. Some of the other jurors, on a number of occasions, appeared to be very amused by what they observed.” (at [6])


	
	Mr Stollery said, in his second affidavit, that after the sentencing proceedings had been concluded and whilst packing files away he had a short conversation with a Court Officer who had been in court during the sentence hearing and at various times during the trial. Mr Stollery stated:
	


“9.   The Court Officer showed me a sketch, it was on white paper about A3 size or possibly larger. At the foot of the page a small table had been drawn and written on the table were the words ‘Exhibit Table’. Various items had been drawn and stacked on the exhibit table so that there was a large pile of sketched items up to the top of the page. The items were tagged and numbered. The items were skilfully drawn. I immediately recognised the items depicted in the sketch as the exhibits that had been tendered in the trial.

10.   The Court Officer informed me that the sketch had been prepared during the trial by the foreman of the jury.

11.   The same Court Officer informed me that the foreman of the jury had asked him to give the sketch to me at the end of the proceedings.

12.   The same Court Officer then showed me a second sketch. It was on similar sized white paper. The sketch was a very detailed cartoon style caricature of Judge Dodd. It was skilfully drawn and very amusing.

13.   The same Court Officer told me that the foreman of the jury had asked him to give the second sketch to Judge Dodd at the end of the proceedings.

14.   To the best of my recollection there were two Court Officers in the courtroom at the time the conversation took place about the two sketches. I do not recall anyone else being present in the courtroom at the time.”


	
	In his oral evidence in cross-examination, Mr Stollery confirmed that the foreperson of the jury had made two sketches. He was referred to his affidavit, sworn 29 January 2015, and gave evidence as follows:
	


“Q.   Right thank you. Paragraph 11, and it says this, “the same court officer informed me that the foreman of the jury had asked him to give the sketch to me at the end of proceedings”. Can I ask you this at all. Prior to receiving these sketches, you had observed the foreman obviously sketching on a number of occasions, during the trial?

A.   I’d form the impression that he was sketching.

Q.   How did you form that impression?

A.   Because of his hand movements. I couldn’t actually see what he was doing but his hand movements were not consistent with writing. It wasn’t a continuous movement of the hand.

Q.   Was this at times that you observed that occurring, that you also observed perhaps his Honour closing his eyes or not?

A.   In what sort of timeframe - at the same time or.

Q.   At the same time, you obviously had your head on a swivel, so to speak, so you were looking at the jury and then no doubt looking at his Honour and looking at the witnesses. Can you tell their Honours at any time that you observed the foreman of the jury sketching, that his Honour was in a position whereby his eyes were closed?

A.   I couldn’t say. I don’t recall the two going together.

Q.   Where is the sketch, at least the one in relation to what you described as being the humorous one?

A.   Well, the sketches were both

Q.   Just deal with it one at a time, the humorous one that you’ve described in your most recent affidavit, and I’ll come to that in a moment, but where is it at the moment?

A.   I received one sketch. I was shown the other one in the courtroom. The sketch that I received, was on what are recorded as being something like butcher’s paper.

Q.   Yes I understand that.

A.   It was at least A3 size if not a big bigger.

Q.   The question I asked - I’m just asking where it is - where you last saw it?

A.   I kept it in my office in Wollongong up until about 2004 when the director’s office in Wollongong moved to another location. That move was carried out by removalists and the sketch was lost during that move.” (T 54-55)


	
	Mr Stollery described one of the sketches:
	


“Q.   Can you tell their Honours what was depicted in that diagram as you sit here right now or not?

A. My recollection was that it was a similar size piece of butcher’s paper, about the size as the first sketch that I saw. It was of the torso, upper torso and head and wig of Judge Dodd. It’s something that I only saw the once whereas the other one I had in my office for quite some time but my recollection is that it incorporated some of the exhibits dangling from his Honour’s wig and there were other features that I can’t now dredge up because it was too long ago.

Q.   Did it depict the eyes of the judge as closed or open, can you recall Mr Stollery?

A.   I have no recollection of that.

Q.   And so the humorous side of this diagram that you observed was the dangly bits of the exhibits of the judge’s head, is that right?

A.   It was in the detail. It was extremely well drawn, the person who drew it had obvious talent. The detail in the wig and the judge’s robes I remember as being quite exceptional.

Q.   You only saw that the one time I think you said?

A.   Only saw that once in the courtroom.

Q.   So who then retained possession of that?

A.   My recollection is that the court officer who was filling in as associate to Judge Dodd had indicated to me that the foreman had asked him to give that to the judge.” (T 56:24-50)


	
	In relation to his observations during the trial, Mr Stollery gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   And you say you don’t have any recollection at all, do you distinctly remember in any way shape or form that the eyes depicted were firstly covered by glasses or not?

A. My recollection is of the detail incorporated in the wig and the gowns and the exhibits that were attached to the wig and I’ve got no recollection of the eyes at all.

Q.   You did observe his Honour however appear to be dozing off during the course of the trial didn’t you?

A.   I saw him on a few occasions with his head bent forward with his eyes closed.

Q.   And making sort of snuffling noises, as one sometimes does as they’re waking from a deep sleep or a semi sleep?

A.   No, I have no recollection of that.

Q.   Your focus wasn’t at all at material times on his Honour, we can agree on that point presumably?

A.   Well visually yes but I was also listening to the details of what was happening in court at all times.

Q.   Did you and was it raised between yourself and any of the prosecutors any concerns at that stage about his Honour dozing off during the course of the trial?

A.   None whatsoever.

Q.   Was it ever raised with you by any defence counsel that they had some concerns, I’m talking about this trial here of Mr Duncan, any stage during the trial was it raised with you?

A.   Not at any stage, I have no recollection of anyone raising this informally or in any other way. It first came to my attention I think in March 2010.” (T 57:10-40)


	
	Finally, Mr Stollery gave the following evidence towards the end of the cross-examination:
	


“Q.   In this paragraph however you describe the foreman of the jury being a graphic artist. I want to ask you this how did you know at that time when you were putting this document together that that foreman of the jury was a graphic artist?

A. I don’t know with certainty, that’s what the court officer indicated to me in our conversation in the courtroom.

Q.   Did you have any interaction with the foreman of the jury outside of the court at any time?

A.   None whatsoever.

Q.   Did you at any time make eye contact with the foreman of the jury whilst he was sketching and doodling during the course of the trial?

A.   Not that I recall, no.

Q.   I think you said this also in that paragraph and I just want to clarify this large drawing, and can I assume there what you’re referring to is the one that is on the butcher’s paper, that is the exhibits diagram that was somewhat humorous?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You said this, “This large drawing was given to me at the end of the trial and was an outstanding reference tool for all on the jury.” This humorous document being an outstanding reference tool, how did you come to the view that it was an outstanding reference tool? What did it depict as being?

A.   It depicted all of the exhibits and their number and they were on one document and they were gradiated as they were stacked up in the document and it occurred to me that it was a very useful reference tool for someone considering the matter and I retained that and I regret that I’ve lost the sketch” (T 59: 19-47)

Consideration


	
	The primary issue raised in this appeal is whether there was, by reason of the trial judge’s conduct during the trial, a miscarriage of justice. The answer to that question requires consideration of the evidence as to the following factual questions:
	



	
	Whether the trial judge failed to attend to the evidence and the arguments of the parties or otherwise failed to appropriately control and conduct the proceedings. In particular, whether the trial judge failed to perform his judicial function by reason of periods of sleep during the trial.
	
	
	Depending upon the factual findings made in respect of (1) above, whether any failure or failures in the trial judge’s conduct required the legal representatives of the parties to the proceedings to have raised such matters with the trial judge.
	
	
	Depending upon the factual findings made in respect of (1) above, whether any inappropriate conduct by the trial judge during the trial impacted upon or affected the jury.
	



	
	In Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen (2008) 236 CLR 358; [2008] HCA 52 the issue in that case was whether a miscarriage arose in circumstances in which the trial judge was asleep for periods during the trial and whether the consequence of such conduct represented a departure from proper conduct of the trial. French CJ stated at [74]:
	


“In a jury trial it is not the judge but the jury which finds the facts. It reaches a verdict by applying to the facts the law as explained to it by the judge. But the judge's function in such a trial is not exhaustively described by saying that he or she rules on questions of law including the admissibility of evidence, sums up to the jury, directs the jury on matters of law and otherwise acts as a kind of referee between prosecution and defence. These are all attributes of a more broadly expressed function of supervision and control of and participation in the trial process. That is a function which has long been understood. It requires no less a standard of attentiveness to the evidence and the conduct of the trial generally than the standard applicable to a judge sitting alone. Indeed, because of the involvement of the jury it requires more.”


	
	In Cesan the question was whether there were substantial discontinuities in the judge’s superintendence and control of the trial due to the alleged sleep episodes and, if so, whether that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. On that question, French CJ observed:
	


“If, by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice. The question whether there has been the reality or appearance of a substantial failure by the judge to perform his or her duty will require assessment of a number of factors including:

1.   Whether the conduct of the judge can be said to have affected the outcome of the trial.

2.   Whether the conduct of the judge has created a risk that the outcome of the trial may have been affected.

3.   Whether counsel raised the question of the trial judge's conduct at the trial.

4.   Whether the jury appeared to have noticed or to have been distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct.

None of these factors, taken by itself, is determinative. There is an overall assessment to be made in deciding whether a failure or apparent failure by the judge for whatever reason to attend to the duty of supervising and controlling the trial process amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In so saying it should be emphasised that the duty of counsel in a case of non-trivial inattention or sleep episodes is to draw these issues to the attention of the judge in the absence of the jury. The failure of counsel to do so may support an inference that the judge's conduct did not amount to a substantial failure in the judicial process at trial. However, it will not always be determinative.” (at [93])


	
	The evidence in the present appeal, in my assessment, establishes the following matters:
	



	
	The trial judge from time to time during the trial closed his eyes, and folded his arms whilst doing so. On certain of those occasions he also rested his chin on his chest.
	
	
	The trial judge’s posture and conduct as described in (1), was capable of giving the appearance of sleep episodes.
	
	
	The matters in (1) and (2) must be considered in context. As stated by the Chief Justice in Cesan, an overall assessment is to be made. That requires in this case consideration of evidence given by a number of witnesses that indicates that though the judge appeared at times to have periods of sleep, he in fact was listening to and following the flow of evidence. This was indicated by his verbal responses to the evidence and the trial judge’s demonstrated capacity to make ex tempore rulings throughout the trial.
	
	
	The affidavit evidence of the legal representatives in particular, provides consistent and strong support for a finding that during the trial the trial judge displayed an understanding of the issues and the evidence in what was a strongly contested trial. This was demonstrated by his ability and capacity to make rulings which were assessed by trial counsel as having been appropriate.
	
	
	There was no attack in this appeal upon the trial judge’s summing-up or, in particular, upon his trial directions. This is at least consistent with the fact that his Honour maintained a sufficient and appropriate command and control of the trial.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Machan, that she heard the judge snoring at various times during the trial, is not consistent with the evidence of trial counsel and that of Mr Stollery whose evidence I accept. Upon close consideration I do not consider that the appellant’s evidence as to the judge snoring on multiple occasions is reliable or cogent evidence. In his handwritten statement written many years after the trial, the appellant could recall and record only one occasion when he said he heard the judge snore. He was unable to explain his later inconsistent affidavit account of hearing snoring on a number of occasions. The most plausible and probable explanation, on the probabilities, is that his affidavit account of hearing snoring was the result of having discussed that aspect of the matter with Ms Machan.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Machan of seeing jurors acting in a way that conveyed that they were being distracted by the trial judge falling asleep is not corroborated by what I consider to be reliable evidence given by trial counsel and Mr Stollery. Her account of hearing the trial judge snore was made a considerable time after the trial concluded. Her evidence as to the jurors being distracted by the trial judge was given for the first time many years after the event. Ms Machan’s evidence on this latter point was very strongly refuted by the evidence of the legal representatives. Mr Greenwood’s evidence, in particular, was that it was his practice in criminal trials to focus his attention upon the jury and that he did not see any member of the jury during the trial indicate or convey any reaction to the trial judge that was consistent with or indicative of distraction having been caused by the trial judge’s conduct.
	
	
	Having closely considered the evidence of Ms Adams SC, Ms McSpedden, Mr Greenwood SC, and Mr Stollery which, as I have stated, I accept as reliable evidence, I find that the jury were not distracted during the trial by the trial judge’s conduct as Ms Machan stated in her affidavit. In so concluding, I consider that any smiling or signs of amusement by one or more jurors on one or more occasions during the trial on the probabilities arose by reason of humorous or amusing aspects of the sketch or sketches produced by the foreman of the jury during the trial as described in evidence by Mr Stollery.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have concluded that the trial judge was not repeatedly asleep during the trial but that his Honour in fact exercised appropriate superintendence and control of the trial and conducted it according to law. In particular, I do not accept that the trial judge was snoring from time to time during the trial.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that his Honour did close his eyes at various times during the trial and adopt a posture at such times as earlier described, on the evidence that was not inconsistent with him listening to and following the evidence. This is indicated by the trial judge’s demonstrated ability and actions in responding appropriately to the evidence led at such times as and when required.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that it is possible that the trial judge may on occasions have had momentary sleep episodes, on the evidence if they occurred they were not sufficient to establish that the trial judge “substantially failed to discharge” his duty of supervision and control of the trial process: see Cesan, supra, at [93]. That conclusion finds solid support in the evidence of trial counsel and that given by Mr Stollery. That evidence establishes that the trial judge in fact exercised supervision and control of what, on the evidence, was a vigorously contested trial of some complexity. The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that the superintendence of trial met the high standards expected of a trial judge such as to exclude the possibility of a miscarriage of justice due to his Honour’s conduct.
	
	
	It follows that I reject entirely the evidence adduced in the appellant’s case to the effect that the jurors were distracted by the trial judge’s alleged conduct. I find that no such distraction as alleged occurred.
	
	
	Ground 1, in my opinion, is without merit and should be dismissed.
	
	
	It follows that there is no basis for the contention in Ground 2 that the appellant’s legal representatives failed in any way in their duty to raise the trial judge’s conduct. Accordingly, that ground should, in my opinion, be dismissed.
	


Order


	
	The order I propose is that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I have had the great advantage of reading Hall J’s judgment in draft. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour for the reasons he gives. But I wish to add some additional reasons about three matters: first, the admissibility of Dr Dodwell’s report; secondly, an additional reason for preferring the evidence of the four lawyers appearing in and instructing at the trial (whose affidavits were read) to the evidence of Ms Machan and Mr Duncan; and thirdly, another matter arising out of the evidence of Mr Stollery, one of the lawyers.
	


The admissibility of Dr Dodwell’s report


	
	Dr Dodwell’s report does not purport to be a certificate of expert evidence under s 177 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), but it was tendered as a business record of Health Quest under s 69. There is no question, as the Crown conceded, that the report was capable of forming part of its business records. The condition of admissibility set out in s 69(2)(b) is that the hearsay rule does not apply to a business record (so far as it contains a representation) if the representation, inter alia, was made on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had, or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the fact asserted in the representation. Section 69(2) needs to be read in the light of the requirements of s 69(1). These are, relevantly in the present context, first, that the report forms part of the records kept by Health Quest for the purpose of a business. This is clearly so having regard to the width of the definition contained in Cl 1 of Pt 2 of the Dictionary to the Act. Secondly, the document must contain a previous representation, inter alia, recorded in the document for the purpose of the business. Reading ss (1) and (2) together it is enough if a record of the business contains a representation, recorded for the purpose of the business provided the recorded representation was made on the basis of information even indirectly supplied by a person who might reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the asserted fact. That person need not be in any way associated with the business, nor need he or she have acquired that personal knowledge for the purpose, or in the course, of the business.
	
	
	Assuming relevance, matters of history and complaint of symptoms given by Judge Dodd to Dr Dodwell are admissible through Dr Dodwell’s report because Judge Dodd may be supposed to have had personal knowledge of those matters. Dr Dodwell’s findings on examination and professional opinion are likewise admissible because he has personal knowledge of them. Dr Dodwell’s record of the opinions of Dr David Jankelson is also admissible by this means because: (a) Dr Dodwell’s report forms part of the records belonging to Health Quest for the purpose of a business; (b) Dr Dodwell recorded as previous representations for the purpose of the business the opinions expressed by Dr Jankelson; and (c) those representations were based on information indirectly supplied by Dr Jankelson (by means of his reports) who might reasonably be supposed to have person knowledge of the facts asserted by his expressions of opinion.
	
	
	Dr Jankelson’s opinions include: the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnoea made on 1st September 2004; the record made on1st June 2005 that the prescribed treatment was effective in controlling Judge Dodd’s condition; and on 9th June 2005, “obstructive sleep apnoea is well controlled … Judge Dodd’s [licence] has been suspended by the RTA while awaiting this data which objectively shows that he is compliant with therapy and treatment is effective”. All of this is recorded in Dr Dodwell’s report, which I have said is part of Health Quest’s business records.
	
	
	I think it fair to say that Dr Dodwell expresses no opinion as to diagnosis, but relies on Dr Jankelson’s views. This follows from the summary of the opinions of Dr Jankelson derived from his reports that were in the possession of Dr Dodwell, and the contents of the first paragraph appearing under the heading “Conclusions” on page 3 of his report. In particular, Dr Dodwell there uses the phrase “on the evidence provided”. The use of this phrase makes it clear that he is not expressing his own independently formed opinion about either the diagnosis or the fact that the condition is now well controlled by treatment.
	
	
	Dr Dodwell, who is an occupational physician, expresses his own opinion about the development of a variable anxiety state as “an appropriate reaction to the very public exposure of [Judge Dodd’s] health problems”. He also expresses an opinion about Judge Dodd’s fitness for work as at the date of his examination on 14th July 2005.
	
	
	It is clear from this that there are, what might be referred to for present purposes as, matters of both primary fact and opinion contained in Dr Dodwell’s report. The matters of primary fact arise from the narrative given by Judge Dodd as recorded by Dr Dodwell. The matters of opinion include both Dr Jankelson’s opinions and Dr Dodwell’s own opinions. The purely factual representations commence with Judge Dodd’s awareness “during 2004” that he was tired, but being unaware of having fallen asleep on the bench. This matter, of course, post-dates Mr Duncan’s trial in 2003. It is clear, however, that the judge’s appreciation is wrong because when a complaint was lodged in June/July 2004 the judge saw his GP and was sent for tests which, Dr Jankelson said, demonstrated severe obstructive sleep apnoea. As Hall J says, it cannot be said from the history given by Judge Dodd that he had the same problem in 2003, but his unawareness of the problem at that time could possibly be relevant, because of the evidence from reliable witnesses that he did appear to be asleep at times during the trial.
	
	
	Moving on to the matters of opinion. Again assuming relevance, the opinions of Dr Jankelson are admissible through Dr Dodwell for the reasons rehearsed. Expert opinion, of course, forms an exception to the exclusionary opinion rule created by s 76. Section 79 provides:
	


79 Exception: opinions based on specialised knowledge

(1) If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.

In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 a plurality of six justices of the High Court of Australia said (at 602 [31]):

[The exclusionary opinion rule] does not, as might be supposed, elide whatever distinction can be drawn between “opinion” and “fact” or invoke the very difficult distinction which sometimes is drawn between questions of law and questions of fact. It does not confine an expert witness to expressing opinions about matters of “fact”. Rather, the opinion rule expressed as it is in order to direct attention to why the party tendering the evidence says it is relevant.  More particularly, it directs attention to the finding which a tendering party will ask the tribunal of fact to make. Considering the operation of s 79(1) it is thus necessary to identify why the evidence is relevant: why it is “evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding”. That requires identification of the fact in issue that the party tendering the evidence asserts the opinion proves or assists in proving. (Emphasis added)

   (See also Honeysett v The Queen [2014] HCA 29; 88 ALJR 320 at [25])


	
	As was made clear during argument (T 11.10 - .35), the fact in issue that the appellant asserts the opinion proves, or assists in proving, is that at the time of the trial in 2003, Judge Dodd suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea. If established, that fact, at least indirectly, could rationally affect the assessment of the probability that Judge Dodd fell asleep during Mr Duncan’s trial. Clearly Dr Dodwell’s own expressions of opinion cannot be relevant to that issue. He accepts Dr Jankelson’s views about diagnosis without forming his own. And Dr Dodwell’s opinion about Judge Dodd’s fitness for the work of his Office in July 2005 is entirely incapable of rationally affecting, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of Judge Dodd having fallen asleep at the trial at 2003.
	
	
	Looking at the question of whether Dr Jankelson’s opinion as recorded by Dr Dodwell in his report is capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of Judge Dodd falling asleep during the trial, I am of the view it does not. The trial took place in February and March 2003. Dr Jankelson’s opinion was expressed in September 2004, 18 months later. It is difficult to see how, without more, an expression of present opinion at that time would tend to prove Judge Dodd suffered from the condition in February and March of 2003. The reliable evidence that the judge appeared to be dozing at the trial in 2003, in my judgment, is not enough to constitute “something more”. To approach the matter that way would invite irrational circuity of reasoning: the judge appeared to be dozing in February and March of 2003; in September 2004 he was diagnosed as suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea; if he was dozing in 2003 it must have been because he then had obstructive sleep apnoea; and if he had obstructive sleep apnoea in 2003, he must have been dozing during the trial. Expressed this way, it is easy to see that Dr Jankelson’s opinion of September 2004 cannot rationally affect even indirectly the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. No presumption of continuity arises from proof, on the one hand, that Judge Dodd appeared to be dozing at the trial in 2003, and on the other, that he was diagnosed as suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea in September 2004. Moreover, as I have said, Judge Dodd himself says his problem commenced “during 2004”. From the law reports, the Cesan trial occurred in May and June 2004.
	
	
	The plurality in Hawchar pointed out (602 [32]):
	


To be admissible under s79(1) the evidence that is tendered must satisfy two criteria. The first is that the witness who gives the evidence “has specialised knowledge based upon the person’s training, study or experience”; the second is that the opinion expressed in evidence by the witness “is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge”.

From the description of Dr Jankelson as a sleep physician, I would be prepared to infer that he has specialised knowledge based upon his training, study or experience as a specialist medical practitioner and that his opinion that Judge Dodd was suffering from severe sleep apnoea was wholly or substantially based upon that knowledge. However, as I have said, the difficulty is not expertise, but relevance.

The preferable evidence


	
	I turn to the second matter. To Hall J’s references to the judgment of French CJ in Cesan ([104] – [105]), I would wish to add some further references. At 390 [105] Gummow J said:
	


The superintendence of the trial by the trial judge required him to ensure that the jury was not distracted from paying full attention. The evidence which was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal showed both that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and that the very source of the distraction was the sleeping judge.

   At 393 [118] – [120] Hayne, Crennan and Keifel JJ said:

As noted earlier in these reasons, in considering whether there was a miscarriage of justice at the trial, attention must focus upon the respect or respects in which it is said that there was some departure from the proper conduct of the trial, rather than upon the cause of the departure. That is why, in the present cases, to focus only upon the fact that the trial judge fell asleep during some parts of the trial diverts attention from identifying whether there was some miscarriage.

What is important, in these cases, is that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence. And it was upon the assessment of all of the evidence led at trial that the jury’s verdict had to be founded. The repeated distraction of the jury from attending to the evidence at various stages of the trial, including when one of the accused was giving his evidence, constituted a miscarriage of justice.

Ensuring that the jury is not distracted from paying full attention to its task is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge. If trial counsel is concerned that members of the jury cannot give, or are not giving, proper attention during the trial, it will be for counsel to raise that issue with the trial judge. Ordinarily, if the trial judge does not act of his or her own motion, and if trial counsel says nothing, an appellate court will not later be able to conclude that the jury did not pay attention to the evidence that was led. In particular, proffering the opinion of one or more observers about whether the jury appeared to be paying attention to proceedings would not ordinarily suffice to show that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The absence of intervention by the trial judge will usually far outweigh the value of any opinion offered by some observer after the trial is over.


	
	It is plain on the evidence in this case that Ms Machan and Mr Perre raised complaints during the trial with counsel briefed to appear on behalf of both accused. This is a very significant matter. And, it having been raised with them, counsel for both accused were vigilant in assessing whether the judge was discharging his duty of superintending the trial, and also whether the jury were paying attention to all of the evidence. I agree with Hall J’s analysis of the evidence, and with his preference for the evidence of Ms Adams SC, Ms McSpedden, Mr Greenwood SC and Mr Stollery. That experienced counsel said nothing, having been alerted to the concern of Ms Machan and Mr Perre, makes it impossible to conclude that the jury were not paying full attention to the evidence that was being lead: Cesan [120]. The contrary impression of Ms Machan and Mr Perre is insufficient to displace this.
	
	
	I wish to record my agreement with the views expressed by Hall J at [165] – [166] that Ms Machan inadvertently influenced the appellant in the account he gave. At the same time, I wish to say that I was very impressed with Ms Machan’s manner whilst giving evidence. She was obviously honest and sincere in recounting her impressions. I formed the view that she was well motivated, had made Mr Duncan’s case her cause and was concerned only to see justice done. But for the reasons given by Hall J, I have formed the view that there was no miscarriage of justice at the trial. The focus must be upon the respect, or respects, in which it was said that there was some departure from the proper conduct of the trial: Cesan at [118] by Hayne, Crennan and Keifel JJ. For the reasons given by Hall J I am satisfied that there was no departure from the proper conduct of the trial by reason of the jury not paying full attention to the evidence because they were distracted for significant periods by the judge sleeping. I agree with the conclusions and findings expressed by Hall J at [199] – [203] of his Honour’s judgment. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that Judge Dodd did fall asleep during the trial, even accepting the possibility discussed by Hall J at [202].
	


Mr Stollery’s evidence – foreman sketching


	
	I turn to the third and final matter. As is evident from each of the separate judgments in Cesan, distraction of the jury from paying full attention to all of the evidence is the critical consideration in deciding whether the conduct of a trial judge has led to a fundamental departure from the standards that must be observed in criminal trials. Bearing this in mind, Mr Stollery’s evidence about the reaction of some jurors to the artistry of the foreperson could be of some concern: the critical question is whether there has been a departure from the proper conduct of the trial, rather than its cause. If a jury was distracted by the artistic efforts of its foreperson and a trial judge failed to correct them, a miscarriage of justice could occur.
	
	
	Mr Stollery’s evidence is set out by Hall J at [184] to [195]. In addition to the references given by Hall J, I wish to include the cross-examination about his evidence that “on numerous occasions during the trial, I observed members of the jury glancing in the direction of the foreman … he was sketching [and] some of the jurors on a number of occasions appeared to be very amused by what they observed” (second affidavit [6]). The cross-examination elicited the following evidence:
	


Q. I just want to ask you a couple of final areas if I can, in your most recent statement 29 January you said this at paragraph 6;

“On numerous occasions during the trial I observed members of the jury glancing in the direction of the foreman. From time to time the hand movements of the foreman suggested to me that he was sketching some of the jurors on a number of occasions appeared to be very amused by what they observed.”

It was during this period of time that you made these observations, are you able to tell their Honours when in the course of the evidence that that was that was being led in the trial?

A. No.

Q. Are you able to give any specific reference to the transcript that has been provided to the court as to those specific occasions when you observed this occurring?

A. No, I couldn’t do that.

Q. Are you able to at least shed some light in relation to who was giving evidence at that time when these particular observations of you and the jury were being made?

A. No, it was no more fleeting that (SIL than) observing jurors when they walk into court sometimes smiling or laughing or talking to each other.

Q. But these were your words “On numerous occasions during the trial”?

A. Yes on numerous occasions I observed them appearing to be a very good humoured jury.

Q. I’m not asking that, I’m asking your observations about the foreman and his drawing and the jury’s interaction with that. How many occasions did you observe that occur during the course of the trial please Mr Stollery?

A. I couldn’t say exactly.

Q. Are we talking ten, less, more?

A. I couldn’t say with any certainty.

 


	
	Reading Mr Stollery’s evidence as a whole, including the passage I have just quoted, I am not satisfied that it establishes that the jury were in fact distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence by their forepersons sketching. I interpolate that the description of the drawing of the “Exhibits Table” suggests to me that his sketching was a form of note taking. One needs to read the whole of this evidence to provide context to the passage of cross-examination I have just recounted. The amusement of the jurors described by Mr Stollery was “fleeting”. At its highest this evidence suggests occasional periods of diversion, not substantial distraction.
	
	
	I make these observations for completeness sake. This matter was not a ground of appeal; it is not “a respect in which it is said there was some departure from the proper conduct of the trial”: Cesan [118]. It formed no part of the argument made on behalf of the appellant that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice. It may therefore be put entirely to one side.
	


Ground 2


	
	I agree with Hall J that as Ground 1 has not been made out, Ground 2 must fail. I wish to record, however, that agreeing as I do with Hall J, the acceptable evidence, as I have already remarked, demonstrates that counsel were vigilant in their duty to assist the judge in the proper conduct of the trial according to law.
	
	
	Since writing these reasons I have had the benefit of considering Simpson J’s judgment in draft with which I am in general agreement. Obviously, there are some differences between us about the application of s 79 Evidence Act 1995. Those differences are not material to the result.
	
	
	With respect, I wish to express my complete agreement with what her Honour has written at [77] – [93].

		21 May 2015",2015-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766560,Louise v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 64,"Judgment (Tender of exhibits 1 – 8 and 20 – 22)


	
	These are reasons for my rulings permitting the tender by the defendant of the following documents:
	



	
	Exhibits 1 and 2 – photographs of the plaintiff from Edge Model Management and promoting car insurance (obtained from the plaintiff’s discovery) (T 163 – 6);
	
	
	Exhibits 3 and 4 – Bundle of 19 photographs from Swindler Photography website and from the Starnow website, obtained from the Internet (T 170);
	
	
	Exhibit 5 – music video of the song “Better off Alone”, obtained from the Internet (YouTube);
	
	
	Exhibits 6, 7 and 8 - audio interview with the plaintiff (T 180 – 188), served on the plaintiff’s solicitors but not included in a supplementary List of Documents; and
	
	
	Exhibits 20, 21 and 22 - CCTV footage of the plaintiff being spoken to and then escorted from Star City, obtained under subpoena.
	



	
	Mr Evatt submitted that none of these documents should be permitted to be tendered, or to be the subject of cross-examination, because none had been provided to the plaintiff in the form of a supplementary List of Documents as required by r 21.6 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”)
	
	
	Rule 21.6 UCPR provides:
	


“21.6 Subsequently found documents to be made available

If at any time after party B’s affidavit is made, and before the end of the hearing, party B becomes aware:

(a) that any document within the class or classes specified in the relevant order for discovery (not being an excluded document) but not included in Part 1 of the list of documents is within, or has come into, party B’s possession, or

(b) that any document included in Part 1 of the list of documents which was claimed to be a privileged document was not, or has ceased to be, a privileged document,

party B must forthwith give written notice to party A of that fact, and comply with rule 21.5 in respect of the document, as if the document had been included in Part 1 of the list of documents and the list had been served on the date of the giving of the notice.”


	
	I shall deal with each of the objections in turn.
	



	
	Exhibits 1 and 2 – photographs of the plaintiff from Edge Model Management and promoting car insurance – Mr Evatt withdrew his objection to the tender of these photographs after Dr Collins QC pointed out that they were obtained from the plaintiff’s discovery.
	
	
	Exhibits 3 and 4 – Photographs from Swindler Photography website and from the Starnow website – These documents are in the public arena, in that they were obtained from the Internet. The StarNow website is a website for actors seeking employment and Swindler Photography appears to be a modelling agency. Mr Evatt complains that these documents should have been included in a supplementary List of Documents by the defendant. Dr Collins QC stated that these were “excluded documents” for the purposes of UCPR r 21.5: Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264 at [80] and [87], and that the obligation to give continuing discovery did not extend to material in the public domain of this kind. The dates of these photographs being taken and put onto the website are uncertain. Some, but not all, may postdate the commencement of the proceedings. The real question is whether a party seeking to tender them is obliged to discover them (as opposed to serving them in accordance with UCPR r 31.10, a procedure discussed in more detail below). Despite the increasing reliance upon social media and other publicly available material published on the Internet, this issue has received scant judicial attention in Australia. The obligation of a party to discover social media and documents such as photographs posted on the Internet is referred to in Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2012) 84 NSWLR 523 and Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264 (“Palavi”). In Palavi the plaintiff had destroyed or disposed of two of her mobile phones, with the result that text messages and photographs stored on those devices could not be produced on discovery. Unlike corporate defendants, who may rely upon the routine destruction of documents (McCabe v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2002] VSC 43; British American Tobacco Services Ltd v Cowell (2002) 7 VR 524), Ms Palavi was not in business, and had no excuse for destruction of her mobile phones. Significantly, the information on Ms Palavi’s phones was not publicly available, or copied from elsewhere, and their destruction meant that their contents were no longer available. That is not the case here. First, these documents are available to anyone searching for photographs or information concerning the plaintiff. Second, if any party was obliged to discover them, that person was the plaintiff, if the falsity of the imputations is a basis upon which aggravated compensatory damages are sought: Tabe v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (1987) A Def R 50-025. It was for these reasons that I permitted the tender of these documents and cross-examination as to their contents. The obligations of parties to discover and preserve ephemeral records such as Internet and social media records, particularly in circumstances where third parties may have control of the relevant websites, is an obligation of uncertain ambit, as the relevant UCPR provisions, drafted before the impact of electronically stored information (“ESI”) was appreciated, have not kept pace with technological change. Additionally, decisions such as Palavi indicate that previous views as to destruction of documents (see for example Powell v Boladz [2003] All E R 131, where medical practitioners destroyed or forged documents to conceal medical negligence) may no longer apply.
	
	
	Exhibit 5 – music video of the song “Better off Alone” – Conformably with my findings as to the plaintiff’s modelling photographs, this music video is both an excluded document and a publicly available document. I also consider that, if it was to have been discovered by any party, it should have been discovered by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Exhibits 6, 7 and 8 – Conformably with UCPR r 31.10, the radio interview was served on the plaintiff’s solicitors but not included in a supplementary List of Documents. Particulars of justification reflecting its contents have been provided. The plaintiff’s insistence that a supplementary list of documents referring to this document be provided is pedantic and inconsistent with the requirement for “just, cheap and quick” resolution of civil proceedings (s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)). The plaintiff’s alternative complaint, namely that the whole interview should be tendered, has been met by providing the jury with the whole tape. It should not, however, be necessary for the defendant to play the whole tape in court.
	
	
	Exhibits 20, 21 and 22 – This CCTV footage of the plaintiff being spoken to and then escorted from StarCity, obtained under subpoena, has been available for inspection by the plaintiff’s legal advisers in the course of the litigation. A party seeking to rely upon a document produced under subpoena is not required to discover the document as well. An additional objection raised by Mr Evatt was that the plaintiff should not be able to be cross-examined on the contents of other persons’ statements or documents, consisting in the present case of the CCTV footage and an incident report prepared by the security guard who can be seen arguing with, and being pushed by, the plaintiff: s 44 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Traditionally s 44 arguments relate to written statements. What should happen when the “statement” consists of footage of the event, and a report describing the conversation the parties can be see (but not heard) to be having? As it happens, I am satisfied (in relation to the CCTV) that any s 44 issues can be resolved under s 44(3), but it is another example of the impact of modern technology on legislative provisions drawn up at a time when this technology did not exist.
	


Service of photographs and audio-visual recordings


	
	Mr Evatt did not refer, in his brief submissions on each of the above documents, to UCPR Rule 31.10, which provides:
	


“31.10 Plans, photographs, audio-visual recordings and models

(1) At least 7 days before the commencement of a hearing, a party who intends to tender any plan, photograph, audio-visual recording or model at the hearing must give the other parties an opportunity to inspect it and to agree to its admission without proof.

(2) A party who fails to comply with subrule (1) may not tender the plan, photograph, audio-visual recording or model in evidence except:

(a) in the case of a prescribed item-where the court is satisfied that the party had a legitimate forensic purpose for not giving the other parties an opportunity to inspect the item, or

(b) in any other case-by leave of the court.

(3) This rule does not apply to any proceedings entered, or intended to be entered, in:

(a) the Commercial List or the Technology and Construction List in the Supreme Court, or

(b) the Commercial List or the Construction List in the District Court.

(4) In this rule:

“audio-visual recording” includes a sound recording or a record of moving images (or both) whether stored on film, audio or video tape, digitally, electronically or by any other means.

“prescribed item” means a photograph or audio-visual recording that was made or obtained in connection with the relevant proceedings, by or at the request of a party, for the purpose of testing the credibility of a witness at the hearing.”


	
	This rule would clearly apply to such material if it is in the defendant’s possession (subject to the “leave” exclusion referred to in the rule). Does it, however, apply to such material where the person with access to it is in fact the party against whom the material is to be used?
	
	
	Use of CCTV film from cameras in public places, material available on the Internet and social media is an increasing feature of modern litigation, particularly personal injury actions. Social media entries were successfully used to challenge plaintiff’s accounts of their ongoing disabilities in Frost v Kourouche (2014) 86 NSWLR 214 and Munday v Court (2013) 65 MVR 251. In neither of those cases was any issue of fairness or obligation for early discovery raised, probably because the records in question had been brought into existence by the plaintiff, and were not surveillance films created by an agent of the other party to the litigation. (Discovery is not available in personal injury proceedings, hence the importance of UCPR r 31.10 to prevent an opponent being taken by surprise.)
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant was under no obligation to discover any of the material tendered. Where any of these documents were not served on the plaintiff prior to the hearing, I note my additional view that the nature of each of the tenders is such that the “leave” exclusion is triggered, in that the plaintiff may have accordingly tailored her evidence to meet the material about which she was cross-examined: Halpin v Lumley General Insurance Ltd (2009) 78 NSWLR 265.
	
	
	As is the case with UCPR r 21.5, the provisions of UCPR r 31.10 would benefit from revision and enlargement to cope with new categories of ESI on social media and other Internet sites.

		14 May 2015",2015-05-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766566,R v Martin [2015] NSWSC 521,"Judgment


	
	On 6 September 2012, Tyrone Martin killed Jeffery Hindle, at his home on a remote property located near Braidwood. He never denied killing Mr Hindle, but always claimed that he had acted in self defence when he hit him in the head with a concrete block. He later offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, an offer which he made again at his trial, but those offers were not accepted by the Crown. At trial, the jury concluded that he had not acted in self defence, nor had he been provoked by Jeffery Hindle.
	
	
	On 24 October 2014, Mr Martin was found guilty of murder. He now stands for sentence for that offence.
	


This Court’s task on sentencing


	
	I will begin by explaining how that sentence must be arrived at, by reference to what legislation enacted by the Parliament and binding case law requires, in a sentencing exercise such as this.
	
	
	The rules of evidence do not ordinarily apply at a sentencing hearing (see s 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)), but nevertheless, the weight of the evidence which the parties then lead, must be critically assessed.
	
	
	After a jury verdict, the sentencing judge must take a view of the facts which is consistent with the verdict which the jury has reached, with any reasonable doubt being resolved in favour of the accused (see Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14]). This does not require a view of the facts which is most favourable to an offender (see R v Martin [1981] 2 NSWLR 640).
	
	
	Disputes about factual findings must be resolved in the way discussed in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. That is, facts may not be taken into account in a way that is adverse to an accused, unless they have been established beyond reasonable doubt. However, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if they are proved on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	In arriving at the sentence the Court must bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Those purposes are:
	


“(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	The sentence imposed on the offender must also reflect the gravity of the offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). That was in issue in this case.
	
	
	The sentence must also be determined in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question. In the case of murder, that is life imprisonment under s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum sentence of life imprisonment is, however, reserved for extreme offences of murder. Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that a sentence of life imprisonment only be imposed if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the murder is so extreme, that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence on the offender.
	
	
	It is for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1). In this case the Crown did not seek to do so. I accept the parties’ common position that this is not a case which warrants the imposition of the maximum sentence, notwithstanding the obvious seriousness of Mr Martin’s offence.
	
	
	The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder, which falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences. A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole, for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence.
	
	
	Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are amongst the factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, as was discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and is now provided in s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	In accordance with s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the seriousness of the offence must be assessed by taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence in question. The offender’s moral culpability for the offence must also be taken into account (see Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600).
	
	
	On sentencing, the Court must also consider identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence (see s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	All of the relevant factors must be taken into account by way of the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. That requires the sentencing judge to identify all of the factors that are relevant to be considered on sentencing in the particular case, discussing their significance and making a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence for that offence is. The sentence so imposed must ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]).
	
	
	Regard must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio.
	
	
	If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629).
	
	
	It is finally also necessary to mention the effect of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), which applies to “serious violence offences”, which under s 5A includes the offence of murder. The effect of this Act is that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the offender continue to receive supervision or remain in detention. If the Court is then satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender would be a “high risk offender”, that is an offender who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision, it may make an order under s 5F for an offender’s extended supervision. An order for continuing detention may be made under s 5G if the Court is then satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.
	


The issues


	
	In this case, for reasons which I will now explain, I am satisfied that justice demands that a significant custodial sentence be imposed on Mr Martin.
	
	
	The Crown’s case at trial was that Mr Martin had murdered Mr Hindle, not having acted in self defence, or having been provoked and having intended to kill him, or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown argued that the number of blows Mr Martin had inflicted to Mr Hindle’s head, the nature of the weapon he used and Mr Martin’s conduct after he inflicted those blows all showed that his intention was to kill Mr Hindle. Further, that his behaviour afterwards, was also consistent with him knowing that he had caused Mr Hindle’s death.
	
	
	Mr Martin’s case was that while he did not deny killing Mr Hindle, he could not be found guilty of Mr Hindle’s murder because he had acted in self defence and under provocation, not intending to kill Mr Hindle, after Mr Hindle had threatened him with a shotgun.
	
	
	The issues then lying between the parties included whether Mr Martin had acted under provocation and in excessive self defence, when he killed Mr Hindle. The number of times he struck Mr Hindle, particularly the number of blows he inflicted to Mr Hindle’s head with the concrete block, which weighs some 7.1kg; Mr Hindle's position when he was struck with that block; and whether there was an interval between those blows being struck, were also in issue, as was whether Mr Hindle had threatened Mr Martin with a shotgun and the reason why Mr Martin took a shotgun with him, when he left the property.
	
	
	At the sentence hearing, there was no longer any issue that Mr Martin had caused Mr Hindle's death by hitting him once to each side of the head with the concrete block. There remained issues between the parties, however, as to:
	


whether Mr Hindle had threatened Mr Martin with the shotgun;

whether Mr Martin had struck Mr Hindle, intending to kill him, or to inflict only grievous bodily harm;

whether Mr Martin initially believed that he had to defend himself, even though it was common ground that, on the jury’s verdict, before he struck the final blow with the concrete block, Mr Martin did not believe that he had to act in self defence; and

whether Mr Martin had lost his self control as the result of Mr Hindle’s provocation, even though it was common ground that on the jury’s verdict, the jury must have concluded that Mr Martin had regained his self control, before he inflicted the final blow.


	
	For reasons which I will explain, on all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the issues lying between the parties cannot be resolved in a way that is favourable to the case advanced for Mr Martin.
	


The resolution of these issues


	
	The issues lying between the parties have to be approached in a context where the jury convicted Mr Martin, accepting the Crown’s case, that his various accounts of what had happened between he and Mr Hindle could not be accepted as true. All of Mr Martin’s accounts were untested.
	
	
	The only person who could have given evidence as to what happened to Mr Hindle was Mr Martin, but he gave no evidence at trial, as was his right. Various evidence revealed the accounts which Mr Martin had earlier given, after he went home and sought assistance for Mr Hindle.
	
	
	Mr Martin relied on those accounts to resist the Crown’s case as to his intention, on self defence and provocation and also to account for two other things. Firstly, for why he had not called for assistance from the property on the landline he had used to call his son on the previous evening. Secondly, to explain how Mr Hindle’s blood came to be on his clothing.
	
	
	On sentencing, an affidavit sworn by Mr Martin was also tendered. He was not required for cross-examination. That affidavit did not deal with how Mr Hindle’s death was caused, but with their relationship, Mr Martin’s regret at his death and his inability to explain the depth of his feelings to Mr Hindle’s family. It also dealt with Mr Martin’s own background, including when he was sexually assaulted on a number of occasions over the course of some 14 to 18 months, while he was a young child. There was also another account of what Mr Martin had done, recorded in a psychologist’s report, which was also tendered in Mr Martin's case.
	
	
	On sentencing, Mr Martin also relied on his accounts. They thus have to be assessed carefully, in light of all of the other evidence which has been received, when the issues lying between the parties are resolved.
	
	
	The evidence established that Mr Martin killed Mr Hindle at the property where Mr Hindle lived and raised dogs and hunted pigs. The uncontested evidence of Mr Hindle’s brother was that the shotgun which Mr Martin took away from the property was the gun which Mr Hindle kept there to shoot snakes and that he hunted using knives. Mr Martin told police that Mr Hindle also kept other guns at his property, but none were found on later police search.
	
	
	When he left the property, Mr Martin took with him a shotgun, knife and ammunition. He later said that Mr Hindle had threatened to kill him, while armed with that shotgun and the knife. The Crown’s case was that this would not be accepted as true.
	
	
	The evidence established that Mr Martin had the opportunity, knowledge, and means to have taken those items from the shed where Mr Hindle kept them. Mr Hindle was an electrician. The shed was powered by generators. It was used as a kitchen and living area. Mr Hindle also kept his equipment there and also parked his vehicle there. He slept in a caravan nearby. There were other vans where visitors, like Mr Martin, slept. The vans had no power or lights. A head torch was located at the property, lying on the ground, away from the vans. On examination, the DNA of both Mr Martin and Mr Hindle was found on the headband of the torch.
	
	
	On sentencing, the relevant evidence as to how Mr Hindle came to die included an account given by Mr Martin after he was convicted, as well as the evidence given at trial by his parents, his son, Senior Constable Fookes, Dr Sansum and another person to whom he spoke before his arrest, Mr Taylor, to all of whom Mr Martin gave an account, on 6 September 2012, about what he and Mr Hindle had done.
	
	
	In evidence was also a recording of the 000 call which Mr Martin made from his home that day, when he called for assistance for Mr Hindle, some 40 minutes after he left him lying unconscious on the ground at his property. Recordings of an interview with police on his arrest, at his home, later that morning and also of another interview in which he participated later that day, at Queanbeyan Police Station, were also in evidence.
	
	
	Evidence was also called from police and ambulance officers who described what they found at Mr Hindle’s property, when they attended that day and subsequently. Other witnesses gave evidence about Mr Hindle, the nature of the prior relationship between he and Mr Martin, and what Mr Martin had told them about his sexuality.
	
	
	Expert evidence was called as to matters such as what examination of Mr Martin and of Mr Hindle’s body and blood had revealed; what blood spatter analysis which had been undertaken at the property and on Mr Hindle’s body had revealed; and what DNA testing of various items located at the property had shown.
	
	
	The objective evidence established that the accounts which Mr Martin had given were false in important respects. His accounts were also inconsistent, contradictory and implausible in others. The lengthy account which he gave in his police interview, after he learned that Mr Hindle had died, not only suffered from these shortcomings, but also altered over the course of the interview, as Mr Martin was asked to explain problematic aspects of the account he was then giving. The account given after conviction reverted to a version of events from which he had departed in that interview.
	
	
	In the result, I am satisfied that none of Mr Martin’s accounts provide a basis on which any findings of fact can be made on sentencing, other than when they are supported by other reliable evidence.
	


Intention to kill


	
	I am satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Martin intended to kill Mr Hindle.
	
	
	Senior Constable Fookes spoke to Mr Martin’s mother some 5 minutes after he made the 000 call, from their home. The Senior Constable asked her questions, which she then conveyed to Mr Martin, who answered them. Mr Martin was then asked how many times he had hit Mr Hindle. He then said that he had hit him twice. He had, in fact, hit him more than twice, but even this was not an admission to which Mr Martin adhered.
	
	
	Mr Martin also told Senior Constable Fookes that he thought that Mr Hindle was dead. That was consistent with what Mr Martin had done, inflicting fatal injuries to Mr Hindle’s head and leaving him to die, lying uncovered, outside on the ground, bleeding heavily on a cold, windy night, for some 40 minutes before he called 000.
	
	
	In all of his other accounts before trial, Mr Martin said that he had struck Mr Hindle only once with the concrete block, while outside the caravan where he had woken to find Mr Hindle threatening him with a shotgun. While he later said that Mr Hindle had fallen to the ground unconscious and that before he left, he had moved Mr Hindle, who was making snoring noises, to take his pulse, Mr Martin claimed that he had left without calling for assistance for Mr Hindle, taking the shotgun, ammunition and knife which he found lying on the ground near Mr Hindle, because he was afraid that Mr Hindle would attack him again. This cannot be accepted as being true.
	
	
	Mr Hindle was found lying on his back, in a large pool of blood. He survived his head injuries for some 2 to 4 hours, after they were inflicted. He died before ambulance officers arrived. The concrete block was in evidence. It was obviously a lethal weapon.
	
	
	The expert evidence established that Mr Martin’s accounts were false. Mr Martin used the concrete block to kill Mr Hindle, by hitting him at least twice, once to each side of his head. It also established that Mr Martin had been moved after the first blow with the concrete block was struck. There was a delay between those two blows. Mr Hindle had also suffered other injuries to his face, the top of his head and his arms, some consistent with Mr Martin having struck him with the concrete block, others consistent with Mr Martin having struck him with a sharp object. Some of these injuries were defensive wounds, which had been bleeding. The injury to the top of his head had bled profusely.
	
	
	Given how heavy, large and awkwardly shaped the concrete block was, it would have been difficult to wield, as Mr Martin demonstrated to police during the Queanbeyan interview, by picking it up from the ground and turning to hit Mr Hindle in the head, while Mr Hindle was standing behind him, especially if he had been pointing a shot gun at Mr Martin’s head. The evidence established that this was not how Mr Hindle was first struck to the head.
	
	
	On autopsy, Mr Hindle was found to have suffered three significant injuries to his skull, as well as other injuries to his face and arms. The injuries to the two sides of his head were consistent with two separate blows struck with the concrete block, rather than the result simply of contact with the ground, after a fall.
	
	
	Mr Hindle was first struck with the concrete block to the right side of his head. The injuries to the right side of his head were complex, with abrasions to his face and ear, as well as bruising to soft tissues and a complex fracturing of the skull beneath, including to the orbital area of the eye. There was also damage to his brain under the fracture.
	
	
	Contrary to Mr Martin’s accounts, on examination, these first injuries were consistent with Mr Hindle's head already being in a fixed position against another surface, either a wall, such as that of the nearby shed or caravan, or the ground. They were also consistent with the second blow to the left side of his head being struck while the already injured right side of Mr Hindle's head was on the ground, after Mr Hindle was moved, before the second blow was struck. Blood pattern analysis confirmed that Mr Hindle’s body was in a different position, when he was struck the second time, sometime after the first blow, while lying on the ground.
	
	
	On the left side of his head, Mr Hindle suffered an irregular laceration behind his ear, going through the full thickness of his skull, with associated bruising, as well as abrasion and bruising to the lobe of the ear. Underneath this laceration there was an associated depressed skull fracture, as well as damage to that side of his brain.
	
	
	The third serious injury towards the top of Mr Hindle’s head was an irregular laceration, with the skin abraded away. It was caused by a separate blunt force impact, consistent with something with a sharp edge striking Mr Hindle’s head, or his head coming into contact with that object, when he fell. That injury was consistent with contact with a metal grate found lying on the ground near Mr Hindle, or a swinging blow with the edge of the concrete block. That injury resulted in the pool of blood in which Mr Hindle was found lying on his back, when police attended.
	
	
	Mr Hindle also suffered other injuries, including an abrasion on his forehead, consistent with another glancing blow from the concrete block, as well as a laceration to his lip, which resulted in him inhaling blood. He also had defensive wounds on his arms, which were also consistent with use of an object with a sharp edge.
	
	
	Consistent with those injuries, Mr Hindle’s blood was also found in various places inside the caravan, where Mr Martin said that he had been sleeping. That van was found to have been considerably damaged, consistent with there having been an altercation there, during which Mr Hindle was injured, before Mr Martin struck Mr Hindle with the concrete block outside the van. Mr Hindle also left blood spots at the entrance to the shed, but none were found in his van.
	
	
	None of Mr Martin’s blood was found in the van or elsewhere. That was consistent with him having suffered only relatively minor injuries to his hands and arms. His account was that those injuries had been inflicted in another altercation between he and Mr Hindle, in the shed, the evening before he killed Mr Hindle. Mr Martin’s clothing was stained with Mr Hindle’s blood, consistent, amongst other things, with him having inflicted Mr Hindle’s various injuries and with having kneeled on the ground, next to Mr Hindle’s body.
	
	
	All of this evidence established not only that Mr Martin got the better of Mr Hindle during their altercation inside the van, before killing him outside the van, but also that Mr Martin intended to kill Mr Hindle.
	
	
	The nature of the various blows which Mr Martin struck, particularly those to Mr Hindle’s head and the fatal injuries which inevitably resulted from the two blows to the sides of his head with the concrete block, when considered together with the state which Mr Martin left Mr Hindle in, when he departed from the property, puts that conclusion beyond question.
	
	
	Mr Hindle was left, bleeding heavily from the head, lying unconscious on the ground outside the caravan, uncovered, on a dark, cold, windy night, while Mr Martin took time to move the concrete block, gather a gun, knife and ammunition, put petrol in his truck and then to drive home for some 40 minutes, before calling for any help for Mr Hindle, rather than calling for an ambulance from the property, as he could have done. Those steps put Mr Martin’s intention to kill Mr Hindle beyond argument.
	
	
	I am, accordingly, satisfied that the evidence established beyond any doubt not only that Mr Martin murdered Mr Hindle, but also that he intended to kill him.
	


Excessive self defence and provocation


	
	The jury accepted the Crown’s case that Mr Martin had not acted in self defence, nor had he been provoked by Mr Hindle.
	
	
	On sentencing, Mr Martin accepted that the jury must have concluded that by the time he had inflicted the final blow to Mr Hindle's head, he no longer had a belief that he had to use the concrete block in self defence. He argued, however, that the verdict, nevertheless, left open the view that he had acted in response to being threatened by Mr Hindle with the shotgun, before he struck the first blow.
	
	
	Mr Martin also accepted that the jury had not accepted his case on provocation. He argued, however, that his account of the words which Mr Hindle had used when he threatened him with the shotgun, supported a finding, on the balance of probabilities, that this was what had caused him to arm himself with the concrete block.
	
	
	These conclusions, if reached, are relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of Mr Martin’s offending.
	
	
	Mr Martin submitted that it was relevant, in this regard, to consider that the jury had reached its conclusion, only after a further direction on provocation and a Black direction, to the effect that it had to persist in its deliberations (see Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; (1993) 179 CLR 44). This, it was argued, left open the conclusion on sentencing, that while initially provoked, Mr Martin had regained his self-control before inflicting the second blow, after which he ceased striking Mr Hindle, left the concrete block, felt Mr Hindle’s pulse and left the property to summon help.
	
	
	For its part the Crown accepted that the onus lay on it to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Martin had not acted in either self defence, or after provocation, at any point. It submitted that it had met that onus on the evidence.
	
	
	Resolution of these issues depends in large part on the dispute about what the evidence in relation to the shotgun establishes, to which I will now turn.
	


The shotgun


	
	I am satisfied that the evidence does not permit a finding that Mr Hindle threatened Mr Martin with the shotgun, before Mr Martin killed him, even on the balance of probabilities. Such a finding depends on the evidence of the accounts Mr Martin gave afterwards. As I have explained, they do not provide a reliable basis for any factual findings. Other evidence is inconsistent with such a finding.
	
	
	It was not in issue that Mr Hindle and Mr Martin were friends. Mr Martin was a frequent visitor to the property and told police about the property and the guns and knives which Mr Hindle kept there. His later accounts that they had been drinking together the evening before, were supported by evidence called from various witnesses, by analysis of Mr Hindle’s blood and by the alcohol smelt on Mr Martin, on his arrest.
	
	
	Mr Hindle had consumed the equivalent of some 23 standard drinks. Mr Martin’s blood alcohol level was not tested, but he had sufficient sobriety not only to be able to injure Mr Hindle as he did, but also to drive in the dark, for some 40 minutes, along rough bush roads to reach his home, where he made the 000 call and gave what proved to be a number of deliberately false accounts, as to all that he had done to Mr Hindle.
	
	
	In assessing the evidence as to what Mr Martin did and said, account must necessarily be taken of the effects of what Mr Martin had done, the alcohol he had consumed and his lack of sleep. Nevertheless, it cannot be overlooked that his accounts were deliberately untrue and that they altered, consistent with a realisation of the problems with what he was saying and ongoing attempts to minimise his responsibility for what he had done to Mr Hindle, namely, to murder him.
	
	
	Mr Martin said that he and Mr Hindle had had an argument in the shed the evening before, when he had raised his sexuality, with the result that Mr Hindle attacked him with a fork. Mr Martin may have discussed his sexuality with Mr Hindle that night. There was evidence that he had discussed this with others.
	
	
	Mr Martin said that there was an altercation in the shed the evening before he killed Mr Hindle. There may have been such an altercation. That is supported by the drops of Mr Hindle’s blood found in the shed and the wounds found on the back of Mr Martin’s hands and forearms on arrest. There were, however, no injuries to Mr Martin’s palms. Dr Sansum examined Mr Martin and considered his abrasions to have been consistent with him having been struck by a fork and raising his arms above his head to defend himself, as he had demonstrated to her, but she said that those slight injuries could have had other causes.
	
	
	None of Mr Martin’s blood was found in the shed or the van where he said he went to sleep. There was, however, undoubtedly an altercation in the van, during which Mr Hindle was injured. It was there that Mr Martin said that Mr Hindle first threatened him with the shotgun.
	
	
	Mr Martin repeatedly described waking to find Mr Hindle in the caravan, with a gun pointed at him, that Mr Hindle had threatened to kill him, that he pushed Mr Hindle away, got out of the van, and that Mr Hindle followed him outside, threatening him again with the gun. It was then that he struck Mr Hindle with the concrete block which he found lying on the ground, in order to defend himself from Mr Hindle, who he thought would kill him.
	
	
	The details which Mr Martin gave of these events varied significantly in his various accounts, but none of them explained how the van came to be damaged as it was; how Mr Hindle’s blood came to be deposited there in various places, including on the mattress where Mr Martin said he was woken from his sleep; or how he could have wounded Mr Hindle as he did, while Mr Hindle was armed with a shotgun and a knife.
	
	
	The evidence as to all of these matters was inconsistent with Mr Hindle having been armed with a shotgun and a knife, as Mr Martin variously claimed. Mr Martin’s accounts as to these matters were implausible. None of them can be accepted as true, given other objective evidence.
	
	
	It is also important to put Mr Martin’s various accounts into context.
	
	
	The first account which Mr Martin gave was to his father, who he also told that he thought he might have killed Mr Hindle. When asked why he had brought the loaded shotgun home with him, Mr Martin said that Mr Hindle had come at him with the gun and that he had protected himself and was frightened that Mr Hindle might wake up and grab it, as he was driving out the driveway, so he picked the gun up and put it in the cab of his ute, with the shells he had also brought with him, filled up the truck and came home.
	
	
	In that and other accounts which Mr Martin later gave, consistently with the nature of the concrete block which he had used and the injuries which he had caused, Mr Martin said that Mr Hindle fell unconscious to the ground, when he struck him. He gave various descriptions of the snoring noises he heard Mr Hindle making. In fact, Mr Martin had struck him more than once, as I have explained, injuring him fatally. In the face of that evidence, Mr Martin’s account that he took the gun and knife with him, fearing that Mr Hindle would attack him again before he left, cannot be accepted as true. That it was false, was confirmed by what else Mr Martin did, before he left.
	
	
	In the 000 call which Mr Martin made after he arrived home, he said that Mr Hindle had found out that night that he was gay; that Mr Hindle had overreacted; that Mr Hindle had wanted to shoot him; and that he had taken the gun away from Mr Hindle and hit him in the head with a brick. He also said that he had woken with the gun pointed to his head; that he had fallen outside; that Mr Hindle was unconscious, snoring when he left him; that there was a lot of blood; and that he did not want him to die. It was in this account that Mr Martin said that he had to drive 20 km, to be able to make the 000 call.
	
	
	This was also untrue. Mr Martin could have made that call from the landline at the property. Instead, before leaving, he took his time to do the various other things I have described.
	
	
	After he returned home Mr Martin also spoke to his mother, his son and Mr Taylor, before he was arrested.
	
	
	Mrs Martin could not remember the exact timeframe of everything that Mr Martin had told her, but remembered that he had said that he woke with a gun to his head, there was a tussle, he pushed Mr Hindle outside and picked up a brick and hit him with it.
	
	
	Mr Martin also told Mr Taylor that he thought that he had killed Mr Hindle and that he had woken up with a gun pointed at him, that a fight had started and that he had hit Mr Hindle with a brick. Mr Martin told his son that he had woken with the gun pointed at him, that he had grabbed it and pushed Mr Hindle off, that Mr Hindle had tried to stab him with a knife and that he had pushed him out of the caravan; that Mr Hindle had grabbed the gun and tried to shoot him and he had hit him with a brick and knocked him out, and grabbed the gun and knife and left.
	
	
	These accounts were inconsistent, incomplete and untrue. Mr Martin’s later accounts were different.
	
	
	On arrest, Mr Martin told police that it was Mr Hindle who had “hit [him] up” about his sexuality and had then attacked with him a fork, during an argument and that Mr Hindle had pointed a sawn off shotgun to his head, when he woke up in the caravan. He then said that he had pushed Mr Hindle out of the way and jumped outside, where he picked up a brick. When threatened further, he said “if you’re going to fuckin’ shoot me, I’ll defend myself”. He said that when Mr Hindle pulled the gun up, “I just went, bang and dropped him.” He also said that he freaked out when he saw blood on Mr Hindle’s face and went home.
	
	
	Mr Martin also said that he up picked the gun and some loose cartridges from the ground and took them home. He said that he had hit Mr Hindle only once and that he was not sure where he had hit him, because it was pitch black, but his face was bloody and a tooth was missing.
	
	
	On further questioning, Mr Martin said that everything went “burrer” when he hit Mr Hindle. He was then asked about the fork. Mr Martin then said that Mr Hindle had a fork in his hand and that he had a knife and a shotgun, and that the injuries to the back of his hands and knuckles were from where Mr Hindle had attacked him. He also said that he was “just putting my hands up” because “I was in bed, asleep” and Mr Hindle had put the barrel to his head and said “You’re fuckin’ dead” He then said that he just rolled to the side, he remembered grabbing something from the side of the bed and:
	


“I got out. I fuckin’ … knocked him over, I got out the caravan door, It’s about that high to the ground. I hit the fuckin deck. Next thing I know, he’s like that, and I just, fuckin’, if you’re goin’ to fuck, and he just You’re fucked. And I just went bang. And I’ve left.”


	
	Mr Martin also then said that after he took the gun off Mr Hindle, he put it on his bonnet and went back to make sure he was OK and found him on the ground snoring. He told police that the gun was stolen and that there were other “hot weapons” buried on the property, including an AK-47. The search later conducted at the property did not locate such weapons.
	
	
	This was a longer, but quite different account to those which Mr Martin had given earlier. It was also untrue, but different again from that which he gave police later in the day.
	
	
	By the time he was interviewed at the Queanbeyan Police Station, Mr Martin had time to consider that he had killed Mr Hindle.
	
	
	Then Mr Martin said that he and Mr Hindle had been drinking and smoking marijuana together the previous evening, when he had raised his sexuality and he had told Mr Hindle that he thought he might be bisexual, knowing that Mr Hindle was not into gays, from earlier conversations which they had had together. Mr Martin then said that Mr Hindle had called him a “fuckin’ queer cunt” and had attacked him with a kitchen fork, leaving scratch marks on his hands, when he lunged at him and he blocked Mr Hindle’s blows.
	
	
	Mr Martin also said that the fork had been left on the table in the lounge, but that he had later grabbed it, when he took the knife and gun and locked them in his car. On that account, before Mr Martin left the property, he must have gone to the shed, where Mr Hindle kept the shotgun and ammunition.
	
	
	Mr Martin then described going to sleep in the caravan and waking in the dark, so black that he couldn’t really see anything, but he could feel a piece of metal on his forehead. He asked Mr Hindle what he was doing. He replied “shut the fuck up faggot” and Mr Martin responded, by flying off the end of the bed, shunting Mr Hindle straight back into the end of the caravan, where he hit the wall. Mr Martin said that he then went out the caravan door, dropping to the ground. Outside, he said it was also pitch black.
	
	
	Given the layout of the caravan, the length of the shotgun and the bed, where Mr Martin described Mr Hindle standing at the end and he lying down asleep, in the darkness he described, there were obvious problems with this version of what had happened. That Mr Hindle could have reached Mr Martin’s head with the shotgun and that Mr Martin could have reached Mr Hindle, to push Mr Hindle away, given their respective positions, in the dark he described, was not plausible.
	
	
	Mr Martin then said that as he stood up outside, Mr Hindle was there, pointing the gun to the back of his head. He then cocked the gun and went to squeeze it. He then looked down, saw the concrete block, picked it up and hit Mr Hindle, who fell to the ground. He then grabbed the gun and the knife, went to his truck and locked them inside. He returned to check Mr Hindle, saw blood and that he had a tooth missing. Mr Martin said that he then thought that he had just knocked him out and left him and went home.
	
	
	This account was also proven to be false. The 000 call was made at 4:43 am. Police responded, arriving at the property before dawn at 5:40 am. It was a very dark, moonless, windy night. So dark, that police had to use torches, when searching for Mr Hindle. There was no light inside or outside the van. That evidence established that it was so dark that Mr Martin could not have seen the things he described, either inside the van or outside, without a light source. He was questioned further about this during the Queanbeyan interview and then his story changed again, as he came to realise the obvious problems with the account which he was giving.
	
	
	When questioned further, Mr Martin explained that he could see the knife which he picked up from the ground in the dark outside, because its handle glowed orange and the shotgun cartridges, which he also picked up from the ground, glowed red. This was also false. The knife was later tested. The handle did not glow.
	
	
	Mr Martin then described the snoring sounds which Mr Hindle was making when he returned to feel his pulse. He also said that he might have had blood on his face, but he said it was pretty dark and he froze and drove home.
	
	
	Mr Martin also elaborated on the discussion which had led to Mr Hindle attacking him with a fork. He then said that they had discussed his history of having been sexually assaulted as a child, over some 40 minutes, in the shed. Later he said, however, that he could not remember whether he had been attacked with the fork in the shed or in the caravan, but that the fork was usually kept in the shed and he remembered pushing Mr Hindle away and then having a few more beers. He also said that he remembered grabbing the fork and putting it in the truck, but that it wasn’t with the gun and knife which he put there and so, he must have dropped it. Later, he said that before he went to bed, Mr Hindle was joking with him and happy.
	
	
	On further questioning, Mr Martin said that there was no electricity in the caravan, but that, contrary to his earlier accounts, it was not dark when he woke up, because Mr Hindle was wearing a head torch. He then said that the torch came off Mr Hindle’s head, inside the van, when he landed on the caravan floor. Mr Martin, again, described how he woke, what he felt and what was said. He repeated that he got up off the bed and pushed Mr Hindle out of the way, then he said by pushing him straight into the chest and getting out of the door. He also said that Mr Hindle was still holding the gun when he fell back and that Mr Hindle came back up and so he dived out of the door.
	
	
	Given the layout of this caravan, where the bed was placed and his account of where he and Mr Hindle each were, this account was also plainly untrue. This further departure from his earlier accounts, that Mr Hindle was wearing a head torch which fell off in the van, explained how Mr Martin could have seen what he described inside the van, but it could not explain what he claimed to have seen and done outside in the dark.
	
	
	Mr Martin was then asked to describe the gun and to explain the layout of the caravan and where he and Mr Hindle each were. Mr Martin again said that Mr Hindle was standing at the foot of the bed and he was lying down, but his account then changed again. Then he said he woke to see Mr Hindle coming forward towards him and then, because he knew martial arts, he used his feet and got Mr Hindle straight back. Mr Hindle then went into the back wall and his head torch hit the ground.
	
	
	When asked whether it was his hands, or his feet that he had used to push Mr Hindle away, Mr Martin said that he was not sure, but he was pretty sure that the head torch came off then, because it went dark. He also said that Mr Hindle had no torch outside. There was no head torch found in the van, but one was later found outside, some distance away. On examination, it had both Mr Hindle and Mr Martin’s DNA on the headband.
	
	
	This version did not have the shotgun placed against Mr Martin’s head and had a light source inside the van, but it was also untrue. Later examination of the van revealed the considerable damage done to the van, while Mr Hindle was bleeding sufficiently from the wounds Mr Martin had inflicted with an object, to have left his blood in various places. This was objective evidence which none of Mr Martin’s various accounts explain and which could not have occurred while Mr Hindle kept hold of a loaded gun, let alone while also armed with the knife.
	
	
	Mr Martin then said that he did not get the gun from Mr Hindle, until they were outside, after he hit him with the concrete block. He then described how he swung the concrete block at Mr Hindle, who was standing behind him pointing the gun at his head, and hitting him in the face.
	
	
	A glancing blow to the face with the concrete block, which caused Mr Hindle to fall to the ground, would account both for the abrasion injury later found on Mr Hindle’s face, and how the injuries which he suffered to the two sides of his head could have been inflicted. They were caused by two blows being struck with the concrete block, one to each side of Mr Hindle’s head, while he was lying on the ground, his body having been moved between those two blows being struck.
	
	
	When asked to explain further, Mr Martin then said that he was not sure where the gun was pointed, when Mr Hindle came out of the caravan. He then changed his account further. Mr Martin said that he was getting off the ground, when he looked up and saw Mr Hindle walk forward and that he came across as if he was going to kill him, with the gun pointing at him and so he had reacted. Mr Martin again said that he thought he had hit Mr Hindle in the facial region and that he fell straight to the ground.
	
	
	On all of these inconsistent accounts, Mr Martin was outside the van, before he inflicted any injury on Mr Hindle. This was also untrue.
	
	
	On these various accounts, Mr Martin claimed that outside, in the dark, he either had his back to Mr Hindle and felt the gun at his head, which caused him to turn and strike him with the concrete block which he saw lying nearby on the ground, or, he looked up at Mr Hindle and saw him walking towards him, with the gun pointed at him, which led him to conclude that Mr Hindle was going to kill him and so he picked up the concrete block and struck him.
	
	
	Mr Martin was then asked where the gun landed. He said on Mr Hindle’s left hand side. He also said that he picked up the knife, gun and two cartridges which he saw lying nearby; that Mr Hindle had not used the knife to threaten him, but that it was also lying on the ground. Mr Hindle then said that he did not know whether it had fallen out of the side of Mr Hindle’s pants, or his pocket.
	
	
	Given the size and nature of this knife, that it could have been so carried was also implausible. That Mr Martin could have seen and done all that he described in the dark, without any light source, was not possible.
	
	
	Mr Martin then said that Mr Hindle was alive and had a pulse when he left and that he did not want to hang around, because he knew he had another shotgun and an AK-47 on the property. It was only on the way home, that he began to think that Mr Hindle might have died and that was what he told his father at home.
	
	
	Mr Martin was then asked again about the torch. He insisted that it was dark outside and that Mr Hindle had not put his torch back on, before he followed him outside. He also said that he had left the concrete block lying on the ground near Mr Hindle, where he put it down, when he grabbed the gun and other stuff. That was also untrue. He moved that concrete block some distance away from where Mr Hindle was lying on the ground, before he left.
	
	
	When asked how it was that he could see what he described, in the dark, Mr Martin said that he could not find the torch, but he could see Mr Hindle’s open mouth, because it was starting to get lighter, when he returned to feel his pulse. That was also untrue. It was still completely dark when police later arrived at the property.
	
	
	When asked how he could see the look he had described seeing on Mr Hindle’s face, Mr Martin said that he knew his body language and his face and he knew that Mr Hindle was out to hurt him. Despite this, and despite having earlier said he saw blood on Mr Hindle’s face and a missing tooth, he later said that he did not know whether what he could feel on Mr Hindle when he felt his pulse was blood or dew.
	
	
	The only evidence which could account for what Mr Martin described seeing, was the head torch later found by police. Him wearing the head torch that night, would account for how he could have seen the blood and missing tooth he described having seen and for how he was able to do the various things he did, before he left the property.
	
	
	Mr Martin told police that he had only remained 5 minutes at the property, before he left. That also proved to be untrue.
	
	
	Before he left Mr Martin took a number of steps, which were consistent with knowledge that he had fatally injured Mr Hindle. Instead of calling 000, he not only moved the concrete block, he collected the gun, ammunition and knife and filled his truck with petrol. He also checked on Mr Hindle, who was as he described, unconscious, bleeding on the ground.
	
	
	After conviction, Mr Martin gave the psychologist Ms Robilliard another account of killing Mr Hindle. He told her that they had been drinking during the evening, that he had confided in Mr Hindle that he might be bisexual, that Mr Hindle had called him a “poofter”, that later in the evening, they had a fight in the shed, when Mr Hindle scratched his arm with a dinner knife and fork. They then drank further. Later, he woke in the caravan to find Mr Hindle standing over him with a shotgun held to his head. He said that he reacted “maybe a bit excessively” and they fought. When he left Mr Hindle he was snoring. He thought that he had knocked him out.
	
	
	In this account, Mr Martin acknowledged the altercation in the van and having hit Mr Hindle excessively, but reverted to a version of events from which he had departed, while he was at the Queanbeyan Police Station, with Mr Hindle holding the gun to his head when he woke.
	
	
	The only basis on which a conclusion that Mr Hindle threatened Mr Martin with a shotgun when he woke in the caravan could rest, was the evidence of the accounts which Mr Martin gave after he killed Mr Hindle. As I have explained, those untested accounts were not a reliable basis on which such a conclusion could rest. To the contrary, they were not only inconsistent and contradictory, but deliberately false. While Mr Martin stuck to his account that Mr Hindle had threatened him with the shotgun in those accounts, that he could have seen and done what he variously described, was inconsistent with other reliable evidence, as I have explained.
	
	
	In the result, it cannot be concluded that Mr Hindle threatened Mr Martin with a shotgun, before he killed him, even on the balance of probabilities.
	


Mr Martin did not act in excessive self defence and provocation


	
	On sentencing all of the evidence received has to be assessed in the way I discussed at the outset.
	
	
	I am satisfied on that evidence, that it cannot be found that before he struck Mr Hindle for the first time with the concrete block, Mr Martin was provoked by Mr Hindle, causing him to act in self defence, when threatened with the loaded shotgun which Mr Hindle had pointed at his head, while making threats such as “You’re fuckin’ dead, you faggot”, as he later variously reported, either inside the caravan where he was sleeping, or outside it.
	
	
	Objective, reliable evidence does not reasonably leave those findings open. They could only be arrived at, if Mr Martin’s untested accounts were accepted. As I have explained, those inconsistent, incomplete and untruthful accounts are not a reliable basis for any findings of fact, unless supported by other evidence. The other evidence does not support those findings.
	
	
	Nor do Mr Martin’s accounts give rise to any reasonable doubt of which he is entitled to have the benefit, either in relation to self defence or provocation. Rather, I am satisfied that the other evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Martin was neither provoked, nor acted in self defence, when he first struck Mr Hindle with the concrete block.
	
	
	That evidence includes what examination of all that was found at the property revealed; the results of the examination of Mr Hindle’s body; where he was found, lying fatally injured, in a pool of blood, on the ground outside the van; the damage and considerable spattered blood found in various places inside the van and on Mr Hindle; that none of that blood belonged to Mr Martin; that there was no evidence that the gun was fired during the struggle in the van; that Mr Martin had Mr Hindle’s blood on various parts of his clothing, but that neither the gun, the knife nor ammunition that Mr Martin claimed he picked up from the ground where Mr Hindle dropped them outside the van, had any blood on them; the darkness that night; and the absence of any light source, either inside or outside the van, which would have permitted Mr Martin to see and to do all that he did, without use of a device such as the head torch.
	
	
	All that Mr Martin did and failed to do, before he left the property with which he was so familiar, was also inconsistent with him having been provoked by Mr Hindle, or having acted in self defence, when he struck him the first time with the concrete block.
	
	
	Instead of helping his seriously injured friend after he first struck Mr Hindle with that concrete block, or calling for assistance on 000, after some lapse of time Mr Martin struck Mr Hindle a second time with the concrete block, while he was lying defenceless on the ground. Having injured him fatally, Mr Martin then also took his time before leaving the property, moving the concrete block, putting petrol in his truck, gathering a loaded shotgun, knife and ammunition and checking on Mr Hindle’s condition, before he drove away, taking some 40 minutes before he called for help.
	
	
	None of that conduct was consistent with Mr Martin having initially been provoked and acted in self defence, before he struck the final blow with the concrete block.
	


The nature and seriousness of the offence


	
	The nature and seriousness of this offence must thus be assessed on the basis that Mr Martin did not act in self defence and was not provoked by Mr Hindle threatening him with the loaded shotgun he took away with him from the property. It must also be assessed without reference to matters personal to Mr Martin.
	
	
	It was common ground that Mr Hindle’s killing was not the result of any premeditation, but occurred during an altercation, while they were both affected by alcohol, Mr Hindle considerably so. In the past Mr Martin and Mr Hindle had been involved in other physical altercations when they were affected by alcohol, in which they had been injured.
	
	
	That is not a mitigating factor, but explains the circumstances in which, on this occasion, Mr Martin lost his control during another such altercation, the result that he killed Mr Hindle in the brutal fashion I have already described. On the evidence, that may have partially been the result of Mr Martin having drunk spirits, which in the past had had an adverse effect on him, but that does not excuse or explain what he did. His intoxication does not make this offence objectively less serious than it undoubtedly was.
	
	
	In assessing the seriousness of his offence, account must also be taken of the evidence that having realised what he had done, instead of taking Mr Hindle with him, or even calling for the help which Mr Hindle then so obviously and desperately needed, Mr Martin left him lying seriously injured, outside on the ground, on an isolated property, uncovered and alone in the dark, on a very cold and windy night, to die of the fatal wounds he had inflicted. While Mr Martin was able to drive home, he was well aware of the difficult road which had to be traversed, before assistance could reach Mr Hindle and still he called for no help, before he left.
	
	
	This heartless conduct must be accepted as being an aggravating feature of this offence, in accordance with the approach discussed in Dulihanty v R [2013] NSWCCA 275 at [68].
	
	
	In the result, there can be no question that objectively, this was a serious offence, in my view falling somewhat above the middle of the range of seriousness of such offences.
	


Moral culpability


	
	Mr Martin’s moral culpability for his offence must also be considered.
	
	
	Mr Martin led evidence on sentencing which shed light on his background, to which I will return. There was no issue between the parties that the evidence of his background was relevant to this sentencing exercise, but the impact that it would have, was not agreed.
	
	
	In particular, despite the provisions of s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which provides that self-induced intoxication at the time of an offence is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor, Mr Martin submitted that his intoxication was, nevertheless, relevant to a determination of his moral culpability, consistent with the approach in Waters v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 219 at [38]. That was because, it was argued, his intoxication revealed that his offence was impulsive and unplanned, committed at a time when his judgment was impaired.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence must lead to the conclusion that Mr Martin’s moral culpability for his offending was not as high as it would have been, had he not experienced the violent sexual assaults which he suffered at a young age, which have had ongoing, adverse impacts upon him, throughout his life, including significant drug and alcohol abuse, from a young age (see Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [43]). His judgment was unquestionably impaired the night that he killed Mr Hindle.
	
	
	Even so, on all of the evidence I have discussed, it must be concluded that Mr Martin’s moral culpability for this awful offence was significant, given all that he did, including how he left Mr Hindle alone to die, instead of calling for help from the property, as he could so easily have done.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevant to this sentencing exercise which the parties identified were:
	


“ …

(c)    the offence involved the use of a weapon,

(d)   the offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences).

…

(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person,

…

(l)   the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant),”


	
	I have already discussed Mr Martin’s use of the concrete block and need say no more about its impact on this sentence.
	
	
	Mr Martin has a prior criminal record in New Zealand and Australia, which it was accepted disentitles him to any leniency in this sentencing exercise. His record includes only one offence of violence, common assault, committed in New Zealand, for which a non-custodial sentence was imposed. There were also juvenile car theft offences, failures to report, breach of supervision and drug cultivation and possession offences, burglary, theft, and wilful damage. Mr Martin was ordered to undertake a residential community program for his drug taking in New Zealand, which coincided with a gap in his record. In New South Wales his record was confined to driving offences.
	
	
	This is not a record which requires any further consideration in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	That Mr Hindle was killed at his home, an isolated rural property, where he ought to have been safe, must be taken into account as an aggravating factor. Mr Hindle was plainly vulnerable to Mr Martin’s attack, given his intoxication, of which Mr Martin was well aware. That is a part of the factual matrix in which the seriousness of this offence must be assessed, as I have discussed, but of itself does not place Mr Hindle into a particular class of victim, who need to be especially protected, because they are vulnerable to criminal offences (see Regina v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740 at [24] - [26]).
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which Mr Martin submitted would be taken into account in his favour, were:
	


""(b)    the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,

(c)   the offender was provoked by the victim

…

(h)   the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise

(i)   the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both),”


	
	There was no issue that this was not a planned or premeditated killing. I have already dealt with provocation, which I consider on the evidence cannot be found as a matter of fact.
	
	
	The unchallenged evidence led on sentencing does, however, establish Mr Martin’s remorse for what he has done. Mr Martin has always accepted responsibility for Mr Hindle's death. He offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, but as was his right, did not admit to the murder of which he has been convicted. While he has been unable to write to Mr Hindle’s family, he has given evidence on sentencing about his feelings and emotions, in terms which I accept establish that his remorse is genuine, consistently with evidence received as to his character. Ms Robilliard also referred to Mr Martin’s repeated expressions of deep remorse at Mr Hindle’s death.
	
	
	As to Mr Martin’s prospects of rehabilitation, on the evidence, given his record, the nature and seriousness of his offence and his serious past problems with drugs and alcohol, much depends on his successful pursuit of treatment for those problems. There is evidence of an acceptance, on his part, of a need to deal with these matters and of the existence of real reasons for pursuing them. On all of the evidence, I consider that Mr Martin does have prospects of future rehabilitation, which may be taken into account.
	


Deterrence


	
	It is unquestionable in the circumstances which I have discussed, that both general and specific deterrence have a significant role to play in the sentence imposed on Mr Martin.
	
	
	Offences involving violence such as this, committed while a person is affected by alcohol, must result in a sentence which deters both Mr Martin and others, from engaging in such violence.
	


Mr Martin’s personal circumstances


	
	Mr Martin’s personal circumstances must also be taken into account.
	
	
	Affidavit evidence was received on sentencing from Mr Martin, his mother, father and sister. Letters from his son, niece, aunt and cousin were also tendered. They all attested to their experience of him and the love and support they continue to offer him. There were also supportive testimonials from friends of Mr Martin and a report of February 2015 from Ms Robilliard, who had examined Mr Martin.
	
	
	Mr Martin was not required for cross-examination and aspects of his evidence as to his background and the history he gave Ms Robilliard were supported by his parents’ and sister’s affidavit evidence. They were also not required for cross-examination. There was no issue between the parties as to the nature of his history, including that he was a victim of childhood sexual assault.
	
	
	All of this evidence established that Mr Martin comes from a stable, supportive family background, with parents who he considered to be exemplary role models, who had always been there for him.
	
	
	Mr Martin was diagnosed to have hyperactivity and learning difficulties as a child, which resulted in disruptive behaviour patterns which were dealt with in various ways, including by involvement in competitive swimming, at which he excelled. Mr Martin revealed to his family having been sexually molested from age 7, only when he was 21. His mother confirmed that changes in his behaviour coincided with this experience. As a young teenager, greater problems developed with his behaviour and he became involved with drug taking, delinquent peers and juvenile offending.
	
	
	The history Mr Martin gave Ms Robilliard described how he was first sexually assaulted by a friend’s stepfather and one of his adult friends, when he was aged 7, while staying overnight there. He described resulting changes in his attitude and behaviour, feeling detached from his parents, sleeping with a knife under his bed, being so afraid of the dark that he would not leave his room at night, even to urinate and blaming his parents for allowing him to spend the weekend with his friend. Mr Martin described his difficulties at school, with drugs, stealing and fighting. By age 9, he was sniffing solvents “to get out of it”. By age 11, he was sniffing glue. By 13, he began using cannabis and then moved on to barbiturates and opium, which was grown in New Zealand. He also began committing drug related offences. Mr Martin also began growing his own cannabis and by age 15 was injecting opium intravenously, during poppy season.
	
	
	Mr Martin left school to commence an apprenticeship with his father, which he left after only 2 months, to pursue drug taking, while he went on unemployment benefits. At age 15 or 16 he was sent to boys’ homes and eventually to drug rehabilitation. Mr Martin made good progress while at Odyssey House, but he returned to cannabis and opium use only 2 weeks after release.
	
	
	In his late teens, Mr Martin formed a long term relationship, but continued heavy drug use. After he met his wife he was introduced to intravenous heroin use, as well as LSD, although he was able then to hold down jobs, at times.
	
	
	Mr Martin has a stepson and two other children. His marriage broke up in 2009 over his wife’s involvement with his best mate, at a time when he discovered that she was using ice. There was an altercation which resulted in his detention and it was on release, that he decided to move to Australia. He then moved to Braidwood to live with his parents, where he obtained employment. He continued using cannabis, but that was accommodated by his employer.
	
	
	Mr Martin’s youngest son went into care and he applied for and obtained custody and brought him to Australia, where they lived together in a cottage adjacent to his parents’ home. In 2013, his wife died of a heart attack, resulting from her drug taking.
	
	
	Mr Martin told Ms Robilliard that he was in sound physical health, although he had lost weight as the result of his emotional distress. In custody Mr Martin reported that he was trying to abstain from drug use, which he found challenging. He had in the past suffered drug comas due to glue sniffing and blackouts, from chronic drinking and drug use. He has no history of mental illness, but had been treated for mood disorder when aged 16.
	
	
	Mr Martin also gave Ms Robilliard the brief account of how he had killed Mr Hindle, which I discussed earlier. In Ms Robilliard’s opinion, it is not uncommon for young males who have been sexually molested during their formative years, to experience confusion about their sexuality and that given his history, Mr Martin was likely to have been hypersensitive to any comments about his sexual identity.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard considered Mr Martin’s description of feeling in danger of serious injury when woken from sleep by Mr Hindle, who was armed, to have resulted in a reaction that was excessive, at a time when his intoxication compromised his behavioural self-control. She considered that the situation he described left little time to exercise judicial or rational thought, or to generate alternative courses of action. That opinion has to be considered in light of the conclusions I have reached on the evidence on which Mr Martin was convicted.
	
	
	The results of tests administered by Ms Robilliard were consistent with Mr Martin’s indicated negative self-worth and depressed mood state. He had a statistically significant score on symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, to which his history of childhood sexual abuse was relevant. There was also evidence of a psychological dependence on and compulsive use of cannabis, consistent with his history.
	
	
	Access to counselling, rehabilitation and psychotherapy were recommended by Ms Robilliard.
	


Victim Impact Statement


	
	A victim impact statement was read in open court by Mr Hindle’s father and the statement given by his sister was also read out. No one present can have failed to have been moved by what was then said.
	
	
	Under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act), on the application of the prosecutor and if the Court considers it appropriate to do so, those statements may be considered and taken into account on sentencing Mr Martin, on the basis that the harmful impact of Mr Hindle’s death on the members of his immediate family, is an aspect of the harm done to the community. That application was not opposed by Mr Martin.
	
	
	It has long been accepted that all human life is precious and that the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community generally. One life cannot be valued over that of another. Nevertheless, in this case, I consider that these victim impact statements should be taken into account on sentence, shedding light as they do on the particular harm which this murder has done. Accordingly, I have taken them into account in sentencing Mr Martin.
	
	
	Before passing from those statements, I wish to observe that the evidence established that Mr Hindle suffered a painful, lonely, awful death. His family and friends all have my very deepest sympathy at his loss and what they must continue to bear, as the result of how his death was brought about. It is to be hoped that Mr Martin’s trial and these sentencing proceedings will give them some small measure of comfort, by revealing how our society has dealt with the awful offence which Mr Hindle’s killing involved.
	


Special circumstances


	
	Mr Martin did not press for a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the ordinary statutory ratio established by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, given the length of the sentence necessarily to be imposed upon him and the result of the application of the statutory ratio to that sentence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, in this case, the statutory ratio will provide an appropriate period of supervision for Mr Martin, prior to the expiration of his sentence, if he is released when he becomes eligible for parole and that his circumstances do not warrant any departure from that ratio.
	


The sentence


	
	The parties agreed that the sentence imposed on Mr Martin must commence on the date of his arrest on 6 September 2012.
	
	
	In written submissions for Mr Martin, reference was made to sentencing statistics and various cases where sentences of various lengths have been imposed on other offenders. I have considered these submissions, but found them to be of but little assistance in sentencing Mr Martin, who must be sentenced for his offence, having regard to all of the matters revealed by the evidence, which are relevant to the sentence imposed upon him, for his offending.
	
	
	As discussed in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520, it is consistency in the application of relevant principles which must be achieved in a sentencing exercise such as this, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence with sentences imposed in other cases, where those principles have had to be applied to the different circumstances there arising to be considered, in respect of other offenders and offences.
	
	
	Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned I have concluded that Mr Martin must be sentenced to a term of 27 years imprisonment for his offence. The application of the statutory ratio results in a non-parole period of 20 years, 3 months and a balance of term of 6 years, 9 months. This means that the earliest date that Mr Martin will be eligible for release is 5 December 2032. That will depend on Mr Martin convincing the Parole Authority that he should then be released on parole. His sentence will expire on 5 September 2039.
	


Orders


	
	Tyrone Earl Martin you are convicted of the murder of Jeffery Michael Hindle.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 27 years, commencing on 6 September 2012 and expiring on 5 September 2039, with a non-parole period of 20 years, 3 months, expiring on 5 December 2032.
	
	
	I set a balance of term of 6 years, 9 months, which is to expire on 5 September 2039.

Introduction


	
	The plaintiff, Craig Ward, commenced these proceedings by way of Summons filed on 22 July 2014. They concern a hearing in the Coffs Harbour Local Court of a criminal prosecution in which the plaintiff was charged with an offence by a Court Attendance Notice. The Notice was served on him on 19 September 2013. It alleged that between 11:30am and 12:00pm on 21 March 2013, at Barraganyatti, he dealt with certain property, namely, $20,000 in Australian currency and that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the same were proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The defendant to the present proceedings, Detective Sergeant Zimmer, was the officer-in-charge of investigations in relation to the alleged offence.
	
	
	The proceedings were listed for mention before the Coffs Harbour Local Court on 16 December 2013. On that date they were listed for hearing on 21 February 2014.
	
	
	The brief of evidence was served prior to 21 February 2014. By reason of the circumstances discussed below, there was no evidence concerning DNA analysis included in the original brief that was served upon Mr Ward, the plaintiff in these proceedings.
	
	
	The hearing by the Local Court commenced and concluded on 21 February 2014 before Magistrate Walker. On that date the Magistrate reserved his decision.
	
	
	Detective Zimmer and Detective Senior Constable Eaton, gave evidence in the prosecution’s case.
	
	
	Subsequently on 9 April 2014, following an application made by Detective Zimmer in circumstances discussed below, the learned Magistrate granted leave to the prosecution to re-open its case.
	


Evidence in Support of the Application to Re-open the Hearing


	
	The application to re-open was supported by the affidavit of Detective Zimmer sworn 8 April 2014. This affidavit was exhibited as part of Exhibit AA1 to the affidavit of Mr Ali Abbas dated 11 November 2014 in the present proceedings.
	
	
	Detective Zimmer’s evidence was that he had made a formal request on 23 December 2013, following the plaintiff’s not guilty plea, for eight elastic bands which bound together the abovementioned currency found by police in the glove box of the plaintiff’s car to be swabbed for trace DNA material by Coffs Harbour Crime Scene (there were in fact ten rubber bands in total). In the written record created by him (referred to as an “EFIMS”) Detective Zimmer requested, under the heading “job criticality”, that the analysis be completed “in less than one month” and indicated that the hearing of the proceedings against the plaintiff had been fixed for 21 February 2014 in an “administration note” attached to the request.
	
	
	The administration note created by Detective Zimmer at the time of making the request was as follows:
	


“Investigators are seeking to establish if the DNA profile of Paul LANSDOWNE (Dob: XXX) (on the DNA database in Qld) is on the elastic bands. It will be alleged that he handed a second suspect (who has not touched the elastic bands) a sum of money which was secured by the elastic bands. This request has only been submitted upon a plea of not guilty. The hearing date for this matter is 21/02/14.” (Affidavit of Detective Sergeant Zimmer at [7])


	
	In para [9] of his affidavit, Detective Zimmer stated:
	


“The ‘rubber bands’ subject to the examination were those used to secure $20,000 in cash seized from the accused on the 20th day of March 2013.”


	
	On 24 December 2013, Senior Constable Gane of Coffs Harbour Crime Scene individually swabbed each of the elastic bands for trace DNA.
	
	
	On 30 December 2013 the DNA swabs were forwarded to the Forensic and Analytical Science Services laboratory for DNA analysis. Detective Zimmer created a further administration note attached to his examination request as follows:
	


“…21/3/13 a suspect vehicle was stopped by Police. Upon searching this vehicle it was found to contain approximately $20,000 cash. The occupant of the vehicle was not able to supply Police with a reasonable excuse for being in possession of this cash. The cash was bundled, with the bundles being secured by elastic bands. Inquiries by OIC has revealed possible OMCG links to the cash which is suspected of being proceeds of criminal activity. A request to swab the elastic bands for trace DNA was made in order to establish possible criminal links to the money. Matter is set for court hearing on 21/2/14.” (Affidavit of Detective Zimmer at [11])


	
	DNA comparison results had not been completed as at the date of the hearing on 21 February 2014.
	


Information Received by Police Subsequent to the Hearing


	
	The prosecution brief of evidence in the Local Court proceedings had been served in accordance with court orders made prior to the hearing. As stated above, no mention was made in any of the material served by the prosecution of an intention to call evidence in relation to DNA testing or analysis.
	
	
	At no stage prior to, during, or at the conclusion of the evidence, or after closing addresses, was any application for an adjournment made by the prosecution for the purpose of obtaining results of DNA tests or analysis.
	
	
	At the completion of the prosecution case the learned Magistrate held there was a case to answer. The plaintiff then gave evidence in his case. The prosecution did not call evidence in reply.
	
	
	Following closing addresses by the prosecutor and counsel for the defendant, the Magistrate indicated that he intended to reserve his judgment in the matter and would notify the parties when he was ready to hand down judgment.
	
	
	In the period mid to late-March 2014, the plaintiff received notice that the proceedings were to be listed at Coffs Harbour Local Court for judgment.
	
	
	It appears from Detective Zimmer’s affidavit that the next events of significance occurred on 8 and 22 March 2014. In paras [13] and [14] of his affidavit he stated:
	


“On the 8th day of March 2013 [sic – 2014], an EFIMS ‘Analysis Finding Result’ was created by staff from the Forensic and Analytical Science Services which stated ‘Profile obtained and uploaded to the DNA database for matching purposes – item reference XF000125831.’

On the 22nd day of March 2013 [sic – 22 March 2014], I received an EFIMS ‘Analysis Job Result’ which stated the following ‘NCIDD Link NA4978 linking scene to Qld person sample. The major contributor in a mixed DNA profile. Link to Paul Jeffery LANSDOWNE, Dob: XXX. Link DNA detected dated; 11/03/2014.’”


	
	On 25 March 2014, Detective Zimmer advised the Sunshine Coast Criminal Investigation Branch of the Queensland Police, of the information received concerning the DNA profile and a link to Lansdowne. He inquired of Queensland Police as to whether a DNA reference sample of Lansdowne could be forwarded to the Forensic and Analytical Science Services, Sydney, for comparison purposes.
	
	
	Detective Zimmer set out in his affidavit the advice that he had received from Detective Senior Constable Hutton of the Queensland Police as to the circumstances in which Paul Lansdowne’s DNA sample came to be on the DNA database as follows:
	


“16.   On the 4th day of July 2013, Paul LANSDOWNE was arrested in Queensland for trafficking prohibited drugs.

17.   An evidence DNA sample was obtained from LANSDOWNE under the authority of Detective Senior Sergeant Darren EDWARDS.

18.   This evidence sample was taken by Detective Senior Constable Shannon DOWD at 3.12pm on the 4th day of July 2013.

19.   This evidence sample was referenced ‘Exhibit P1300219282’ and was lodged on the 4th day of July 2013 by Detective Senior Constable DOWD.

20.   On the 5th day of July 2013, this DNA exhibit was transported by Senior Constable SPENCER to Queensland Laboratories.

21.   On the 8th day of April 2014, the DNA profile of Paul Jeffery LANSDOWNE was forwarded to the Forensic Intelligence Results Management department, Sydney.”


	
	Detective Zimmer then set out in his affidavit details of communications he had on 8 April 2014 with Ms Kim Miller of the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database section as follows:
	


“22.   At 1.00pm on 8th day of April 2014, I spoke with Kim MILLER of the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database section. She advised that she had received the DNA profile of Paul Jeffery LANSDOWNE this date and that she would immediately forward this profile to the Forensic Analytical Science Services section where a comparison would be made.

23.   Kim Miller advised that the comparison would take place this week (week ending 11 April 2014) and the results of that comparison could be prepared in a court report. The current turnaround time for the production of a court report is 60 days unless otherwise ordered by the court. If a ‘Fast-Track’ order was ordered by the court then application for expedient preparation of the court report would be arranged by the officer in charge.”


	
	Mr Abbas, solicitor for the plaintiff, received an email on 25 March 2014 from the Prosecutor in which reference was made to the DNA results.
	
	
	The proceedings were then listed at Coffs Harbour Local Court on Friday, 28 March 2014. On that date, as stated above, the Prosecutor indicated that he was making an application to re-open the prosecution case for the purposes, in due course, of adducing evidence relating to the DNA testing and analysis.
	


The Application to Re-open the Hearing


	
	The application to re-open was opposed by the plaintiff. The application was heard and determined on 9 April 2014.
	
	
	The transcript of proceedings from that date, a copy of which was exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Abbas, records the submissions made to the Magistrate by the prosecution and by the defence.
	
	
	Having heard submissions, the Magistrate made his decision granting the application to re-open and for the prosecution to adduce additional evidence in its case.
	
	
	The prosecution had submitted that if leave was granted to re-open the case additional time would be required to prepare its evidence in relation to DNA testing and analysis in admissible form.
	


Factual Matters Concerning the Offence Charged


	
	The Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions sets out the factual matters relating to the prosecution of Mr Ward under the heading “Case Summary”. Reproduced below are the facts as summarised in the plaintiff’s submissions:
	


12.   On 21 March 2013, the Plaintiff met with a person named Paul Lansdowne at the Star Hotel, River Street, Macksville. The person Lansdowne was a person of interest to the Queensland police and was suspected to be involved in crime including the illicit drug trade.

13.   The two were under police surveillance and police also obtained CCTV footage of when the two men went into the hotel and were observed to have a drink. Shortly after they were seen to be in the vicinity of a Commodore Sedan motor vehicle (later established to be driven to the scene by Lansdowne) with the bonnet up and at one stage with the boot open and also the driver’s door in the open position.

14.   Nothing was seen to pass from one man to the other and there was no evidence that Lansdowne handed anything to the Plaintiff.

15.   The two men were seen to shake hands and then the Plaintiff entered his vehicle parked in the immediate vicinity. Surveillance footage shows that upon entering his vehicle, the Plaintiff leant across towards his glove box area but no mention was made of this in the course of the evidence in the case and no detail was elicited as to what he did when he so manoeuvred within his vehicle.

16.   The Plaintiff was stopped by a number of police in four police cars on the Pacific Highway at Barraganyatti and when questioned freely admitted that he had the sum of $20,000 in cash in his glove box and this was then located by police and seized.

17.   The Plaintiff was interviewed at the roadside by the informant and that interview was recorded on video and produced in evidence.

18.   The Plaintiff in essence told the informant that he had attended the Star Hotel to inspect and possibly purchase a commodore motor vehicle. He met with Lansdowne who he knew as Max and having inspected the vehicle decided that the asking price was too high and he was not prepared to buy it.

19.   He maintained that the money was his and that he had earnt it by buying and selling things over time including imported cars and the like.

20.   At no time, either at the roadside interview or during the conduct of the defended hearing was the Plaintiff asked when he had last touched or examined the money or whether he had touched it after the meeting with Lansdowne and there did not appear to be any necessity to do so on the case the Plaintiff had to answer.

21.   The Defendant allowed the Plaintiff to leave the area requesting that he provide evidence of the origin of the $20,000.

22.   On 24 March 2013 the Plaintiff sent an email with attachments (Exhibit 9 in the proceedings), to the informant setting out transactions in which he had been involved and from which he made profits and accounted for the sum of $20,000.

23.   The Plaintiff gave evidence that over months thereafter he made numerous attempts to contact the Defendant for the return of his money without success and was not able to speak to the Defendant.

24.   On Tuesday, 23 July 2013 the Defendant contacted the Plaintiff by telephone and indicated that he would like to ask him further questions about the money and about the person Max and the Plaintiff declined whereupon the Defendant told the Plaintiff he would be issuing him with the CAN for the offence with which he was ultimately charged.

25.   The Plaintiff put his character in issue and gave evidence that when he was in a defacto relationship with four children and on 30 June 1998, the day his second son was born he became intoxicated and he had a run in with the police and that this was the only time he had ever been in trouble.

26.   During the course of the case evidence was admitted over objection as to crime rates and criminal activities in Queensland from the experience of Detective Senior Constable Christopher Kevin Eaton attached to the Sunshine Coast District Drug Enforcement Team; the telephone and its registration in the possession of the Plaintiff and some statements of listed witnesses for the prosecution which do not affect the current appeal.”

The Present (Appeal) Proceedings


	
	The proceedings in this Court are brought by the plaintiff under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which is entitled Appeals from Local Court to Supreme Court. Subdivision 1 of Div 1, Appeals by Defendants, provides for appeals as of right (s 52) and appeals requiring leave (s 53).
	
	
	The plaintiff relies upon the provisions of s 53(3)(b) of the Act which are in the following terms:
	


s 53(3)(b):

Any person against whom:

(a)   …

(b)   an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.


	
	The plaintiff also seeks an order extending time as the proceedings were not filed within the prescribed time.
	
	
	The issues arising in these proceedings under s 53(3)(b) include:
	



	
	Whether the Magistrate’s decision to re-open the hearing was an “interlocutory order”;
	
	
	Whether the grounds for the Amended Summons raise “a question of law”; and
	
	
	Whether leave to appeal should be granted if no question of law is raised.
	



	
	The initiating Summons, as stated above, was filed in this Court on 22 July 2014.
	
	
	On 2 October 2014, the plaintiff filed an Amended Summons Commencing an Appeal (Pt 50).
	
	
	On 17 November 2014, a Further Amended Summons Commencing an Appeal (Pt 50) was filed on his behalf.
	
	
	At the hearing, Mr Earl of counsel who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that he wished to rely upon grounds set out in a further document entitled “Appellant’s Amended Grounds of Appeal” dated 24 March 2015. That document was marked as MFI-1 in the proceedings. Mr Earl stated at the hearing of the proceedings on 26 March 2015, that the grounds set out in the original Amended Summons were inadequate and accordingly he relied upon the grounds set out in MFI-1 in respect of the whole of the decision of the Magistrate. The grounds set out in MFI-1 are as follows:
	


“1.   The Learned Magistrate misdirected himself as to the legal requirements that must exist prior to exercising a discretion to allow the prosecution to re-open the prosecution case in that:

(a)   The Learned Magistrate failed to consider the question of fairness to the Appellant prior to exercising his discretion.

(b)   The Learned Magistrate misdirected himself as to the meaning of ‘the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably have been foreseen’.

(c)   The Learned Magistrate wrongly disregarded the requirement that ‘the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably have been foreseen’.

(d)   Them Learned Magistrate wrongly relied upon the principle that the primary objective was the administration of justice in New South Wales in disregarding (c) above prior to exercising his discretion to allow the prosecution to open its case.”

Evidence on the Appeal to this Court


	
	The plaintiff’s Amended Summons filed on 17 November 2014 was supported by the affidavit of Ali Abbas affirmed 11 November 2014. A number of paginated documents exhibited to his affidavit were contained in a folder marked Exhibit AA1. Included in the exhibited materials was a copy of the transcript of the hearing of proceedings in the Local Court on 21 February 2014 (pp 1-40 of Exhibit AA1) together with copies of the exhibits in those proceedings. These included statements of other witnesses, a surveillance DVD, telephone intercepts and other documentary materials as identified in paragraph 9 of Mr Abbas’ affidavit. As mentioned above, also included in Exhibit AA1 was a copy of Detective Zimmer’s affidavit sworn 8 April 2014 in support of the prosecution’s application to re-open the hearing and transcript of the hearing of the application on 9 April 2014.
	


The Magistrate’s Decision to Re-open the Proceedings


	
	At pages 6-7 of the transcript of 9 April 2014, the ex tempore decision of the Magistrate is recorded as follows:
	


“This is an application to the Court to re-open the prosecution’s case in regard to a situation that developed subsequent to the evidence discovered with a large amount of money in his glove box, wrapped in a sock. It was covered by a rubber band.

During the hearing of this matter before [word omitted] for the charge of the proceeds of crime matter there was no evidence that there was any DNA evidence upon the sock or the rubber band. That stage was crucial piece of evidence but it appears now from what the prosecution says, they are requesting to re-open their case on the basis that they now have discovered that that rubber band was not properly dealt with in regard to the DNA analysis. And they say that that should now be carried out and the case should be held over until that evidence has been produced.

The law in regard to re-opening these cases is the case of Queen v Chin where it was held by a majority that the Court should not split its cases and call further evidence after the close of the defence case. Only in exceptional circumstances. In fact the major decision in regard to that matter was that,

‘The general principle is that the prosecution must present its case completely before the accused is called upon for his defence. Although the trial judge has a discretion to allow the prosecution to call further evidence after evidence has been given for the defence he (it says here) should permit the prosecution to call evidence at that stage only if the circumstances are very special or exceptional and then and generally speaking, not if the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably have been foreseen.’

Mr Cox has argued that because this evidence would have been normally foreseen that I should not re-open this case. And also this is giving the prosecution, as it were, a second go at their case.

We have (sic) all, in these courts know the difficulty we have regarding to (sic) getting evidence from laboratories in regard to DNA evidence and drug evidence and that has become such a situation in New South Wales that we have had to firstly order these urgent applications for the court to get this type of material and time and time again we find that it is not produced. The delays have become such in this Court that it has become outrageous that the police cannot produce these cases in time. This case I think is a case that falls directly in regard to that.

Was it reasonable (sic) foreseeable that this evidence should have been produced to the Court? Well it appears from the affidavit before the Court today that there were apparently some mistake make (sic). Should the defendant benefit for that in the circumstances where it is reasonable (sic) foreseeable that should have been done and it has not been done. Well, as I have alluded to, the reality in regard to these types of matters is that evidence is difficult to produce on time in regard to drug type matters. Generally speaking, as the Judge says in that matter, it would be reasonably foreseeable that that could be a possibility but I think in the circumstances I have to disregard that because the primary objective of course is the administration of justice in New South Wales and THIS CASE I AM OF THE VIEW FALLS INTO WHAT CAN BE REGARDED AS AN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND I AM GOING TO ALLOW, IN THE EXERCISE OF MY DISCRETION TO RE-OPEN THE CASE IN REGARD TO THAT PART OF THE EVIDENCE.” (original emphasis).

Application for an Extension of Time


	
	The plaintiff sought leave to pursue the appeal out of time. The Court’s power to grant leave is provided for in cl 5(5) of Part 51B, Supreme Court Rules 1970.
	
	
	The Magistrate’s decision (ruling or order) the subject of these proceedings, as noted above, was given/made on 9 April 2014.
	
	
	By cl 5(3) of Part 51B of the Supreme Court Rules, an application for leave to appeal under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act must be filed within 28 days after the “material date”, being the date on which the decision was pronounced or given (see definition cl 3).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s initial Summons having been filed on 22 July 2014, these proceedings were commenced more than three months after 9 April 2014.
	
	
	Whilst the defendant opposed an extension upon the basis of delay, Mr McGorey, Solicitor Advocate for the defendant, fairly conceded that the defendant did not assert prejudice by reason of the delay in instituting the proceedings. In his submissions he noted that the plaintiff obtained legal advice on 4 June 2014 but there was no clear explanation as to why the Summons was filed on 22 July 2014.
	
	
	I have determined, in all the circumstances, that the plaintiff’s application for an extension of time should be granted. The delay has largely been explained and is not so extensive as to warrant refusal of an extension of time. In the absence of actual prejudice to the defendant, I consider that the plaintiff should be permitted the opportunity of challenging the Magistrate’s decision on a matter of importance to both him and the prosecution.
	
	
	The plaintiff filed Written Submissions on 20 October 2014 and a Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions on 18 November 2014. The written submissions were supplemented by Mr Earl’s oral submissions at the hearing on 26 March 2015.
	


Plaintiff’s Submissions

(i) Interlocutory Order


	
	The plaintiff’s written and oral submissions acknowledged the distinction between an “order” and a mere ruling on what was referred to as an initial point of law: Written Submissions at [35] referring to Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (2009) 75 NSWLR 392.
	
	
	It was noted in submissions for the plaintiff that for all intents and purposes the hearing of the proceedings before the Magistrate had finished and the parties were simply waiting for judgment.
	
	
	It was submitted that in the particular circumstances of the present case permitting the prosecution to re-open the hearing was more than a mere ruling on procedure: Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [40]. The prosecution, it was noted, could not re-open its case without an order permitting it to do so.
	
	
	In his oral submissions before this Court Mr Earl submitted:
	


“In making that decision which we can tell the court is in the nature of the order at that stage of the proceedings, it can’t possibly be simply a ruling on procedure or evidence. It is not so closely connected to the matter which has just been finished to re-open on that matter. The matter has been finished for quite some time in all respects in every way, shape or form. It amounts to an interlocutory order allowing a recommencement of the proceedings.” (T 9:20-30)


	
	Mr Earl submitted that in a particular case whether or not a decision amounted to a ruling or an order depended upon the circumstances of each case.
	


(ii) Question of Law


	
	In the plaintiff’s submission the Magistrate had misdirected himself as to the requirements that must exist before he could exercise his discretion to permit the prosecution to re-open its case: Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [43].
	
	
	The written submissions helpfully set out extracts from well-known authorities that have enunciated and applied the general rule that the Crown is not to be permitted in criminal proceedings to split its case. Reference was also made to the principles that address the limited circumstances in which the discretion to do so may be exercised: These included the High Court’s judgments in Shaw v The Queen (1952) 85 CLR 365 (‘Shaw’) and The Queen v Chin (1984-1985) 157 CLR 671 (‘Chin’).
	
	
	It was noted in the written submissions for the plaintiff at [49] that although the defendant “always knew” that the plaintiff maintained the position that the money was his and that it did not come from Lansdowne (which was said to have been the crux of the suspicion relied upon by the prosecution) the defendant did nothing to obtain DNA evidence until December 2013. Further, it was noted that no mention had been made of the possibility of this type of evidence being sought or obtained prior to the hearing of the proceedings on 21 February 2014, and no application for an adjournment was made so that DNA evidence could be obtained. It was submitted that the prosecution effectively elected to proceed without that evidence: Outline of the Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [50].
	
	
	Whilst it was submitted that the Magistrate in giving his decision had correctly summarised the relevant principles as stated in Chin, it was contended that he had misdirected himself as to the requirement for there to be exceptional circumstances. Additionally, it was contended that his Honour had misdirected himself as to the fact that it had been foreseen by the prosecution that such evidence may be available and that the prosecution, with such foresight decided to proceed with the case to completion without it, which, on the authorities it was submitted, was ground for refusing the application: Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [54].
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that the Magistrate erred in principle in stating that, “… the primary objective is the administration of justice” (T 13:45-T 14:10). This, it was argued, constituted an error on a question of law. The Magistrate had, in effect, employed that matter to, “… effectively rule out … foreseeability as required …” (T 14:1-5).
	


(iii) The Question of Fairness


	
	It was further contended that the Magistrate had misdirected himself because he had not directed his consideration to the question of fairness: Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [55].
	
	
	It was submitted that the admission of the evidence concerning DNA testing and analysis would:
	


“… lead to a grave injustice and effectively require a re-examination of the prosecution witnesses who were performing surveillance of the person Lansdowne and the plaintiff. They admit there is no evidence that the property was handed to the Plaintiff by Lansdowne which was the basis of the suspicion relied upon.” (Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [56])


	
	It was observed that the evidence tendered during the proceedings indicated an “interaction” between the plaintiff and Lansdowne, including an inspection of the plaintiff’s vehicle and shaking hands, and that there was no evidence adduced “… as to the easy transference of DNA from one object to another after physical contact with the person whose DNA is referred to”: Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [58].
	
	
	Mr Earl submitted that unfairness to the plaintiff would occur as a result of the Magistrate’s decision due to the fact that there would essentially be a “re-run” of the case: T 12:35-40. He submitted that it would be necessary, if the proceedings were re-opened, to cross-examine police officers who had conducted surveillance on the plaintiff during which there were the incidents of Lansdowne shaking hands and inspecting the vehicle. He maintained that the prejudice would be “enormous” by reason of what would be a “re-run of the whole case”.
	
	
	In his oral submissions in reply Mr Earl identified the inconvenience, delay and the financial cost associated with the proceedings to date and of any further hearing as relevant to the question of fairness. The plaintiff, he observed, is a married man and he does not qualify for legal aid. He would be required to travel up to Coffs Harbour in relation to any further hearing. The proceedings to date, it was submitted, had already been “very costly” to the plaintiff. These matters, it was submitted, all contributed to what was said to be “an enormous pressure” upon the plaintiff: T 37:25-38:10.
	
	
	It was also submitted by Mr Earl that the evidence established that the availability of DNA evidence was foreseeable by the prosecution: T 10:15-25; 35-40.
	
	
	Mr Earl again submitted that the learned Magistrate had not turned his mind to the question of fairness to the plaintiff and that he had misdirected himself in not finding that the evidence “ought reasonably have been foreseen”: T 10:39.
	
	
	Mr Earl stated it was clear that the police knew they had material upon which DNA testing could be carried out but that no application had been made “for a fast-track order” for DNA testing or analysis. Mr Earl accepted that the swabs taken from the elastic bands had been sent to Queensland so that this was not a normal case where swab material was usually only sent to the laboratory in Sydney. Mr Earl also properly acknowledged that the police had to send away to obtain Lansdowne’s DNA profile: T 11:39-50.
	


Defendant’s Submissions


	
	The defendant relied upon the Written Outline of the Defendant’s Submissions of Mr C McGorey, Solicitor Advocate, dated 30 October 2014, the Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions dated 23 February 2015, and oral submissions made on 26 March 2015.
	


(i) Interlocutory Order


	
	In the Written Outline of the Defendant’s Submissions dated 30 October 2014, it was submitted that the Magistrate’s ruling did not constitute an “interlocutory order” for the purposes of s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. This point was said to be the primary focus of the defendant’s submissions. It was contended that the Magistrate’s ruling did not command that anything be done. It was a ruling on the law as to whether the prosecution should be permitted to re-open its case: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Submissions at [43].
	
	
	The written submissions referred to a number of authorities that considered whether rulings, including, in particular, rulings on procedural matters, can be regarded as either interlocutory judgments or interlocutory orders: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Submissions at [35]-[42]. This was further addressed in the Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [3]. In the latter submissions, reference was made to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2005) 62 NSWLR 309, in particular at [30] where the Chief Justice approved remarks made by King CJ in Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee v a Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 at 127. In the latter case the Chief Justice stated:
	


“… judgments and orders on the one hand are to be distinguished from incidental rulings given in the course of hearing and determining such questions. Examples of such incidental rulings are those which relate to adjournments, the time and place of hearing, admissibility of evidence and the exclusion or otherwise of witnesses from the hearing, as well as decisions upon submissions as to matters of fact law or procedure made during the course of the hearing.”


	
	It was submitted for the defendant that the Magistrate’s ruling that the prosecution had leave to re-open its case constituted an “incidental ruling” made in the course of the hearing: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [4].
	
	
	Mr McGorey’s submission was that in accordance with judgment of the Chief Justice in The Queen v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633, an order involves a judicial operative act, in essence one that constitutes a command: T 23:45-50.
	
	
	The defendant’s submission was that a ruling permitting a case to be re-opened was no more a command than a ruling that the prosecution could lead evidence over objection: T 23:45-50.
	


(ii) Question of Law


	
	The defendant had submitted in its initial written submissions that the plaintiff had not argued that the Magistrate erroneously instructed himself as to the applicable legal principles: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Submissions at [56]. However, as noted above, the plaintiff subsequently amended the grounds relied upon. Those amendments were directed to the basis upon which it was contended that the Magistrate had misdirected himself with respect to relevant legal principle.
	
	
	The defendant’s submission was that a ground of appeal that asserted that his Honour had erred in applying the correctly stated principles to the facts, would constitute a mixed question of fact and law: R v PL (2009) 199 A Crim R 199; [2009] NSWCCA 256 at [26].
	
	
	The defendant contended that the Magistrate had correctly stated the principles set out in the judgment of Gibbs CJ and Wilson J in Chin: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [6].
	


(iii) Exceptional Circumstances


	
	The defendant took issue with the plaintiff’s submission to the effect that the learned Magistrate had misdirected himself in law as to what constituted “exceptional circumstances”. “Exceptional”, it was noted, is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning “out of the ordinary course, unusual, special”: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [8]-[9].
	
	
	It was submitted that, generally speaking, to be exceptional, the circumstances would need to be unusual, special or outside of the ordinary course. The defendant’s contention was that this was a straightforward concept and there was no evidence that his Honour misdirected himself in law as to the principles underpinning the “exceptional circumstances” requirement: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [10].
	
	
	In large part, it was submitted, the plaintiff’s complaint was really about how his Honour applied the principles and on that basis there was no question of law involved: T 26:15-25.
	
	
	On the issue of exceptional circumstances, Mr McGorey submitted that police had made a request for DNA testing to be performed in a timely manner. Notwithstanding that request, the fact was that the results were not available as at the time the hearing commenced. Reference was also made by Mr McGorey to what he termed “the pragmatic realities of the Local Court in the significant wait lists” and that an adjournment of a hearing can cause difficulties to the Local Court list (T 35: 20-25). The officer in charge of the investigation, it was submitted, had not left it to the last moment in seeking testing and analysis of the swab material taken from the elastic bands. An additional fact of relevance was said to be that the DNA material of Mr Lansdowne was in Queensland and that there was a need for it to be transferred to New South Wales. All such matters, it was submitted, are to be taken into account on the subject of exceptional circumstances: T 35:19-26.
	


(iv) Reasonably Foreseeable


	
	On the question of whether the calling of the evidence was “reasonably foreseeable” it was submitted that the Magistrate proceeded on the basis that the discretion should be exercised in the prosecution’s favour notwithstanding that “it could be reasonably foreseeable that [calling of the DNA evidence] could be a possibility”. In doing so, it was stated, his Honour had previously acknowledged that “generally speaking” the Court should not ordinarily do so: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [17].
	
	
	It was further submitted that the principles enunciated by Gibbs CJ and Wilson J in Chin do not mandatorily require that leave be refused if the occasion was reasonably foreseeable: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [19].
	


(v) The Principle of Fairness


	
	In the Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions it was noted that Dawson J in Chin at 685 noted that the principle that the prosecution not be permitted to split its case is “essentially one of fairness” (at 685) to the accused.
	
	
	The defendant’s submission was that the issue of “fairness” underpinned the requirement that the learned Magistrate be satisfied that “exceptional circumstances” existed before permitting the prosecution to re-open to call further evidence after the close of the defence’s case. The principle of fairness thereby operated in the exercise of the discretion: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [21].
	
	
	Mr McGorey stated that in analysing his Honour’s reasons for granting leave to the prosecution to re-open the hearing for the purposes of adducing DNA evidence, it was relevant to take into account the submissions that were made to his Honour both by the prosecution and the accused. Mr McGorey submitted that, a reading of the transcript of submissions indicates that the plaintiff’s contention focussed on the issue of “reasonable foreseeability” and that his Honour was not requested to have regard to particular aspects of unfairness: T 27:20-30.
	
	
	It was submitted by the defendant in the present proceedings that the question of fairness arises in two respects. Firstly, in terms of the fairness requirement that underpins the requirement for exceptional circumstances. Secondly, the role that the question of fairness plays in the exercise of the discretion: T 31:25-50.
	
	
	On the matters raised by Mr Earl said to give rise to prejudice to the accused, Mr McGorey questioned whether, on a further hearing, there would in fact be a need to recall police officers who carried out surveillance as to what they saw take place between the plaintiff and Mr Lansdowne and the submission that there could be a downside or detriment to the accused in doing so: T 32:20-26.
	
	
	On the other hand Mr McGorey accepted that, on the basis of the transcript of the evidence of the proceedings before the learned Magistrate there seemed to be an evidentiary basis for an argument to be mounted by the plaintiff as to transference of DNA material. In those circumstances it would be for the Crown to exclude the possibility that there has been any transference of Mr Lansdowne’s DNA: T 32:35-40.
	
	
	In relation to any interaction between the plaintiff and Mr Lansdowne when they were together in the bar, it was submitted that the CCTV footage of them would speak for itself and show any “interactions” between them. The evidence in that respect it was noted was objective evidence in itself: T 32:45-50.
	
	
	In addition to the matters referred to in [78] above, it was submitted that, having regard to the learned Magistrate’s reasons, appropriate regard should be given to the practical realities of a Local Court and the expectation that a prompt and practical judgment be delivered: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [22].
	
	
	It was submitted that leave to appeal should be refused, or, alternatively, the substantive appeal dismissed, and that an order for costs in the defendant’s favour be made: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [23].
	


CONSIDERATION

1. The Issue of “Interlocutory Order”


	
	The exercise of jurisdiction which the plaintiff seeks in these proceedings is that provided for in s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. However, in that respect the defendant’s submissions dispute jurisdiction.
	
	
	As discussed above, the plaintiff submitted that the decision of the Magistrate made on 9 April 2014 constituted an interlocutory order. In that respect, it was contended on his behalf that the decision to permit the prosecution to re-open in the circumstances of the case was more than a mere ruling on procedure: Written Outline of the Plaintiff’s Submissions at [40].
	
	
	As also noted above, the defendant took a contrary position submitting that the “ruling” by the Magistrate granting leave to the prosecution to re-open its case constituted an “incidental ruling” made in the course of the hearing and did not constitute an “interlocutory order”: Written Outline of the Defendant’s Supplementary Submissions at [4]-[5]. On that basis the defendant effectively submitted that in these proceedings the jurisdiction under s 53(3)(b) is not available to the plaintiff.
	
	
	There is no definition in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act of the expression “interlocutory order” in s 53(3)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, permits an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from an “interlocutory judgment or order” made in proceedings to which the section applies. There are authorities that hold that a ruling on admissibility of evidence does not generally amount to “an interlocutory judgment or order” within s 5F. However, in R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 (cited with approval in DPP v Leonard (2001) 53 NSWLR 227 at [40] per James J) a case involving an appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, the interlocutory decision effectively brought to an end the prosecution of the respondents by excluding all of the evidence the Crown might seek to rely upon, the decision relying upon s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. That decision was held not to be a mere ruling but was held to be an interlocutory decision.
	
	
	The approach taken in R v Bozatsis accordingly involved one that took into account the effect of what was argued to have been an interlocutory order, or the consequences flowing from it to the viability of the proceedings, in determining whether or not it constituted or amounted to an “interlocutory order”, for the purpose of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	As to a ruling on evidence, in R v Steffan [1993] 30 NSWLR 633, the Court (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Sharpe JJ) observed, at p 636:
	


“A judgment is the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court. An order is a command by a court that something be done (or not done). It is unnecessary in the present case to discuss the highly technical distinction between interlocutory and final judgments or orders. If the ruling on evidence in this case was either a judgment or order, it was clearly interlocutory in nature. It is not immediately self-evident as a matter of ordinary usage how a ruling on the admissibility of evidence could be entered in the records of the court as a judgment, or how it commands that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It is true that such a ruling may be accompanied (as it was here) by elaborate reasons which have been expressed in a document called a ‘judgment’, but that is an altogether different usage of the word ‘judgment’ and denotes the reasons which have been expressed rather than the formal act of the court.”


	
	There is authority for the proposition that rulings made during a trial are not interlocutory orders: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 (refusal of a trial judge to direct recall of a Crown witness for further cross-examination was held not to be an interlocutory judgment or an interlocutory order).
	
	
	A ruling on evidence made in advance of or in the course of a trial is not an interlocutory judgment or order within s 5F: R v Steffan, supra, at p 639. See also R v Adamson [2005] NSWCCA 7.
	
	
	In Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), Spigelman CJ observed:
	


“14.   Whether a decision or ruling constitutes a ‘judgment or order’ turns on whether there is an operative judicial act: see Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 17; (2005) 62 NSWLR 309 at [29] …”


	
	In Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee v a Practitioner, King CJ observed at 127:
	


“There is no completely satisfying definition of either ‘judgment’ or ‘order’ and no exhaustively definitive way of distinguishing between judicial acts which should be characterised as judgments and judicial acts which should be characterised as orders. Fortunately it is unnecessary for present purposes to make such a distinction. If the decision falls within either description it is appealable.

A judgment or order is a judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings then before the court or judge. The question decided may be the substantive question or one of the substantive questions raised in the action; or it may be the question or one of the questions raised in interlocutory proceedings taken in the course of the progress of the action. Judgments and orders on the one hand are to be distinguished from incidental rulings given in the course of hearing and determining such questions. Examples of such incidental rulings are those which relate to adjournments, the time and place of hearing, admissibility of evidence and the exclusion or otherwise of witnesses from the hearing, as well as decisions upon submissions as to matters of fact law or procedure made during the course of a hearing. Such incidental rulings are not judgments or orders and are therefore not appealable even by leave.” (emphasis added)


	
	There being no statutory definition of the phrase “interlocutory judgment or order” and no bright line test that distinguishes between what is an interlocutory order and an incidental ruling, there is necessarily a degree of uncertainty into which category the Magistrate’s decision in this case (to grant the prosecution’s application to re-open the case for the purpose of adducing evidence based on DNA testing and analysis), falls.
	
	
	On the jurisdictional issue to which I have referred it is essential that attention be given to:
	



	
	The nature of the application the Magistrate was called upon to decide;
	
	
	The nature and terms of the Magistrate’s decision or ruling;
	
	
	The specific terminology of s 53(3)(b) that confer and define rights of appeal in relation to an interlocutory order; and
	
	
	The principles that must be applied in the construction and application of s 53(3)(b).
	



	
	As to (1), the application was an oral application made by the prosecution to re-open its case on the basis of the results of DNA analysis sought by police before but received following the hearing. The Magistrate was informed that if leave to re-open was granted, the prosecution indicated that it would require time to put the evidence into admissible form.
	
	
	As to (2), the terms of the Magistrate’s determination have been extracted and reproduced in [40] above. The decision or ruling was given ex tempore. The Magistrate said that he was going to “allow” the application. There was no order expressly referred to or made by the Magistrate when giving his decision or ruling which involved a discretionary exercise of power with respect to the further conduct of the proceedings permitting the prosecution to re-open its case.
	
	
	As to (3), the legislature chose to limit the right of appeal on a question of law alone (and only by leave of the Supreme Court) to “an interlocutory order” made by the Local Court in relation to a person in summary proceedings. The legislature chose not to extend the right of appeal to an interlocutory “decision” or to an interlocutory “judgment”.
	
	
	As to (4), the principles that guide the construction of s 53(3)(b) were considered by Spigelman CJ in Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), supra.
	
	
	In that case, the magistrate had dealt with two preliminary questions of law, one being the proper interpretation of s 308H of the Crimes Act and the other an issue of duplicity of the charges brought against the plaintiff.
	
	
	There was no issue in that case as to whether the magistrate’s determination was “interlocutory”. The issue was whether her Honour had made an “order” within the meaning of s 53(3)(b).
	
	
	The following observations of Spigelman CJ in Salter are pertinent to the issue in the present case.
	



	
	It was noteworthy, the Chief Justice noted, that the word “order” appears in s 53(3)(b) alone and not, as is often the case, as part of a broader formulation extending to “judgment or order”: cf Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F, a matter discussed in R v Steffan, supra, at 636-639; Salter at [10]-[11].
	
	
	The word “order” is narrower in scope than the word “judgment”, although they may substantially overlap in a particular statutory framework. For example, a decision on a separate question of law will constitute a “judgment” in a particular statutory context: at [13]‑[14].
	
	
	Whether a decision or ruling constitutes a “judgment or order” turns on whether there is an operative judicial act: Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd at [29]. In Salter there was held to be no operative judicial act: (at [14]-[15]).
	
	
	Where there is no more than an answer by a magistrate on a question of law, there is no order: Salter at [15]-[16]). Such a determination does not “command that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It remains no more than a ruling, one which can be tested on appeal to this Court after conviction”: Steffan at 639.
	



	
	In addition to the above matters, Spigelman CJ in Salter addressed the issues of ultimate rights of appeal and the undesirability of fragmenting summary proceeding as matters that bear upon or provide a basis or rationale for confining the jurisdiction under s 53(3)(b).
	
	
	The Chief Justice observed at 395 in that respect:
	


“By s 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a conviction or sentence, by leave or, pursuant to s 52(1), without leave on a question of law. It is plainly undesirable to fragment committal or summary proceedings by interlocutory appeals. The ability to appeal after conviction strongly indicates that the word ‘order’ in both par (a) and par (b) of s 53(3) should not be given an expansive meaning.”


	
	The terms of s 53(3)(b) do not permit appeals against “decisions” of an interlocutory nature. This was made plain in Salter at [24]:
	


“Section 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act cannot be interpreted as if it said “an interlocutory decision” has been made. Nor can s 53(3)(a) be read as if it said a decision has been made in committal proceedings. That would permit fragmentation of both kinds of proceedings to a degree which could not have been intended. I note that the leave requirement would not, of itself, serve that purpose because of the possible disruption occasioned by applications for leave.” (at [24])


	
	Campbell JA in Salter was of the same opinion on the restrictive nature of appeals permitted under s 53(3)(b).
	


“The summons in the Supreme Court failed to reflect the terms of s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, in that it sought ‘leave to appeal from the interlocutory decision in the Tribunal below’. Section 53(3)(b) does not confer jurisdiction for the Supreme Court to give leave to appeal against an ‘interlocutory decision’ only against an ‘interlocutory order’. There are some interlocutory decisions, of which those involved in the present case are examples, that are not in themselves interlocutory orders, and do not ever come to be given effect to by an interlocutory order.” (at [32])


	
	Whilst the Magistrate’s determination in the present case can be said to have had the effect of permitting the prosecution to re-open its case to pursue an additional line of evidence based upon a DNA analysis undertaken by the Forensic and Analytical Science Services, I do not consider that the character and effect of the Magistrate’s determination by way of granting the application to re-open answers the description of an “order” or “interlocutory order” in terms of s 53(3)(b). It was a ruling on a discretionary question involving legal principles on whether the prosecution ought, in the circumstances established by evidence on the application, be permitted to re-open its case.
	
	
	Accordingly, on that basis, it must follow that the proceedings do not fall within the jurisdiction conferred by that provision.
	


2. Question of Law


	
	Notwithstanding the conclusion expressed above that the appeal brought by the plaintiff is not within the jurisdiction provided by s 53(3)(b) as the Magistrate did not make an interlocutory order, his determination being in the nature of a ruling on an application to re-open, I proceed to deal with the parties’ submissions upon the asserted questions of law that were made upon the premise, contrary to the conclusion expressed above, that the jurisdictional requirements under s 53(3)(b) had been satisfied.
	


(i) Principles


	
	The following principles are well-established:
	



	
	The general principle is that the prosecution must present its case completely before the accused is called upon for his/her defence: R v Chin (1985) 157 CLR 671 per Gibbs CJ and Wilson J at 676.
	
	
	In a criminal trial, a trial judge has a discretionary power to allow the prosecution to call evidence after the close of the case for the defence. However, the exercise of the power must be exercised in accordance with established principles. That said, there is no rigid formula by which the discretion is to be exercised: Shaw at 380.
	
	
	The prosecution should only be permitted to call evidence after evidence given for the defence if the circumstances are very special or exceptional: Chin, supra, at 676.
	
	
	“Generally speaking” the prosecution should not be permitted to do so if the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen: Chin, supra, at p 676.
	
	
	The principle would not prevent the prosecution from giving reply evidence directed to an issue the proof of which did not lie on the prosecution. Examples include a defence of insanity or rebutting evidence of the accused’s good character, provided that the prosecution had not anticipated the raising of an issue of that kind and led evidence with regard to it, for the prosecution must not split its case on any issue: Chin, supra, at p 676.
	
	
	Evidence in rebuttal may be permitted in circumstances, if for some reason, it was not available to the prosecution until after it had closed its case: Chin at 677; R v Rice [1963] 1 QB 857 at 867-8; R v Levy and Tait (1966) 50 Cr App 198.
	



	
	In Shaw, the appellant had made a potentially incriminating statement to police. The Crown sought to contend that his statement to police at the scene of the murder in question suggested or implied that he knew that the deceased victim had been “throttled”.
	
	
	In Shaw, prior to the commencement of the cross-examination of the appellant, the Crown prosecutor applied to recall the police witnesses who had been present at the crime scene. Leave was granted to do so. After the close of the case for the defence seven police officers were recalled and examined and cross-examined as to rebut the possibility of someone in the course of police investigations at the crime scene having made a statement within the hearing of the appellant (Shaw) to the effect that the deceased had been throttled or strangled and of the appellant having heard it.
	
	
	In the joint judgment (Dixon, McTiernan, Webb and Kitto JJ) it was noted that the cumulative effect of this evidence:
	


“… was to bring into strong relief the admission made by the prisoner that he had used the word ‘throttled’ to give great emphasis to the point made by the Crown Prosecutor upon it, as well as the contradiction which was involved of the prisoner’s evidence by so many witnesses and also to detract from any advantage the prisoner might obtain in placing before the jury by his personal evidence the answer he made to the charge as the final thing before the addresses of counsel and the charge to the jury by the judge”: (at p 378).


	
	The High Court in Shaw addressed the rule against permitting the Crown to re-open its case “unless the circumstances are most exceptional” (p 380). The following remarks were made:
	


“It seems to us unsafe to adopt a rigid formula in view of the almost infinite variety of difficulties that may arise in a criminal trial. It is probably enough to say that the occasion must be very special or exceptional to warrant a departure from the principle that the prosecution must offer all its proofs during the progress of the Crown case before the prisoner is called upon for his defence.” (at p 380)

“… generally speaking an occasion will not suffice for allowing an exceptional course if it ought reasonably to have been foresee.” (emphasis added) (at p 380)


	
	In the course of a separate judgment, Fullager J in Shaw stated that the test propounded by Tindal CJ as used in R v Frost (1839) 4 St Tr (NS) at p 386 was “too strict and rigid”: at p 383. His Honour there noted:
	


“.. In the second place, the rule so stated is on its face fundamentally unsound and calculated not to aid but to impede the administration of justice. After all, the aim of legal proceedings, including criminal proceedings, is supposed to be to elicit the truth so far as human imperfection permits …” (at p 383)


	
	Fullagar J formulated the test to be applied in the following terms:
	


“These things having been said, however, it remains true and important that the Crown should be permitted to adduce evidence after the close of the case for the defence only in exceptional circumstances and when it is reasonably clear that the accused will not be unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the evidence. A wide discretion must be conceded to the judge presiding at the trial but it should be regarded as limited in that way, and it is to be remembered that the practical effect of the evidence on the minds of a jury may differ according as the evidence is adduced in chief or by way of replication. But the discretion ought not be regarded as further limited or as governed by any rigid rule or formula … It is impossible to foresee and provide a priori for the infinite variety of circumstances in which either question may arise.” (at p 383-384)


	
	In Killick v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565, the issue was whether a trial judge may permit the Crown to adduce evidence after the close of the case for the defence in order to rebut an alibi sworn by the accused in the course of his evidence, and not previously the subject of evidence at the trial but which the Crown ought reasonably to have foreseen would be raised by the accused at the trial, because it had been put forward by him in earlier legal proceedings.
	
	
	In that case, in the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ, Murphy and Aickin JJ, it was stated that:
	


“The general rule that all available evidence on which the prosecution intends to rely in proof of the guilt of the accused should be presented before the close of the case for the Crown is not merely a technical rule, but an important rule of fairness. Evidence tendered by the Crown after the defence has closed its case may assume an inflated importance in the eyes of the jury. The very fact that the last piece of evidence which the jury hears is given in contradiction of evidence already given by or on behalf of the accused tends to tilt the scales in favour of the prosecution.” (at 569) (emphasis added)

(ii) The Issue of a ‘Question of Law’ in this Case


	
	The difference between the statutory formulation considered by the High Court in Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 and a provision such as s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act which restricts the right of appeal to “a ground that involves a question of law alone” was the subject of consideration in R v JS (2007) 175 A Crim R 108; [2007] NSWCCA 272 and in R v PL (2009) 199 A Crim R 199; [2009] NSWCCA 256.
	
	
	It is now clear from those authorities that the provisions of s 53(3)(b) are to be construed as follows:
	



	
	An appeal under s 53(3)(b) does not lie on a mixed question of fact and law: R v PL per Spigelman CJ at [25].
	
	
	The process of “applying” a legal principle to the facts of a case involves a mixed question of fact and law which is accordingly not within s 53(3)(b): R v PL per Spigelman CJ at [26].
	
	
	An error as to an essential legal proposition or a legal requirement which constitutes a distinct and separate step in the reasoning process involves a question of law alone. An example is a case of the interpretation of a statutory provision as considered in R v JS.
	



	
	If what the Magistrate did in the present case was to wrongly apply correct principles to the facts that would constitute an error of mixed fact of law and an appeal would not lie: Smith v R (2000) 1 WLR 1644 at 1653; Brough v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWSC 1396 (Button J at [34]).
	
	
	In determining the prosecution’s application to re-open the hearing the question is whether his Honour applied incorrect principle(s) to his consideration of the application and thereby committed an error of law alone. An alternative would be a case in which the alleged errors relied upon involved error in the application of a legal principle to the facts of the case. If so, then it would involve a mixed question of fact and law and not a question of law alone.
	
	
	The possibility of such evidence before a jury assuming “inflated importance” would not usually be considered a realistic possibility where the trial court is constituted by an experienced Magistrate. In other words, if evidence of DNA testing and analysis performed by the Forensic Analytical Science Services laboratories was admitted in the Crown case no basis exists (and understandably no submission was made) to suggest that such evidence, if admitted, would unfairly gain force or be given “inflated importance” by the Magistrate by reason only of the stage at which the evidence was admitted.
	
	
	However, that said, the discretion to allow the prosecution to adduce further evidence following completion of the defence case must, of course, nonetheless, be exercised in accordance with the principles defined in Shaw and Chin, in particular, that there be exceptional circumstances. The whole of the relevant factual circumstances of each case in that respect must be taken into account.
	


(iii) Application of Principles


	
	The plaintiff submitted, as discussed above at [38], that the Magistrate had misdirected himself as to the legal requirements that must be addressed before the discretionary power to re-open, was exercised. The alleged misdirections, it was argued, went to:
	



	
	The issue of fairness.
	
	
	Whether the occasion for calling further evidence ought reasonably have been foreseen; (points (b) and (c) in MFI-1 extracted at [38]).
	
	
	Reliance by the Magistrate upon the administration of justice in New South Wales as a primary objective in exercising the discretion.
	



	
	In the consideration of each of these points, the following matters are to be taken into account:
	



	
	The discretionary nature of the power to re-open must be exercised in accordance with principles enunciated by the High Court in Shaw, Chin and as applied in Lawrence and Killick.
	
	
	The matters established by the affidavit evidence of Detective Zimmer in support of the application to re-open.
	
	
	The relevant considerations that the Magistrate was required to take into account and the exclusion of any irrelevant consideration.
	
	
	The Magistrate’s reasons in support of his determination to re-open the hearing.
	



	
	As to the failure of the prosecution to adduce DNA evidence in its case on 21 February 2014, the discussion of the factual matters above indicates that this was not a case where investigating police overlooked or failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing investigations with a view to obtaining DNA material and obtaining testing and analysis of any such material. Such inquiries were pursued soon after the entry of the plaintiff’s not guilty plea. The written request by police for DNA testing by Forensic and Analytical Science Services noted that the hearing date of 21 February 2014 had been fixed. The laboratory, as discussed above, had been unable to fulfil the request by that date. The Magistrate referred to the fact that delays were commonly experienced in obtaining DNA results. It appears on the basis of what was said by his Honour that that was attributed to the well-known heavy demands placed upon the laboratory for DNA testing and analysis.
	
	
	The Magistrate made his observations on this problem in his reasons extracted above at [40].
	
	
	In the course of giving his ex tempore reasons, which were briefly stated, his Honour was clearly mindful of both the limitations that applied to the prosecution in its application as indicated by his reference to the High Court’s decision in R v Chin and to the relevant principles as enunciated in that case, in particular:
	



	
	The general principle that the prosecution must present its case completely before the defence is called upon for his defence.
	
	
	The discretion to permit evidence to be called by the prosecution after evidence has been given for the defence, should only be allowed if the circumstances were very special or exceptional and generally speaking, not if the occasion for calling further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen.
	



	
	His Honour, after referring to the difficulty and delays of obtaining DNA evidence from the “laboratories”, turned to what was the central issue in the exercise of the discretion, namely, “was it reasonable [sic] foreseeable that this evidence should have been produced to the Court?” This question, taken in context, was addressing the issue of “reasonable foreseeability” to which the High Court referred in Chin. His Honour referred to an apparent mistake having been made (by whom and as to exactly what is not specifically stated). Critically he then referred to the lastmentioned issue in these terms:
	


“… should the defendant benefit for [sic] that in the circumstances where it is reasonable [sic] foreseeable that should have been done and it has not been done. Well; as I have alluded to, the reality in regard to these types of matters is that evidence is difficult to produce on time in regard to drug type matters. Generally speaking, as the judge says in that matter, it would be reasonably foreseeable that that could be a possibility but I think in the circumstances I have to disregard that because the primary objective of course is the administration of justice in New South Wales and this case I am of the view falls into what can be regarded as an exceptional circumstance …”. (T 9 April 2014 p 7, Exhibited as part of Exhibit AA1 to the Affidavit of Mr Abbas).


	
	It is necessary to make some allowance for the unedited and unpunctuated record of the ex tempore decision given in a busy magistrate’s court. The transcript should be examined with that in mind: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472, 478-9 per Kirby P.
	
	
	In relation to the above quoted passage from the ex tempore decision in this case, a fair reading, in my opinion, discloses the following matters as having formed part of the decision:
	



	
	It was reasonably foreseeable that DNA testing and analysis would possibly produce or result in evidence relevant to the money found in the plaintiff’s vehicle.
	
	
	Although such DNA testing and analysis had been sought by police in accordance with conventional processes or protocols, no results had become available as at the hearing date, 21 February 2014.
	
	
	The unavailability of DNA test results was part of a problem “that evidence is difficult to produce on time in regard to drug type matters”: T 9 April 2014 at p 7.
	
	
	It would “be reasonably foreseeable that that could be a possibility …”: T 9 April 2014 at p 7.
	
	
	In “the circumstances” the Magistrate stated he had to “disregard” that fact (i.e. the issue of reasonable foreseeability at (4) above) “because the primary objective is the administration of justice.”
	



	
	The Magistrate’s reasoning proceeded upon the basis that the principle was as stated in the passage he quoted from Chin, that is, the circumstances needed to be “very special or exceptional” and “generally speaking” leave was not to be granted if the occasion for calling further evidence ought reasonably have been foreseen.
	
	
	The question of whether the circumstances are “very special” or “exceptional” is to be determined having regard to all of the relevant circumstances: Morris v R [2010] NSWCCA 152 per McClellan CJ at CL at [30] with whom Buddin J and Barr AJ agreed at [37] and [38]. As the then Chief Judge at Common Law there observed, the relevant statement of principle in Chin by Gibbs CJ and Wilson J, extracted in that judgment (and referred to by the Magistrate in this case), makes plain that one of those circumstances which may be determinative is whether the need to call further evidence “ought reasonably to have been foreseen”. McClellan CJ at CL also observed at [30]:
	


“That issue is not to be resolved as a separate question although of considerable significance when determining whether the application to re-open should be granted.”


	
	The above statement of principle by the High Court in Chin which referred to the proposition that “generally speaking” the prosecution should not be permitted to call evidence after evidence has been given for the defence where the further evidence ought to have been foreseen, was expressed in terms that admitted of the possibility of the discretion in the particular circumstances of a case being exercised permitting the prosecution to do so notwithstanding such further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen. As stated in Morris, that would be one of the circumstances to be considered.
	
	
	In the present case the foreseeability of at least the possibility of DNA evidence becoming available to the prosecution was at the centre of the Magistrate’s decision. He considered the particular circumstances bearing upon the question of “reasonable foreseeability” as discussed above. In applying the correct statement of principle to the facts of this case, as his Honour did, he clearly considered and concluded that the delay in the DNA testing and the unavailability of the test results as at the date of the hearing was a “circumstance”, along with that of reasonable foreseeability, that gave rise to or that constituted an exceptional circumstance. Even if it could be said that there was error in applying the relevant principles to the facts of the case that, on the basis explained above, could not constitute an error of law alone.
	


(iv) The Issue of Fairness


	
	The issue of fairness was raised in the proceedings in this court. Mr Earl for the plaintiff submitted that there was unfairness to the plaintiff by reason of the need to have prosecution witnesses recalled for further cross-examination, as well as factors such as the impact upon the plaintiff in terms of additional cost and stress to him.
	
	
	However, the species of fairness considered in cases such as Shaw and Chin, focused upon the impact that evidence adduced, by the prosecution being permitted to re-open its case after evidence had been called by the defence, was upon the trial process itself, in particular upon the juries in those cases. In those cases involving trial by jury, such evidence, it was held, produced unfairness. In Shaw, it was determined that the evidence given by seven officers who were recalled, was very likely to have operated unfavourably to the accused: per Dixon, McTiernan, Webb and Kitto JJ at p 381. The unfairness in other words in that case arose by reason of what became a “tactical disadvantage” which Fullager J stated often results from “the magnification of a comparatively unimportant issue”: Shaw at 384.
	
	
	In Killick, as noted at [125], evidence called by the prosecution in a jury trial pursuant to leave to re-open can assume “an inflated importance in the eyes of the jury”: at 569.
	
	
	Even if the issue of fairness had been raised and argued before the Magistrate on the hearing of the re-opening application, the matters of asserted unfairness identified by Mr Earl would not, in my opinion, have constituted “circumstances” that the Magistrate was required as a matter of relevant legal principle to have determined favourably to the plaintiff.
	


(v) The Administration of Justice


	
	The reference by the Magistrate to the administration of justice as a primary objective is to be seen in context of the matters that were addressed by him immediately before that reference, namely the fact that police had not received a response from the Department of Analytical Laboratories to its request for DNA testing.
	
	
	The Magistrate was responding to the matters put before him on the application to re-open. To better understand what the Magistrate was addressing it is necessary to set out the relevant part of the submission made by the prosecutor on 9 April 2014 as follows:
	


“At the time when the matter was set for hearing, in fact at the time of the hearing, nothing had been received from the Department of Laboratory indicating that any analysis had taken place. In fact, nothing had been received saying that nothing was even able to be analysed. Your Honour would be aware if you take judicial notice of how many things go down to these analytical laboratories in which a sample can’t even be obtained or it is not suitable for presentation of court. It wasn’t until after the hearing. So on that basis the prosecution rightfully in my respectful submission assume that nothing was available to be presented as part of the case. The prosecution presented the evidence as part of the case, what was available to it. And it wasn’t until after the prosecution concluded its case, the defence concluded its case and your Honour even asked the prosecution if there is evidence in reply in which we stated there wasn’t and the matter was adjourned for decision, that the prosecution became aware that there was in fact a sample which was able to be analysed and that sample came back of understood to be matching Mr Lansdowne’s DNA. The importance of that is that Mr Lansdowne is what the prosecution say where this money came from as part of the suspicion attaching to the proceeds of the crime.

The chain of events your Honour, as soon as the OIC was notified by email, he notified me. That day I notified Mr Abas (sic), indicating that this evidence had been received. I concede at today’s date, it is not in admissible form. The affidavit addresses that your Honour what is required for that to happen now. The reason this has been put on, this application has been put on, and I can see there is no chain of custody statement. …” (T 9 April 2014 at p 4: 15-35)


	
	In context, the Magistrate’s reference to the administration of justice was based upon the requirement, as he determined it, that in the circumstances of the receipt of advice as to the DNA testing subsequent to the hearing, the granting of the application to re-open, as he assessed it, was required to provide the prosecution with the opportunity of adducing DNA evidence that was not previously available. The reference by the Magistrate to the “primary objective” of the administration of justice must, in my opinion, be taken as a reference to the objective of allowing parties to criminal proceedings the opportunity to adduce evidence as to relevant facts in the fair and proper conduct of such proceedings.
	
	
	The proper administration of justice is, of course, a fundamental objective in legal proceedings including criminal proceedings, as Fullager J observed in the extract set out in [122] above. I do not consider that the Magistrate’s reference to that aspect, in context as discussed above, can be taken to be or evidence of the adoption by him of incorrect legal principles.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders and directions:
	



	
	An order extending time for the plaintiff to commence these proceedings out of time.
	
	
	The proceedings are dismissed.
	
	
	I will hear the parties on the question of costs.

		07 May 2015",2015-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766575,R v Do (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 512,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 18 March 2015 the offender was found guilty by a jury of murdering Kim Lien Huyhn on 13 September 2012 in her home at 4 Alick Street, Cabramatta. He stands now to be sentenced for that offence.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment.
	


The facts


	
	I find the following facts. Those facts which are found against the offender have been found by me beyond reasonable doubt and those in his favour on the balance of probabilities. It is my obligation to make findings of fact consistent with the verdict of the jury.
	
	
	The offender was born on 1 March 1954. He was 58 years of age at the time of the offending and is now aged 61. He was born and raised in Vietnam and schooled to year 9 level.
	
	
	He married in Vietnam and two children were born there. At some time he fled to the United States of America as a result of his involvement in the Vietnam war. Four further children were born in the United States and all six children were raised by the offender and his former wife.
	
	
	The offender was examined by Dr Susan Pulman and Lisa Zipparo, both neuropsychologists, at one consultation in October 2014. This was prior to his trial. The offender emerges from their report as a relatively simple man with simple needs. The psychologists thought that he had sustained brain damage from being brutalised when captured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam war. He demonstrated average non-verbal abilities and intact verbal memory function but he showed compromised performance in tasks of visual memory and more complex processing speed and working memory tasks. That comparison was strongly suggestive of brain damage.
	
	
	Although he had lived in the United States from about 1980 he had learnt very little English because his wife took care of everything. Although he worked for short periods when he first moved to the United States he was largely unemployed and on a disability pension due to war wounds to his leg, and, presumably, his brain.
	
	
	He and his wife separated in about 2006 and shortly after that time the offender met the deceased online. At some point she travelled to the United States to meet him and on another occasion prior to his moving to Australia he came here where he met the three daughters of the deceased.
	
	
	In July 2011 the deceased and the offender were married at Sacramento in California. He then travelled to Australia with the deceased. He was sponsored here on a spousal visa by the deceased and that remained his status at the time of the deceased’s death.
	
	
	The deceased was aged 54 at the date of her death. She had previously been married and three daughters Alice, Aminda and Anna were born to that marriage. In 2001 the deceased’s former husband had a serious stroke. He subsequently developed Alzheimer’s disease. Although the deceased looked after him for a period of time his needs became so great that it was not possible for him to be looked after other than in a full time nursing facility. At some time after these events the deceased and her former husband were divorced. However, they apparently remained on good terms.
	
	
	The deceased and her former husband had run a strata management company called K & H Real Estate from premises in Canley Vale, a few kilometres from where they lived. After her former husband suffered his stroke the deceased continued to carry on this business herself.
	
	
	The offender and the deceased lived at the house at 4 Alick Street, Cabramatta with two of the deceased’s daughters, Aminda and Anna although by reason of Anna’s ongoing training as a vet she spent lengthy periods of time living away from home.
	
	
	For some time after they met and after they married the relationship between the deceased and the offender was harmonious. The evidence suggests that the offender was accepted into the family by the deceased’s three daughters who seemed to be favourably disposed towards him.
	
	
	However, it seems clear that the relationship between the deceased and the offender started to deteriorate from about four months or so prior to the deceased’s death. From about that time the offender was sleeping downstairs, generally in the front room on the left of the hallway on a sofa bed although sometimes in the room on the right of the hallway on a futon bed. At times the deceased would lock her bedroom door upstairs. There was evidence from the deceased’s daughters that their mother could be hard on the offender, calling him unpleasant names, asserting that he was lazy and accusing him of cheating on her with women he contacted on the internet. The picture that emerged of the offender from the deceased’s daughters was of a fairly passive individual who simply endured what was directed towards him by the deceased. Even where the daughters expressed concern to him about the way the deceased spoke to him, he would shrug it off.
	
	
	The offender was socially isolated having virtually no friends or acquaintances apart from the deceased and her family. He claimed not even to know the Vietnamese neighbours to speak to. None of this appeared to bother him.
	
	
	The relationship between the deceased and the offender was clearly an unequal one. The deceased was an apparently successful businesswoman with money and other property. The picture of the deceased which emerges from the evidence is that of a fairly tough-minded and driven person who had firm ideas about what was and was not appropriate behaviour, particularly for her daughters, but was loving and supportive of her daughters to give them the best start in life.
	
	
	On the other hand, the offender had virtually nothing and appears to have been financially and probably emotionally dependent upon the deceased. He worked in her business, doing painting and other handiwork. Certainly, his presence in this country was entirely dependent upon his being sponsored for a visa by the deceased. In trying to understand why the deceased was killed by him, it is perhaps significant that in the months leading up to her death the deceased had asked each of her daughters what they thought about the offender and whether they thought she should send him back to the United States.
	


The killing of the deceased


	
	It is not known precisely when on 13 September 2012 the deceased was killed. Dr Irvine, the forensic pathologist, was not able to put any time on the deceased’s death based on her examination of the deceased. She said that the best that could be done was to look at objective factors about it when it was known that the deceased was last alive and when she was first found dead.
	
	
	The last contact any person had with the deceased, apart from her killer, was at 12:28pm on that day when she had a phone call with Mr Michael Chakkas who was on the strata committee for a block of units at Warwick Farm of which the deceased was the strata manager. It is not known where the deceased was when Mr Chakkas spoke to her. However, shortly after that time at 12.48pm the offender was using the home computer in the front room of the house.
	
	
	It seems likely that the deceased went to her office in Canley Vale on the day of her death. The offender said that she went home during the afternoon. That is likely to be correct because one of her neighbours in Alick St, Mrs Curtis, said that she heard the familiar sound of the deceased’s car’s security system being activated in the afternoon. Aminda had left for work before lunch. Neither Anna nor Alice was living at the house in the days leading up to and including the day of the deceased’s death.
	
	
	Aminda arrived home from work at about 8.30 pm. She did not find her mother’s body until around midnight but it can be safely concluded that the deceased had been murdered by the time Aminda returned home that night. Although Aminda walked through the hallway of the house a number of times and walked up and down the stairs twice she did not see her mother’s body until she descended the stairs for the second time at about midnight to let one of her dogs out. That was the first time she turned on a light which lit the front room of the house where the deceased’s body lay.
	
	
	The attack on the deceased was brutal as it was determined. She was stabbed four times to the head, she received multiple blunt force injuries to the head and body and she was asphyxiated with five bones in her neck being broken. She sustained some self-defence injuries to her hands, the most significant of which was the near amputation of a finger. All that is known about her dying is that she was alive for at least half an hour after the infliction of the blunt force injuries to her head.
	
	
	The only matter which might provide some indication of when the deceased was killed was the furious and uncharacteristic barking of Aminda’s dogs at about 5.50pm as reported by Mrs Curtis who lived next door. However, it is not necessary to make a finding in this regard.
	
	
	I am entirely satisfied that the death of the deceased was not planned by the offender. What is likely to have happened is that both the deceased and the offender were home on the afternoon or early evening of 13 September when an argument erupted between them. Consistent with the deterioration in the relationship during the preceding four months the deceased may have threatened to end the relationship and, in effect, to send the offender back to the United States where he did not want to go. Whatever it was that triggered what happened, it seems clear that the offender completely lost control of himself and attacked the deceased.
	
	
	I am entirely satisfied from the wounds and injuries suffered by the deceased that the offender intended to kill her and not simply to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. There can be no other explanation for the severity of the injuries and the three different ways those injuries were inflicted.
	
	
	Following the killing, the offender returned to the business premises in Canley Vale Road where he stayed. When Aminda discovered her mother’s body and rang the offender he told her, in answer to her question, that the deceased was at home sleeping. When he arrived at the house he told lies to Aminda about his movements during the day. Subsequently, in the statement he made to the police in the early hours of that morning he also told lies about his movements that day.
	
	
	This course of lying was perpetuated during the walkthrough of the business premises with Sergeant Barnes. The DVD of that walkthrough did not disclose the offender as being a person upset, in grief or remorseful about what he had done. Certainly, he did not appear to be confused or frightened as he subsequently told the police in his ERISP that he was at that time. That confusion or fright was said by him to be the explanation for not having told the truth on the day of the deceased’s death and following.
	
	
	Later that night the offender made what appeared to be a serious attempt to take his own life. Although the stab wounds he inflicted on himself were superficial, the Emergency Registrar at Liverpool Hospital considered that what the offender had consumed in the way of tablets and other substances could have been life threatening had he not been given a high level of care.
	


Remorse


	
	The Crown submitted that his attempted suicide was not an expression of remorse or regret but rather was motivated by a fear of detection. The Crown pointed to the offender’s continuing to lie to the deceased’s family whilst in hospital and subsequently by the elaborate lie he told in his ERISP. That elaborate lie was an attempt to provide an innocent explanation of how his DNA, fingerprints and footprints were likely to be located (he did not then know that they had been so located) at the crime scene because by the time he participated in the ERISP forensic procedures had been conducted on him.
	
	
	What he told the police in his ERISP was that he came home and found the deceased lying in a pool of blood. He claimed to have tried to give her mouth to mouth resuscitation. He attempted to clean up some of the blood. His account varied between his believing that she had fainted and believing that there was or may be someone still in the house who had attacked her. He said that he left because he was frightened and went back to the shop to wait for Aminda to arrive home. He made no phone calls to anyone, nor did he attempt to speak to any neighbours in the street or near the shop, despite a number of these persons being Vietnamese.
	
	
	The jury clearly rejected this account. I find that the offender killed the deceased and then returned to the shop premises in Canley Vale until he again returned to the house after Aminda’s midnight phone call. That course of events certainly demonstrates no remorse to that point. He then lied to Aminda, saying that the deceased was home sleeping when he knew otherwise. His statements and behaviour up to the time of the suicide attempt do not disclose any remorse.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions nor acknowledged the injury and loss which he has caused to the deceased and to Alice, Aminda and Anna. He did not give evidence at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	By reason of these matters, his lying after he was taken to hospital and particularly the elaborate lie in his ERISP, it is difficult to see that his suicide attempt was remorse or grief for the deceased’s death. Nor does the note the offender wrote prior to his suicide attempt express remorse, only a regret that the deceased was no longer around to spend life with him. I do not find that the suicide attempt was motivated by remorse, nor that he has shown remorse for what he has done.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The murder was unplanned. I accept that it occurred spontaneously as a result of a loss of control by the offender. There was no apparent motive for the attack on the deceased apart from anger and a loss of control. Nevertheless, the attack was brutal and sustained. The fact that there were stab wounds, blunt force injuries and asphyxiation points to the fact that the offender could have ceased the attack notwithstanding the initial loss of control. I have already found that the intention was to kill the deceased.
	
	
	There were two matters of aggravation. First, at least one weapon was used to inflict the stab wounds. Secondly, the offence occurred in the deceased’s home where she was entitled to feel safe and secure.
	
	
	A further consideration is that this murder was in a domestic setting. Important factors in sentencing a domestic violence offender are specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and protection of the community: Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336 at [32].
	
	
	I consider, particularly because the killing was spontaneous from a likely lack of control, that the offending is below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Hardship


	
	As noted earlier, the offender is from a Vietnamese background although he resided in America for approximately 30 years before coming to Australia. Nevertheless, he has learned very little English. Both the evidence at trial and Dr Pulman’s evidence disclose that he has led a fairly isolated existence both in America and in Australia in the sense that he had few if any friends or acquaintances outside the immediate family. Ordinarily, it would be found that imprisonment for a foreign national serving a sentence here with limited family and other support would be more onerous than for other prisoners: Thi Lan Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181; R v Huang [2000] NSWCCA 238; [2000] 113 A Crim R 386.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because the offender already led a socially isolated life, although he was not unhappy in so doing, this means that imprisonment may well not be more onerous for him. Mr Smith of Senior Counsel for the offender submitted that the offender’s age and very limited English language skills means that the usual finding ought to be made.
	
	
	In my opinion, Mr Smith’s submissions should be accepted. As some indication of what he has already experienced, the report from Dr Pulman indicates that since he was transferred from Lithgow to Silverwater he has indeed experienced isolation in custody.
	


Rehabilitation and reoffending


	
	Any assessment of this from direct evidence is difficult because the offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Further, the psychological report was prepared some months prior to his trial where he denied the offence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the indications are that the offender was not a violent person. He has no past criminal record and is a person of good character, both of which are mitigating factors. It is very likely that this was a one-off offence so that I am satisfied he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend. His age by the time of his release reinforces that view.
	


Special circumstances


	
	There are a few considerations associated with the question of whether there should be a reduction of the non-parole period for special circumstances. First, for sentences for crimes such as murder it is generally accepted that the statutory ratio provides a sufficient period for rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.
	
	
	Secondly, in the present case the offender is very likely to be deported at the conclusion of his non-parole period. He only remains in this country on a spousal visa. The authorities make clear that ordinarily it is irrelevant that the offender will be deported at the completion of the non-parole period in fixing the sentence and fixing the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence.
	
	
	Mr Smith submitted that, working on the basis that the offender will be near his 80th birthday on release, he would still have limited English skills and would be released into a community which was in many respects largely foreign to him. I accept that the offender’s age is a relevant matter when considering special circumstances, while noting that the appropriate sentence cannot be reduced simply on the basis that it is likely to extend to most of the offender’s remaining life expectancy: Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 at [128]; Asplund v R [2014] NSWCCA 237 at [67].
	
	
	Thirdly, his custody will be more onerous by reason of his limited English skills and his social isolation in a country where the only people with whom he has or had a relationship were the daughters of the deceased.
	
	
	In my opinion, there should be a small reduction of the non-parole period to take account of special circumstances.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	Each of the deceased’s three daughters read lengthy Victim Impact Statements. Their grief and emotional turmoil was undoubtedly worse because their mother was killed by a person they had accepted into their family and had come to trust and like. For various reasons explained in those Statements the deceased’s death caused problems amongst the three sisters for some time although those matters appear now to be more resolved. However, they continue to deal with the effects of her death on a regular basis, not the least reason for which is that they need to keep the truth from their incapacitated father who constantly asks for the deceased.
	
	
	Aminda’s position was far worse, not only because she discovered her mother’s brutalised body but because she was initially thought to be a suspect arising, partly from the somewhat unusual course of events in the house from the time she arrived home until she found her mother dead on the floor.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor has asked that the Statements be taken into account under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) in connection with the determination of the punishment. I have noted the discussion about this amended section by Hamill J in R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 at [77] to [85] and the difficulty of determining when it is appropriate to take a Victim Impact Statement into account. It is far from clear what practical difference has been made by the amendment. As Johnson J noted in R v Pluis [2015] NSWSC 320, all lives are precious and the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community in general. The harmful impact in this case of the deceased’s death on her daughters is an aspect of harm done to the community generally, and that harm is, in any event, one of the considerations that form part of the instinctive synthesis of sentencing.
	
	
	I consider that I should take the Statements into account. Senior Counsel for the offender does not argue against that position. I again extend the Court’s sympathy to Alice, Aminda and Anna for the loss of their mother, and hope that the conclusion of these proceedings may further their recovery from the effects of her death.
	


Sentence


	
	I have read and considered the cases provided to me by Senior Counsel for the offender. They have been of assistance in coming to a view concerning the appropriate sentence. Needless to say, however, no two cases are identical.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since he attended Cabramatta Police Station on 20 September 2012. The sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Before proceeding to sentence I wish to express my thanks to Counsel and to the solicitors for the Crown and the offender for the efficient and harmonious manner in which the trial and the sentencing proceedings were conducted. I was greatly assisted by them as I am sure the jury were also.
	
	
	Tony Thao Do, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 16 years commencing 20 September 2012 and expiring 19 September 2028 with an additional term of 7 years expiring 19 September 2035. The offence is to be recorded on the offender’s criminal record as a domestic violence offence pursuant to s 12(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal) Violence Act 2007 (NSW).

2766576,Galvin v R [2015] NSWCCA 88,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In March 2014, Colefax DCJ sentenced Mr Galvin to an aggregate sentence of 5 years, 7 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, 2 months for two offences, one under s 25(1) and one under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), and one offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW). He had entered a plea of guilty for those offences, for which he received a 25% discount. He now seeks leave to appeal the severity of those sentences.
	
	
	The two grounds of appeal initially advanced were:
	


1.   The sentencing Judge erred in finding that the objective criminality of the applicant was approximately equivalent to that of his co-offender.

2.   The sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	Mr Galvin later sought to add a third ground:
	


3.   The sentencing judge erred in relation to his determination in relation to the applicant’s (lack of) remorse, in that he applied the incorrect standard of proof, that of “comfortable satisfaction”, rather than the balance of probabilities simplicita.


	
	Leave to add that ground was opposed, but granted at the hearing.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I consider that while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 1 – Mr Galvin’s objective criminality


	
	Mr Galvin’s case was that Colefax DCJ erred in concluding that he and his co-offender, Mr Huckstadt’s, objective criminality was “approximately equivalent”, when the combined quantum of drugs involved in their respective ongoing supply offences created a significant disparity between them.
	
	
	The two offenders were sentenced together.
	
	
	The first drug offence to which Mr Galvin entered a plea of guilty related to ongoing supply of amphetamine between 10 and 25 October 2012 at Lithgow, which attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years or 3500 penalty units or both. The second offence related to a further supply of amphetamine on 31 October at Lithgow and attracted a maximum penalty of 15 years or 2000 penalty units or both. The firearms offence related to his possession of a taser on 24 January 2013. It attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years
	
	
	Mr Galvin also asked that four further offences be taken into account on sentencing on a Form 1:
	


Knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine on 18 December 2012 at Hartley (s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act: maximum penalty 15 years or 2000 units or both)

Knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine on 2 January 2013 at Lithgow (s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act maximum penalty 15 years or 2000 units or both)

Possession of cannabis at Wallerawang on 24 January 2013 (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act maximum penalty 2 years or 20 penalty units or both)

Possession of an unauthorised firearm, an air pistol, on 24 January 2013 (s 7A(1) Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) maximum penalty 5 years)


	
	Mr Huckstadt entered pleas to the same offences as Mr Galvin, although what they comprised, differed. He asked for eight further offences to be taken into account on sentencing under a Form 1, four of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, one of possessing prohibited weapons, two of possessing prohibited drugs and one of possessing an unauthorised firearm.
	
	
	Colefax DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence on Mr Galvin, which commenced at 7 years and 6 months, but after a 25% discount, was fixed at 5 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months. His Honour also indicated the individual sentences he would have otherwise imposed. Before discount the sentence for the ongoing supply offence would have been 6 years and 6 months, for the supply offence 2 years and 6 months and for the weapons offence, 6 months.
	
	
	Colefax DCJ also imposed an aggregate sentence on Mr Huckstadt, which commenced at 9 years, but after a 25% discount, was fixed at 6 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. Before discount the sentence for the ongoing supply offence would have been 7 years, for the supply offence 3 years and for his weapons offence, 6 months.
	
	
	The drugs involved in Mr Galvin’s ongoing supply offence amounted to 163.1 grams and in the supply of 54.3 grams, a total of 217.4 grams. This still fell below the commercial quantity. By comparison, in Mr Huckstadt’s case the ongoing supply offence involved 165.6 grams and the supply offence 141.8 grams, a total of 307.4 grams. In total, Mr Galvin submitted that amounted to a commercial quantity (250 grams), with the result that in Mr Huckstadt’s case, the s 25A charge did not significantly capture the criminality of his offence.
	
	
	Mr Galvin argued that his ongoing supply offence occurred on 10, 16 and 25 October and he committed the further supply offence on 31 October. The additional supply offence was thus capable of being charged as part of the one ongoing supply offence. While he had entered a plea to the second charge, the criminality involved in that offence, he argued, was largely captured by the first.
	
	
	By comparison, Mr Huckstadt’s ongoing supply offence occurred on 5 and 18 December 2012 and 2 January 2013. The additional supply occurred on 24 January. It thus fell outside the 30 day period required for inclusion in the first charge. Mr Galvin submitted that the result was that Mr Huckstadt’s further supply, even if part of the one course of conduct, could not be viewed as having been largely encapsulated in Mr Huckstadt’s first offence. It followed that his Honour had erred in the conclusions he had reached as to the seriousness of their respective offending.
	
	
	In my view, this submission should not be accepted.
	
	
	Mr Galvin and Mr Huckstadt both gave evidence on sentencing. That and other evidence revealed that the two offenders were, as the Crown then submitted, “largely in it together”.
	
	
	Colefax DCJ found that while the facts had been agreed, during his oral evidence Mr Huckstadt had attempted to put a gloss on those facts, which he did not accept.
	
	
	His Honour noted that what was agreed was that the two offenders were cousins, Mr Huckstadt, the elder, aged 39 and Mr Galvin 28. They came to be identified as involved in drug supply during a NSW police strike force investigation into drugs in the Bathurst and Lithgow areas, during which phone calls were legally intercepted and an arrangement made to purchase amphetamine from Mr Galvin.
	
	
	On 10 October 2012, Mr Galvin and Mr Huckstadt went to the arranged meeting place, Mr Huckstadt driving. Mr Galvin supplied 53.6 grams of amphetamine for $5,600, found to have a purity of 15%. This was the first of the transactions in Mr Galvin’s supply offence and the subject of one of Mr Huckstadt’s Form 1 offences.
	
	
	On 16 October 2012, there was another supply, the second of the transactions in Mr Galvin’s supply offence and the subject of another of Mr Huckstadt’s Form 1 offences. Mr Huckstadt was, again, the driver. Mr Galvin supplied 53.7 grams of amphetamine for $4,700, found to have a purity of 13%.
	
	
	On 25 October 2012 the third of the transactions in Mr Galvin’s supply offence and the subject of another of Mr Huckstadt’s Form 1 offences occurred. Mr Huckstadt was, again, the driver. Mr Galvin supplied 55.8 grams of amphetamine for $5,000, found to have a purity of 16%.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012, Mr Galvin committed his second offence when he supplied 54.3 grams of amphetamine for $5,000, found to have a purity of 14.5%. This was also the subject of another of Mr Huckstadt’s Form 1 offences, he again being the driver.
	
	
	When contacted by the operative in November, Mr Galvin said he was concerned about four police raids in the area and that his cousin was taking over his business. Mr Huckstadt made contact later that day and told the operator “I am looking after things now”. On 5 December he supplied 55 grams of amphetamine for $5,000, found to have a purity of 12%. Mr Galvin was not present. This was the first transaction in Mr Huckstadt’s ongoing supply offence.
	
	
	On 18 December 2012, Mr Galvin drove Mr Huckstadt when he supplied 54.9 grams of amphetamine for $5,000, found to have a purity of 12.5%, the second transaction in Mr Huckstadt’s ongoing supply offence. This was one of Mr Galvin’s Form 1 offences.
	
	
	On 2 January 2013, Mr Galvin drove Mr Huckstadt when he supplied 55.7 grams of amphetamine (in fact, the drug known as MDDM) for $5,000, found to have a purity of 11.5%, the third transaction in Mr Huckstadt’s ongoing supply offence. This was also one of Mr Galvin’s Form 1 offences.
	
	
	On 24 January 2013, Mr Galvin was not present when Mr Huckstadt supplied 141.8 grams of amphetamine, found to have a purity of 14.5%. He was not paid, because he and the operative were arrested. This was his supply offence.
	
	
	On execution of search warrants, a taser was found at Mr Galvin’s home, the subject of his weapons offence. An air pistol and 7 grams of cannabis were the subject of his two other Form 1 offences. At Mr Huckstadt’s home another taser was found, as well as a body armour vest, a pellet gun, cannabis leaf and seeds, the subject of his three Form 1 offences.
	
	
	A factual dispute emerged on sentencing between the two offenders as to whether or not there had been a real change in who was running their drug operation. There was limited cross-examination of the two offenders as to certain relevant matters identified by Colefax DCJ.
	
	
	Colefax DCJ noted that Mr Galvin’s evidence was substantially consistent with the agreed facts, but that Mr Huckstadt denied that he had taken over the business. Mr Galvin’s explanation of his ongoing involvement at that point, was in order to ease the transfer of the business to Mr Huckstadt. His Honour did not accept either of that evidence.
	
	
	Mr Huckstadt’s evidence was that he did not keep the proceeds of the transactions. Even after he took on a more obvious role, he gave the money to Mr Galvin, he did not know Mr Galvin’s supplier in Sydney and had not obtained any of the drugs, he had himself supplied. The only payment he had received for all of his involvement was petrol money and a small amount of drugs to meet his own habit.
	
	
	Mr Huckstadt was recalled after an adjournment and then gave evidence of having received death threats in custody, initiated by Mr Galvin, with the result that he was in protective custody. They concerned the evidence he had earlier given in relation to the control of the business and its operation. Mr Galvin was then recalled and denied having directly, or indirectly, caused these threats to be made.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that Mr Huckstadt’s evidence was not only inconsistent with the agreed facts, but with what the operative had been told by both he and Mr Galvin. His Honour noted that Mr Huckstadt’s lengthy criminal record included threatening to cause injury to a potential juror or witness. He concluded that this was indicative of a disregard for the legal trial process on Mr Huckstadt’s part. In the result, he concluded that Mr Huckstadt had not met the onus of establishing matters he had raised in mitigation of his offending.
	
	
	His Honour thus concluded that, from 28 November, Mr Huckstadt’s role changed from a driver for insignificant reward, to being the primary supplier. His Honour concluded as to the drugs offences:
	


“From the foregoing facts it can be seen that in relation to Mr Galvin’s offence of ongoing supply, there were three transactions in which a total of $15,300 was involved, and 163.1 grams of amphetamines. In relation to Mr Huckstadt, there were also three transactions, in which $15,000 was involved and 165.6 grams of methylamphetamine. Furthermore, in relation to the supply prohibited drug offences, Mr Galvin was concerned with 54.3 grams of methylamphetamine and Mr Huckstadt 141.8 grams of MDDM.

   For parity considerations I am of the view that in terms of objective criminality, the conduct of each offender was approximately equivalent.

   In terms of objective seriousness, the ongoing supply offences are a little below the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind; and the supply offences are below that mid range, but not at the bottom of the range.” (T10)


	
	His Honour’s conclusion that the two offender’s objective criminality was “approximately equivalent” was open on the evidence, notwithstanding that Mr Galvin was not present at the supply when Mr Huckstadt was arrested. The total weight of the drugs involved in the co-offenders’ respective offending was different. While that was an important factor to be considered in the sentencing exercise, it was not determinative.
	
	
	What had to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offenders’ respective offending included the evidence as to the business operation, as well as the number of instances of supply and the individual quantities supplied (see R v Giang [2005] NSWCCA 387 at [1 8] – [1 9]; R v Hoon; R v Pouoa [2000] NSWCCA 137 at [1 6]). As discussed in R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [3 3] the quantity of drugs was not the sole or principal determinant in this sentencing exercise. More important was Mr Galvin’s role and the level of his participation in the business.
	
	
	Further, it was also relevant for his Honour to have regard to the gradation of seriousness reflected by the statutory increases in penalty, as the quantity of the drug supplied becomes commercial or large commercial quantities. In Mr Galvin’s case the total amount in which he was involved was some 328 grams, for which the operative paid over $30,000 in total of $30,300. That also amounted to a commercial quantity. That evidence also shed considerable light on the nature and size of this drug operation.
	
	
	Plainly, Colefax DCJ did not accept Mr Galvin’s evidence that his involvement on the two occasions in January, when he drove Mr Huckstadt to meet the operative, had only been in order to ease the transfer of the business. That evidence had to be considered in light of the fact that Mr Galvin had not been present when Mr Huckstadt had first met the operative alone, in order to supply in November. On all of the evidence it was open to his Honour to reject Mr Galvin’s evidence that his continuing involvement in the operation was less than before and was not ongoing. That conclusion was supported by the evidence that it was Mr Galvin who had obtained drugs on credit from his supplier, which pointed to his operation of a substantial drug business, given the large quantities of drugs and money involved in his offending.
	
	
	In the result, I cannot conclude that a different sentence was warranted in law, as was submitted for Mr Galvin, given the objective criminality involved in his offending. The conclusions which Colefax DCJ reached in that regard were open on the evidence.
	
	
	This ground of appeal must, accordingly be dismissed.
	


Ground 2 – the sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	This ground was also not made out.
	
	
	In order for manifest excess to be established, an appellant must establish that the sentence was unreasonable, or plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]). Some misapplication of principle, even if where and how cannot be discerned from the reasons, must be shown (see Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [5 9]). As discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [ 25 ], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ said:
	


“As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in  House v The King  itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentence allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentence not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender’s appeal, as ‘manifest excess’, or in a prosecution appeal, as ‘manifest inadequacy’. [footnotes omitted]”


	
	Here no error of fact has been established. Nor were irrelevant matters taken into account, or relevant matters overlooked. His Honour concluded that Mr Galvin’s ongoing supply offence fell a little below the middle of the range for such offences and that the supply offence was below the mid-range, but not at the bottom of the range. These conclusions were not challenged on appeal.
	
	
	The ongoing supply offence attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years and the supply offence 15 years. The weapons offence attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. They were all statutory guideposts which had to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise (see s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120).
	
	
	Before discount, Mr Galvin’s aggregate sentence was 7 years and 6 months, but after a 25% discount, was fixed at 5 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months. That was a relatively favourable outcome for Mr Galvin, in all of the circumstances which his Honour had to consider in this sentencing exercise, given the nature and seriousness of Mr Galvin’s offending and his moral culpability for that offending.
	
	
	In application of the principle of totality, his Honour had to consider the question of concurrency and accumulation, even though an aggregate sentence was imposed (see R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [ 45 ]).
	
	
	It is settled that where the criminality of one offence significantly overlaps with another offence, an aggregate sentence should only be increased marginally (see Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150; (2013) 230 A Crim R 581 at [ 66 ]). Here, however, Mr Galvin was charged and entered a plea to an entirely separate offence, involving supply of a different amount of drugs, on another day, for another payment. His Honour was entitled to conclude that the sentences imposed should not be totally concurrent and indeed, had he imposed totally concurrent sentences, may have fallen into error.
	
	
	As discussed in Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 at [ 27 ], imposing the same sentence for a number of offences that differ in criminality, may demonstrate a failure to comply with the fundamental principles of sentencing preserved by s  53A (2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which permits the imposition of aggregate sentences. Such questions must be determined in the way discussed in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27].
	


“In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	In reaching his conclusions and undertaking the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian at [37] – [39], Colefax DCJ also had to consider the concessions made for Mr Galvin on sentencing. They included that his offending was serious; the ongoing supply charge was the most serious of his offences; that his offences had involved significant quantities of drugs; and that he was at the level of wholesalers, much higher than street dealers. He also had to consider the four Form 1 offences, which each had to result in a higher sentence being imposed on Mr Galvin (see Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [23] (Bathurst CJ); R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63; (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 at [62]).
	
	
	Ultimately, his Honour was required to impose an aggregate sentence, which included a non-parole period which reflected the minimum period of actual incarceration that Mr Galvin had to spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his crimes and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629).
	
	
	For Mr Galvin it was argued that his Honour erred because an aggregate sentence of 5 years, 7 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, 2 months was excessive, given his Honour’s findings as to the objective seriousness of his offending.
	
	
	On sentencing it had been submitted that it was open to his Honour to make the sentences for the two drug offences wholly concurrent, in the circumstances, which included that the final transaction the subject of the separate supply charge had occurred within the 30 day period provided for ongoing supply offences. Mr Galvin’s subjective circumstances supported that approach. He had a limited criminal record, his prospects of rehabilitation were found to be reasonable, he had long term drug and gambling addictions, but was in a long term relationship and had the support of his partner and was generally in employment.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept Mr Galvin’s submissions. The result of his Honour’s approach, it was argued, in partially aggregating those sentences, was a manifestly excessive sentence. That, it was submitted, was not significantly mitigated by the fact that there was effectively no additional time imposed upon Mr Galvin for the weapons offence, which would not have attracted a custodial sentence, if considered on its own.
	
	
	Reliance was also placed on sentencing statistics, which showed that the indicative total term for the ongoing supply offence, after discount, fell in to the top 5 or 6% of sentences for similar offences involving amphetamines. The indicative non-parole period for offenders with Form 1 offences taken into account placed the sentence within the top 2%. Further, only about half of offenders charged with a single supply offence with drugs amounting to less than the commercial quantity, received a prison term. At least 51% of those sentenced to a term of imprisonment, after a plea, had sentences less than the indicative sentence indicated for Mr Galvin imposed upon them.
	
	
	These submissions were of no assistance to the case pressed for Mr Galvin. This Court has repeatedly discussed the problems with undue reliance on statistics (see for example Sinkovich v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 90 at [40]; Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 326 at [74]). In this case, given the nature and seriousness of the offending for which Mr Galvin was being sentenced, the statistics relied on simply showed no error in the aggregate sentence which his Honour imposed.
	
	
	There was no error in his Honour’s approach, either in principle or in result. That his Honour did not make the drug offence entirely concurrent with the drug supply offence, as he did with the weapons offence, does not establish the necessary error or that the sentence imposed upon him was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Ground 3 – remorse


	
	In Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; (2011) 209 A Crim R 297 at [ 44 ], Buddin J explained:
	


“Remorse in [a sentencing] context means regret for the wrongdoing which the offender’s actions have caused because it can be safely assumed that an offender will always regret the fact that he or she has been apprehended. Remorse is but one feature of post-offence conduct upon which an offender may seek to rely as a matter which has the potential to mitigate penalty. The manner in which the issue of remorse is approached is not unique to either the sentencing process or to the courtroom. Indeed, it is a common feature of everyday existence. Ordinary human experience would suggest that it is only natural that a person who has committed some misdeed would wish to make the most favourable impression possible in seeking to make amends for it.”


	
	In this case Colefax DCJ did not accept Mr Galvin’s evidence as to his remorse, observing:
	


“Mr Galvin entered his pleas of guilty at the first available opportunity and it is appropriate that he receives a discount of twenty-five percent.

   Although Mr Galvin has expressed remorse in the witness box, and also to the author of the pre-sentence report, I was left with some sense of unease about the genuineness of those expressions of remorse - as opposed to regret at having been caught. Mr Galvin had taken no steps to address his cannabis or gambling problems before his arrest. His decision to discontinue his involvement in supplying drugs to the old high school friend of Mr Muldoon was not occasioned by any insight into his criminality, but rather because he heard of raids being conducted by the police. And, somewhat surprisingly, there is no reference to or disclosure of his long term cannabis addiction in the pre-sentence report.

   Nevertheless, and not withstanding that I am unable to be comfortably satisfied that there is genuine remorse, by having regard to this offender’s minimal past criminal history, his age and the support of his family, I think his prospects for rehabilitation might be reasonable.” (T12-13)


	
	He later said in relation to Mr Huckstadt that:
	


“I have also had difficulty in assessing whether Mr Huckstadt is remorseful for his offences. Remorse is significant in a number of respects, not least because it impacts upon an assessment as to his prospects of rehabilitation.

    The difficulty I have had in assessing Mr Huckstadt’s remorse is connected with the evidence he gave concerning whether in fact he took over the business from his cousin after late November 2012. And as I have already said I was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his assertions in that regard were true. I have therefore reservations about his expressions of remorse.” (T15)


	
	His Honour had earlier observed:
	


“Mr Huckstadt has the onus of proving his assertions in this regard as they clearly matters in mitigation. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he has discharged that onus.” (T9)


	
	On the following page when assessing Mr Galvin’s evidence as to his explanation for the taser found in his possession, his Honour also referred to the “balance of probabilities”.
	
	
	These sentencing remarks must be read as a whole. A fair reading of them does not reveal any error as to the standard of proof applied to Mr Galvin in relation to the mitigating matters which he set out to prove. Indeed, in oral submissions on appeal it was accepted for Mr Galvin that what his Honour said in relation to remorse, did not change the relevant standard per se.
	
	
	What was pressed was that what his Honour did was to impose the standard referred to in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336 on Mr Galvin, usually reserved for grave and adverse findings, contrary to the interest of the person against whom they are being found. If that standard had not been applied, it was argued there was material on which a finding of remorse could have rested.
	
	
	That submission must be rejected. It does not accord either with the particular words his Honour used, or the sentencing remarks as a whole. A finding of remorse is a conclusion on evidence which it fell to his Honour to assess. No error has been shown in that regard, either in principle or result.
	
	
	This ground must also be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	For these reasons, I would grant Mr Galvin leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.

		11 May 2015",2015-05-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766579,Gregory John Walsh v R [2015] NSWCCA 83,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Adams J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: 
	
	
	On 11 December 2013 the applicant was convicted by a jury of two counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and two counts of attempted sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) and s 61P. All four offences were committed in the early hours of 1 January 1992. The victim was a babysitter, then aged 57 years, who was sleeping in the house of the children under her care. The circumstances of aggravation were the same in respect of each count, comprising injuries inflicted to the victim. The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate period of 7 years commencing 9 December 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years. The indicated sentences were, in respect of the sexual intercourse offences, each a term of 7 years with a non-parole of 5 years and 3 months and, in respect of the attempted offences fixed terms of 3 years.
	
	
	The applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentences, on the following grounds –
	


Ground 1: there was an incongruity between the aggregate sentence imposed and the indicated sentences.

Ground 3: the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and outside the applicable range.

Facts


	
	These were not contested on appeal and have largely been drawn from the reasons of the learned sentencing judge. On 31 December 1991 the victim, aged 57 years, was babysitting at the home of two young children. The children went to bed in the same bedroom at about 9:30pm and sometime later the victim went to bed on the bottom bunk in the same bedroom. She was wearing a nighty and underpants. At about 5:00am she felt the applicant, who had entered the house through an open window, put his hand over her mouth and told her to “shut up” and “be quiet”. He said that she knew who he was (although he lived in the same street as the parents, in fact the victim did not know him). It was dark in the room because the blinds were drawn. The applicant pinned the victim’s arms to the bed by kneeling on them and then hit her violently to the face. She was crying and terrified. The applicant pulled her off the bed, took off her underwear and forced her into a kneeling position with her back towards him. He penetrated first her anus and then her vagina with two fingers. He removed his penis from his trousers, ejaculated onto a pillow that was on the floor and then attempted to insert his penis into her anus and her vagina. However, it was flaccid and he was unable to effect penetration. He then pushed the victim away and left the room. The applicant had been in the bedroom for about 15 minutes.
	
	
	The victim called her daughter and the police. When she was examined at the hospital the following injuries were found: a laceration to the right side of the upper lip; swelling to the left side of the face and upper jaw; grazes to the chin; a bruise to the left cheek; scratches below the eye and nostril; a loosened tooth (which she subsequently lost); bruising to the upper arm; a 2cm bruise and swelling in the vaginal area; and a 2cm tear to the anus. These injuries were obviously very painful.
	
	
	The pillow on which the applicant had ejaculated was subjected to DNA testing and samples preserved in the laboratory. Years later the applicant’s DNA was uploaded to the database and matched the DNA profile from the semen stain. This cold case matching led police to identify the applicant as the offender and he was arrested on 3 February 2011.
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant was the youngest of seven, his parents separating at his birth and thereafter his mother entering into a relationship with an alcoholic who was extremely violent towards his mother and the applicant over a lengthy period of time. Because of this the applicant left home at fourteen years of age and, obtaining his own accommodation, his mother joined him sometime later. The applicant obtained employment to support himself at a time when he was ill equipped to obtain good work because he was almost illiterate. With his mother’s help, he learned to read and write competently. When he was nineteen the applicant met his wife and was able with his savings to buy a home. He has been regularly employed all his life and never been on the dole. He held some managerial positions at the factory where he worked and also worked as a landscaper.
	
	
	In 1996 the applicant was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising an overall sentence of 6 years 3 months with an effective non-parole period of 4 years 3 months. Whilst serving this sentence he and his wife separated and they were ultimately divorced and, as he said, signed over the house to his wife. They had a daughter who now lives with his ex-wife and her partner. He has a close relationship with his natural daughter and his stepdaughter. He had a subsequent relationship that lasted five years, during which he claimed he was subjected to domestic violence. At the time he was arrested for the present offences he was living with his brother.
	
	
	Evidence was given on the applicant’s behalf by a family friend who had known the applicant for 30 years and his stepdaughter whom he is obviously very close. Both said that, in their experience, he was respectful towards women and had never been violent towards them. Although he was convicted in September 2009 of the offence of using a carriage service to threaten serious harm, the witnesses said, in effect, that this might have been said in the heat of the moment and that they did not believe at all that he would ever carry through with such a threat. Significantly, the applicant, who gave evidence, maintained that it was not he who attacked the victim. As he said, “My heart goes out to her but what was done to her was not done by me”.
	
	
	A psychologist’s report was tendered which expressed the opinion that, due to the applicant’s background, in particular, the violence to which he was subjected when young, he suffered from Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The judge observed that neither the applicant’s traumatic childhood nor his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can be linked to the commission of the offences.
	


Criminal record


	
	The applicant had a criminal record of moderate length involving a number of relatively minor offences, commencing when he was seventeen years of age. The most serious of these matters were the dangerous driving offences committed in 1996. The only subsequent conviction was in September 2009, which has been mentioned. He was on bail for an offence of breaking and entering with intent at the time of the present offences.
	


Assessment by the sentencing judge


	
	The judge considered that there was no significant distinction between the acts of penetration. Aggravating features were that the victim was (for practical purposes) at home, being there at the invitation of the owners and having their young children in her charge. She was subjected to a number of violent blows which caused significant injury and was in considerable pain both during the attack and afterwards. She suffered psychological damage that was revisited following the need to give evidence in the trial against the applicant. She was subjected to the humiliation of having her clothing removed and being forced into a kneeling position. On the other hand, there was no evidence of any significant degree of planning, the crime being an opportunistic one that presented itself when the applicant saw the open window.
	
	
	His Honour found that “it is no benefit to the offender that the … [attempted] intercourse was unsuccessful due to the fact that [the applicant] had already ejaculated”. As a general rule, the objective seriousness of an attempted offence will, for obvious reasons, be less than the completed offence. It seems to me, with respect, that here the fact that the attempted assaults were unsuccessful renders the attempts objectively less serious than would have been the completed offences. It is clear from the indicative sentences that the judge, indeed, had regard to the less serious character of the attempted offences. I take his Honour’s comment to mean that the moral (as distinct from the criminal) culpability involved in the attempts was not lessened by lack of success.
	
	
	In determining the seriousness of the offence, the sentencing judge said that he took into account, in addition to the violence of the assault and the nature of the injuries, “the fact that it was clear that the offender knew that [the victim] was not consenting to the offences that were perpetrated against her”. This observation was made in the context of assessing the aggravating features of the offences. Since the fact that the offender knew the victim was not consenting is an element of the offence itself, it cannot be regarded in aggravating its seriousness. However, I think this observation should be read merely as a description of the character of the crime, demonstrating how serious it is, rather than as identifying an aggravating feature.
	
	
	The judge (rightly, with respect) gave the applicant’s criminal history only limited significance in reducing the leniency that might otherwise be extended to the applicant, since his offences were (except for the dangerous driving matters) both relatively trivial and altogether different from those for which he was being sentenced. His Honour observed that the applicant’s history, particularly following the dangerous driving charges, suggested (except for the 2009 offence) that he had been substantially rehabilitated. He did not think that the criminal history indicated that any particular emphasis should be given to the requirement of specific deterrence.
	


Historical offences


	
	The sentencing judge noted that the offences were committed in 1992 and it is therefore appropriate to sentence in accordance with the sentencing patterns of the time. His Honour accepted that, generally speaking, sentencing practice had moved adversely to offenders in recent times and this must be taken into account. He noted that, for the present, the seriousness with which these offences are now treated is demonstrated, amongst other things, by the stipulation of a 10 year standard non-parole period for a case in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Crown provided the sentencing judge with a number of judgments of this Court dealing with sentences that were reviewed at or about the time when the offences were committed. His Honour took these judgments into account noting, however, that each case is determined upon its own facts. His Honour observed that it was the usual practice at the time that multiple offences not dissimilar to those committed by the applicant were dealt with by imposing totally concurrent terms of imprisonment but he thought this practice was not consistent with the law as expounded in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. It seems that, for this reason, his Honour accumulated one or both of the sentences for the attempt offences, as distinct from following the earlier practice. In my respectful view, his Honour was correct to take this approach as a matter of principle. This is not at all a substantial departure from earlier sentencing patterns to the detriment of the offender, although it applies a different structure. Ultimately, the question, when comparing past approaches to the present, must be the same as that asked when considering whether the concurrency or accumulation of sentences for multiple offences has resulted in an inappropriate overall sentence, namely whether it reflects the total criminality involved.
	
	
	The applicant produced to this Court a table of cases obtained from the Public Defenders dealing with sentences imposed for aggravated sexual assaults contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act. The details given provide some, but not much, basis for comparison. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the table shows sentences for roughly comparable objective circumstances which straddle the sentence under present consideration. Mr Bellanto QC for the applicant candidly conceded that one could not draw from the table the conclusion that the sentence in this case was out of kilter with the sentences more or less contemporaneous with the date of the commission of the applicant’s offences. However, he submitted that a case which did show a departure from contemporaneous sentencing levels was R v Rothapfel (NSWCCA 4 August 1992, unreported, Mahoney JA, McInerney and Studdert JJ). This was an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the inadequacy of sentences imposed for offences of breaking and entering with intent to steal, armed robbery (using a knife), the infliction of actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, indecent assault and attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The sentences respectively imposed were terms of imprisonment of two years, five years with a non-parole period of four years, a fixed term of three years, a fixed term of eighteen months and a fixed term of three years imprisonment. All sentences were entirely concurrent, giving an effective sentence of five years with a non-parole period of four years. The offender, who was intoxicated, forced entry through a window in the premises occupied by the 71 year old victim. The circumstances of both the robbery and the sexual assaults were terrifying, involving threats with knives which he took from the kitchen, including a threat to “slit her throat”. A medical examination revealed several bruises, a laceration to the left middle finger, and tearing of the anal margin. The effects on the victim were devastating. The offender was twenty years of age, left school at year 8 and home at fourteen, and lived as a squatter in various cities; for three years before his sentence he was unemployed and a regular abuser of alcohol and illicit drugs. The pre-sentence report assessed him as “a manipulative and violent individual and a continuing risk to the community”. He had a relatively trivial criminal record. The offender gave evidence of contrition and accepted his need for rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol. He pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. The Court declined to disturb the sentences in respect of the first and fourth offences but, in relation to the second, third and fifth offences imposed, respectively, terms of eight years with a non-parole period of six years, five years and five years, all sentences to be served concurrently. The Court made the point that (as was the practice at the time with successful Crown appeals against sentences) the resulting terms were not at the level which would have been appropriate at first instance. It should also be noted, in fairness, that, in 1992, only slight allowance was made, if any, for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty (which, at all events was at the last moment in this case) but it was regarded as evidence of contrition, and the fact that victim was saved the trauma of having to give evidence about a frightening and humiliating experience given real significance.
	
	
	Leaving aside the obvious point that a single instance can only very rarely indicate the limits of the sentencing discretion for particular offences, I do not see Rothapfel as giving significant, indeed even suggestive, support to the applicant’s contention that, by comparison, the sentences imposed upon him were excessive. The sexual offences did not involve penetration, the extent of actual violence was less, the offender had pleaded guilty, sparing the victim from having to give evidence and it was a Crown appeal.
	


Were the sentences manifestly excessive? 


	
	It may be that the applicant’s case in respect of manifest excess was not limited to acceptance of the contention that his sentences were significantly greater than those which would have been imposed when the offences were committed, although no additional arguments were advanced. Given this ambiguity, I should state my view that the overall sentence, though severe, was by no means excessive. Even so, I am troubled by the apparent double punishment demonstrated by the identical sentences indicated for the offences under 61J because the circumstance of aggravation is particularised in each case as being “before the offence [the applicant] maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm”. His Honour specifically noted that the same circumstances of aggravation were alleged in each of the charges. However, this issue was not a ground of appeal and was not argued before us. Accordingly, I say no more about it.
	


Accumulation


	
	So far as accumulation is concerned, the learned sentencing judge said –
	


The offences were committed at the same time during a very short period and for that purpose I intend to impose … [an aggregate] sentence that reflects the total criminality. In doing so, I would indicate that any sentence in respect of each offence would be partially accumulated on each other but also substantially concurrent …


	
	As to the indicative sentences, his Honour said –
	


In relation to each of the sentences, I would have indicated that each … would be served substantially concurrent with an adjustment of some accumulation in relation to each count sentenced upon the other.


	
	The applicant points out that the ultimate aggregate non-parole period of seven years exceeded by one year and nine months the non-parole periods indicated in respect of Counts 2 and 3. It is this difference which, it is contended, amounts to an incongruity requiring correction by this Court. However, the accumulation applied to two additional offences. Taken overall, I am not persuaded that its extent was inconsistent with the judge’s stated approach. Accordingly, this ground must be dismissed.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders –
	



	
	leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	appeal dismissed.
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Adams J, for the reasons expressed by his Honour, subject to one qualification. His Honour has expressed the view at [14] that, “as a general rule, the objective seriousness of an attempted offence will, for obvious reasons, be less than the completed offence”. I would prefer not to generalise that assessment in a pre-emptive way. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the degree of difference between a failed attempt and a completed sexual assault might be of little significance in the overall assessment of objective seriousness of an offence. I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.

2766588,R v Thomas [2015] NSWSC 537,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Michael Thomas (""the accused""), then known as Jose Antonio Reyes, was born in Chile in 1988. His mother had a severe intellectual disability and was unable to care for him. They lived in extreme poverty. He suffered deprivation and malnutrition and was hospitalised. He was adopted shortly before his third birthday by Maurice and Susan Thomas and was raised in the western Sydney suburb of Emu Plains.
	
	
	The accused was assessed by a clinical neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist, Dr Susan Pulman, in 2013. She found that he had a ""moderate intellectual disability"". She assessed him as functioning below 99.9 per cent of the population, features of which included extremely limited attention, extremely poor information processing speed and impaired conceptual reasoning abilities.
	
	
	Susan Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2011. She underwent surgery and then embarked upon a course of chemotherapy. In November 2012 she was informed that the cancer had metastasized. Her decline thereafter was rapid. By 31 January 2013 the medical opinion was that she had a few weeks left to live. On that day there was an argument between the accused and his parents concerning his loss of employment. He struck his mother to the face. She died later that day. The accused was arrested and charged with murder.
	


The accused is unfit to be tried


	
	On 29 August 2014, Bellew J found the accused was unfit to be tried: R v Thomas [2014] NSWSC 1181. Pursuant to s 16 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), the Mental Health Review Tribunal notified the Court that the accused would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offence. The Director of Public Prosecutions declined to take no further proceedings in the matter and accordingly the Court was required to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable: s 19(1)(b).
	
	
	The purpose of a special hearing is to ensure, despite the unfitness of the accused to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that he is acquitted unless it can be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that, on the limited evidence available, he committed the offence charged or any available alternative offence: s 19(2). A special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings: s 21(1).
	
	
	The special hearing commenced before me on Monday of this week. The accused was represented by Mr Ierace SC, Senior Public Defender. He was arraigned, and although no plea was entered, he was taken to have pleaded not guilty: s 21(3)(a).
	
	
	I confirm I have taken into account the fact that the accused is unfit to be tried and is thereby inhibited in a variety of respects in the way in which he may participate in the proceedings. I also have borne in mind the meaning of unfitness; the purpose of this hearing; and the legal and practical consequences of the verdicts I might return: s 21(4).
	


The indictment


	
	The accused is charged with the following offences:
	


1.   On 31 January 2013 at Emu Plains in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully kill Susan Thomas

alternatively

2.    On 31 January 2013 at Emu Plains in the State of New South Wales recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Susan Thomas.


	
	It is important to note that the accused is presumed to be innocent of each of the charges and that it is the Crown who bears the onus of proving the essential elements of the offences to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt.
	


The evidence


	
	None of the evidence in the hearing was disputed. Matters that were disputed were confined to the inferences that should be drawn from, and a medical opinion based upon, the evidence. Accordingly I will not review the evidence but simply set out the story that it told.
	
	
	The accused obtained a job as a kitchen hand at the Outback Steakhouse at Penrith in about May 2012. The position was arranged by Ms Heidi Van Gender, a job support consultant with Ability Options Employment. Her role as a case officer was to assist clients with disabilities in relation to employment issues. She saw the accused regularly and monitored his performance. It seems his main task was cleaning the cutlery and he did not particularly enjoy it.
	
	
	The accused worked each Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 9am until 12 noon. He was accompanied to and from work by one or the other of his parents.
	
	
	Ms Van Gender saw the accused on Friday 25 January 2013 when she visited him at his workplace. She observed that he was performing his job in a substandard fashion. She spoke to him about this but he reacted in a way that might indicate anger, frustration, or both. He walked out. Knowing him as she did, Ms Van Gender decided not to pursue the matter but proposed to speak to him about it at a later stage.
	
	
	On Saturday 26 January the accused attended work but told his superiors that he was quitting on the basis that it was too stressful for him. He did not tell his parents.
	
	
	Mr Thomas said that in the days leading up to Thursday 31 January 2013 (the next day the accused was supposed to be going to work) he and his wife became aware that their son was experiencing some form of difficulty in relation to his employment. That morning, Susan Thomas was too weak to get out of bed. It was decided that Mr Thomas would accompany the accused to work in order to find out what was happening.
	
	
	The accused got dressed as if he was going to work. He and his father drove to the Outback Steakhouse but when they arrived the accused stayed in the car. Mr Thomas went in and spoke with various people and soon found out what had occurred. He returned to the car and they drove home, having some conversation about the issue on the way but continuing as they entered the home.
	
	
	When they arrived home Ms Thomas was on the phone but terminated the conversation when she heard some commotion. She was in bed. Her husband and the accused came in and the conversation about the accused no longer having a job continued. It would seem from Mr Thomas’ evidence that both he and his wife were expressing their concerns in fairly strong terms to the accused.
	
	
	The accused left the room. Mr Thomas went to the kitchen. He then heard his wife call out, “Michael, come here”, in a strong voice. (The accused's brother, Ben, described her voice as ""very loud and aggressive"".) Mr Thomas reacted by calling out to her: “Sue. Why? It’s over.” He then saw the accused come out of his room. He had changed out of his work clothes and he walked hurriedly across to the bedroom where his mother was. Mr Thomas immediately heard “two hits”. He reacted by racing down the hallway to the bedroom where he saw Ms Thomas on her back on the bed. She was propped up on pillows. He said to her, “Has Michael hit you?” She replied in a soft and calm tone of voice, “No, I’m alright”.
	
	
	Mr Thomas noticed that there was blood on her cheek which he described as being “probably a spot”. When Ben Thomas came into the room he saw his mother holding her left cheek. Mr Thomas was worried about her low platelet level and he proceeded to get a flannel and some water and returned. He wiped her face but noticed she was having difficulty breathing and he began to worry. She soon became unconscious.
	
	
	The accused said, “This is bad. I’m going to get into trouble for this” (according to Mr Thomas). According to Ben Thomas, he said ""I will regret this"" and, repeatedly, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to"", to which his mother replied, ""I know you didn't mean to"". It was the accused’s suggestion that his father call an ambulance.
	
	
	An ambulance officer arrived shortly after 10am. She quickly assessed the situation and summoned more officers to attend. Ms Thomas was taken to Westmead Hospital.
	
	
	Mr Thomas attended the hospital with the accused. Mr Thomas spoke with a neurosurgeon who informed him that they were not able to operate because of the internal bleeding and Ms Thomas' condition, particularly her low platelet count. He was told that she would not last long. A priest was summoned and administered the last rites. A life support system was turned off. Susan Thomas passed away at 3.07pm.
	
	
	Mr Thomas said in his evidence that the family had been grieving for the previous two months since receiving the news that the cancer had metastasized. Tests performed on Thursday 24 January 2013 confirmed that her situation was dire; her platelet levels were extremely low. Platelet transfusions had increased her well-being but they were ceasing to be effective. Mr Thomas was asked about his wife’s mobility in the days before her death and he said that, for example, if she had fallen to the floor she would have had difficulty getting up by herself. She could not shower without assistance. He said: “It was getting worse, she was deteriorating.” Ben Thomas' evidence was to the same effect.
	
	
	The accused was aware that his mother’s illness had progressed to the final stage. On the evening of 24 January he asked his father, “Why can’t mum have any more platelet transfusions?” Mr Thomas and his wife told him that there were only so many she could have before the body rejected them. Mr Thomas said that his son went to bed with that knowledge but at 3am he was found to be sitting outside in the yard. He had been drinking. He was asked what was up and he replied to the effect that he was not coping and said, “I’ve got a crappy job and my mum’s dying of cancer”. Ms Thomas managed to put him back to bed and Mr Thomas heard her say to her son, “No, I’m not dying of cancer. I’m not dying”.
	


Medical evidence


	
	Dr Istvan Szentmariay conducted an autopsy on 1 February 2013. Of relevance he noted three sizable contusions, irregularly shaped, around the left ear. On an internal examination he found an underlying confluent contusion of the soft tissues. A subsequent neuropathology examination of the brain revealed a basal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay's opinion was that the cause of death was blunt force trauma. The three contusions were consistent with having been caused by a punch with a fist. He could not say how many punches there were; whether one, two or three. It was his opinion that there would have been an application of “probably [a] moderate degree of force”. He excluded a greater degree of force because there was no underlying fracture.
	
	
	Dr Nicholas Wilcken, the Director of the Department of Medical Oncology at the Westmead Hospital, was of the view that without the alleged assault occurring prior to death Ms Thomas had a very short time to live; less than six weeks. He considered the fact that the severe brain haemorrhage occurring after experiencing the trauma was “almost certainly due to the fact that she had such a dangerously low platelet count thus predisposing her to bleeding”. He said, “It is therefore my opinion that the main cause of death was cerebral haemorrhage, due to a low platelet count, due in turn to metastatic breast cancer on a background of an expected survival of a few weeks”. (Dr Wilcken was not present or otherwise involved in any post-mortem examination.)
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay accepted that there would be a greater degree of haemorrhage as a result of the deceased’s advanced cancer and very low platelet level. He said, “The trauma may cause a relatively minor haemorrhage, but because the body has very limited capability to deal with a small haemorrhage, it just keeps bleeding”. Despite the view of Dr Wilcken, he maintained his opinion that the cause of death was the blunt force trauma.
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay was cross-examined about his opinion that there was a moderate degree of force. In summary, it appears to have been based upon the extent of the injury, namely the three areas of bruising to the side of the face, as well as the injury to the brain indicated by the onset of loss of consciousness and which was explained on autopsy by the finding of the subarachnoid haemorrhage. He agreed that the bruising was of more limited assistance in making an assessment of the degree of force because it would be exaggerated by the low platelet count. Nevertheless he maintained his opinion.
	


Police interview


	
	The accused was interviewed by Detectives McWhirter and Burnet on the evening of 31 January 2013. It was readily apparent from the replaying of the recording of the interview in court that the accused had significant difficulty in understanding some of the questions and in recounting what had occurred and what his thinking was at the relevant time.
	
	
	Dr Pulman gave evidence on the voir dire about the various difficulties the accused would have experienced during the course of the interview and raised questions about the reliability of his responses. There was an objection to the admissibility of the interview on a variety of bases including that it was not sufficiently clear that (a) the accused understood the cautions that he was given and that (b) his responses to police questions could be regarded as reliable having regard to his intellectual disability. However the objection was not pressed once it became common ground that the interview could be taken into account as providing the following narrative:
	


“That he’d resigned from his job a few days earlier; he told his father, having been driven to work that morning; his father was upset; his father went home and told his mother; his mother was upset; there was a conference involving the mother, the father and Mr Thomas; Mr Thomas senior left Mr Thomas and his mother together; that she was angry; she expressed that anger to him; that he punched her; that he believed he punched her on more than one occasion; that he knew he punched her on the left side of her face; that he knew at the time that she was weak and tired.” (T91)


	
	It seemed to me that there was merit in the defence submission that any of the responses given by the accused that might be relevant to a critical issue concerning the degree of force with which he struck his mother were not sufficiently reliable to form any reasonable view as to what in fact occurred.
	


Manslaughter


	
	To establish the charge of manslaughter the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased and that the act was both unlawful and dangerous.
	
	
	The ""deliberate act of the accused"" relied upon by the Crown was his striking his mother at least once to the left side of the face. There is no dispute about this.
	
	
	The requirement that this act ""caused the death of the deceased"" requires proof that it substantially or significantly contributed to her death: Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378. As I have earlier outlined, there was a difference of opinion between Dr Wilcken and Dr Szentmariay as to the cause of death.
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay had the advantage of having conducted the autopsy examination and he had the assistance of the neuropathology report of Professor Buckland. It was not submitted that a reasonable doubt on the issue of causation arises from Dr Wilcken's opinion. Reliance upon it was limited to the issue of the degree of force applied (T105.35). I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the application of force by the accused to the deceased made a significant contribution to her having died on 31 January 2013.
	
	
	The accused's striking of his mother clearly constituted an assault and was thereby ""unlawful"". There was no issue about this.
	


The reasonable person and the dangerousness test


	
	A substantial issue was raised on the question of whether the act was ""dangerous"".
	
	
	The suggested direction for a trial judge to give to a jury in the Criminal Trials Bench Book at [5-990] is as follows:
	


""An act is dangerous if a reasonable person, in the position of the accused at the time the act was committed, would have realised that the act exposed another person, whether it be the deceased or not, to a risk of serious injury. It does not matter whether the accused believed that his/her act was dangerous. The test is whether a reasonable person, that is, an ordinary member of the community in the position of the accused, would have realised or appreciated that the act was dangerous.

A reasonable person in the position of the accused is one who is not subject to the peculiar eccentricities of the accused or any temporary or fleeting emotional or mental state to which the accused might have had at the time. The reasonable person is not affected by alcohol or drugs. But the reasonable person is to be taken as being of the age and maturity of the accused and to have the knowledge [if relevant, the skill] and experience of the accused at the time of the act relied upon by the Crown. Therefore, the reasonable person in this case is to be taken as … [set out the age and maturity of the accused and any relevant knowledge or experience (including education and training) the accused had at the time of the act alleged].""


	
	There is a real question, in my view, whether this represents a correct reflection of the law. However, it was not fully argued and I will only comment briefly about it. I do not believe anything of significance turns on this issue for the determination of this case. Accepting therefore the correctness of the direction, in the present case it would require attributing to the ""reasonable person"" the age of the accused (27) and his maturity. The evidence is not such that I can make an assessment of his level of maturity beyond having regard to the fact that his chronological age means that he is well into his adult years. In any event it would be entirely unrealistic to regard that as reflecting his maturity, given his intellectual handicap. Both “age” and “maturity” are not significant factors for attribution to the reasonable person in this case.
	
	
	The suggested direction would also require taking into account the accused’s knowledge of the frailty of his mother. He said in his police interview that ""she was tired and weak or something"" (Q 303). I accept the evidence of the accused's father and brother which was to the same effect and that she was virtually bed-ridden as a result.
	
	
	If the ""reasonable person"" was attributed with only the things mentioned in the suggested direction, I would have no hesitation in concluding beyond reasonable doubt that such a person would have realised that striking the deceased to the head at least once with even only a mild degree of force would have exposed her to a risk of serious injury. So much was conceded by senior counsel for the accused (T106.47).
	
	
	At this point I will say something more about the suggested direction. There appears to me to be a real question as to whether the “age” and “maturity” of the accused are necessarily required to be attributed to the reasonable person. There is even more doubt about the relevance of an accused's ""education and training"". The basis in authority for such a requirement is far from clear.
	
	
	It may be that the suggested direction was derived from a case such as R v Edwards [2008] SASC 303 which is cited in the Victorian Criminal Charge Book (published by the Judicial College of Victoria) at 7.2.4.1 (41) as authority for a proposition that ""the reasonable person should be considered to be the same age as the accused, and to have any specialised knowledge and experience that the accused had (e.g., knowledge of the recommended dosage for medication)"".
	
	
	In R v Edwards, Layton J directed herself in a judge-alone trial concerning both forms of involuntary manslaughter that, in respect of the unlawful and dangerous act form, ""the reasonable hypothetical person would be imbued with the qualities of age, experience and knowledge of the accused"". She cited The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 as authority for the proposition. No pinpoint reference was provided but it seems safe to assume that her Honour was referring to the directions of the trial judge in that case (set out at [14]) which included:
	


""… [Y]ou have to compare the conduct of the accused as you find it to have been with the conduct of a reasonable person who possesses the same personal attributes as the accused, that is to say a person of the same age, having the same experience and knowledge as the accused and the circumstances in which he found himself, and having the ordinary fortitude and strength of mind which a reasonable person would have"".


	
	The High Court in The Queen v Lavender was not directly concerned with that aspect of the trial judge's directions and it was not specifically addressed, let alone endorsed. And in any event, the case was concerned with manslaughter by criminal negligence, not by a unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	Layton J proceeded to direct herself that the reasonable person should be attributed with a variety of factors personal to the accused of which the following is merely an example:
	


""[386] In this case the age of the reasonable hypothetical person would be approximately 28 years old. He would be a fit young man who had been a security officer for some years and had been in charge of other security officers at the hotel as the second in charge to Spencer.

[387] The reasonable hypothetical person would have the following training as Edwards indicated he had undergone. Edwards had undertaken five days of full time training as a security officer with Marksman Security Training in 1997. He admitted that during that course he had received training in defence tactics, blocks, strikes, take-downs and restraining holds. Restraining holds included wristlocks and arm bars. The two main take-down holds were a straight arm bar and a “goose neck”, which is the application of pressure on the wrists.""


	
	In my view, with respect, this goes too far in attributing matters personal to the accused to the reasonable person. It substantially reduces the objective quality of the element of dangerousness. It may be that some confusion has arisen from a conflation of the sub-elements of dangerousness: the ""reasonable person"" and that such a person is ""in the position of the accused"". The latter requires consideration of the context in which the act causing death occurred; not the personal qualities such as the training and experience of the accused.
	
	
	Returning to the present case, senior counsel for the accused submitted that I should attribute to the reasonable person the accused's moderate intellectual disability. His intellectual capacity was assessed by Dr Susan Pulman as being at a level below the capacity of 99.9 per cent of the population. The particular characteristics that this entails that were specifically sought to be attributed to the reasonable person were an extremely poor information processing speed and impaired conceptual reasoning abilities.
	
	
	Mr Ierace SC acknowledged that he could not locate any precedent for attributing an intellectual disability to the reasonable person in either appellate or first instance decisions concerning the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown was not able to assist with any precedent either.
	
	
	The starting point is to refer to Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313 in which the High Court of Australia resolved a divergence of approach as to the objective element of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. It was held by the majority (at 327) that the test applied in R v Holzer [1968] VR 481 should be preferred to that applied in England as set out in authorities such as Director of Public Prosecutions v Newbury [1977] AC 500. The Holzer test required that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of really serious injury, whereas the English authorities and cases in Australia which had followed them held that an act was dangerous if it carried with it the risk of some harm. The majority (at 333), however, questioned the utility of the qualifier ""really"" and said that ""it is better to speak of an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury"".
	
	
	Wilson v The Queen is now of longstanding and unquestionable authority on the broad terms of the objective element of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. As was observed in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 (at [54]), ""it settled the law of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act for Australia"". It says nothing, however, of the attributes of the reasonable person.
	
	
	My attention was invited to R v Vangelder (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 February 1994, unrep). In that case a woman aged 24 was found guilty of manslaughter as a result of shaking a baby who had died of a subdural haemorrhage. The trial judge rejected evidence from a psychiatrist and a psychologist which was to the effect that the appellant's level of intelligence was in the bottom five per cent in terms of intellectual capacity. Gleeson CJ recorded that the only basis on which the evidence was sought to be led related to an argument that she would not have appreciated the danger involved in her actions in shaking the baby. But he said:
	


""Because of the objective test that is applicable to the concept of a dangerous act for the purpose of the crime of manslaughter, the evidence was irrelevant on that basis and his Honour was right to reject it.""


	
	The issue of whether the intellectual capacity of the appellant should be attributed to the reasonable person was not raised and so the case does not assist.
	
	
	In R v Wills [1983] 2 VR 201 at 212 it was held that the objective test is concerned with the physical acts of the accused and not his or her idiosyncrasies or ephemeral emotional or mental state. Lush J explained that if such matters are taken into account ""the test begins to take on a subjective appearance"". Fullagar J agreed but added (at 214) some additional remarks which included that matters relevant to the judgment exercised by the accused cannot be considered ""because that would be to bring into the equation a judgment by a man whose reason and judgment are in a morbid and clouded condition, whereas the reasonable man for the purposes of this particular rule of law is a man who judges with the unclouded reasoning power of a healthy and reasonable mind"".
	
	
	In R v Besim [2004] VSC 169; 148 A Crim R 28 at [38], Redlich J, described the objective test thus:
	


""The expression 'a reasonable man in the accused's position performing the very act the accused performed' relates to the physical circumstances of the accused and the nature of the act performed by the accused as viewed by a reasonable person. It is an objective test concerned with foreseeability of serious harm to the victim. Emotions passions or the mental state of the accused at the time the act was performed and which may have impaired the accused's capacity to assess the risk are not to be attributed to the reasonable person.""


	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v TY [2006] VSC 494; 167 A Crim R 596 (""DPP v TY""), Bell J was concerned with an issue as to whether to attribute the age of the accused to the reasonable person for the purpose of charging a jury in respect of the elements of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. The case concerned an allegation that the accused, when aged 14 years and 8 months, struck the deceased to the head with a golf umbrella with its long metal tip puncturing the deceased's skull and penetrating into the brain to a significant depth. The defence contended that the age of the accused was a relevant consideration in the jury's assessment of the dangerousness element.
	
	
	Bell J described the rationale for the objective test of dangerousness:
	


“[8] … The law stipulates an accused will be criminally responsible if a reasonable person would have realised how appreciably risky their actions were. The test is stipulated in objective terms because, if the conduct causes a homicide, the dreadful seriousness of that consequence is seen to require the accused’s responsibility to be measured against a general community standard, not one subjective to the accused.”


	
	His Honour later reiterated:
	


“[14] As I said earlier, it is the dreadful consequence of an act causing the death of a human being that is seen to call for the application of an objective test. The community expects criminal responsibility to be attributed even where the accused, subjectively, did not realise his or her actions were dangerously risky.”


	
	Bell J referred to the acceptance in the law of negligence of the relevance of age. One authority to which he referred in this respect was McHale v Watson [1966] HCA 13; 115 CLR 199 where (at 213) Kitto J stated:
	


“The principle [of the objective reasonable person standard] is of course applicable to a child. The standard of care being objective, it is no answer for him, any more than it is for an adult, to say that the harm he caused was due to his being abnormally slow-witted, quick-tempered, absent-minded or inexperienced. But it does not follow that he cannot rely in his defence upon a limitation upon the capacity for foresight or prudence, not as being personal to himself, but as being characteristic of humanity at his stage of development and in that sense normal. By doing so he appeals to a standard of ordinariness, to an objective and not a subjective standard. In regard to the things which pertain to foresight and prudence – experience, understanding of causes and effects, balance of judgment, thoughtfulness – it is absurd, indeed it is a misuse of language, to speak of normality in relation to persons of all ages taken together. In those things normality is, for children, something different from what normality is for adults; the very concept of normality is a concept of rising levels until ‘years of discretion’ are attained. The law does not arbitrarily fix upon any particular age for this purpose, and tribunals of fact may well give effect to different views as to the age at which normal adult foresight and prudence are reasonably to be expected in relation to particular sets of circumstances.” (My emphasis)


	
	Reference was also made by Bell J to cases in which age had been similarly taken into account, such as in homicide by culpable negligence under s 156(2)(b) of the Criminal Code (Tas) and in the objective test of provocation in Stingel v The Queen [1991] HCA 61; 171 CLR 312 at 330-331.
	
	
	His Honour could find no case in which it had been held that the age of the accused who is a child should not be taken into account in applying the dangerousness test in manslaughter. He concluded that:
	


“[12] … it would not be inconsistent with the function of the test in the law of manslaughter to do so.""


	
	I regard as particularly pertinent for the present case what immediately followed:
	


“[13] It has often been pointed out [that] the common law of homicide has evolved from automatic culpability for those who cause death, whether intentionally or accidentally, to culpability only for those whose actions or state of mind fulfil additional criteria. One important principle now applied to that continuing process is that, so far as possible, the criminal law should be developed “towards a closer correlation between moral culpability and legal responsibility”. Subjecting children to an adult standard, when we know children have a lesser capacity for realisation of appreciable risk than adults, would widen the gap between moral culpability and legal responsibility to its maximum. Taking the age of a child into account when applying the dangerousness test brings the two more closely together and is more consistent with the evolution of the law of homicide.”


	
	A prosecution submission that taking age into account would undermine the objectivity of the test because it would lead in the future to further subjective matters being taken into account such as gender and upbringing was rejected:
	


“[15] I cannot accept this submission. A child is a person under the age of 18 years. All persons under that age are children. The status of an accused person as a child is an objectively ascertainable attribute. It is not like a state of mind or an emotion. It is not like an intention. As we saw Windeyer J say, it is not an “idiosyncrasy”. And, as we saw Kitto J say, it appeals to “an objective and not a subjective standard.” Taking the age of a child-defendant into account has not damaged the objective reasonable person test in the law of negligence. Taking the age of a child-accused into account will not damage the objective reasonable person test in the law of manslaughter.”


	
	In the end, Bell J resolved to direct the jury that, in respect of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter, the prosecution must prove that the accused ""acted in a way that a reasonable person who was a young teenage boy would realise exposed the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury"".
	
	
	Finally, in Leigh Ann Russell by her next friend Julie Ann Russell v Rail Infrastructure Corporation [2007] NSWSC 402 (“Russell v Rail Corp”), Bell J (as her Honour then was) also drew from McHale v Watson, amongst other authorities, in holding that in determining an issue of contributory negligence it was appropriate to take into account the plaintiff’s mild intellectual handicap. Her Honour said:
	


“[96] I have decided that I should determine the defence of contributory negligence by considering whether the plaintiff failed to take the reasonable care for her own safety that is to be expected of a reasonable adult having a mild degree of intellectual handicap. The test remains objective and I do not take into account considerations peculiar to the plaintiff, albeit that they may be related to her disability, such as her childlike personality and tendency to be easily led.”


	
	McHale v Watson was cited (at [93]) as authority for the proposition that “the standard of care that applies to the liability of children in negligence is an objective one, which takes into account the limitations of childhood development"". Her Honour noted what was said by Kitto J (at 213) in the extract above (at [60]) and also what was said by Owen J (at 231) about a special standard having been applied to persons at the other extreme of life whose mental faculties have been impaired by age.
	
	
	Bell J set out her logical extrapolation of the consideration given to children to those of intellectual incapacity as follows:
	


“[94] The reasons that inform the adoption of an objective standard that is tailored to the recognised limitations of childhood (or, it may be, great age), may be thought equally applicable to the limitations of intellectual incapacity. It is true that childhood is not an idiosyncrasy; all adults have experienced it. Intellectual disability may be idiosyncratic but it is a condition that is capable of assessment by standardised measures. One can posit an objective standard to which a person possessed of mild or moderate or profound intellectual handicap, as the case may be, is to be held as much as one can posit the objective standard to which a child of four or nine or 13 is to be held. If it is against the policy of the law to hold a child with his or her limited understanding to the standard of care of the reasonable person there may be thought equally strong reasons for not applying the standard of the reasonable person to a plaintiff with a recognised degree of intellectual incapacity. (Lord Hoffman considered that the reason for holding children who lack a full understanding of the danger of an activity to a different standard in dealing with contributory negligence is because it would not be just and equitable to do so and that the same consideration may apply to a person of unsound mind: Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 AC 360 at 371-372).”

Conclusion


	
	I am attracted by the logic in the analyses in DPP v TY and Russell v Rail Corp. Like the age of the teenage child accused in the former and the mildly intellectually handicapped plaintiff in the latter, the moderate intellectual disability of the accused in this case is an objectively ascertainable attribute. There is nothing transient or ephemeral about it. And there is nothing borderline about it either; the accused's intellectual capacity is so far removed from that of the vast majority of people in the community that it strikes me as patently unfair to require him and his actions to be judged by standards that he could never hope to emulate.
	
	
	In preferring the test in Holzer over that in DPP v Newbury, the majority in the High Court in Wilson v The Queen gave (at 327) as one of its reasons ""the development of the law towards a closer correlation between moral culpability and legal responsibility"". To my mind, to judge the actions of a person who has an intellectual capacity in the bottom 0.1 per cent of the population by the standards of the vast majority of citizens is to widen the gap between moral culpability and legal responsibility to a point that is simply unacceptable.
	
	
	I propose to assess the fourth element of the charge of manslaughter upon a consideration whether a reasonable person possessed of a moderate intellectual disability rendering that person with extremely poor information processing speed and impaired conceptual reasoning abilities with knowledge that the deceased was weak and frail as a result of a debilitating illness would have realised that striking her to the left side of the face at least once would expose her to a risk of serious injury.
	
	
	I can express my conclusion immediately. I consider it probable that such a person would have had such a realisation; but I cannot exclude the possibility that he or she would not.
	


Reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm


	
	I turn to the alternative count alleging that the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The element of grievous bodily harm was not in issue and I simply record that I am satisfied that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt. And, for the reasons given earlier, I am similarly satisfied that it was the deliberate act of the accused which caused it.
	
	
	The critical element is that of recklessness. It requires proof that at the time of striking his mother, the accused realised that he may possibly cause actual bodily harm to her yet he went ahead and struck her: see s 35(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Actual bodily harm can be anything that interferes with the health or comfort of a person. It does not need to be permanent but must be more than fleeting or trivial in its affect.
	
	
	Mr Ierace submitted that there was material in the accused's police interview that indicated that he did not think about what he did at all; that it simply happened and it was only afterwards that he realised that he should not have done it. He referred to the following responses (and I have added some surrounding passages to provide context):
	


“Q57 Yeah, tell me the story about what happened today, sorry.

A. Well, last Saturday, last Saturday I quit, they didn’t want me to work at my job, and stuff like that. So I quit, but I don’t think, and everything else has just been too over the top with mum, you know, with her, just cancer and stuff, and all that stuff.

Q58 Yeah, we’ll get into that.

A. And there’s been too many stress in the family and stuff, and yeah. And plus I’ve got an alcohol problem, but, so when I ---

Q59 I’m listening, yep.

A. So I never wanted to, I love my mum, but I didn’t, I never wanted to hit her, but I had this picture in my head, it’s the alcohol picture in my head, just made me feel like I want to drink, and I just, I didn’t want to do that, but so I just punched her, but yeah.”


	
	Mr Ierace submitted that the reference to ""the alcohol picture"" should be understood as a feeling of stress on the part of the accused because it was to alcohol that he turned when he was feeling stressed.
	


“Q133 OK. So once she asked you these questions, then what happened?

A. I don’t know. I, I don’t know. It was terrifying, I, I didn’t want to do it, but yeah.”


	
	This was said to amount to insight on the accused's part; ""a realisation on his part that he could not process what was happening and so there was some sort of frustrated outburst"". (T103.13)
	


“Q302 What did you think would happen to your mum when you punched her?

A. She wouldn’t defend herself. That’s why ---

Q303 Why do you think she wouldn’t defend herself?

A. No, she, she was tired and weak or something.

Q304 So she was tired and weak, was she?

A. Yeah.

Q305 What did you think would happen if you punched your mum?

A. I don’t, I wasn’t thinkin’ about it.

Q306 OK, so you weren’t thinking about it when you did it ---

A. Nuh.

Q307 --- is that right?

A. Nuh.

Q308 Did you think that it would hurt your mum?

A. Yeah. A couple of times, she’s had, she’d had, a couple of times I get stressed ‘cause she’s had a couple of falls, yeah. She had a big bruise on her, her hip ---""


	
	I have reservations about whether the ""Yeah"" in response to Q. 308 can be regarded as an admission that at the time of striking his mother he appreciated that it would hurt her. It would depend upon whether he understood the question to require him to say what his thinking was before or at the time of the striking and not in hindsight. Given his intellectual capacity, I am not sure that he would have appreciated the precision of the question; that ""would hurt"" required him to distinguish between his thoughts before and after.
	
	
	There are difficulties in drawing too much from any of the responses to which counsel referred. For the very reason that he argued that other responses could not be regarded as reliable, there is reason for circumspection about these as well.
	
	
	The simple facts of the matter are that the accused was engaged in an argument about his loss of employment with his parents. His father left and went to the kitchen. The accused went to his room and got changed out of his work clothes. But his mother wanted to continue the discussion. Mr Thomas said he heard her call out in a strong voice, ""Michael, come here"". He must have detected an air of agitation because he responded by calling out: ""Sue. Why? It's over."" The accused was then seen to walk hurriedly into his mother's room and in an instant, and however one might characterise the degree of force used, Mr Thomas, from another room in the house, was able to hear “two hits”.
	
	
	Then there is Dr Pulman’s evidence when asked whether the accused had the capacity to anticipate the probable or possible consequences of punching his mother. Her opinion was encapsulated in a passage in her report of 19 November 2013 and an answer she gave in evidence:
	


“It is likely … that he understood that punching his mother would probably cause her some degree of physical pain and may possibly result in bruising or scratches to her face. However it is was unlikely that he gave consideration to any potential complications, possible or probable, caused by his actions.” (19.11.13 report at 7-8)

""He would have the capacity to realise that it would cause her pain and it would hurt and she wouldn’t like it, he has the capacity to know that. And in that, he has the capacity to know it would cause injury in the sense of pain.” (T37.48)


	
	Having regard to this evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused struck his mother with the thought that it would cause her some harm. It was an angry and reactive response, albeit probably borne of stress and frustration. I am satisfied that each of the essential elements of the count of reckless causing of grievous bodily harm have been established.
	


Verdicts


	
	I return the following verdicts:
	


Manslaughter: Not guilty

Reckless grievous bodily harm: On the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence.

		18 May 2015",2015-05-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766594,New South Wales Crime Commission v Tran [2015] NSWSC 542,"This is a matter arising under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act). The plaintiff, New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) and the first defendant, Mr Tran, ask the court to make consent forfeiture orders under s 22 of the Act giving effect to their agreement for the final disposition of the proceedings between them. The fourth defendant, Mrs Tran, objects to the Court making the orders because she argues they will affect property in which she claims an interest contrary to Mr Tran. Mr and Mrs Tran had lived together in a bona fide domestic relationship of some 15 years duration when Mr Tran was arrested for serious drug offences, for which he has been convicted and imprisoned. They are parties to proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia which will include an application for the division of property between them.
	


Proceedings for a property settlement


	
	The aforegoing summary is an oversimplification of the issues. The initiating application in the federal jurisdiction seeks orders in relation to “financial (property and/or maintenance)” matters. “Final orders” are sought in these very general, prospective terms (Fourth Defendant’s tender bundle page 3 – 25):
	


That the wife be granted leave to amend her Final Orders sought upon determination of the case in the Supreme Court of NSW known as NSW Crime Commission v Brendon Phong Tran and Ors (No. 2011/293013).


	
	The initiating application was filed to obtain urgent ex parte orders permitting Mrs Tran to reside at certain premises at Haymarket from which Mr Tran purported to have her evicted from his prison cell. Interim orders “until further order” restoring Mrs Tran to residence and “exclusive occupation” of the Haymarket property were made by his Honour Judge Scarlett on 17th March 2014 (affidavit of Mark Ian Youssef sworn 7th May 2015 [5], Annexure A).
	
	
	These family proceedings provide the context for the present dispute. A number of provisions of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) (FLA) need to be mentioned to elaborate the context: s 78 empowers the Court to declare the existing rights of the parties in respect of property; s 79 permits the division of property between the parties including, but extending beyond, their existing individual interests; orders under s 79 may be set aside in exceptional circumstances including the making of a proceeds of crime order against a party; s 79B requires an applicant for a property order to notify the court if either party is covered by a proceeds of crime order, or a forfeiture application; by s 79C a court notified under s 79B must stay the property proceedings until the proceeds of crime order ceases to be in force or the forfeiture application is finally determined; and during the currency of a proceeds order, by s 79D, a stay may only be lifted if, in this case, the Commission consents. For present purposes it is enough to record that a “proceeds of crime order” includes a restraining order under s 10A of the Act.
	
	
	The Commission is a party to Mrs Tran’s application in the federal jurisdiction and in accordance with s 79C FLA those proceedings have been stayed. This is because at the time the proceedings were commenced, seeking those urgent orders, the proceeds of crime orders were in place, inter alia, in respect of all the interests in property of both Mr Tran and Mrs Tran. In the case of Mr Tran, a restraining order was made under by Garling J on 9th September 2011. In Mrs Tran’s case, a restraining order was made on 11th December 2013 by Davies J.
	
	
	To add to the apparent complications, Mr Tran’s mother and one of his sisters are the second and third defendants. The proposed consent forfeiture orders cover any interest of Mr Tran in real property in Western Australia in which various family members have a registered interest.
	
	
	The deeper background to all of this is garnered from the annexures to the affidavit of Mrs Tran’s solicitor, Mr Yussef, that is read in support of her position. There are 41 items of property of various kinds described in four schedules to the proposed consent orders including real property, bank accounts, shares, cash, motor vehicles and other chattels, like electrical items, mobile phones, watches, gold and coins. Some of these items are registered, or held, in the name of Mrs Tran, Mr Tran’s mother and his two sisters. The Commission has information which if led as evidence accepted by the Court, would prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the acquisition of each of the items of property was funded by Mr Tran (see the 95 page Annexure G attached to Mrs Tran’s Federal Circuit Court affidavit forming part of Annexure A to Mr Yussef’s affidavit). Most of the property is in Mr Tran’s own name including the contentious Haymarket property and a particularly valuable parcel of shares in what seems to be a mining company (proposed consent orders Schedule 1 Item 8).
	
	
	Mr Tran was convicted on 31st May 2013, on two counts of supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months and an additional term of 2 years and 3 months: a total effective sentence of 8 years.
	


Consent Orders


	
	The proposed consent order is signed by Mr Tran, his solicitor and the legal representatives of the Commission. The form runs to 7 pages, but the principal relief agreed upon is contained, so far as has been the subject of argument before me, in the following proposed orders:
	


13.   Leave is granted to the Plaintiff to amend its summons to seek an order pursuant to section 22 of the Act forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown the interests and property of the First Defendant in property specified in Schedule One and Schedule Four hereto.

14.   Pursuant to section 22 of the Act the interest in property of the First Defendant in the property in Schedule One hereto and Schedule Four hereto be forfeited to, and vest in, the Crown.

15.   The application for a proceeds assessment order is dismissed.


	
	Recitals which the Commission and Mr Tran ask me to “note”, record that Mr Tran asserts no interest in the property specified in Schedule 4, whilst the Commission asserts that he does. Schedule 4 mainly lists property registered or held in the name of other family members, including Mrs Tran (see [6] above). No order is sought in respect of Mr Tran’s interest in real property described in Schedule 3 of which he is a registered proprietor as joint tenant with one of his sisters. Nor is any order sought in respect of 13 items of property described in Schedule 2 including, what I will refer to as, the former family home. Mr Bhalla of Counsel, who appeared for the Commission, explained that “the Schedule 2 property … was carved out for the sole purpose of providing for the first defendant’s dependants … that property will be available in due course to be dealt with” in the federal jurisdiction (6.15 - .25T). No mention was made of the Schedule 3 property. Perhaps there are practical difficulties in giving effect to s 23 of the Act in respect of an interest as a joint tenant in real property located interstate. On the other hand, it may be that the Commission is satisfied Mr Tran’s interest in that property is not caught by the Act.
	
	
	Mr Boulten SC appeared for Mr Tran to support the Commission’s position. Understandably, Mr Tran is desirous of achieving finality in these proceedings, to avoid further legal costs.
	


Legal basis for consent orders


	
	In asking the Court to make the orders the Commission and Mr Tran rely upon s 62 of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


Orders made by consent

(1) The Supreme Court may, on the application of the Commission and with the consent of all persons whose interest in property will be subject to an order under this Act, make that order by an order under this section (a consent order) that gives effect to the terms of an agreement negotiated between the Commission and any one or more persons whose interest in property will be subject to the order under this Act.

(2) A consent order may be made by the Supreme Court without consideration of the matters that the Supreme Court would otherwise consider before making the order.

(3) In particular, and without limiting subsection (2), the Supreme Court is not required to consider the matters set out in section 16A in making a restraining order by consent order that makes provision of the kind referred to in section 10B (3) (b).

(4) A confiscation order may only be made by consent order if the Commissioner for the Commission certifies that any guidelines with respect to the negotiation of the terms of agreements with respect to the making of consent orders given under section 57 (Directions and guidelines to Commission) of the Crime Commission Act 2012 have been fully complied with.

I record that the Commissioner has provided the Certificate required by s 62(4).

The contentions of the parties


	
	The Commission argues that Mrs Tran has no standing to be heard in relation to the application for the making of the consent orders because, given the form of the orders sought, she is not a person “whose interests in property will be subject” to the order.
	
	
	Mr Bates of Counsel, who appears for Mrs Tran, objects to forfeiture orders being made which affect 10 items of property contained in Schedules 1 and 4. He has provided the following table summarising the matters in dispute. 
	


 



 



From the references to Mr Youssef’s affidavit, I understand that Mrs Tran “seeks an exclusion order under ss 25 and 26, or hardship relief under s 24 of the Act”.

 


	
	Mr Bates argues that the interest of his client in property referred to in the Schedules does not depend upon any exercise of her statutory right to have the Federal Circuit Court alter general law property rights under s 79 FLA. Rather, Mrs Tran assets “traditional caveatable interests” (5.10T) and circumstances creating an equitable interest by way of proprietary estoppel (5.15T) or perhaps a constructive trust.
	
	
	The Commission argues that Mrs Tran has no standing to seek an exclusion order and that hardship orders under s 24 of the Act can be made after the forfeiture order has taken effect: New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelly [2003] NSWCA 245; 58 NSWLR 71 at 76 [24] by Sheller JA; Santow and Tobias JJA agreeing.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 62 (in its present form) was inserted on the enactment of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) (Schedule 5.2 [13]), the key phrase “all persons whose interests in property will be subject to an order” employs language broadly similar to s 25(1)(a): “a persons whose interests in property might be subject to the order if made” (s 25 deals with exclusion orders). This phrase and the expression “a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order” in s 25(1)(b) have been given a surprisingly narrow meaning by a series of cases in the Common Law Division, all decided before the significant amendments made by the Criminal Assets Recovery Amendment Act 2009. The various decisions were examined by Hall J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Keen [2005] NSWSC 1151; 64 NSWLR 515, discussed by Basten JA in New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; 65 NSWLR 478 at 467 [26]; 497 [80] and 499 [88] (the other members of the Court Mason P and Giles JA did not refer to the issue). The issue is a significant one, for as Basten JA said in Liu v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 347; 179 A Crime R 58 (in a judgment with which Mason P and Tobias JA agreed), (at [15]):
	


Whether there is any scope for the innocent owner to recover his or her property absent an application under s 25 … was the subject of consideration in [Ollis], which rejected the availability of such a process: at [35] (Giles JA, Mason P agreeing).

When Ollis was decided, the power to make an assets forfeiture order under s 22 of the Act was limited to “interest in property that is, or proposed to be, subject to a restraining order”. Section 22 was freed from that constraint by the 2009 amendments: s 22(1B).


	
	Returning to Justice Hall’s decision in Keen, the issue was whether a person, I will usual neutral language, not being a person against whom a forfeiture order had been made, had standing to bring and maintain an application for an exclusion order, in this case after the forfeiture order had been made i.e. under s 25(1)(b), as it then stood. Hall J made the following observations which remain apposite to the legislation in its current form (520 [27] – 521 [29]):
	


[27] Importantly, s 22(4) provides that when an assets forfeiture order is made, “it must be made so as to apply to specified interests in property”.

[28] It is important in this respect to observe that an assets forfeiture order is not made in respect of identified property. Rather it is made in respect of interests in property which, as earlier observed, takes its meaning from the provisions of s 7(1) and (2) of the Act.

[29] Section 23(1) provides, inter alia, that on an assets forfeiture order taking effect in relation to an interest in property, that the interest is forfeited to the Crown and vests in the Public Trustee on behalf of the Crown. (original emphasis.)

His Honour’s observation at [28] was also made by Basten JA in Liu at [8]. It was necessary for the plaintiff in Keen to show that he was “a person whose interest in property was forfeited” by the forfeiture order. In deciding the point against him, Hall J commenced his analysis by reference to the decision of Badgery-Parker J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Young (10th August 1992, unreported), that case was concerned with s 25(1)(a). Badgery-Parker J pointed out that the forfeiture order was proposed to be made only in respect of the interest in property of a named person who was not the applicant for the exclusion order. His Honour said:

The submission of the applicants seems rather to equate the words in s 25(1)(a), “might be subject to the order if made” as meaning, “might be affected by the making of the order if made”. In my view the words of the section are quite clear and are not capable of carrying the meaning contended for.


	
	By parity of reasoning, Hall J decided that words “a person whose interest in property is forfeited” were not the equivalent of “a person whose interest in property has been affected”: 523[36]. His Honour pointed out that the same approach had been followed in Black Uhlans Inc v State of New South Wales (McInerney J, 5th December 1996, unreported) and New South Wales Crime Commission v Greer [2000] NSWSC 363; 112 A Crim R 461 by Simpson J. Although not referred to Badgery-Parker J’s decision by counsel, her Honour adopted the same approach at 464 [13].
	
	
	In Ollis at 496 [77] Basten JA said:
	


As Hall J noted at [27], an assets forfeiture order may only be made “so as to apply to specified interests in property”: s 22(4). It is at least doubtful that an order could validly be made which identified a piece of land or an item of personal property and specified that which was the subject of forfeiture (or indeed a restraining order) as “the defendant’s interest in” such land or other property. The difficulty said to attend Mr Masri’s application was that, for the purposes of s 25, the only person who could seek an exclusion order was “a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order”. Because the order in terms only forfeited Mr Keen’s interest, Mr Masri had no standing. (It may be noted by way of comparison that the equivalent provision in the Proceeds of Crime Act (Cth), considered in Woodcroft, allowed any person “having an interest in the property” to apply to the Court “for a variation of the order to exclude the person’s interest from the order”: s 48(3)(c).)

And at 497 [80] his Honour said:

The problem identified in Keen highlights the need for the Commission to identify with precision the interests in property with respect to which it seeks a restraining order and an assets forfeiture order. If it asserts that only the identified defendant has an interest in the property, it should seek an order in relation to “all interests” in the identified property. In every other case, the interest must be described with sufficient precision for it to be a “specified interest”. Where the interest is identified as the interest of a named person in a piece of land of which the named person is the sole registered proprietor, it may perhaps be inferred that the interest sought to be identified is the freehold estate.


	
	Ollis was decided before the 2009 amendments, when there was a necessary connection between a restraining order and a forfeiture order. Basten JA dissented from the majority in Ollis by holding that redress would be available under s 12. However at 499 [88] his Honour said:
	


There is a separate question which arises in relation to the availability of relief to someone who is not a party to proceedings under the Act, but who asserts an interest in property which appears to have been identified as an interest of a defendant. As appears from Keen, assets forfeiture orders are sometimes made by consent. It is not hard to imagine cases in which a defendant will be willing to consent to, or at least not challenge, an order sought by the Commission, even though he or she knows that a third party might well seek to assert an interest in the property if given an opportunity. However, the availability of relief to a third party does not arise in the present case as each of the applicants for relief is a defendant in the proceedings and is subject to a restraining order. (Emphasis added.)


	
	I understand the concluding sentence of that passage to relate to his Honour’s view that s 12 may be called in aid of a party to the proceedings against whom a restraining order has been made. With respect, that seems to have been the gravamen of his Honour’s dissent and that avenue is foreclosed by the majority decision. But as will be seen that Mrs Tran is a party to these proceedings is matter of particular significance.
	


Decision on standing to challenge the Consent Orders


	
	Section 62 was enacted to make clear the Court’s power to pronounce orders by consent. It might be said that there was really little doubt: see International Finance Trust Company v New South Wales Crime Commission (No 2) [2010] NSWCA 46 at [64] – [65]; compare Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1981) 148 CLR 150 at [63].
	
	
	The question about the validity of forfeiture orders raised by Basten JA in Ollis (at 497[80]) did not arise in International Finance Trust (No 2); that case concerned a proceeds assessment order in a specified sum. The language of s 62(1) “All persons whose interests in property is subject to an order” may also be contrasted with the requirements of s 29(3) relating to certain enforcement orders. This provision refers to: (a) the person against whose interest in property the order is sought; (b) any other person who the Commission has reason to believe may also have an interest in the property; and (c) any other person who claims an interest in the property.
	
	
	Given the line of cases commencing with Young, I am constrained to the view that the expression “all persons whose interest in property will be subject” to a proposed consent order does not mean “all persons whose interest in property may be affected” by a proposed consent order. The legislature may be taken to have been aware of the Young line of cases; it may be said that it deliberately adopted like language to achieve a like result. The provisions of s 29(3) also demonstrate that the legislature was aware that persons whose interests are not subject to the order may claim an interest that could be adversely affected by the making the order. Yet no specific provision was made in s 62 to allow them to be heard before consent orders are made. Only those whose interests will be subject to the order are entitled to be heard about the making of a consent order. I will return to the question of whether her claimed interest is subject to the form of consent orders proposed.
	


Is there a general law right to be heard?


	
	As I have said, it is of particular significance that Mrs Tran is party to the proceedings. In Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission at [163], (as Basten JA pointed out in International Finance Trust (No 2) at [64]), a plurality of four Justices of the High Court said: “a party to the proceedings is entitled to argue that any order made by the Court should conform to legal principle”, at least when their legal position may be affected by the orders.
	
	
	Under the general law a court of record, especially a superior court, has “an overriding power to control its own proceedings and [is] not obliged to act upon [a] request by some of the parties before it that consent orders be entered”: James Hardie & Co v Seltsam Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 78; 196 CLR 53 at 62 [17]; RD Werner & Co Inc v Bailey Aluminium Products Pty Ltd (1988) 18 FCR 389 at 392 – 393. In my view s 62 of the Act does not displace this general law rule. Rather, its purpose, in part, is to confirm the conformity of the Court’s powers in matters arising under the Act to its general law powers as a superior court of record. Moreover, as s 62(3) makes clear, another purpose was to overcome the specific decision of this Court in NSW Crime Commission v Cook [2011] NSWSC 1348; 82 NSWLR 1 (Hall J) requiring the Court to satisfy itself that the provisions of s 16A were complied with before making an order for the payment of a person’s legal expenses by consent.
	
	
	The question of whether a party will be heard in opposition to consent orders agreed to by other parties to the proceedings seems to depend whether the opposing party is “directly interested in the question” resolved by the consent orders: James Hardie at 62 [17]; Walter H Wright Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1958] VR 318; ALR 698 at 321; International Finance Trust (No 2) at [68]-[73]. In International Finance Trust (No 2), which as I have said concerned a proceeds assessment order, not a forfeiture order, the appellants did not suffer any practical injustice by not having the opportunity to be heard before the consent order was made. In the circumstances of that case they could not be deprived of their interests in the property until an application under s 29 of the Act had been made and determined (per Basten JA at [69] and [72]).
	
	
	Had the opposing party in James Hardie made its opposition plain, which it did not, it would have been entitled to “seek deferral of the entry of judgment” until determination of the issue in which it was directly interested. The consent judgment would not have been of legal effect until entered. Moreover, had the judgment been entered against the wishes of the opposing party an appeal by it against that judgment would have been competent: James Hardie at 63 [19] – [20]; Walter H Wright at 321; Oceanic Crest Shipping Co v Pilbara Harbour Services Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 626 at 670 – 1.
	
	
	If Mrs Tran is “directly interested” in the question to be resolved by the entry of the consent orders, and she must be at least in respect of Mr Tran’s interest, if any, in the property listed to her name in Schedule 4, the immediate effect of the entry of a forfeiture order will be to deprive her of any interest she may have in Schedule 1 property, and to diminish her apparent full beneficial interest in her the Schedule 4 property. This is made clear by the provision of s 23 of the Act which I will set out in full:
	


Effect of asset forfeiture order 

(1) On an assets forfeiture order taking effect in relation to an interest in property:

(a) the interest is forfeited to the Crown and vests in the NSW Trustee and Guardian on behalf of the Crown, and

(b) if the person forfeiting the interest was in possession, or was entitled to possession, of the property, the NSW Trustee and Guardian may take possession of the property on behalf of the Crown.

(2) An interest forfeited under subsection (1) is to be disposed of by the NSW Trustee and Guardian in accordance with the directions of the Treasurer and the proceeds are to be paid to the Treasurer and credited to the Proceeds Account.

(3) The Treasurer may delegate the power to give directions for the purposes of subsection (2).

(4) The Supreme Court may, when it makes an assets forfeiture order or at any later time, make any ancillary orders that the Court considers appropriate. For example, the Court may make ancillary orders for and with respect to facilitating the transfer to the Crown of interests in property forfeited to the Crown under such an order.


	
	I am conscious of the criticisms of forfeiture orders made in the form sought here made by Basten JA in Ollis. But Ollis was not raised by any party and accordingly, the point that may have been available arising out of paragraphs [77] and [80] of his, dissenting judgment, in Ollis was not taken. In the circumstances, I am prepared to assume that the order proposed in paragraph [14] of the Consent Orders is a valid exercise of this Court’s power. In the context of the disputed items in Schedule 1, I understand the “specified interest” of Mr Tran for the purpose of s 22(4) of the Act to be the freehold estate in respect of the real property and the whole beneficial interest in respect of the shares. Looked at this way, the order sought deprives Mrs Tran of any contrary interest in that property which she is able to establish.
	
	
	When one considers the effect of s 23 in this light, “the interest which is forfeited to the Crown” is the whole undiminished beneficial interest in each of the disputed items of property. It follows from this, and from what I have said about the Schedule 4 property in Mrs Tran’s name, that, she is “a person whose interest in [the disputed property] might be subject to the [forfeiture] order if made”: s 25(1)(a) (emphasis added). And if the whole undiminished beneficial interest in those Schedule 1 items is forfeited to the Crown then whatever lesser interest she may be able to establish will be “forfeited by the order” (s 25(1)(b).
	
	
	Mr Bhalla argued that if Mrs Tran had an interest in Schedule 1 property “ancillary orders” could be made under s 23(4) to protect her position. In Ollis (at 493 [61]) Basten JA considered the term “ancillary”, where used in s 12 of the Act, means “consequential upon” rather than “subservient or subordinate to”. Giles JA, with whom Mason P agreed, did not find it necessary to fully explore that matter, but did observe, in the context of s 12, that the kind of orders that can be made “do not suggest a narrow notion of what is ancillary” (Ollis at 486 [28]).
	
	
	Certainly an order deferring entry of part of the consent forfeiture orders seems comfortably within the ordinary meaning of “ancillary”. However, if one considers the example give in s 23(4) of what is ancillary, it may be that the legislative intention is that ancillary orders are orders having the purpose of furthering the effectiveness and efficiency of the forfeiture order rather than delaying its implementation. It is not necessary to finally decide the scope of ancillary orders under s 23 for it seems to me that the Court’s ordinary powers would permit a deferral of the entry of orders if that was appropriate in this case.
	
	
	Mr Bhalla also argued that the making of orders, perhaps with a deferral, would enable Mrs Tran to take proceedings in equity to establish whatever interest in the disputed property she claims to have. However, I am not convinced that is the appropriate procedure. That would suggest that anyone could circumvent the “drastic” requirements of s 25 (Ollis 487 [35]). Where s 25 applies it is not enough that a person seeking an exclusion order establishes a competing interest in the property. Section 25(2) requires the applicant to prove, relevantly in the present case, that “the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property”. The purposes of the Act would be, if not defeated, substantially undermined, if orders made could be challenged on general law principles that avoided rather faced up to the stringent requirements of the Act for excluding interests from the reach of forfeiture orders. In my view the only path available to Mrs Tran is to bring herself, if she can, within the exceptions created by the Act itself.
	
	
	It follows however from what I have said about the construction of the proposed orders, assuming Mrs Tran can establish an interest in property on general law principles, that she is a person whose interest might be subject to the proposed order, applying the Young line of cases. From this it follows that she is also within the class of persons entitled to be heard under s 62 of the Act. If I am wrong in this last proposition, I am of the view that as a party she has a general law right to be heard before the orders are made.
	
	
	I think it appropriate to stand the matter over for a period of 28 days to give Mrs Tran an opportunity to bring an application for an exclusion order by way of cross-claim in these proceedings before the forfeiture orders are “made” within the meaning of s 25. It may be that the mere pronouncement of them, whether they are entered or not, is sufficient to satisfy that expression as used in s 23.
	
	
	Moreover, given what I have said about Mrs Tran’s schedule 4 interests, the interests of Kim Christine Tran and Thi Kim Phuong Tran may be similarly affected. Adjourning the matter will enable the Commission to give them notice of the proposed orders so far as it might affect them, if so advised.
	
	
	I appreciate that Mr Tran, as I have already said, is desirous of finalising his involvement in these proceedings. I propose making the consent orders on the adjourned date whether or not Mrs Tran files her cross-claim seeking any available relief under the Act, provided the other parties have notice of the orders.
	
	
	I do not wish to be taken as expressing any view on the strength of any application that Mrs Tran may bring: Cox v Journeaux [No2] [1935] HCA 48; 52 CLR 713 at 720. The matter came up for hearing before me relatively quickly and she has not had the opportunity of filing evidence to demonstrate that she has a fairly arguable case. As I have said, she should be given the opportunity of formulating one and doubtless those advising her will bear in mind the provisions of s 25(3) in formulating any cross-claim she proposes to bring.
	
	
	In dealing with the matter as I have, I have borne in mind the provisions of s 79C FLA. It is clearly the intention of the Commonwealth Parliament that questions arising under the Act should be determined in this Court before the Federal Circuit Court of Australia is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction in relation to property settlements or spousal maintenance. Given that a forfeiture order was not the form of principal relief sought against Mr Tran until the proposed Consent Orders were proffered, Mrs Tran cannot be criticised for failing to earlier bring an application for an exclusion, or hardship, order.
	
	
	I also record that there is no added danger to the revenue in adjourning the matter for 4 weeks. The proceedings have been on foot for some time and there are restraining orders in place in respect of the interests of each of the defendants in the property specified in the four schedules to the Consent Orders. I appreciate that fluctuations can occur in the value of property relatively quickly, especially in the case of shares. But those fluctuations are just as likely to favour the Crown as not. So far as the value of the Haymarket property is concerned Mrs Tran has the benefit of an order for exclusive possession made in the federal jurisdiction. Clearly before the value of Mr Tran’s interest in that property could be realised a further application to the Federal Circuit Court would be necessary.
	
	
	Finally, I record that Mrs Tran proffered the usual undertaking as to damages. Given the relatively short delay, and the existence of the restraining orders I do not think it appropriate to require that undertaking as a condition of the adjournment.
	
	
	My orders are:
	



	
	Adjourn the proceedings to Tuesday, 9th June 2015 for the pronouncement of the Consent Orders agreed between the plaintiff and the first defendant;
	
	
	Direct the fourth defendant to file any cross-claim seeking orders under ss 24, 25 or 26 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 by Friday, 5th June 2015 in which regard time shall be of the essence.
	
	
	Costs of this application reserved.

2766596,McVittie v R [2015] NSWCCA 92,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Sean James McVittie (“the applicant”) applies for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon him by Hosking ADCJ in the Sydney District Court on 4 December 2013 for an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In being sentenced for that offence he asked that his guilt in respect of an offence of aggravated kidnapping be taken into account.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for 25 years: s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is also prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Aggravated kidnapping has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years: s 86(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	After allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the applicant’s plea of guilty, the learned sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months dating from 5 February 2013.
	


Facts


	
	The Crown’s written submissions provided the following very useful and succinct summary of the objective facts of the offending:
	


“Both offences arose from events on 5 February 2013 when the victim was invited to attend the applicant’s house. When he arrived, the applicant confronted the victim with a 30cm knife and detained him. There followed a prolonged ordeal during which the applicant inflicted numerous acts of violence upon the victim. The applicant continually threatened the victim with the knife throughout the incident, and used it to stab him on three occasions. He also struck the victim forcefully with a dumb bell bar and a hammer as well as punching him to the face. The injuries sustained by the victim included three stab wounds (left shoulder blade, left thigh and chest area).

The offender’s purpose in carrying out these actions was to try to get the victim to agree with his (delusional) belief that the victim had been at his back fence the night before, talking with the applicant’s ex-girlfriend and others about killing the applicant.”

Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The applicant was born in 1979 and so was aged 33 at the time of offences. (The applicant has an alias, Christopher Neal McVittie with a date of birth in 1981, and under that guise he would have been aged 31.)
	
	
	The applicant has a criminal history which, excluding driving offences, comprised an offence of intimidating a police officer in the execution of his/her duty in 2007 and a matter of assault in 2009, for each of which he received a 12 month good behaviour bond. He had not been in gaol before his arrest for the present matter.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant tendered in the sentence proceedings reports by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, dated 2 April and 1 November 2013 and a letter written by the applicant apparently in June 2013. He called the applicant’s father to give oral evidence. Written submissions were provided which were supplemented by brief oral submissions.
	
	
	In the first report which resulted from interviewing the applicant on 19 March 2013, Dr Allnutt obtained an account of the events of 5 February 2013 which clearly indicated that his actions were the product of delusions. For example Dr Allnutt reports that the applicant told him:
	


“By the time of the alleged offence he said he had got rid of his ex girlfriend; he believed that she was trying to get him murdered; the night before the alleged offence he believed that his girlfriend had been conspiring to kill him; he believed that he had previously seen people pointing guns at him; when he had brought this up with her she seemed to be blank about it which meant to him that she already knew.

…

The night before the alleged offence he said that Uresh was having sex with Rachel, as bait; he was having sex with her to bait your client; he knew this was happening because he had gone to look for them; he said he had gone to a stormwater drain at the back of the house; he explained that he had gone to the stormwater drain because on a previous occasion, he had heard them through the stormwater drain plotting to kill him; he had heard Rachel and Justin and had been hearing this for a number of months prior to the alleged offence; he heard them say ‘what’s his knife gonna do to your shotgun’.

…

Uresh rang; he said he went to Leumeah; he said that Uresh asked him if he could come over; he thought Uresh might have asked him if he could come over in order to ‘finish the job from the night before’, ‘or maybe have a choof’; he told him that he was a dead c*** and hung up; Uresh persisted that he wanted to come over and your client concluded, based on Uresh’s insistence, that Uresh’s plan was to kill him.”


	
	The applicant gave an account to Dr Allnutt of having first used cannabis at the age of 17 and having used it on a reasonably regular basis ever since. He had first used methamphetamines from about early 2012 and over the years had experimented with cocaine and speed.
	
	
	The applicant’s first contact with a psychiatrist was in 2000 when he had been admitted to Waratah House in Campbelltown for a drug induced psychosis. He was again admitted to Waratah House in August 2012. At the time of the offences he was receiving medication by way of Largactil and Endep.
	
	
	The life history given to Dr Allnutt indicated that there was nothing particularly significant about his early years at school, at university and in employment, although in relation to the latter he had lost jobs because of poor attendance as a consequence of drug and alcohol abuse.
	
	
	The applicant had had one serious relationship; with Rachel who he had met in 1996 and with whom he had a daughter. He told Dr Allnutt that he had broken up with her in late 2012.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt concluded that the applicant manifested (as at 19 March 2013) symptoms consistent with psychosis, characterised by persecutory delusions in which he believed that a number of people had been conspiring with Rachel to have him killed. In Dr Allnutt’s view the appropriate diagnosis was one of probable paranoid schizophrenia. Dr Allnutt also concluded that drug use had probably contributed to prior episodes of psychotic symptoms. Dr Allnutt stated:
	


“His functioning, in my view, at the time that he saw me was significantly impaired particularly in interpersonal relationships and social relationships as a consequence of ongoing unresolved psychotic symptoms despite the prescription of antipsychotic medication in the form of Solium and Largactil that he continued to take.”


	
	Dr Allnutt concluded that the applicant was fit to be tried but expressed the view that he would have available to him a defence of mental illness in that he had a defect of reason arising from his delusions and hallucinations causing him to make irrational interpretations of events that were occurring in his environment. He considered it unlikely that he would not have been able to understand the nature and quality of his actions but was severely compromised in his capacity to know the wrongfulness of those actions.
	
	
	The letter written by the offender was undated but bore a stamp from the Legal Aid office at Campbelltown dated 13 June 2013. It was addressed to the victim (Mr Uresh Mendis) and at the outset purported to “express my sorrow, remorse and regret over the incident that happened between us on the 5th of February this year”. It included, however, that the victim “obviously felt aggrieved enough to not tell the truth over what happened that day”, claiming that Mr Mendis had lied in his “statement of facts” (presumably his police statement). The letter continued by saying that, nevertheless, the applicant was sorry for his actions and hoped that Mr Mendis’ injuries had healed quickly. The applicant asked for forgiveness; acknowledged that their friendship was probably over; wished Mr Mendis “nothing but the best in life”; and concluded by restating that he was “sorry, remorseful and regretful”.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s second report of 1 November 2013 arose from a further interview with the applicant on 29 October 2013. Dr Allnutt augmented the history originally obtained from the applicant. This included that at the time of the offences he had been taking his prescribed medication irregularly. He told Dr Allnutt that his mental state had changed in relation to what had occurred at the time of the offending. He now thought he may have been mistaken about things such as people chasing him with shotguns. He believed that his mental illness made him think that. He now understood that he had schizophrenia. At the time of the offences his thinking was irrational. He denied a continuing belief that there were any plots or conspiracies.
	
	
	The applicant also told Dr Allnutt that he had not attended any drug and alcohol counselling in prison; he had had a positive urine test a month before (but claimed that there was an innocent explanation which the judge doubted); and that he had continued taking his medications. The applicant said that he believed he needed his medications as they kept him normal; he had continued seeing a psychiatrist; and he had no interest in taking drugs. He also said that he was receiving visits from his fiancé (Rachel), daughter and his parents.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s mental state examination was expressed in more positive terms than previously but included, “there were probably some residual symptoms of psychosis related to prior delusional experiences”.
	
	
	Although Dr Allnutt remained of the opinion of the applicant’s psychiatric illness as expressed in his original report, he added that “there has been amelioration in his symptoms from the time that I first saw him, likely secondary to antipsychotic medication”.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s second report was prepared for the purpose of sentence proceedings; the applicant had entered a plea of guilty and had thereby abandoned any reliance upon a defence of mental illness. Dr Allnutt included in this report his opinion that the applicant’s “mental illness made a significant contribution to his offending”. He recommended that the applicant continue to follow up with a psychiatrist on a regular basis; take antipsychotic and mood stabilising medication; abstain from substances absolutely; and pursue formal drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
	
	
	The applicant’s father’s oral evidence included that he remained supportive of his son and visited him weekly. He said that he had noticed signs of change in that he had become “just more like his old self”. He said that he had discussed the offences with the applicant and had been told “that he’s extremely remorseful for his actions”. The judge intervened at that point and asked whether the applicant had in fact used the term “remorseful”, and Mr McVittie confirmed that he had. The applicant’s counsel asked for detail of what the applicant had said and he replied, “I think at first he couldn’t understand he had done what he did and the remorse and regret was there for what had happened because they [the applicant and the victim] had been friends”. Mr McVittie also said, “he’s a bit worried about the harm he had inflicted on [the victim]. Still at times he couldn’t believe that he had done that”.
	
	
	Relevantly to two of the grounds of appeal, counsel for the applicant submitted to the sentencing judge that “there are some guarded yet not unrealistic prospects for rehabilitation”. On the question of remorse, counsel sought to meet an anticipated objection by the Crown to the admissibility of the applicant’s letter by referring his Honour to Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; 209 A Crim R 297 and Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1. Both of those authorities were relied upon for the proposition that to establish remorse for the purpose of the provision in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act an offender does not have to give oral evidence. In the course of making that submission, counsel acknowledged that it was a question of the weight that might be given to the evidence when it does not come directly via oral evidence from an offender.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant appeared in this Court without legal representation. He had filed a document headed Grounds of Appeal and another document headed Submissions. He supplemented those by making oral submissions at the hearing of the application. The grounds of appeal raise three issues:
	


1.   The judge erred by regarding the applicant as having no chance of rehabilitation.

2.   The judge erred by taking into account that the applicant was still psychotic at the time of sentencing and presented a danger to the community.

3.   The judge erred by not accepting that the applicant was remorseful.


	
	The starting point in the assessment of each of the grounds of appeal is to recognise that this Court’s authority to intervene depends upon error having been established in the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Lacey v Attorney General (Qld) [2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573 at [11]-[12]; Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [35].
	
	
	The second point to note is that error in the original sentencing exercise cannot be established by reference to events or circumstances that have subsequently arisen. If facts did not exist at the time of sentencing it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account: Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [110] (Simpson J).
	
	
	A third matter to note is that, generally speaking, the court may take into account “fresh” evidence (evidence of which the applicant was unaware and could not have obtained with reasonable diligence) where it might have affected the outcome of the case; or in other words, where the applicant can show a miscarriage of justice occurred in the sentence proceedings: R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377-378; R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328. This is as opposed to “new” evidence, being evidence which was available at the time of sentencing and could have been obtained with reasonable diligence but was not used: Khoury v R at [107].
	
	
	I have referred to these matters because, in a large part, the applicant’s case in this Court depended upon it being prepared to receive a report of his treating psychiatrist, Dr Andrew White, dated 20 November 2014. The report includes reference to the applicant’s treatment within the custodial environment prior to sentence but also subsequent to sentence. The applicant’s case on sentence in the District Court was presented on the basis that he had a significant mental illness which bore upon his offending behaviour. The issue was well known and was dealt with by way of obtaining and tendering the two reports of Dr Allnutt to which I have referred. In my view, no case has been made for this Court to receive and take into account the further report by Dr White, both as to events prior to sentencing and subsequent.
	


Grounds 1 and 2


	
	Questions of rehabilitation prospects and of whether the applicant was still subject to psychosis at the time of sentencing were overlapping considerations in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and so it is appropriate to deal with these two grounds together.
	
	
	The judge reviewed the evidence in detail before announcing various findings. They included that ""there is no real evidence before me of any genuine desire in the offender to permanently abstain from consumption of illicit drugs""; ""there is a real connection between the offender's continued use of prohibited drugs and his psychotic state""; and that ""there is no substantial evidence that his thinking is significantly less delusional now than it was at the time of the commission of the offence"".
	
	
	The judge noted that the applicant had been taking psychiatric medication in custody but noted an absence in Dr Allnutt's second report of any prognosis as to his future mental health. He noted as well that Dr Allnutt had referred to ""amelioration"" in the applicant’s symptoms since seeing him earlier in the year but noted that this did not amount to a finding that they had ceased. He had earlier noted Dr Allnutt's view that ""there were probably some residual symptoms of psychosis related to prior delusional experiences"".
	
	
	The judge also said that there was ""little or no evidence of any real insight by the offender"". He found the applicant was not genuinely remorseful; he was not confident about the applicant's rehabilitation; and he would not make any finding that he was unlikely to re-offend. The judge immediately proceeded to say that the applicant may well re-offend and that he represented a ""real danger to the community"".
	
	
	One of the reasons the judge considered that the applicant remained delusional at the time of sentencing was that additional aspects of his account of the offences provided at the second interview with Dr Allnutt included claiming that the victim attempted to take up a knife and a hammer, and at one point tried to get the applicant to stab himself with the knife the applicant was holding. The judge said that these claims were ""patently untrue"" and showed that the applicant was ""still in a significantly delusional state"".
	
	
	The judge acknowledged that in the second report the applicant was recorded as having said that he ""might have been mistaken about Grant, Justin and Johnny chasing him with shotguns"" and believing that his mental illness had made him say this. But his Honour found it significant that nowhere in Dr Allnutt's second report was there anything reportedly said by the applicant about realising that his actions towards Mr Mendis, the victim, were inappropriate, entirely without justification, seriously criminal, or regretted.
	


Consideration of the applicant's submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the judge was wrong to have found that he had ""no chance of rehabilitation"". That is not quite what the judge said. He said that he was ""not confident"" about the applicant's rehabilitation. However, he also said that he ""represents a real danger to the community"".
	
	
	To establish that these findings were wrong, it is necessary for the applicant to establish that the findings could not be justified on the evidence that was before the judge. In other words, they were findings that were simply not open to be made on that evidence. I have used the italics to emphasise to the applicant that the report of Dr White cannot be taken into account by this Court for the reasons given earlier. It is necessary for the applicant to establish that the judge misdirected himself, misapplied some principle, took into account something that was irrelevant, or made a finding that had no basis in the evidence: see, for example, R v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50; R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397; and AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 339 at [44]-[55].
	
	
	There was nothing wrong in the judge's assessment of Dr Allnutt's second report. The doctor did not state that the applicant was free of psychosis at the time of his second consultation which occurred in the month prior to the sentence hearing; simply that his symptoms had abated, or ameliorated. The doctor had also specifically noted that there were still some ""residual symptoms"". Moreover, it was open to the judge to characterise the false statements about the victim's conduct that the applicant had added to his version of events as being the product of a continued delusional state.
	
	
	With those findings being open to the judge, it followed that it was also open to his Honour to be dubious about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. In turn, and having regard to the seriously violent nature of the detention and assault of Mr Mendis, it was open to the judge to consider that the applicant presented a danger to the community.
	
	
	The applicant sought in his submissions to contrast the negative findings of the sentencing judge in his case to another case (identifying details of which were not provided) where ""a fellow prisoner with a 45 page criminal record was deemed a good chance of rehabilitation"". That may seem unfair to a person in the applicant's position, not having any apparent training in the law, but it reflects the fact that the factual matrix of every case is unique. It reflects the fact that sentencing is a complex task involving the exercise of an individual judge's discretionary judgment. It also reflects the notion that justice is individualised in that a finding of fact in one case might be warranted whereas similar evidence in another case might, because of its different context, warrant a different, or no, finding.
	
	
	I can discern no appellable error in relation to either issue raised by the applicant under grounds 1 and 2.
	


Ground 3


	
	The applicant relied upon his letter written in June 2013 and the evidence of his father as justifying a finding that he was remorseful. He submitted that it was wrong for the sentencing judge to have found that he was not remorseful.
	
	
	Again, this is a challenge to a finding of fact and what the applicant must establish is that it was simply not open to the judge to make the finding or that there was some error in the judge’s process of reasoning that led to it.
	
	
	The applicant's counsel in the District Court was quite open in conceding that, in the absence of oral evidence by the applicant, it was a matter for the judge to assess what weight he should give to the letter. That was clearly a matter for the judge's discretion. As it turned out, he gave it no weight at all. That was open to him because whilst it purported to express to Mr Mendis the applicant's ""sorrow, remorse and regret"" it also accused him of being a liar. The judge was also critical of the letter referring to the applicant having thought that Mr Mendis was coming to kill the applicant; and that it used a substantial understatement by referring to ""the incident that happened between us"", when by ""incident"" the applicant was referring to what the judge called ""a savage, sustained, one-way attack"".
	
	
	The applicant's father's evidence that the applicant was ""extremely remorseful for his actions"" was not required to be accepted by his Honour. He had the benefit, as this Court has not, of having seen and heard Mr McVittie give evidence. Counsel for the applicant made no submission to the judge about whether or not the judge should accept it.
	
	
	I can discern no error in the judge's approach on this issue.
	


Was the sentence manifestly excessive?


	
	Given the applicant is not legally represented it is appropriate to consider a broader question of whether the sentence is manifestly excessive even absent a ground complaining as such. A sentence will fit this description if it is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].
	
	
	The offence for which the applicant was sentenced was a very serious one. So too was the further offence he asked the judge to take into account.
	
	
	The judge made findings in the applicant's favour that his moral culpability and the need for general deterrence were of less significance and that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon him on account of his mental illness. On the other hand it was necessary for the judge to punish the applicant for the serious harm, both physical and psychological, that he occasioned to his innocent victim, to personally deter him and to protect the community.
	
	
	For a person who had not previously been to gaol a sentence of five and a half years with a non-parole period of almost three and a half years is a stern imposition. However, having regard to the fact that the offences involved a sustained and violent attack upon an innocent man after the applicant lured him to his home, I am unable to see anything unreasonable or unjust in the outcome.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	WILSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

		13 May 2015",2015-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766598,Cumberworth v Parole Authority of NSW [2015] NSWSC 538,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By application filed on 31 October 2014 Nigel Cumberworth (the applicant) sought that a direction under s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act) be given to the respondent, the State Parole Authority (the Authority), that the information on which the Authority based its decision that the applicant should not be released on parole was misleading and irrelevant. No other relief was sought. All references in these reasons to statutory provisions are to the Act unless otherwise indicated.
	
	
	Although the application was directed at the Authority’s decision made on 31 July 2014, that ‘decision’ was the formation of an initial ‘intention’ to refuse parole. It was common ground that the operative decision to refuse parole was made by the Authority on 28 August 2014. The documentation before the Authority was, on each occasion, substantially the same.
	
	
	A further application was filed in this Court on 17 December 2014. This second application was, in substance, a complaint about the applicant’s security classification within the prison system, which is not a matter determined by the Authority and does not fall within s 155. Mr Crowley, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, confirmed that it ought be treated as a submission rather than as a separate application.
	
	
	The Authority has filed a submitting appearance, save as to costs. To ensure that there is a contradictor, the Attorney-General, for whom Mr Kell appeared, was granted leave to intervene in the proceedings. The Attorney-General did not seek costs.
	
	
	Before setting out the background facts and addressing the grounds of the application, I propose to set out the statutory framework and the relevant principles that apply to an application under s 155.
	


The statutory framework


	
	Part 6 of the Act deals with “Parole”. Section 126 provides that “Offenders may be released on parole in accordance with this Part.” Section 132 confirms that the offender’s sentence continues to run while the offender is on parole. Division 2 of Part 6 deals with “Parole orders for sentences of more than 3 years”. Section 135(1) provides that the Authority must not make a parole order unless satisfied that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest. Section 135(2) sets out criteria to which the Authority must have regard when considering whether it is so satisfied, including the following:
	


(a)    the need to protect the safety of the community,

(b)    the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice,

(c)    the nature and circumstances of the offence to which the offender’s sentence relates,

(d)    any relevant comments made by the sentencing court,

(e)    the offender’s criminal history,

(f)    the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life,

(g)    the likely effect on any victim of the offender, and on any such victim’s family, of the offender being released on parole,

(h)    any report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service, as referred to in section 135A,

(i)    any other report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Review Council, the Commissioner or any other authority of the State,

…”


	
	Section 135(3) of the Act provides that, except in “exceptional circumstances”, the Authority must not make a parole order for a serious offender unless the Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC) advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole. The term “serious offender” is defined by s 3(1) of the Act to include offenders (such as the applicant) who have been convicted of murder or who are serving a life sentence. Section 135A sets out the matters to be addressed in a report by the Probation and Parole Service for the purposes of s 135(2)(h), including the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life (s 135A(a)); the risk of the offender re-offending while on release on parole, and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk (s 135A(b)); the offender’s attitude to the offence to which his or her sentence relates (s 135A(d)); the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs, and the success or otherwise of his or her participation in such programs (s 135A(e)).
	
	
	Subdivision 3 of Division 2 of Part 6 deals with “Serious offenders”. Section 143 provides that, except as otherwise provided, the Authority must consider the question of parole at least 60 days before the date on which the offender first becomes eligible for release on parole (the “parole eligibility date”). The applicant first became eligible for parole on 4 April 2010.
	
	
	Section 143A deals with consideration of parole in subsequent years and provides:
	


143A Consideration of parole in subsequent years

(1)    At any time within 90 days before an offender’s annual review date, the offender, if still eligible for release on parole, may apply to be released on parole.

(1A) For the purposes of this section, an offender’s annual review date occurs on each anniversary of the offender’s parole eligibility date.

(2) After receiving such an application, but not more than 60 days before the offender’s annual review date, the Parole Authority must consider whether or not the offender should be released on parole.

(3) Despite subsection (2):

   …

(c) in any case, the Parole Authority may decline to consider an offender’s case for up to 3 years at a time after it last considered the grant of parole to the offender.


	
	Section 144 provides:
	


Formulation of Parole Authority’s initial intention

On or immediately after giving its preliminary consideration as to whether or not a serious offender should be released on parole, the Parole Authority must formulate and record its initial intention either:

(a) to make a parole order in relation to the offender, or

(b) not to make such a parole order.


	
	Section 146 provides for notice to be given to a serious offender of the Authority’s intention to refuse parole. Section 148 provides for the principles on which the Authority’s final decision is to be made.
	
	
	Section 155 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


155 Application to Supreme Court by offender

(1) If:

(a)    the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and

(b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information,

the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.

(2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit.

(3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.

(4) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority’s decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1).


	
	Section 155 does not provide a form of appeal from a decision refusing parole. The Court, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 155, does not concern itself with the merits of a decision or with the weight to be placed on the factors the Authority has to consider in arriving at its decision: S v New South Wales Parole Authority [2007] NSWSC 1287 at [9], [15] per Barr J. Before a direction can be made under s 155, information must be identified that is false, misleading or irrelevant and, it must be shown that the decision was based on that information: R v Naudi [2003] NSWCCA 160 per Simpson J at [19] (Hodgson JA and James J agreeing).
	


Background facts


	
	The applicant is presently in custody in Bathurst Correctional Centre, serving a life sentence for murder with a non-parole period of 13 years, which commenced on 4 April 1997. He committed the offence on 1 February 1997, with another offender, Juma. The victim resided at a flat near the home of a woman whom the applicant and Juma were visiting. The applicant used a knife to gash the victim’s stomach, cut his penis, stab his scrotum, and cut him across his throat.
	
	
	In the sentencing remarks delivered on 25 November 1998, MacKenzie J described the offence as a “brutal and terrible crime” and the savagery of the attack as “beyond comprehension”. His Honour said:
	


“Because of the horrific nature of the crime, when the authorities come to consider your case, many years from now, I hope that they make absolutely certain that neither of you is a danger to the public before any decision is made that you be released into the community.”


	
	The applicant’s appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed on 16 July 1999: The Queen v Cumberworth [1999] QCA 249. In June 2006, after a period of custody in Queensland, he was transferred to New South Wales in order to be closer to his family.
	
	
	The applicant first became eligible for parole on 4 April 2010. As he was convicted of murder and was serving a sentence for life he was a “serious offender”. At no time has SORC advised the Authority that it is appropriate for the applicant to be released on parole.
	
	
	The applicant’s first application for parole was refused, as were further applications made between 2010 and 2013. On 22 May 2014 the applicant notified the Authority that he was seeking consideration for parole for possible release in 2014. On 6 June 2014 the Authority published a notice indicating that his parole application would be considered on 31 July 2014 and stating that reports (from Community Corrections and SORC) were required by 21 July 2014. On 31 July 2014, as required by ss 143C and 144 of the Act, the Authority met to give preliminary consideration to the application.
	
	
	The documents which the Authority had before it on 31 July 2014 included the applicant’s criminal history in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, MacKenzie J’s sentencing remarks and the Queensland Court of Appeal judgment, various reports from psychologists, reports from Community Corrections (Probation & Parole Service), correspondence from the applicant, and reports from SORC. Neither SORC nor Community Corrections supported his release on parole. The SORC report dated 8 July 2014 contained the following passage:
	


“Council notes the report dated 27 June 2014 from Senior Community Correctional Officer, Cheryl Robinson and agrees that the inmate requires a period of time in various external leave programs and further agrees that the inmate’s participation in the VOTP program and willingness to participate in the Weekend Leave program has oscillated.

Council has a further concern raised in a report dated 4 June 2014 from June Wong, Psychologist, VOTP, in her VOTP treatment report, that where the offender acknowledges his mental health issues and says he is compliant with his medication, a urinalysis test made while on the program did not detect the presence of such medication.

Council advises that until the issues of the external leave programs are resolved it is not appropriate to grant parole.”


	
	The Authority formed an initial intention to refuse parole. It notified the applicant of its intention. It recorded its reasons as follows:
	


“Needs to further address offending behaviour (General) [needs to complete program(s) that address alcohol and other drugs problems], need for post release plans [structured post release plans in the community], need for post release accommodation [no suitable post release accommodation], needs to participate in the external leave program and SORC advised that it is not appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.”


	
	After listing the material the Authority had considered, the notice continued as follows:
	


“Material Facts

Offender is now 38 years old and is serving a life sentence for the stabbing and violent murder of a male victim in the company of a co-offender that occurred when he was 19 years old.

Started Ngara Nura in January 2012 and was removed 23 July 2012 given disruptive behaviour.

Was found unsuitable for the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program.

Offender completed Getting SMART in 2008 and CALM in 2010.

Commenced the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP) in August 2010 and finalised the assessment and readiness phase in December 2010.

In January 2012 was discharged from the VOTP given threats he made to the life of an officer and has since been referred to the Serious Offenders Assessment Unit (SOAU).

In April 2014, the offender completed the VOTP and has been attending VOTP Maintenance and SMART Recovery.

Is purported to be on medication for schizophrenia, however, this is not being found in urinalysis testing.

Does not have approved accommodation or post release plans.

Consideration of matters in s135

Offender received a life sentence for murder

Sentencing judge started, “The injuries which were inflicted on (the victim) were quite horrible and the savagery with which the attack must have been pursued is something that is really beyond comprehension.”

Sentencing judge stated, “Because of the horrific nature of the crime, when the authorities come to consider your case, many years from now, I hope that they make absolutely certain that neither of you is a danger to the public before any decision is made that you be released to the community”.

Offender needs to participate in external leave programs to assist with reintegration into the community and develop a structured post release plan upon release.

Community Corrections and the Serious Offenders Review Council do not support release to parole at this time.

Critical issues

SORC have advised that release to parole is not appropriate at this time. Offender needs to work towards reintegration into the community through external leave program and appropriate post release plans. The offender would also benefit from continued attendance at AOD programs.

Conclusion

Unless the offender can demonstrate that exceptional circumstances exist, the Authority cannot form an intention to grant parole until such time as SORC advise release to parole is appropriate. The offender is currently serving a life sentence for murder and entered custody at a young age. The offender would benefit from continued participation in AOD program and participation in external leave programs.”


	
	On 14 August 2014 the applicant applied to the Authority for a hearing to review its intention to refuse parole. At its meeting on 28 August 2014 the Authority determined that a review hearing was not warranted, reconsidered its initial intention to refuse parole and determined to refuse parole. In its written Determination of the same date, the Authority said:
	


“The State Parole Authority is not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest.”


	
	The Notice stated that parole was refused for the reasons as stated on 31 July 2014, which were repeated in the Notice. The Notice further stated that, in deciding that the release of the offender was not appropriate in the public interest, the Authority had regard to the matters then specified in the Notice. These matters were, in substance, the same as those in the Notice set out above.
	


The grounds of the application


	
	In support of his application under s 155, the applicant relied on three instances of allegedly misleading information and three instances of allegedly irrelevant information. These will be considered in turn.
	


Alleged misleading information (1): alleged failure to continue VOTP programs


	
	The applicant alleged that the Authority was misleading in painting him in an unfavourable light in its Determination of 28 August 2014 by relying on his failure to continue VOTP maintenance programs when his non-attendance was the result of illness and other matters outside his control such as correctional centre operational requirements; and he had undertaken to continue the maintenance program while in the community.
	
	
	The Determination relevantly states:
	


“[The Applicant] Commenced the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP) in August 2010 and finished the assessment and readiness phase in December 2010.

In January 2012 was discharged from the VOTP given threats he made to the life of an officer and has since been referred to the Serious Offenders Assessment Unit (SOAU).

In April 2014, the offender completed the VOPT and has been attending VOTP Maintenance and Smart Recovery.”


	
	The Determination not only does not contain the allegedly misleading information, but also it records that the applicant had in fact completed VOPT and had been attending the maintenance program. This ground is not made out.
	


Alleged misleading information (2): alleged lack of completion of an External Leave Program


	
	The applicant accepted that he had not completed an External Leave Program but contended that he had been unable to do so because of his security classification. He submitted that he had not been charged with institutional misconduct since 14 January 2014 and that there were no adverse case notes in the Community Corrections pre-release report of 31 July 2014.
	
	
	Whether an applicant for parole has engaged in pre-release leave is relevant to the decision whether to grant parole since it is germane to readiness and suitability for release into the community. The Pre-release report dated 17 July 2014 prepared by Cheryl Robinson of Community Corrections stated:
	


“Given the length of time that Mr Cumberworth has spent in custody to date, Community Corrections considers it imperative that he participate in all aspects of the external leave program, including work release and day/weekend leaves in order to assist him with his long term reintegration.”


	
	This ground is not made out since no “information” that could be said to be “misleading” has been identified.
	


Alleged misleading information (3): the applicant’s removal from the Ngara Nura program


	
	The third matter relied on by the applicant is a reference in the Determination, under the sub-heading of ‘material facts’, to the applicant’s removal in 2012 from the Ngara Nura program, which is a custodial-based residential drug and alcohol treatment program. The material fact was that the applicant:
	


“Started Ngara Nura in January 2012 and was removed 23 July 2012 given disruptive behaviour”.


	
	This fact, which the applicant did not challenge, was established by material that was before the Authority, such as the Pre-release report of Ms Emma Albertini dated 25 January 2013, which stated:
	


“The offender commenced the Ngara Nura program in January 2012, perusal of the Offender Integrated Management System (OIMS) revealed Mr Cumberworth’s initial response to the program was considered good, noting a general positive attitude towards the program. However at the beginning of July 2012, there appeared to be a noted decline in the offender’s engagement and attitude within the program which coincided with Mr Cumberworth’s relapse into drug use. Subsequently he was removed from the program on 23 July 2012.”


	
	I reject the applicant’s contention that, as he had not been required to undertake the program, it was misleading to take into account that he had been removed from it. Moreover, there is no “information” that can properly be said to be “misleading” and, accordingly, the third matter is not a matter that could properly be the subject of a direction under s 155 of the Act.
	


Alleged irrelevant information (1): that the applicant has not provided post-release plans


	
	The applicant contended that the fact in the Determination that “post release plans have not been provided by the applicant” was irrelevant since he had previously provided details of post-release accommodation and employment, including employment with a Mr Kevin Sullivan at Adaptable Plant Hire Cronulla which he provided by letter dated 21 July 2009.
	
	
	In its Determination dated 28 August 2014, the Authority referred to the “need for post release plans [structured post release plans in the community], [and the] need for post release accommodation [no suitable post release accommodation]”.
	
	
	The Community Corrections report dated 17 July 2014 recorded that the applicant refused to sign a release of information form that would permit its staff to make third party enquiries to verify some of the information reported by the applicant, including in respect of employment and other post-release support. The report referred to earlier contact which had been made with someone whom the applicant had identified as a potential employer and said:
	


“Due to the offender refusing to sign the release of information, it is unknown if indeed this work continues to be available to Mr Cumberworth.”


	
	The report addressed the extent of the applicant’s assistance in the preparation of the report as follows:
	


“During preparation of this report, Mr Cumberworth presented as somewhat disinterested in the process; citing that he had other things he needed to do which included eating his breakfast. His refusal to sign the release of information form, advising that he did not give consent for Community Corrections to make third party enquiries as he was not going to be “trapped” again, has hampered any ability to confirm some of the limited information he provided. His demonstrated [resistance] to engage with Community Corrections is concerning and raises the question about his willingness long term to work with his staff who will be involved in preparing him to return to the community.”


	
	The report noted that a pre-release home visit (with a view to considering the suitability of proposed post-release accommodation) had not been undertaken
	


“at this juncture as a result of the length of time that he has spent in custody and the previous recommendations by the Authority. It is evident that the offender will need to participate in the external leave program, amongst other things, prior to receiving a positive recommendation towards release to parole.”


	
	The applicant has not established that there was any such “information” about his post-release plans that was “irrelevant” for the purposes of s 155 or that any such information was (wrongly) acted upon by the Authority. This ground of complaint has not been made out.
	


Alleged irrelevant information (2): failure to test positive for prescribed medication


	
	The applicant alleged that the SORC report dated 8 July 2014 described him as failing to test positive for antipsychotic medication that had been prescribed for schizophrenia as follows:
	


“Council has a further concern raised in a report dated 4 June 2014 from June Wong, Psychologist, VOTP, in her VOTP treatment report, that where the offender acknowledges his mental health issues and says he is compliant with his medication, a urinalysis test made while on the program did not detect the presence of such medication.”


	
	He did not contend that the SORC report (which was supported by the VOTP treatment report) was not accurate in this respect. He emphasised that (as is apparent from the wording of the report) this conclusion was based on a single failed urine test on 10 December 2013. He submitted that this information was irrelevant and that the Authority acted on the basis of it in refusing his application for parole.
	
	
	Whether the applicant was compliant with anti-psychotic medication was plainly relevant to the determination whether parole ought be granted since his underlying condition (schizophrenia) could lead to further offending on release if not adequately controlled by medication. This ground has not been made out.
	


Alleged irrelevant information (3): the applicant’s need to address further his offending behaviour


	
	The applicant contended that the statement in the Determination that he “needs to further address offending behaviour (General)” was irrelevant. He submitted that the SORC report did not canvas any issues of offensive behaviour and, indeed, contained a reference to an absence of offences in custody.
	
	
	I accept Mr Kell’s submission that this ground misapprehended the Authority’s remarks. The relevant passage in the following terms referred to the applicant needing further to:
	


“address offending behaviour (General) [needs to complete program(s) that address alcohol and other drug problems]…”


	
	I am satisfied that the phrase “offending conduct” was a reference to the murder and other crimes which the applicant had committed before his incarceration and was not intended to include fighting or violence while in custody. The recommendation of the SORC report was that the underlying causes of the offending conduct could be further addressed: for example, by participation, or continued participation, in the VOTP maintenance program and drug and alcohol programs. The extent to which the applicant could properly be regarded as having addressed his offending behaviour was plainly a relevant matter for the Authority to consider. In any event, there was no “information” identified that was “irrelevant” and to which regard was had by the Authority. Accordingly, it is not a matter for a direction under s 155.
	


Section 155(3) considerations


	
	Section 153(3) provides that this Court is only to consider an application under s 155 if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. In order to determine whether the application is an abuse of process and whether there appears to be sufficient evidence to support it, it has been necessary for me to consider each of the grounds of the application. Although I am persuaded that none of the grounds has been made out and that the application ought be dismissed, I was obliged to consider it because I was satisfied that it was not an abuse of process, although there was insufficient evidence to support it.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following order:
	



	
	Application dismissed.

2766605,R v Kettule [2015] NSWDC 202,"Judgment


	
	When a security guard, as part of his job, responded to a call to the commercial premises he was responsible for on the night of Sunday 4 December 2011, he found the chain securing the property had been cut through with bolt cutters. He saw a car parked in the driveway. No one was supposed to be there. Wisely he asked his headquarters to contact the police. Bravely he got out of his own car and approached the car, which was by that stage moving towards him. A man approached him and said “Reverse the car or I will fucking kill ya.” He was then told to get into his car and get of there, which sensibly he did. The other car drove away.
	
	
	The police were quick on the scene and they stopped the car. There were four men inside. There were also items which were from the premises that had been broken into. The police arrested all four men.
	
	
	One of the men they arrested was Amar Kettule. I am sentencing him this afternoon. The three other men have already been sentenced. Two of them were sentenced by his Honour Judge Norrish QC on 15 November 2012. The fourth man was sentenced on 14 March 2014 in the Local Court. To a criminal lawyer those circumstances mean that the principle of parity in sentencing looms large. That means that - all other things being equal - like offenders should be alike.
	
	
	Before dealing with that, I should record that the offence each man was charged with is break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstances of aggravation were that they were in company at the time. That is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament obviously regards it as a serious offence because it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to the crime. If I have not already done so, I formally convict Amar Kettule of that offence.
	
	
	It is important in sentencing an offender to record not only what happened, which I have briefly described, but to record personal information about the offender. Both are relevant to the sentencing judge. What happened and the role of the offender the judge is sentencing is important. Some activity can be a more or less serious example of the same crime. In other words, one offender may be more involved in the committing of the same crime than another offender. That will become relevant in this case. Personal information extends not only to an offender’s background and personal circumstances but also to their criminal record.
	
	
	In this case, Mr Kettule already has a significant criminal record. He has lots of convictions for traffic offences but, significantly, also a conviction for supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. For that he received a custodial sentence of two years and nine months. Not only that, he has a conviction for a specially aggravated commit serious indictable offence and break out with a weapon. For that offence he also received a prison sentence of two years and nine months. He also was convicted of driving recklessly a few months before committing the offence that I am sentencing him for. The magistrate sentenced him to four months imprisonment for that offence but on appeal to this court he received a good behaviour bond. Significantly, the offence that I am sentencing him for - which as I have said, occurred on 4 December 2011 - happened about a week after he had received a good behaviour bond from the District Court on appeal from the gaol sentence imposed by the magistrate.
	
	
	That brings me to another circumstance about Mr Kettule and his behaviour. When he committed this offence on 4 December 2011, not only was he under the good behaviour bond imposed by the District Court a week earlier but he was still on parole for the two more serious offences that he received the prison sentences for. I mention those two factors - namely his criminal record and the fact that he was on conditional liberty when he committed this crime - because the sentencing law provides that those two factors are aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. I should add that after he was arrested he spent a day in custody but a week or so later, the parole he was serving was revoked and he spent a good amount of time in custody at the end of 2011 and in 2012 serving out the balance of his parole which he had breached.
	
	
	On the personal side, Mr Kettule is now 28. So he is still a relatively young man. He pleaded guilty to this offence in circumstances that I will return to. He was born in Iraq and moved to New Zealand in 1994, migrating to Sydney with his family in 2001. His parents have medical conditions, including post‑traumatic stress disorder suffered by his father and diabetes suffered by his mother. A significant and tragic event in the family’s history occurred on 26 January 2014 when Mr Kettule’s brother was murdered. A forensic psychologist whom Mr Kettule saw for the purposes of an assessment and it seems, for treatment, Mr Stephen Woods, diagnosed Mr Kettule with a number of conditions, including a persistent complex bereavement disorder and post‑traumatic stress disorder. He had what the psychologist described as ‘survivor guilt.’ Mr Woods provided a report dated 1 October 2014. Mr Woods also noted a history of drug use and drug dependency which Mr Woods noted was in remission. He also noted an earlier binge drinking alcohol disorder also in remission. Mr Woods recommended that Mr Kettule undertake a structured treatment regime and attached to his report a plan. In a more recent report dated 7 May 2015, Mr Woods regrettably said little about the treatment but expressed the opinion that based on “Mr Kettule’s current mental state and stable circumstances I am of the opinion that he does not require further treatment or monitoring by a clinician.”
	
	
	The crime was committed some years ago now and part of Mr Kettule’s case in mitigation is to point to progress he has made over that period of time. For some time he has been assisting in a family hospitality business and managing that facility, but more recently has set up his own mechanical and electrical repair business for motor vehicles. Exhibit 2 comprises the documents which are relevant to that business. A presentence report prepared on 1 December last year noted that Mr Kettule “has the benefit of a positive and supportive family network and employment background. It would appear the offender’s association was a significant factor in contributing to his offending behaviour.” The report confirmed the personal circumstances which I have referred to about Mr Kettule.
	
	
	The reference to Mr Kettule’s ‘offending behaviour’ reminds me that I need to say something about that. As I said earlier, an important question is the role that a particular offender played in the offence. In this case there were four criminals involved in the same crime. The case made out by senior counsel for Mr Kettule, Mr Greg James QC, emphasises the reduced role which his client had in this particular crime compared to one or two of the others. Mr James QC’s submissions are borne out by the evidence. There is no evidence in the prosecution case against Mr Kettule that he was the person who uttered the threat to the security guard that night. The car being used by the offenders did not belong to Mr Kettule, nor did a trailer which was attached to the car. One or two of the other offenders were involved in the scrap metal industry and the items which had been stolen from the premises were relevant to their business. Mr James submitted, and I accept, that the “circumstances of this offender’s conduct show a significantly limited culpability when compared to his co-offenders.”
	
	
	Mr Kettule’s account is that he was getting a lift with these men to his then girlfriend’s place. He did not know when he joined the car that their intention was to commit the crime. His error was in doing nothing but going along when it became apparent what the other offenders were doing. Mr James QC called his client to give evidence on the first occasion before me and his client’s verified evidence supports that. Mr Kettule has the benefit of the principles of criminal law which provide that in sentencing a person, the judge cannot take into account anything which might aggravate the offence unless the judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. There are a number of factors which ,to my mind, would suggest that Mr Kettule’s involvement in this offence were not as innocent as he claims. It would surprise me that an offender such as Mr Kettule with his criminal record which included this kind of crime and being on parole and a good behaviour bond found himself innocently mixed up with the wrong crowd. Not only that, the reference from his then girlfriend whom he was visiting says this -
	


“It is my understanding that on the night of his arrest Amar and I had made plans to see each other, he had organised to get dropped off to my house located in Croydon Park by a few of his friends. Unfortunately, Amar never showed.”

I note she put it no higher than her “understanding.”


	
	Nevertheless, the other evidence pointed to by Mr James of his client not owning the vehicles, nor being involved in the activity and the confirmation by his then partner that she expected his visit mean that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his involvement in this crime was any greater than that submitted on his behalf by Mr James QC. That is a significant finding because it will become very relevant shortly when I come to consider the question of parity in sentencing between him and the other offenders.
	
	
	In their helpful written submissions Mr James QC, his junior counsel Mr Evan James and his solicitor Mr Zemarai Khatiz fairly acknowledge the aggravating factors which apply to their client - his previous convictions and the fact that he was on conditional liberty - but they also point out that some of the aggravating factors which might at first glance seem to be relevant do not apply in this case. I accept the submission set out by them over pp 3 and 4 of their written submissions which are contained in exhibit 1. In addition, they point to factors which they argue are mitigating factors. I accept that Mr Kettule has demonstrated his remorse. I am disinclined to conclude that he is unlikely to reoffend. I am hoping that the progress he has made in the last few years will mean that he does not reoffend but it would be unrealistic for a judge to regard a person with Mr Kettule’s criminal record and who has committed a further crime whilst on conditional liberty to be “unlikely to reoffend.” I think Mr Kettule’s prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. He has stayed out of trouble for some years and appears to have changed his life in the right direction. Again, I am hoping that the change will be permanent.
	
	
	I should add here that Mr James also pointed out that so far as the offence itself was concerned the stolen items were returned to their owners. Their value, relatively speaking, was not very high. Mr Kettule had offered to pay compensation but that offer was not taken up.
	
	
	I turn now to the question of parity. As I said, Judge Norrish QC sentenced two of Mr Kettule’s co-offenders, a Mr Choban and a Mr Erarslan. On Mr Choban his Honour imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment and fixed a non-parole period of one and a half years. In respect of Mr Erarslan his Honour imposed a sentence of 22 months which his Honour then suspended. Mr Erarslan drove the car that the men were in and was also engaged in the business which was relevant to what was stolen. However, Judge Norrish QC found that Mr Erarslan was “less involved than that of the other three offenders.” In fact, I have erroneously said that he was involved in the business concerning what they were stealing. That is not the case. His Honour found that Mr Erarslan “had no prior connection with the scrap metal business.” He thought that he had become somewhat unwittingly involved in the criminal enterprise. His Honour found that Mr Erarslan “has no relevant criminal history.”
	
	
	His Honour went on to find, speaking of Mr Choban and Mr Erarslan, that whilst they were “involved in a joint criminal enterprise, they are not equally morally culpable for the crime that they have admitted to.” His Honour found, regarding Mr Choban, that he “took a leading role in the commission of the offence.” Mr Choban had a criminal record but had not served any time in gaol. There were a number of drug related possession offences and other offences dealt with in the Local Court. This was his first serious offence. It is relevant also to observe his Honour’s finding that the criminality of the overall offending was “below that of the midrange of criminality for offences of this type.” His Honour acknowledged that the value of the stolen goods being $5,000 whilst “not insubstantial, in the scheme of offences involving commercial break‑ins I have seen over the years, was relatively modest.” Mr Choban did have a business interest in the items which were stolen.
	
	
	The fourth offender is a Mr Romel who was dealt with not by the Local Court as I had earlier said, but in this Court. Mr Romel received a prison sentence of two years which was also suspended. The remarks on sentence are not available.
	
	
	Mr James QC focussed on the sentence which had been imposed on Mr Choban. His focus was well placed. Mr James QC pointed out that his client had a significantly less significant role in the crime than Mr Choban. He also pointed out correctly that Mr Kettule had demonstrated a lot more towards his rehabilitation than had Mr Choban. In fact, Judge Norrish QC found Mr Choban an unacceptable witness. On the other hand, Mr Kettule’s criminal record is worse than Mr Choban's, although Judge Norrish did describe Mr Choban’s record, which I have referred to, as one “of some length.” Mr Choban was not on conditional liberty, unlike Mr Kettule. His Honour fixed four years imprisonment as the starting point for Mr Choban’s sentence.
	
	
	Mr James’ argument was that his client’s sentence should be somewhat less than that. In my opinion Mr James has made out his case. Relevant in particular are three things. One is the overall assessment of the crime as being towards the lower end of objective seriousness. Second is the acknowledged less significant role in the commission of the offence of Mr Kettule. Third is Mr Kettule’s stronger subjective or personal case so far as his efforts at rehabilitation are concerned.
	
	
	I would regard an appropriate starting point for Mr Kettule’s sentence as being one of three years and six months. In other words, the factors that I have referred to would result in a commencing assessment for a sentence some six months below that of Mr Choban's.
	
	
	Mr Choban had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and received for that a 25% discount in accordance with legal principle. Mr Kettule did not plead guilty at the earliest available opportunity. In fact he pleaded guilty on the occasion that the trial was listed for the fifth time. But again, Mr James QC took me through the history of the other listings. On one occasion it appeared that there was a conflict of interest so far as Mr Kettule’s representation was concerned resulting in the hearing date being vacated. On a second occasion, what was described as a medical issue - apparently Mr Kettule was assaulted and wounded - meant that he could not face his trial. On another occasion, his brother had been tragically murdered close to the time of the trial.
	
	
	Mr James QCs point was twofold. First, although the prosecution was not responsible for the adjournments they were events that occurred rather than initiated by his client. There is some force in that submission. The second point he made is that his client had used the intervening time to rehabilitate himself to a significant degree. I accept that submission as well.
	
	
	Indeed, relevant to this case are the factors referred to, as Mr James QC pointed out, in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 (at 519-520). These principles were adopted by the High Court of Australia in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64 ff. There has been a delay of some years in the sentencing proceedings in this case. The reason for the delay was connected with the offender but was not initiated by him. The High Court extracted, with approval, a passage from the judgment of Street CJ in Todd where his Honour had said at 519-520 -
	


“[W]here there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence…”

In the High Court their Honours acknowledged that these considerations not only apply to the fixing of a non-parole period, but also to the fixing of a head sentence. I gave weight to that factor, as well, in determining that an initial head sentence would be three years and six months for Mr Kettule.


	
	Mr Kettule, however, does not get the same benefit of the early plea entered by Mr Choban. As Howie J said in R v Borkowski (2009)195 A Crim R 1, with the specific agreement of McClellan CJ at CL, at 10 ([32]) -
	


“The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount.”

His Honour observed at the same paragraph that, generally speaking, “the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced.”


	
	In this case, however, there is an additional factor. The additional factor is the subject of confidential exhibit D. I have read that exhibit and taken it into account. I will ask my associate to seal that document and I have marked that it not be opened except by a District Court judge or a judge of a higher jurisdiction. Mr James submitted that his client should receive a combined discount, for his plea of guilty and under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, of some 40%. Mr C Bridge who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and whose submissions, I might add, were also very helpful, did not disagree with that assessment. To my mind that is a fair assessment for a joint discount, a combined discount in this case. I would therefore discount the initial sentence of three years and six months by 40% which produces a sentence of just over 25 months. I would be prepared to round that down to 24 months or two years imprisonment.
	
	
	Mr James QC placed reliance on s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides that a Court “must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.” He argued that I should either suspend the sentence or direct that his client be assessed for an intensive corrections order. I propose to adopt one of those alternatives.
	
	
	My reasons are that I accept the written submissions made on behalf of Mr Kettule to the effect that a sentence of full‑time custody “may nullify rehabilitation already achieved.” This is a case where the offender has used very well the time during which he has been waiting for his sentence to be imposed. Evidence suggests that he is not associating with people that might lead him to crime and, on the contrary, is engaged in the family business and in setting up his own business.
	
	
	I am hopeful that his rehabilitation will continue and that he will no longer need to appear before the criminal courts. As I said, I am realistic and experienced enough to know that that may not be realised but I am prepared to give Mr Kettule the benefit of the doubt and I think a case has been made out for him to serve his two year sentence other than in full-time custody.
	
	
	​I have heard helpful submissions from Mr C Bridge who is prosecuting and Mr Z Khatiz who is appearing today for Mr Kettule. I propose to suspend the sentence in a moment. My reasons are those outlined by legal representatives. I think Mr Khatiz is right in pointing to the efforts of his client in rehabilitating himself with working in the family business at weekends and in his own business during the week. Those are impressive steps towards rehabilitation. I would not want to frustrate that progress by imposing limitations on his lifestyle, especially working lifestyle, which would limit him. I acknowledge also, as Mr Bridge says, that an intensive correction order would be a more demanding form of sentence for Mr Kettule and perhaps one that arguably should be imposed. But I am not going to for the reasons that Mr Khatiz pointed out about his client’s work but also for the reason that Mr Bridge pointed out, that it means that I can monitor Mr Kettule progress over the next two years.
	


HIS HONOUR: If you would stand up, Mr Kettule, I am going to sentence you now.


	
	For the offence of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation I sentence you to two years imprisonment under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period, and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for two years.
	



	
	​The conditions of the bond are:
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour for that period.
	
	
	That he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.
	
	
	That he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Kettule, you’ve listened to me for the last hour or more, and you’ve heard what I’ve said. I’ve got my reservations but you’ve got the benefit of the principles of the law and I’m hoping that the case that’s been made out for you by Mr James is going to be seen through by you and you’re just going to now get on with your life, with your family and with your business, your relationship - I didn’t mention that, Mr Woods mentioned that - your new relationship but it’s entirely up to you.

A few things have to be clear, one is you’ve got a gaol sentence of two years, all right. Two, it’s suspended for two years. Three, that with Mr Khatiz you will have to go to the Registry now, sign a good behaviour bond, stay out of trouble for two years. If you change your address you let them know at the Court here. And three, if you get a notice in the mail saying you’ve got to turn up, you turn up, you don’t have the Sheriff chasing after you.

The most important thing which Mr Khatiz will remind you of, and you may know from your own knowledge, is a s 12 bond is not like an ordinary good behaviour bond. If you break that, even a drink driving offence or a fight or something like that, the law makes it very hard for me not to send you to gaol. I’ve pretty well got to send you to gaol. That’s why Mr James has emphasised the ‘it’s in your hands’ and Mr Bridge has done the same and I imagine Mr Khatiz will. What you do over the next two years will determine whether you stay out of gaol or not. If you continue to do what you have been doing for the last few years - which is commendable, and I congratulate you - then you won’t have to see me again. If I do get a report, you will be in before me and as said, my hands are very much tied. Do you understand all that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Keep up the good work and good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You can come out of the dock and join your family. Anything else Mr Khatiz and Mr Bridge?

BRIDGE: The only other thing your Honour, is in terms of the original bond, if that’s been officially called up, I know you had facts and stuff and I know you’ve referred to it. I just wonder as a formality whether or not it should be marked as no further action perhaps?

HIS HONOUR: Which bond is that?

BRIDGE: The bond for the driving offence.

HIS HONOUR: Which he got from the District Court. I will do that.

BRIDGE: Given it’s now expired and given you’ve just imposed - I know I handed up facts on a previous occasion, you certainly referred to it in your sentencing remarks. I don’t know whether you need any formal paperwork, I think there’s puzzling looks coming from--


	
	In respect of the good behaviour bond imposed under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 28 November 2011, under s 98 of that Act I am satisfied the offender has failed to comply with the good behaviour condition of the bond and under s 98(2) I decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply.
	


HIS HONOUR: Does that deal with it?

BRIDGE: That’s fine, thank you very much.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else, Mr Bridge?

BRIDGE: No, thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Khatiz?

KHATIZ: No, your Honour.

		16 September 2015",2015-05-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766608,Ghosh v Miller (No. 3) [2015] NSWDC 133,"Judgment


	
	These are reasons for the orders I made on 14 May 2015.
	
	
	These defamation proceedings have had an unfortunate history from the beginning. First, the plaintiff commenced them in the wrong jurisdiction, namely the Local Court (which cannot hear defamation proceedings: s 33(1)(b) Local Court Act 1982 (NSW)) and then sought to continue them in the wrong registry (Newcastle) of the correct court. Second, delays occurred while the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant, Google Australia Pty Ltd, was struck out and dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”): Ghosh v Google Australia Pty Ltd [2013] NSWDC 146. The remaining defendants were then not served in accordance with the Rules: Ghosh v Miller & Ors (No. 2) [2013] NSWDC 194. Orders for the filing of defences by the defendants after they were served were finally able to be made in the Newcastle District Court on 1 December 2014. However, the defences of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh defendants disclosed no defences known to law and were struck out, with leave to replead, on 20 February 2015. The fifth defendant filed no defence and on 23 April 2015, I made a self-executing order, which expired today, for the fifth defendant to be represented in court, or to file a defence.
	
	
	This recital of events is necessary to understand why I refused to make the timetable orders sought by the third to seventh defendants which are as follows:
	



	
	The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants are to serve on the plaintiff a copy of what they understand to be the current Second Further Amended Statement of Claim no later than 7 days from today (on or before 21 May 2015);
	
	
	The plaintiff is to advise the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants by no later than 14 days from today (on or before 28 May 2015) that this is a true copy of the statement of claim on which she relies, and if this is not the case, the plaintiff is to serve on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants by no later than 14 days from today (on or before 28 May 2015) a complete copy of the statement of claim on which she relies;
	
	
	The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants are to make any request for or regarding particulars of the statement of claim relied upon by the plaintiff no later than 21 days from today (on or before 4 June 2015);
	
	
	The plaintiff is to respond to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants’ request for particulars on or before 18 June 2015;
	
	
	The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants are to notify the court of the interlocutory applications they propose to make in the proceedings on or before 9 July 2015;
	
	
	Each party has liberty to restore the matter to the list on 3 days’ notice;
	
	
	The matter is listed for directions on 16 July 2015.
	



	
	Orders 1 and 2 are unnecessary as this document has been identified in court today. Orders 3 and 4 are unnecessary as the defendants have filed defences. Order 5 is otiose as the applications foreshadowed by the defendants (namely security for costs and dismissal of the claim on the basis of alleged misstatement of her address) are no longer to be brought. Finally, and most importantly, the length of the adjournment which would result from these unnecessary steps is contrary to the efficient conduct of litigation, as well as suspends the existing timetable, which was put in place when the proceedings were last before the court.
	
	
	The plaintiff opposed the making of these orders, but herself sought orders of an unsatisfactory kind, namely summary judgment and an apprehended violence order. This puts the court in a difficult position, in that neither party to the litigation is proposing a sensible timetable capable of disposing of the issues in dispute.
	
	
	Sections 56-62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) contain a series of powers for courts to exercise case management principles. These include the making of such orders as are necessary for the efficient disposal of business of the court (s 56(1)(b)) in relation to procedural orders (s 58(1)(a)(iii)) for the purpose of elimination of delay (s 59).
	
	
	In particular, s 61(2) provides:
	


“(2) In particular, the court may, by order, do any one or more of the following:

(a) it may direct any party to proceedings to take specified steps in relation to the proceedings,

(b) it may direct the parties to proceedings as to the time within which specified steps in the proceedings must be completed,

(c) it may give such other directions with respect to the conduct of proceedings as it considers appropriate.”


	
	These provisions permit the court to substitute its own timetable where parties cannot agree upon, or propose, a timetable which will lead to the readying of the proceedings for hearing.
	
	
	In Ivory v Telstra Corp Ltd [2002] QCA 457 at [85], Wilson JA stated:
	


“[85] I respectfully agree with the observation of Mahoney JA in Ley v R De W Kennedy (Finance) Pty Ltd as cited in the later decision of Raybos Australia Pty Ltd & Anor v Scitec that the right of a litigant to present his case –

“must not be seen as giving ..... an absolute right to conduct a case, or to conduct a case in the manner and for the time that such a person chooses, whatever that choice may be. That right must be balanced against the rights of other parties who are involved in the litigation, including the right...... not to be involved in pointless litigation and to have the litigation conducted properly and with reasonable promptitude; and it must be balanced against the right of the public generally not to have the court's time wasted.

...

What steps will be appropriate, in a particular case, to prevent injustice being done to parties who find themselves involved in litigation conducted in this way, must, of course, be determined in the light of the facts of that a case; but it should be clear that it is proper that steps be taken to that end.”


	
	The timetable proposed by the third to seventh defendants fails to take into account the necessary steps for the future conduct of the proceedings in the form of the filing of a Reply by the plaintiff, discovery and interrogatories. The orders that they seek will only lead to further delay and intemperate correspondence of the kind that has been put before the court on this application.
	
	
	However, the plaintiff’s complaint, namely that the defendants are harassing her, and that this court should issue an apprehended violence order to restrain such conduct, is similarly without merit. The plaintiff asks me to make an apprehended violence order against the defendants, whom she accuses of the following misconduct in the affidavit she tendered to the court:
	


“I seek Apprehended Violence Orders against all defendants for constant stalking on the internet, in the media, by nuisance emails and phone calls, and for impersonating me in offensive internet blogs as “Golly Ghosh” or “Anonymous.” The merged Case 2013/238215 and 2013/76771 file contains copious evidence of Police witnessed death threats, vile phone messages, repeated aggravated break and enters into my property at 15 Bundall Rd Surfers Paradise with eye witness accounts, and repeated slander and threats to each and every tenant who stays there, including Federal and State Police Officers. My current long term tenants (since December 2013) were made to chop down trees on my property without my permission on order from the third to seventh defendants, who continue to slander me to them continuously and urge them not to pay rent, as they did with all the holiday rental tenants.”


	
	The plaintiff acknowledged that the District Court does not have power to make apprehended violence orders: see s 91 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). Such orders can only be made by the Local Court or the Children’s Court, and the only jurisdictional basis upon which such an order could be made in this court would be by way of appeal from the court below.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that her case was “too difficult” for the Local Court to determine, and argued that she should not have to bring her application in the Local Court at all, but go straight to the “appellate” court (namely this court) for her application to be determined. This would save time and money, which is a relevant factor under ss 56 – 62, she submitted.
	
	
	This is a novel argument. I note the Court of Appeal in Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock (Sir Alan Herbert, “Uncommon Law” (Methuen, 1930)) received a similar application by the celebrated litigant in person, Mr Haddock, for his case to bypass the Court of Appeal and go straight to the House of Lords, on the basis that one intermediate court was a reasonable precaution “but two suggest panic” (p. 257). However, Mr Haddock’s “frolics in jurisprudence”, to use the description given by Lord Atkin in the Introduction, are, unfortunately, entirely fictitious.
	
	
	Any claim by Dr Ghosh for an apprehended violence order should be made in the proper way to a local court. This court has no jurisdiction to make orders of such a nature and the plaintiff’s application must be refused.
	
	
	There is, however, a limited power, under s 61 Civil Procedure Act, to make orders other than of a timetable nature where problems of this kind occur, such as appropriate directions for the forwarding of correspondence (Jenolan Caves Resort Pty Ltd v Field [2007] NSWSC 1117), or for the parties to refrain from serving or sending particular documents. Such orders must only be made in exceptional circumstances: McGuirk v University of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 104 at [159]. In McGuirk, the Court considered that the provisions of s 61 may, in appropriate circumstances, be given a “liberal interpretation” in light of ss 56(2), 57(2) and 58 (McGuirk v University of New South Wales at [10], [11] and [142]). In the interests of encouraging efficient communication between the parties, I have accordingly provided separate directions for future service on the plaintiff to be by facsimile, at a number noted on the court file.
	
	
	The orders for the fifth defendant to file his defence by 21 May will permit the existing timetable to continue without further interruption. The parties to this litigation should endeavour to comply with the present timetable. With each default or delay, the willingness of the court to entertain failure to comply will rapidly diminish. While leeway has been given in the past while proceedings were conducted in Newcastle by parties who were largely self-represented, no further accommodations of this nature will be made.
	


Orders


	
	Note that the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim (MFI 2) is provided to Mr Maconachie to check if it matches what the defendants have.
	
	
	Refuse to make the orders for fresh service of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim or for particulars as set out in the Short Minutes of Order (MFI 3).
	
	
	Note that the plaintiff no longer brings an application for summary judgment against the fifth defendant on the basis that she accepts that the requirement for the fifth defendant to “attend” today has been discharged by the presence of a legal representative and an undertaking to file a Notice of Appearance in 7 days.
	
	
	The fifth defendant to file a Notice of Appearance in 7 days.
	
	
	Note the third, fourth, sixth and seventh defendants withdraw their complaints concerning the plaintiff’s address for service and accept that the plaintiff practises from the premises at Shop 5, 138 Pacific Highway, Charlestown NSW 2290.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application for apprehended violence orders against all defendants sought on the basis set out in paragraph 5 of her affidavit sworn on 14 May 2015 is dismissed.
	
	
	Note MFI 2 has been uplifted for photocopying.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions to Thursday 4 June 2015 at 2:00pm.
	
	
	The fifth defendant to use his best endeavours to file and serve his defence by 21 May 2015.

		27 July 2015",2015-05-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766609,R v Duffy (No. 6) [2015] NSWSC 562,"Judgment


	
	Towards the close of proceedings yesterday on 13 May, whilst the accused was being cross-examined about the acts involved in the killing of the deceased, one of the jurors became visibly upset. As a result of that, I indicated that there should be a break in the proceedings and that the jury should be sent back to the jury room. It then became clear that the juror's upset was to such an extent that she was unable to move from her seat in the jury box. Eventually she was assisted to her feet and helped out of the court by the sheriff's officer and one other member of the jury. In the meantime four jurors in the front row were not able to exit the jury box to return to the jury room.
	
	
	After the jury returned to the jury room, I indicated that I would adjourn the proceedings for the day.
	
	
	Mr Trevallion for the accused now applies to discharge the whole of the jury by reason of that incident. He submits that the juror concerned has demonstrated by her reactions yesterday that she would be unable to consider the evidence in the matter dispassionately. In addition, he submits that the other members of the jury are likely to have been affected by her emotional reaction. He said it cannot be known, but speculated that it might be the case that one or more of the jurors has discussed this juror's emotional reaction afterwards in the jury room. This might lead to the view that the jury as a whole would be unable to bring a dispassionate mind to bear.
	
	
	Relevant sections of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) are these:
	


22 Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror

Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner under Part 7A, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if:

(a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members:

(i) is not reduced below 10,

(ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused, or

(iii) is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months,

…

and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, orders that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors under Part 7A.

…

53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(a)   the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b)    …

(c)    …

(d)   it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

53C Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury

(1) If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.

…


	
	The present application requires consideration of s 53B (a) and (d). Paragraph (a) refers to the juror becoming “so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict”.
	
	
	There has been no prior indication in the three and a half weeks that this trial has been proceeding that this juror has been unable to attend to her duties and responsibilities as a juror. There has been no outward indication that she has been emotionally affected by the evidence that has been given in the case. In those circumstances, I do not consider that one incident that took place over perhaps a 10 minute period in the course of the trial means that the juror falls within the words of that paragraph.
	
	
	On the basis that paragraph (d) is directed more widely I could not be satisfied that, simply because a juror became emotional or upset at hearing graphic evidence of how the deceased was killed, such a reaction leads to the conclusion that the juror could not perform her functions as a juror, whether by not being able to bring an impartial or dispassionate mind to examine the evidence, or otherwise.
	
	
	The application was to discharge the jury as a whole. No basis was demonstrated for that application apart from the suggestion that it might be the case that the whole jury would be so affected by this juror’s reaction that the other members would not be able to properly to perform their roles.
	
	
	In my opinion, the proper approach in a situation like the present is to consider first the position of the juror concerned under s 53B. If the Court is satisfied that one or more grounds in that section has been made out and that it was appropriate to discharge the juror concerned, then consideration would need to be given under s 53C whether the jury as a whole should be discharged. Although Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; (1999) 199 CLR 99 say at [6] that the decision to discharge a juror and the decision to proceed with a jury of less than 12 are distinct steps often affected by different considerations, it will often not be possible to separate the two stages, as McHugh J said at [30].
	
	
	If a single juror is to be discharged, the Court must form an opinion about whether continuing the trial with the remaining jury members would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. If there is such a risk the whole jury must be discharged. If there is not such a risk the trial is to continue with the reduced number as section 22 provides. The test sets the bar at a high level. The risk is not simply of a miscarriage of justice but a substantial miscarriage of justice (Cf. s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) where both expressions are used and the distinction is maintained: Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 337; Clarke v R (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 at 237.
	
	
	What was sought on the present application was not that the particular juror be discharged but that the whole jury be discharged. It was only when I raised with counsel for the accused during his submissions in reply to the Crown the distinction between the two possible applications that counsel said that if I refused to discharge the whole jury he would ask that I discharge the particular juror. Part 7A of the Act appears to contemplate, however, that in the circumstances giving rise to the present application an application to discharge the jury as a whole would only arise after an application under s 53B with respect to the individual juror.
	
	
	Even if I had been satisfied that a basis was made out for discharging the juror concerned (which I have indicated that I am not) I would not have been of the opinion on the basis of anything that was observed or known that continuing with the remaining jurors would give rise to a risk of any miscarriage of justice, let alone a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The application is refused.

2766611,R v Thomas (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 561,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: Michael Thomas, who is unfit to be tried, was found last week to have committed an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. That finding was made at a special hearing over which I presided without a jury and was based upon what the legislation calls ""the limited evidence available"". (That term is used in recognition of the fact that a person who is unfit to be tried is not able to participate in a special hearing to the same extent as an accused person can in a normal criminal trial.)
	
	
	It is necessary for me now to indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment: s 23(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900 (NSW). The answer to that question is in the affirmative and that is common ground between the parties.
	
	
	In that case, I am required to nominate what would be my best estimate of the sentence that would have been imposed if the special hearing had been a normal trial in which a person had been found guilty: s 23(1)(b).
	
	
	In nominating that term I may take into account any period in which Mr Thomas has been held in custody. I have been informed that he has been in custody since he was arrested and charged on the evening of 31 January 2013; a period of about 2 years 3½ months.
	
	
	As to the length of the term, I note that recklessly causing grievous bodily harm is an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and there is a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	The facts surrounding the commission of the offence are set out in the judgment I gave at the conclusion of the special hearing last week and need not be repeated: see R v Thomas [2015] NSWSC 537. I would assess the objective seriousness of the offence as being neither at the high nor low end of the range. The degree of force used to punch his mother was moderate but, having regard to her condition, the consequence was most severe, namely a subarachnoid haemorrhage. It was not something that Mr Thomas gave any prior thought to. I am satisfied that it was the product of a spontaneous outburst of anger in the context of him having been under the stress of working in a job he did not enjoy, an argument with his parents about having resigned from it, and his mother's deteriorating health over the preceding two months to the point where she did not have very long to live.
	
	
	Relevant subjective circumstances of Mr Thomas are also to be found in that judgment. The most prominent of these are that he is 27 years old and has a moderate intellectual disability. The latter has the effect that he has an intellectual capacity less than 99.9 per cent of the general population. This level of functioning did not require him to be under any form of professional care and monitoring. He did receive assistance and mentoring in relation to employment. In fact, it was his resignation from a job he had, working as a kitchen hand, that led to the argument that preceded the assault upon his mother.
	
	
	Prior to going into custody, Mr Thomas was living at home with his parents and younger brother. I understand that it is proposed that he will return to live with his father and brother at their Emu Plains home.
	
	
	Mr Thomas' moral culpability is at a relatively low level for this offence. General deterrence and denunciation which are normally taken into account in sentencing have no relevance. In short, Mr Thomas is not an appropriate person to be denounced or made an example of.
	
	
	I do not get any sense that Mr Thomas presents any particular danger to the community. He has a criminal record but it is confined to a matter of assault that was dealt with under the provisions of s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act (meaning that the charge was dismissed and he was discharged into the care of his mother.)
	
	
	I have concluded that if this had been a normal trial I would have imposed a sentence of 1 year 6 months. Consequently, I am going to nominate a limiting term of 1 year 6 months and specify that it date from the day Mr Thomas went into custody, 31 January 2013.
	
	
	Section 24 requires that upon nominating a limiting term the Court must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and make an order with respect to the person's custody as is considered appropriate. However, the effect of the order I propose to make is that Mr Thomas will no longer be a forensic patient who is subject to the oversight of the Tribunal: s 52(2)(a). I think it would be appropriate nonetheless for the Registrar to send a formal notification to the Tribunal of the outcome of the proceedings.
	


Order

1   Nominate a limiting term of 1 year 6 months dating from 31 January 2013 and expiring on 30 July 2014.

2   Direct Mr Thomas' release forthwith.

3   Direct the Registrar to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of these orders.

2766619,R v Gaiter [2015] NSWDC 305,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Gaiter my practice is to tell people in advance what sentence is to be imposed. In your case the starting point of the sentence to be imposed is three years, six months imprisonment. I am giving you a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgement of Thomson and Houlton, the total sentence therefore taking into account the matters on the Form 1 will be two years and seven months. The non-parole period will be 15 months, that is one year and three months dated from 7 May. That balance of the sentence will be one year and four months. The total sentence will expire on my calculation on 6 December 2017. What I have just said to the prisoner will be incorporated into the remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The prisoner Leigh Dean Gaiter appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and continues his plea of guilty in this court.
	
	
	The particulars of that offence are that he between 10 August 2013 and 20 February 2014 at Broken Hill did supply a prohibited drug to wit 25.3 grams of methylamphetamine. I pause for a moment to point out that firstly when the prisoner was first charged in relation to the criminal investigation that was undertaken in respect of his activities, he was charged with well over one hundred charges for reasons that escape me. He was quite amenable to being charged with at least two or three charges pursuant to s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which of course attract a greater sentence than the ultimate charge to which he has pleaded guilty. Also, the particular concerning the total number grams of methylamphetamine may not be correct, although it is not a matter that requires any ex officio indictment being as I point out a particular.
	
	
	That statement of facts that have been tendered which is very lengthy runs to over 20 pages, points to the offender’s supply of either 25.3 or 25 grams of methylamphetamine over the time particularised in the Court Attendance Notice. I will sentence the offender without having had the opportunity of counting up every transaction, although every transaction is particularised in the facts on the basis that he was involved over the relevant period of time in supplying at least 25 grams of the prohibited drug.
	
	
	There are matters to be taken into account on a Form 1, these are offences of supplying the drug cannabis between 18 October and 20 February 2014. A second charge of supplying prescribed restricted substance contrary the Poison’s and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966, that is supplying Mogadon, a type of barbiturate or sedative and a third charge arising out of the prisoner’s arrest on 20 February 2014 dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C Crimes Act 1900. That offence relates to the prisoner’s possession of $1,000 in cash and an intercepted telephone call related to the circumstances of his arrest, in which it is clear in its terms the prisoner was referring to the cash in his possession as being partly his and partly belonging to another person.
	
	
	The prisoner is entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentences I have foreshadowed, in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. The guideline judgment set out a range of discount that may be given to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. I appreciate in the context of the character of the investigation and the process of charging the prisoner that the matter of settling upon an appropriate charge for which the accused could be committed for sentence was a complicated one. Whilst there was some delay in the Local Court the accused, having been on bail it would seem since late February early March 2014, the delay would seem to arise from the character of the proceedings, rather than any attitude of the prisoner. It was agreed as I understand it at the bar table that the prisoner was entitled to the discount that I have accorded him.
	
	
	In relation to the matters on the Form 1 I take them into account, in accordance with the guideline judgment, Attorney General’s Application Number 1, (2002) 56 NSWLR 147 and particularly the observations of then Chief Justice Spigelman at [18] -[43]. The fact that matters are to be taken into account on a Form 1 will mean that there will usually be a need for greater emphasis to be placed upon retribution and deterrence and the entire point of the process will be usually to impose a longer sentence, or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence had stood alone, although there is no need to identify the extent to which there would be any adjustment to the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. Sometimes with matters on a Form 1 may provide more evidence of context than anything else. If a person is convicted of an armed robbery and there are four or five armed robberies on a Form 1 well the sentence to be imposed in respect of the principal offence would be substantially greater taking into account those matters than if the principal offence had stood alone. In this case this is not the situation the possession of the cash is intimately bound up of the circumstances of the prisoner’s trading in methylamphetamine. The supply of the cannabis I am satisfied was sporadic and incidental to the prisoner’s main business of supplying methylamphetamine. The supplying of the Mogadon was a minor matter in context and really each of the three matters on the Form 1 circulate around and provide some background or context to the principal offending.
	
	
	With regard to the principal offending, as I said, there is a statement of facts that extends to 21 pages and obviously I do not propose to read that onto the record. It can be shortly stated that the police in their usual efficient way in these matters undertook an operation intercepting a particular telephone service that whilst it was subscribed to a person living somewhere in the Gilgandra area was under the authority or the use of the prisoner and this telephone intercept operation is the essence of the evidence that is produced against the prisoner that commenced on 18 October 2013 and continued right up until the arrest of the prisoner, in the circumstances I earlier outlined, on 20 February 2014.
	
	
	The police monitored all the calls, there are a very significant number of voice calls and text messages some 8,900 voice calls and 13,800 text messages but in that context there were identified just over 100 transactions which the police are satisfied, and the prisoner admits, were concerned with the supply of methylamphetamine and the facts set out the code words that were used or slang terms used by the prisoner and others to identify the methylamphetamine. There was some conversation about the provision of cannabis. The prisoner in his evidence before me denied that he ever supplied as much as a ‘pound’ but it is on his own evidence the case that on at least four occasions he supplied some relatively small quantities of cannabis to other people. As I say incidental to his primary business.
	
	
	The various individual supplies occurred almost on a daily basis but not always so. Then again there were a number of days when there were multiple supplies on the one day.  Some examples of that can be found that on 14 January there were four supplies by the prisoner on the one day. There were four supplies by the prisoner on 17 January 2014. With regard to the quantities that were supplied on each individual occasion on my careful reading of the facts there was one supply of 1.5 grams, there were at least two supplies of 1 gram, but the rest of the supplies were primarily of supplies of methylamphetamine of a quantity identified from the telephone conversations of between .2 of a gram and .5 of a gram. There were of course some supplies between .5 of a gram and a gram and there were a number of supplies I appreciate of what in the parlance of drug suppliers amounted to a ‘point’. A 'point' being .1 of a gram.
	
	
	The prices paid varied depending upon the quantity and I assume the relationship of the prisoner with the purchaser as is often the case. I have noted for example that one supply of .5 of a gram was for a figure around about $383.70 but on occasions the prisoner supplied a point of a gram for $100 which is a sort of a standard rate or even less for .5 of a gram. It would seem that when there were multiple points involved there was some discount. I have not, again done the maths, nobody has assisted me in this regard but it seems to me on my rough calculation from the available facts that the prisoner negotiated the sale of methylamphetamine over the period of time in the quantities identified in the facts for a sum of money roughly, just very roughly between about $17,000 and $20,000. Certainly there was in total a substantial sum of money involved and the transactions as I said were regular and on occasions occurring on multiple occasions on the one day. 4 January is another day where the prisoner supplied four different people, or maybe the same person, with different quantities of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The prisoner’s arrest of course brought an end to the supplies. He was in custody for seven days I am informed he was granted bail and has been on bail, I accept that he has been on strict bail conditions as one would expect. He is fortunate to have bail, particularly given the strength of the Crown case and the inevitability that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Having regard to the maximum penalty of s 25(1) of the Act and of course having regard to the long standing authority which makes it clear that those involved substantially in the supply, or trafficking, of prohibited drugs must expect fulltime custodial sentences unless there are exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	In this regard, in an earlier matter, although the statistics were not tendered in this case, the Crown tendered statistics in relation to sentencing of matters pursuant to s 25 of the Act in the District Court over, as I remember it, a seven year period. There was a very large sample of cases, something in excess of 700. Those statistics were tendered in the context of a discussion I had had with the Crown concerning a supplier of MDMA and the availability of an order under s 10. The range of penalties where terms of imprisonment were imposed were between six months imprisonment the bare minimum one would expect of a term of imprisonment and something in the order of seven or eight years. The vast majority of sentences falling in a range between 18 months and three to four years. Of course, statistics have limited value they provide a court with a range of what has happened before, in courts of first instance, they do not provide the court with information as to, for example which particular sentences were subject of appeal. They do not provide details about the quantity of the drug. They do not provide details of the role of the particular person and the particular subjective circumstances, and there are of course to be borne in mind the fact that some people appear for sentence from custody and end up with a non-custodial order because their time in custody has been taken into account.
	
	
	There are the matters identified in the decision of Bloomfield, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal from 1998 of Chief Justice Spigelman, concerning the value of statistics, particularly in the context of dealing with matters on appeal and I have taken that into account, although to be fair to Mr Wilkinson who appears for the prisoner and the Crown the statistics which were referred to in submission were not actually produced in this case.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the authorities to which I referred setting out the general principle if it could be described as that concerning those who are substantially involved in trafficking in prohibited drugs. I point out in the context of the submissions that were made very skilfully by Mr Wilkinson on behalf of his client and the submissions of the Crown it was conceded, bearing in mind the terms of s 5 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that a term of imprisonment had to be imposed and the prisoner was expecting that in any event.
	
	
	There were no exceptional circumstances identified and it must be said, notwithstanding the prisoner’s evidence, that there was an element of profitable commercial exploitation by the prisoner which was referred to by Justice Hunt in the decision of Clark, an unreported decision from 1990, which has been the subject of a discussion in a range of authorities including the 2006 decisions of Gip and Gu in the Court of Criminal Appeal and of course the decision of Justice Adams in Fayd’herbe v R [2007] NSWCCA 20 where Adams J surveyed a number of those earlier authorities.
	
	
	The sentencing of the prisoner of course requires consideration of the quantity involved, but this is not a case it should be said, self-evidently so of someone being found driving along the Silver City Highway with 25 grams of methylamphetamine in their car in circumstances where, in the context of this prisoner is being a drug user, some might be used for personal purposes and some may be supplied, sometimes for profit. The quantity here is clearly the quantity that the prisoner himself actually sold. I bear in mind of course that as the prisoner explained it, he would be ‘ripping off’, customers from time to time to ensure he had drugs for himself. He did not go into any great detail as to whether he cut drugs to provide himself with more quantity than was otherwise available.
	
	
	Ultimately, in sentencing the prisoner by reference to the maximum penalty and the facts of the case, it is clear, as Mr Wilkinson pointed out from the judgment of Poon a NSWCCA judgment in 2003 of Justice Ipp: “a primary factor in determining the appropriate sentence will be the relevant statutory scheme and the sentencing tribunal will have due regard to the maximum penalty prescribed for the particular drug in question.” With the quantity of the drug being a relevant but not determinative factor.
	
	
	Having regard to the quantity of the drug whilst there was extensive trafficking by the prisoner as I said over a hundred transactions, it was within the scheme of quantities contemplated by the legislation a modest quantity. Of course that is not, as I say, the determinative factor. But it needs to be borne in mind the quantities that were supplied on each individual occasion were by and large relatively small quantities many of them of the lowest level of quantity. Although in that regard I should point in fairness to the prisoner that at least one supply was for actually .05 of a gram, that is half a point. But this is not a case of a person dealing in wholesale with drugs for the purposes of providing drugs to dealers further down the line, selling on the street so to speak. The prisoner was more or less at the end of the food chain but as I say substantially involved in trafficking. I do not have any evidence available to me as to the purity of the drugs and the prisoner has not provided much assistance, in fact no assistance to anybody as to the source of the drugs that were provided to him. Of course, he does not get penalised for that but to be brutally frank there is complete absence of cooperation on his part in the investigation of the matter with police. Whoever was providing the prisoner with the drugs is no doubt still continuing to do so unless he or she is in gaol.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history indicates that he was on a bond at the time of the commission of this offence pursuant to s 10 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which I will herein after refer to as the Act. The prisoner in fact does not have a significant criminal history as his counsel pointed out and I am prepared to accept that as a ‘mitigating factor’, to the extent that it can so operate. But committing an offence while subject to conditional liberty is a countervailing aggravating factor, there are varying degrees of severity of aggravation of course and certainly an offence committed whilst on parole is a greater aggravating factor than that involving an offence committed whilst on a bond, depending upon of course the circumstances. The bond, the prisoner was on was for a drink, driving matter of a different character of course than the matter with which I am concerned, but the matter still stands as an aggravating factor. In fact the prisoner’s criminal history shows that on three occasions he has appeared in court, prior to the current matter, twice in relation to low range PCA matters. On two occasions receiving s 10 bonds, which shows that he has been given the benefit of leniency before in the courts and on the first occasion he appeared in court in 2003 he committed a street offence for which he got a dismissal pursuant to s 10. Now of course those dismissals in their various forms may have reflected the status of his subjective circumstances at the time of the offending, some of which is still present today. They may also reflect the character of the offending. But it is as I say a matter where the prisoner has received leniency from the courts in the past.
	
	
	As I understand the matter he was born on 30 December 1983 at the time of the offending with which I am concerned he would have turned 30. He now appears before me aged 31. He would have been 29 when he started supplying the drugs.
	
	
	He gave evidence before me about a range of topics which deal with his background, his health, the circumstances of the offending, the reasons for the offending and what has happened since being charged and what his hopes are for the future. In relation to that evidence there is, if I can call it, “quite supporting” evidence in various forms, including a letter from a neurosurgeon dated 27 September 2008 and progress reports and other reports from medical practitioners relating to treatment and counselling he had received, it would appear, since the time of his arrest in relation to the current matter.
	
	
	The prisoner was born in Broken Hill. His stepfather, as he is described in some of the material, or his father and his mother, apparently live at Spencer’s Creek just outside of Broken Hill. I understand his stepfather was a miner, or is a miner. The prisoner is not a person with any background of antisocial attitudes or conduct. He had an unexceptional upbringing. There was obviously some tensions in the family for various reasons but they are of no moment here. He obtained various trade certificates and qualifications as I understood his evidence. He undertook a boiler making apprenticeship for some period of time in South Australia. He has qualifications as a crane driver, amongst other skills that make employable in the mining industry and elsewhere and it would seem, by and large up until 2012, he has been in reasonably regular employment. Certainly he has a number of trade or trade based skills that provide opportunity for him to find employment on his release from custody. I do not have any doubt about his evidence in that respect. However, the evidence he gave so far as his subjective background is concerned did raise important matters to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise that seemed to me to have some bearing upon the current situation in which he finds himself.  I accept his evidence that up until 2008 he was not a regular user of amphetamine.  He was not a person who was a 'lout' or a person adversely known by the police as a man involved in the drug culture and the like.
	
	
	On 23 February 2008 when, with a friend after leaving what I understand to be the Mulga Hill Tavern, which I understand is on William Street in Broken Hill, he was beaten up by a group of people. Nobody was charged in relation to that matter but I draw no conclusion one way or the other about that. He suffered a depressed skull fracture in the right parietal region with an overlying laceration. He had to be transferred to Royal Adelaide Hospital for treatment and he went into theatre for an elevation of the depressed fracture and stayed in hospital for four days; he was discharged to a brain rehabilitation clinic and remained as an outpatient until July 2008. After that he took up a job in metal fabrication it appears, on the history obtained by the neurosurgeon at Port Lincoln, doing crane rigging, welding and grinding.
	
	
	I point out of course, with those matters I earlier mentioned, he has welding qualifications. He had occasional headaches and scalp tenderness at that time but has not had any seizures. The surgeon thought, in the context for preparing a letter for the Australian Defence Forces, with a view to the prisoner taking up a position there, that there were no continuing neurological issues. The prisoner gave evidence before me that, in fact, he has continued to have neurological issues to the extent to which they are primarily connected to this injury or from other reasons, I cannot conclude. But he talks about headaches, lack of concentration, some memory lapses and the like. He found himself, he said, after he was discharged from treatment, having trouble staying awake and he started to use amphetamines sporadically in his work environment to try and stay awake which is a dangerous thing, of course, to do. He did, in fairness, through his counsel produce an exhibit showing that he had been randomly drug tested at his place of employment in 2010 and no positive findings were made in relation to illicit or prescribed drugs but he said from time to time he continued to use amphetamines.
	
	
	He returned to Broken Hill in 2012 on a more or less permanent basis, but without employment. As best I can understand it he has been unemployed since then. He had, he said, some savings and he lived off his savings for a period of time but being unemployed with little interest it would seem he started using amphetamines again. He also, it is clear from the pre-sentence report which was, at the heel of the hunt, produced to these proceedings, to have become involved in heavy gambling. It would seem that problematic gambling has been a contributing factor to his offending in one sense because he needed money not only for drugs, which I accept, he also needed money for his gambling habits and I am satisfied too that given the sums of money involved he was using money for his own personal lifestyle. On his own version of events he was on the dole and he had no savings left and that is what he said drove him into the circumstances that give rise to these charges. He was a willing participant in this activity, of course. The telephone intercepts which I have not heard, would indicate that that is so and he was pretty well organised within the context of drug supply matters of this character. Obviously there were people who knew that he could provide prohibited drugs as the police identified from the intercept operation.
	
	
	After he was arrested he went to obtain some assistance but I think the state of the evidence could be fairly summarised as that, whilst not as dependent upon amphetamines as he was at the time of his arrest, he has still used prohibited drugs up until the present time, admittedly on a diminished scale. He had problems with alcohol before his arrest. That is diminished to some extent. He said, as I understood his evidence, that he had primarily given up on alcohol and had largely stopped using drugs but had not stopped using drugs altogether. He tried to address his gambling problem as well. He has been in a relationship for the last couple of years but his partner has gone to Cairns to get away from the stress of the current proceedings and it seems as though that there have been tensions in their relationship for a range of reasons that really, ultimately, are of no moment.
	
	
	I should point out another event that was the subject of evidence and it is referred to in the medical histories. That is the almost fatal injury suffered by his younger brother. According to the history given to a psychiatrist, in 2012 the prisoner was drinking alcohol with his brother, his brother fell backwards and got struck by broken glass in a broken coffee table which sliced open his back and punctured his lung. The history states that the prisoner “rescued his brother” from this situation and got him to hospital where his life was saved and the prisoner was greatly distressed by this. The history also refers to an event that I do not remember the prisoner giving evidence about, but that may be an oversight on his part, and that is approximately six months before March 2015 he ran into a meat hook and sustained an eye injury which caused him continuing difficulty. The assessment of the psychiatrist, which admittedly is not a report for court but is a report sent to another doctor to give the doctor an understanding of what needed to be done for the patient, was that the prisoner had a history of severe traumatic events and had symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety and “panics” as it is described. He had antisocial personality problems with the control of his anger and had a very significant poly-drug and alcohol habit with significant family conflicts. The prisoner also has continuing concerns about his skull which I have taken into account.
	
	
	To my mind it will be relevant to the circumstances of his custody. He has a metal plate in his skull and he feels, at least, that it is loose which is a very disconcerting feeling to have, I am sure. Apparently he has continuing ophthalmic and dental issues and the psychiatrist thought that he needed ‘Post Traumatic Stress Disorder’ and drug and alcohol counselling and needed assistance in relation to dealing with panic attacks, as well as other interventions that were appropriate. There are some notes attached to that report, reflecting upon the matters identified in that report.
	
	
	The medical practitioner to whom that report was directed is apparently a general practitioner, or was a general practitioner, here in Broken Hill at what is called the “GP Super Clinic”. He is aware of the prisoner’s background of traumatic brain injury and his use of prohibited drugs and the way in which he became dependent upon them. He noted what the prisoner told me about in his evidence, which I accept, that he tried to get into drug rehabilitation, particularly after his arrest but had been rejected. He had a lot of symptoms consistent with conditions reactive to his current situation, as well as underlying issues that predate his involvement in this offending. He has slow mood, poor sleep, hopelessness, recurrent suicidal thoughts but no plan to suicide. He is thought to act recklessly on occasions in ways that are identified in that report. The latest progress note of 21 April 2015 that has been provided reflects upon the fact that he was still using drugs at that time, although he aimed to stop drinking and using drugs once in prison and was hoping, as he said in his evidence, to start again when he was released from custody.
	
	
	In that respect I accept the evidence he gave that when he was in custody and beyond he was hoping to try and break the nexus with his dependency on amphetamines and he was hoping to start his life afresh, hopefully reunite with his partner. He certainly has the basic wherewithal to do this. He has trade and other skills that would make him attractive as an employment proposition but it is quite clear as the facts of this case reveal that the prisoner’s current circumstances are very much driven by his continuing dependency upon methyl amphetamine, the pernicious character of that drug and drugs like it, or closely allied drugs is a matter of some considerable discussion in the community and rightly so.
	
	
	The problem is, of course, in sentencing the prisoner, as far as it works adversely to him, is that he is aware of the pernicious character of the drug. Notwithstanding his need for it and the fact that I accept that, in part, he sold the drug to obtain the drug for himself where he was dependent upon the drug, he was subjecting other people or exposing other people to the effects of the pernicious effects of the drug. It is a self-defeating cycle of despair, I understand that. I appreciate people in these circumstances do not act altogether rationally. But one would have thought the prisoner might have had greater insight into the effect of what he was doing, bearing in mind what he claims to be the effect upon him of the very drugs that he was supplying and this is a point taken up in the pre-sentence report. It sets out a history that is in accord with the evidence that the prisoner gave before me. I was dubious about the prisoner’s explanation of his involvement in the supply of cannabis. Ultimately I think it is a matter of no moment. I am not entirely satisfied, in fact I do not accept, that the only purposes of obtaining money for the supply of drugs was to obtain drugs for himself. It is clear, as I said earlier, that he was using drug sales to obtain money for gambling which is a lifestyle choice and of course clearly, on his own version, he did not have the independent sources of income to maintain his lifestyle.
	
	
	In relation to the pre-sentence report, having reflected upon these matters of history which I need not repeat, and noting of course the attempts by the prisoner to obtain counselling and the absence of relevant services or incapacity to provide services to the prisoner, the reporter for Community Corrections observed that:
	


“The prisoner appeared to have little insight into the serious of his offences as he minimised his behaviour and was unable to recognise the risk he posed to the community.”


	
	That observation is, as I said, hard to understand. Whilst I accept it in the sense that the prisoner surely understood the effect of the drug that he was providing to others, the report noted the prisoner attempted to excuse his offending by claiming that he did not benefit financially from the offences. That is a matter that I have already commented upon and a claim which I do not accept. The Community Corrections Service Officer observes that:
	


“He was not able to appreciate that his lack of financial stability may have been linked to his drug use and gambling.”


	
	To be fair to his evidence before me, I did understand him to say that he had an understanding that when he ran out of his savings that forced him into the position he described of getting involved in the supply of drugs because he had little access to money. But the general observation made by Community Corrections, to my view, is sound. I accept during the remand period, as I earlier pointed out, that whilst subject to strict bail conditions the prisoner has made endeavours to try and address some of the issues that have brought him to the current situation. I accept, of course, it is difficult in Broken Hill to get a ‘Rolls Royce’ service and I accept, of course, given the character of addiction, that he would have great difficulty giving up the use of drugs altogether. Although the truth of the matter is that for his reformation giving up prohibited drugs altogether and particularly methyl amphetamine is a start. But it is a start he has not quite yet reached.
	
	
	I have had regard to all the evidence that has been provided to the Court and I have done my best to do justice to it in the summary I have now provided. One last matter relating to his evidence and I have already referred to it in passing, is I accept his evidence that he is genuinely desirous to get away from the use of drugs and he is genuinely desirous of re-establishing his life in the community and he is capable of doing that in the context of considering some mitigating factors under s 21A(3). Those are the issues relating to the likelihood of reoffending and the prospects of rehabilitation, but only if he is able to remain drug free on his entry to the community.
	
	
	His counsel has referred to some matters that I have already cited, particularly the reference to Poon, made acknowledgements of the importance of deterrence, both personal and general in sentencing for offences of this type and that is self-evident from the authorities to which I earlier referred. He noted in his submissions the significance of the events of 2008 that almost irreversibly changed his life. I accept that is so and I am prepared to accept that that change to his life was something beyond his control and it is a relevant matter to take into account in sentencing him. This is not a man who has gone into drug dealing as I see it, solely on a cynical commercial basis. It is the culmination of a series of events.
	
	
	With regard to s 3A matters his counsel readily conceded that all the purposes of sentencing applied in various ways as they are identified in that section. In fact as I noted it, having a transcript of the proceedings his counsel made the submission that s 3A was “written for him”. I would have thought s 3A was probably more pertinently written for Robert Vincent Veen, but there are some truths in the fact that each of the purposes of sentencing are relevant in this matter.
	
	
	His counsel took me to s 21(2) and specifically conceded that aggravating factors were that the offence, that is the offence to which he pleaded guilty, involved a series or multiplicity of criminal acts and that is self- evidently so. That leads to the conclusion that the prisoner was substantially involved in trafficking of drugs. The offence was committed for financial gain; that is self-evidently so and one would have thought that was the sole purpose of drug dealing. Even if one was obtaining money to obtain drugs for one’s self, it is still a form of financial gain. But still, whilst it is intimately involved in the offending, it remains as an “aggravating factor”.
	
	
	I should point out, in passing, Howie J, on a number of occasions some years ago, in the run of the mill, if I might call it, or ordinary drug supply case, was unpersuaded that planning was an aggravating factor in those offences because of the character of the offending recognised by the legislature. I believe by and large that is true in relation to the issue of financial gain in a case such as this. Certainly there is no submission made that I should find that planning was an aggravating factor, beyond the planning that is self-evident in the facts. Whilst clearly drug dealing has a connection with organised crime, the manufacture and the dissemination of the prohibited drugs is a characteristic of organised crime. This prisoner could not be said to be a member of an organised crime network as such.
	
	
	Further, the offence was committed whilst on conditional liberty, a matter pointed out by the Crown. It was further submitted with regard to mitigating factors under s 21A(3) that the prisoner did not have a significant record, I have already dealt with that matter. It was submitted that the prisoner was a person of good character. I accept that before offending in this manner the prisoner was a person of good character to the extent that he had not been previously involved in drug dealing, but he had prior findings of guilt for criminal offences, not of great moment. I accept that he was, until he became dependent upon prohibited drugs and perhaps before he was seriously injured in 2008, a person able to make a contribution to his community.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the issues of likelihood of offending and the prospects of rehabilitation. The Community Corrections Service noted his lack of insight into his offending. The prisoner expressed regret for his conduct. I am prepared to find, on balance, that there is evidence of remorse. It is not a matter of great significance in this case. Remorse really does not come into it. By and large the facts self-evidently show what can the prisoner say other than, “I am guilty and I regret what I did”, but I do not believe the prisoner is cavalier about his circumstances, albeit that I do not believe he fully appreciates the seriousness of his conduct. His plea of guilty, of course, is a mitigating factor as his counsel points out. For that he gets a discreet discount.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions late in the day, in fairness to her and under a great deal of difficulty, given her health at the time, were straightforward; they dealt with the discount which I have already dealt with, her time in custody. The Crown properly points out that only a term of fulltime custody can be imposed in this matter.
	
	
	There is just one outstanding issue arising from the evidence and the submissions. A case cited earlier in these proceedings, De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly some observations of McClellan CJ at CL, at [177]-[178]. It must be said, firstly, this is not a case of mental illness or intellectual handicap. It may be categorised, given the physical injury to the prisoner as a case involving an offender with “mental problems” arising from that injury and its sequelae. The causal connection between the injury, its sequelae and the offending with which I am concerned is perhaps indirect, but there is a connection there and it is a matter that I have taken into account. I do not know whether the prisoner’s physical condition presents some difficulty for him in custody. I would imagine, to be frank, that a blow to the head, if that were to happen, it would be a significant danger to the well-being of the prisoner. But from what I read of the psychiatric evidence and the report of the medical practitioner, whilst the prisoner displays various symptoms, including symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and I factor them into account, the conditions from which he suffers and their relationship to the offending do not to any substantial degree ameliorate the need for general deterrence. I do not believe that there is anything in the prisoner’s condition that warrants greater significance being put upon specific deterrence because he presents a danger to the community.
	
	
	As it ultimately pans out there was must be a term of imprisonment imposed. But for his physical injuries and the effect upon him of his physical injuries and its ultimate course to the point where we are now I would have fixed a greater sentence upon him than I have concluded is an appropriate starting point. But in considering the sentence I imposed upon him, noting his activities, I have had regard of course to the quantity of the drug and the scheme of quantities that warrant prosecution under s 25(1). As I earlier pointed out, just by reference to quantity alone the quantity is certainly not in the mid to high level of quantities that the section contemplates. Thus, I have concluded that the starting point of any sentence to be imposed is three years six months imprisonment and the sentence thus will be, as I have identified, I have made a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. Clearly this prisoner needs professional assistance, he has needed professional assistance for some years and has tried to obtain it whilst on bail. He needs an extended period of supervision, he needs assistance to adjust to community living, bearing in mind this will be his first gaol sentence. Although he did, of course, spend seven days in custody before, he will need to my mind direction and assistance, not only in relation to drug and alcohol counselling but also in relation to gambling dependency and also in respect of anger management as it affects his relationship.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner, as I have concluded I have, as I said, taken into account the circumstances of his bail conditions as I understand them to be.
	
	
	Could you stand up please sir. In respect of the offence to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. In sentencing you I take into account the matters on the Form 1. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of one year three months, that is to commence on 7 May 2015 and will expire on 6 August 2016. In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of one year four months. That sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 6 December 2017. The sentence I have imposed permits me to direct that you be released to parole at the expiry of your non-parole period. The Parole Authority will read my remarks on sentence, subject of course to the appeal rights of the Crown and the defence. Whatever is the final situation as far as you are concerned, your release to parole will be undertaken under the supervision of the Parole Authority and I will leave it for the Parole Authority to fix the appropriate conditions. You can take a seat.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else from you Madam Crown?
	
	
	BROWN: The matter should now be adjourned in order for the drug proceeds order application to be made.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That application is noted and is stood over to a date to be fixed.
	
	
	BROWN: Thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything more from you Mr Wilkinson?
	
	
	WILKINSON: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Gaiter you will be eligible for release to parole, as the orders currently stand, in one year and three months’ time, 15 months and you will be subject to parole supervision for a period of one year and four months when you are released to parole.

		17 December 2015",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766629,RJB v R [2015] NSWCCA 93,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Hidden J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to six sexual offences committed against his step-daughter over a period between 2002 and 2006. Four of the offences (counts 1 to 4) were sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age, an offence under s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. At the time of the first two counts, in 2002, that offence carried a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. At the time of counts 3 and 4, 2003, the maximum penalty had increased to 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years had been introduced.
	
	
	The remaining two offences, counts 5 and 6, were aggravated sexual assault, being sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The circumstance of aggravation was that the complainant was under the age of 16 at the time. These two offences were committed on the same occasion in 2006.
	
	
	The following sentences were imposed:
	



	
	Count 1 – a fixed term of 2 years, commencing on 2 August 2012;
	
	
	Count 2 – a fixed term of 3 years, commencing on 2 August 2013;
	
	
	Counts 3 and 5 – fixed terms of 3 years, commencing on 2 August 2014;
	
	
	Count 4 – 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 2 August 2016;
	
	
	Count 6 – 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 2 August 2019.
	



	
	The overall sentence was imprisonment for 17 years, with an effective non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 2 August 2012. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against these sentences.
	


Facts


	
	At the time the offences began the applicant had been in a relationship with the complainant’s mother for some years. She had three children, of whom the complainant was the youngest. They married, and the applicant moved in with the family two or three years before the offences. The six offences charged were part of a continuing pattern of abuse of the complainant when she was aged between 6 and 10 years, and were described in a statement of facts as “representative of the type of abuse he inflicted upon the victim.”
	
	
	The offending was described in the statement of facts as follows:
	


Count 1. In 2002, when the complainant was aged six years, the offender came into her room at the family home at Berkeley one night while she was sleeping and took her from her bed out into the lounge room of their house at Berkeley. He laid her on the lounge, where he removed her pyjamas and inserted his fingers into her vagina which caused her pain. She said, ‘Stop, it really hurts’, but the offender continued for a short time before taking her back to her bed. She didn’t tell anyone what had happened because she was frightened of the offender and feared she would not be believed by her mother.

Count 2. Some time between May 2002 and May 2003, when the complainant was still six years of age, the offender again entered her bedroom while she slept, woke her and took her out into the lounge room. He removed her pyjamas and proceeded to insert a hard object into her vagina, causing her to cry out in pain. He pulled the object in and out of her vagina for a period of time while she was screaming and crying for him to stop. When the complainant woke the next morning she noticed that there was blood on her underpants, which scared her into disclosing what had occurred to her mother. She told her mother that she discovered blood on her underpants as a result of the offender touching her down there. Her mother left the room and returned soon after and said to the complainant, ‘It’s okay, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it’.

Count 3. Between May 2003 and May 2004, when the complainant was seven years old, she was asleep in her room at the Berkeley address when the offender entered her room, took her out into the lounge room and laid her on the lounge. He removed her pyjamas and inserted his fingers into her vagina, causing her pain. This continued for a short time while she cried.

Count 4. When the complainant was around seven years of age and still living at the Berkeley address, she was asleep in her bed when the offender entered her bedroom and removed her pyjamas and underwear. He climbed on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina, causing her pain. The complainant tried to push him off but was unable to move. She yelled at him to stop and leave her alone but he continued thrusting his penis in and out of her vagina. After a period of time he climbed off, kissed her forehead and left the room. The complainant remembers noticing a clear fluid and some blood on the sheets following the assault. Around this time the complainant again approached her mother and complained of being abused by the offender. She said, ‘Mum, dad’s been touching me down there’. Her mother said, ‘No, you’re making it up like last time’. The complainant said, ‘No, mum, I’m telling the truth’. Her mother left the room and had an argument with the offender. A short time later the offender and the mother returned to where the complainant was and the offender yelled at the complainant, ‘You’re a fucking liar’. The mother said, ‘You need to stop making up stupid shit like that’. The complainant was then grounded.

The complainant and her family moved from Berkeley to Unanderra on 8 June 2006, when she was about ten years of age, and the abuse continued.

Counts 5 and 6. Soon after they moved into the house, the offender entered her bedroom late one night where she had been asleep and removed her pyjamas. He inserted his fingers into her vagina before rolling her over onto her stomach and inserting his penis into her anus, which caused her pain. He thrust his penis in and out of her anus while the complainant was crying and sobbing, telling him, ‘Stop, stop’. However, the offender continued on for a short period before leaving the room.

The complainant again complained to her mother and this time her mother purchased a lock which she installed on the complainant’s bedroom door. The lock did not stop the offender gaining entry into her bedroom and the abuse continued.

Eventually the complainant moved from the house into the garage, where she continued to live until 14 February 2012, when she moved to Bathurst to live with her older sister. While living with her sister the complainant disclosed to a family friend what the offender had been doing to her. That friend then informed the sister, who in turn reported the matter to Bathurst Police.


	
	The applicant was arrested on 2 August 2012. He exercised his right to silence, was charged and was refused bail. While in custody he sent a letter to his brother, in which he wrote:
	


“’Well this is the hard part of the letter but I need to man up and see what happens. Brother I’m as guilty as they come. I did what I’m accused of. In the process I’ve hurt a child I love dearly...I feel like a monster and don’t understand why I did it but I have to live with it for the rest of my life but I am going to man up and plead guilty and do the time given to me...’”.


	
	In assessing the objective gravity of the offences, the sentencing judge noted that they were not isolated incidents. His Honour also had regard to the complainant’s age, observing that “generally the younger the child the more serious the offences.” He said that the “recitation of the facts should be sufficient to convey the gravity of the offending conduct.” He noted that the offences caused the complainant pain and distress, and were perpetrated despite her protests.
	
	
	The applicant, his Honour said, had “exploited this vulnerable child in the worst possible way.” He added that the “callousness” of the applicant “was on full display” when he confronted the complainant in the presence of her mother and accused her of lying. In relation to counts 5 and 6, the incidents of digital and anal penetration in 2006, he said, “If it was possible to imagine a more disgusting and degrading act then this was it.”
	
	
	Generally, his Honour observed that it was possible “to hypothesise cases of greater heinousness than the present”, but expressed the view that “each offence is an example of the most serious criminal conduct.”
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant was aged between 35 and 39 during the period of the offences, and he is now 47. He has a criminal history which, his Honour noted, “would not entitle him to leniency.” There are no prior sexual offences, but there are a number of convictions for common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening apprehended domestic violence orders. The victim of some of these offences was his wife, whom he would sometimes assault during heated arguments. On one occasion, in 2003, he struck her, rendering her unconscious. Police were called, he brandished a knife and a three hour siege ensued.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. His subjective case is to be found in the report of a psychologist, Ms Case, who assessed him for the purpose of the proceedings. He had a difficult background. When he was about 15 months old, he and his older brother were effectively abandoned by their parents. They became State wards and spent a period of some years in a children's home. At the age of 10 he joined a family in Adelaide as a foster child, leaving his brother in the children’s home. To Ms Case he described his foster parents as strict, and said that he felt “left out of the family and unloved.” After some years he moved with the family to Sydney until he began to live independently at the age of 17. Generally, he described the period with the family as happy, but he felt guilty at having left his brother behind.
	
	
	In his early twenties he re-established contact with his biological father, with whom he maintained contact for about 15 years before his father moved on without explanation and without farewelling him. He learnt that he was one of 12 children to his mother, and that she had died of cancer. He never had any contact with her or with his siblings, except for the brother to whom I have referred. He told the psychologist that he no longer wished contact with that brother because he had assisted the police in their enquiries into these offences.
	
	
	He was educated to year 10 standard, and had only sporadic employment. He gave the psychologist a history of alcohol and drug abuse from his late teens, although he had never undertaken a detoxification or rehabilitation program. He believed that his drug use was “problematic” during the period of the offences and said that on occasions he committed them while intoxicated.
	
	
	He reported having suffered from depression and anxiety for his “whole life”, and to have attempted suicide on several occasions. He had had counselling “on and off” over the years for this condition and for his drug abuse. While in custody following his arrest he had seen a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressant medication.
	
	
	In addition to his step-children, he and his wife had 3 children of their own. Since being in custody he has had no contact with them, apparently at the direction of the Department of Community Services. To the psychologist he described his wife as “mentally abusive”, and himself as the submissive party in the relationship. Nevertheless, he admitted that on many occasions he had threatened or intimidated her, and physically abused her. He said that he “guessed” he loved her, but added, “I don’t really know what love is. I’ve never really received love from my parents or anyone.”
	
	
	Asked by Ms Case what was significant about the complainant, he could not explain it but admitted having had sexual feelings for her. Asked whether he thought of his behaviour as abusive, he said, “I guess I do” but added that he could also see it “as love.” Ms Case reported:
	


“[The applicant] expressed remorse for his actions and is distressed by the repercussions of his behaviour on losing access to his wife and children. [He] recognised the detrimental effects on the victim to include the loss of a father figure and trust issues within relationships. He acknowledged that her disclosures to her mother and installing a lock on her own bedroom door were indications that his behaviour was unwelcome.”


	
	Ms Case reported that he denied having been the victim of any physical or emotional abuse while in foster care, but that he disclosed “flashbacks of a sexual nature, and described visualising sexual imagery and scenes involving himself and unknown adults.” He “questioned whether this could indicate a personal history of abuse.”
	
	
	Ms Case recommended that, while in custody, he participate in a sexual offending program and receive psychotherapy to explore his childhood issues. She also recommended immediate intervention in respect of his depression and anxiety symptoms, and recommended a “comprehensive substance abuse treatment program to address his alcohol and illicit substance abuse.”
	
	
	His Honour accepted the applicant’s statements to Ms Case as “some” evidence of his remorse, which he also saw as reflected in his pleas of guilty. He noted that those pleas were entered at the earliest opportunity, entitling him to a discount of sentence of 25%. He saw his prospects of rehabilitation as “very much dependent on his ability to undertake successfully the programs whilst in the custodial setting.”
	


The application


	
	It is not a ground of the application that the sentences individually, or the overall sentence, are manifestly excessive. The three grounds argued assert that the sentencing judge fell into error in various respects in his approach to the sentencing task, and counsel for the applicant, Mr Ginges, submitted that this court, finding error, should determine that a lesser sentence is warranted and re-sentence the applicant in the exercise of its own discretion. Put shortly, it is said that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offences, in the manner in which he accumulated sentences, and in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	A subsidiary ground notes that his Honour fell into technical error in passing fixed term sentences in respect of counts 3 and 5, because a standard non-parole period was prescribed for each of those offences. That being so, they were among the offences set out in the Table to Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and the power conferred by s 45(1) of the Act to decline to set a non-parole period was not available in respect of them.
	


Objective gravity


	
	Mr Ginges referred to his Honour’s observation that “each offence is an example of the most serious criminal conduct”. He submitted that this amounted to a finding that each of the offences was at or towards the top of the range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind, and that his Honour failed to assess the objective gravity of each offence individually. He argued that a proper assessment of the objective gravity of each offence, by reference to offences of its kind, would have been the following:
	


Counts 1 & 3 (sexual intercourse by digital penetration) – below the mid-range of objective seriousness;

Count 5 (sexual intercourse without consent by digital penetration) – below the mid-range;

Count 2 (sexual intercourse by penetration with an object) and Count 4 (penile/vaginal sexual intercourse) – mid-range;

Count 6 (sexual intercourse without consent by anal penetration) – towards the upper end of the mid-range.


	
	Mr Ginges cited in support of his argument the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the court agreed) in AWKO v R [2010] NSWCCA 90. That was a case involving an offence which carried a standard non-parole period, in which the sentencing judge had classified the offence as “at least in the middle range of objective seriousness.” The Chief Judge observed at [14] that this assessment did not identify the extent to which the offence fell above the mid-range, and added:
	


“When an ambiguous expression is used by a sentencing judge it does not enable the offender or this Court to understand the sentencing judge’s conclusion as to the seriousness of the offence which is fundamental to the sentence which was ultimately imposed.”

In support of that proposition, the Chief Judge referred to the statement of Howie J to the same effect in R v Knight & Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283, 176 A Crim R 338, at [39] (346).


	
	However, these observations must be understood in their context. Knight & Biuvanua was also a case involving an offence which carried a standard non-parole period. In both cases the court was focusing upon the standard non-parole period provisions in Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: in particular, s 54A(2) which, as it then stood, provided that the standard non-parole period represented the non-parole period for an offence “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” for the offences specified in the Table to the Division. (That subsection and other provisions in Div 1A were amended in 2013, following the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120.) The two decisions were among a number of authorities requiring the sentencing judge in standard non-parole period cases to specify with some particularity where the objective seriousness of an offence lay in relation to the mid-range. That approach arose from the “two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences”, in which the standard non-parole period played a pivotal role, which was rejected by the High Court in Muldrock: at [27]-[31] (132-3).
	
	
	This is not to deny the necessity, which has long been recognised, of a sentencing judge to assess the objective gravity of the offence or offences for which sentence is to be passed. That is what his Honour did in the passages of his remarks on sentence to which I have referred at [9]-[11] above. True it is that his Honour’s observations related to the offences globally, without considering them individually. Nevertheless, as the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, it is apparent from the sentences passed that his Honour did consider the objective gravity of each of them. I accept the Crown prosecutor’s submission that no further elaboration of the objective seriousness of the offences was required.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


Accumulation


	
	Mr Ginges did not take issue with the sentences passed for each offence, or with the need for partial accumulation of them. His complaint was the manner in which his Honour approached the accumulation, arguing that he had failed properly to apply the principle of totality. He referred to the observation of this court in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272, 164 A Crim R 481, at [13] (486) that the discretion to direct that one sentence is to be served cumulatively upon another “is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality.” He also cited the following passage from that judgment at [11] (also 486):
	


“[11]   One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616.”


	
	Mr Ginges referred to the summary of the principles governing the issues of accumulation and concurrence by Hall J in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52]. Relevantly for present purposes, his Honour said:
	


“[52] There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at 47. However, a number of propositions relevant to the consideration of that issue may be derived from the case law. They include the following:-

(1) It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality: Regina v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing.

(2) In Regina v Weldon; Regina v Carberry (2002) 136 A Crim R 55, Ipp JA at [48] stated that it is ‘not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed’ but his Honour observed that ‘this is not an inflexible rule’ and ‘[t]he practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct’.(3) The question as to whether sentences in respect of two or more offences committed in the course of a single episode or a criminal enterprise or on a particular day should be concurrent or at least partly accumulated is to be determined by the principle of totality and the relevant factors to be taken into account in the application of that principle. See observations in this respect of Howie J in Nguyen v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12].

(4) In applying the principle of totality, the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence. See generally Regina v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11] and [13], Cahyadi (supra) at [12] and [27] and Vaovasa v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 253.

(5) If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(6) If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(7) Whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other calls for the identification and an evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences. These will include the nature and seriousness of each offence.

                                                                                                 …

(9) Where two offences committed during the course of a single episode are of a completely different nature and each individually involved significant or extreme gravity, it is likely that some accumulation will be necessary to address the criminality of the two: Nguyen (supra) per Howie J at [13].

                                                                                                … .”


	
	It will be remembered that the sentence for count 2 (penetration by an object) was accumulated by 1 year upon the sentence for count 1 (digital penetration). The sentences for counts 3 and 5 (both digital penetration) were concurrent but were accumulated by a further year upon the sentence for count 2. The sentence for count 4 (penile/vaginal penetration) was accumulated upon the sentences for counts 3 and 5 by 2 years. Finally, the sentence for count 6 (penile/anal penetration) was accumulated upon the sentence for count 4 by 3 years.
	
	
	As refined in oral argument, Mr Ginges’ challenge was to the accumulation of the sentence for count 4 by 2 years and the further accumulation of the sentence for count 6 by 3 years. I should record two subsidiary arguments which can be disposed of immediately.
	
	
	He referred to the concurrent sentences for counts 3 and 5, noting that count 5 was the digital penetration which occurred on the same occasion as the anal penetration the subject of count 6. He argued that it would have been more appropriate to make the sentence for count 5 concurrent with that for count 6. That was an approach which was open to his Honour, but it was equally open to make the sentences on counts 5 and 3 concurrent because they both involved digital penetration. Whichever approach was taken would have made no practical difference.
	
	
	He noted that the sentence for count 3 was accumulated upon the sentence for count 1 by 2 years, whereas the sentence for count 2 was accumulated upon count 1 by only 1 year. He pointed out that count 2 involved penetration by an object, which might be seen as more serious than digital penetration. His argument, as I understood it, was that it was incongruous that the measure of accumulation of the sentence for count 3 upon the sentence for count 1 should be greater than that for count 2. This argument is misconceived. As I have said, what his Honour did was to accumulate count 2 upon count 1 by 1 year and accumulate count 3 upon count 2 by a further 1 year. For practical purposes, the measure of accumulation was the same. If Mr Ginges’ argument were accepted, the sentences for counts 2 and 3 would be concurrent.
	
	
	The gravamen of Mr Ginges’ argument was that there should have been less accumulation between the concurrent sentences for counts 3 and 5 and the sentence for count 4, and between the sentence for count 4 and the sentence for count 6. However, he did not demonstrate error in his Honour’s approach by reference to any of the principles summarised by Hall J in XX. Count 4, penile/vaginal intercourse, was a significant escalation of the pattern of criminality demonstrated by the first three counts, and the 2 year accumulation could not be said to be inappropriate. The same must be said of count 6, anal intercourse, which his Honour clearly saw as the most serious of all the offences. The sentence for that count was accumulated upon the sentence for count 4 by 3 years, although it commenced 2 years after the expiration of the concurrent sentences for counts 3 and 5. Those sentences are concurrent with the sentence for count 4 to the extent of 1 year.
	
	
	The measure by which his Honour accumulated the sentences was within the proper exercise of his discretion, and did not cause the sentencing process to miscarry. In answer to a question from the bench whether the total sentence would have been inappropriate if the sentences had been structured differently, Mr Ginges made it clear that there was no complaint of manifest excess. As he put it, if the total term had been passed as an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it would not “give rise to manifest excessiveness of the sentence as a ground of appeal.”
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Subjective case


	
	Mr Ginges acknowledged that his Honour had summarised the applicant’s subjective case in some detail in his remarks on sentence. He submitted, however, that his Honour did not explain how he had taken that material into account and, in particular, did not appear to have regard to:
	


the applicant’s significant mental health problems, which were present during the offending period;

his substance abuse and, in particular, his drug use which he described as “problematic” during the offending period;

his dysfunctional upbringing, including his lack of experience of love, and the relevance of this to his offending;

the likelihood that he had himself been sexually abused as a child and the impact that had on his offending;

the evidence of his remorse.


	
	As to the applicant’s mental health, as noted above, his Honour summarised the material in the psychological report: his longstanding depression and anxiety, his attempted suicide, and the counselling he had undergone from time to time over the years for that condition and his drug abuse. Mr Ginges submitted that this material raised the familiar principles governing the relevance of mental health to sentence summarised by Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]: in particular, that mental illness which contributes to the commission of an offence may reduce the offender’s moral culpability and the need for denunciation of the offence, may moderate the consideration of general deterrence, and may make custody weigh more heavily upon the offender. However, there was nothing in the material before his Honour, including the psychological report, which raised any of those considerations. Certainly, there is nothing to suggest that mental illness had any bearing upon the applicant’s longstanding pattern of offending.
	
	
	The applicant’s history of alcohol and, more particularly, drug abuse was also referred to by his Honour, together with his assertion that he had been affected by drugs or alcohol over the period of his offending. However, as the Crown prosecutor pointed out in written submissions, such material as there was about his substance abuse provided no explanation for his offending over the 4 year period, nor mitigate the gravity of his continuous abuse of the victim.
	
	
	The applicant admitted being sexually attracted to the child. In my view, his Honour correctly recorded his history of depression and substance abuse as a relevant part of his background, to be taken into account along with his dysfunctional upbringing and the lack of affection he suffered during it.
	
	
	His Honour did not mention the material, referred to at [19] above, about flashbacks raising a question whether the applicant himself had been the victim of sexual abuse. However, that material is so speculative that it is difficult to see how any weight could have been afforded to it. It seems that his Honour did not take it into account, an approach which was clearly available to him.
	
	
	As to remorse, Mr Ginges argued that his Honour failed to indicate how he took into account the evidence of remorse from the psychological report and in the applicant’s letter to his brother. This material, he said, met the requirements of remorse as a mitigating factor to be found in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	However, as I have said, his Honour did find “some evidence” of remorse in the psychological report. Ms Case reported his expression of remorse and his recognition of the detrimental effect of his behaviour upon the victim. However, the expression of remorse as it was recorded in the report, quoted at [18] above, was not entirely unqualified. He “guessed” that he thought his behaviour as abusive, adding that he also saw it “as love.”
	
	
	It is true that his Honour did not refer to the applicant’s letter to his brother, which was also capable of being seen as evidence of remorse. However, plainly enough he did find a measure of remorse on the part of the applicant, and the fact that he did not refer to the letter does not convey to me that he failed to give the evidence of remorse the weight it deserved.
	
	
	This ground also fails.
	


Standard non-parole period offences – counts 3 and 5


	
	It remains to consider how this court should deal with his Honour’s undoubted error in failing to pass a sentence with a non-parole period for each of counts 3 and 5. The options available to this court to deal with errors of that kind were considered by Johnson J in Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129, at [64]-[65]. In the present case the error is the subject of a ground of appeal, and it is appropriate that it be remedied.
	
	
	It appears to me that the 3 year term his Honour fixed in respect of each offence is what he would have considered an appropriate non-parole period. Whether that is how a fixed term should be arrived at was a question raised, but not resolved, by RA Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213, at [56]-[62]. Nor need it be resolved here. I would propose that the 3 year term for each offence be treated as a non-parole period and that a balance of term, complying with the statutory proportion, be added to it. This is consistent with the approach of this court in Aguirre v R [2010] NSWCCA 115, at [33]-[36], [114]. I would re-sentence the applicant on each count to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, dating from the day specified by his Honour. Both sentences would remain partly concurrent with the sentences on count 2 and count 4, and would leave the total sentence and effective non-parole period unchanged.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I would intervene only for the purpose of adjusting the sentences on counts 3 and 5. I would propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.

(2)   The sentences on counts 3 and 5 are quashed and, in lieu, on each count the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 2 August 2014 and expiring on 1 August 2017, and a balance of term of 1 year, commencing on 2 August 2017 and expiring on 1 August 2018.

(3)   The appeal is otherwise dismissed.

 


	
	RS Hulme AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J and with his Honour's reasons.

		28 May 2015",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766631,Regina v Yi-Hua Jiao [2015] NSWCCA 95,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The Crown has appealed, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), against the sentence imposed on the respondent, Ms Jiao, following her conviction of one offence of dealing with money, the value of which at the time of dealing was more than $100,000, that it was reasonable to suspect was the proceeds of crime (s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)).
	
	
	Ms Jiao pleaded not guilty to that charge. After a trial in the District Court commencing on 1 December 2014, the jury returned a guilty verdict on 17 December 2014. On 19 December 2014, Ms Jiao was sentenced. The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of her offending as falling just within the middle of the range for crimes such as this. His Honour also acknowledged that this was a serious offence and that general deterrence was an important factor. The maximum penalty for the offence of which Ms Jiao was convicted was imprisonment for 3 years and/or a fine of $30,600 (180 penalty units). The sentence imposed was a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months, to commence that day and to expire on 18 June 2015.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. In essence, the Crown contends that the sentence imposed did not reflect the seriousness of the offence created by s 400.9(1) nor the objective gravity of Ms Jiao’s offending and that it leaves no room for the differentiation in other cases, where there may be lesser criminality or greater mitigation than was present in Ms Jiao’s case. The Crown emphasises the importance of consistency in sentencing and guidance as to sentencing standards in respect of s 400.9(1) offences, given that the offence is of wide ranging application.
	


Background


	
	The conduct the subject of the offence occurred in January 2013. Ms Jiao, who holds both Taiwanese and New Zealand passports, flew to Sydney on 18 January 2013 from New Zealand. She was staying at the time at The Star casino in Sydney, where she apparently had a casino account.
	
	
	On 20 January 2013, Ms Jiao met a man later identified as Mr Thi Nguyen at The Star casino. She did not know him. Ms Jiao identified herself to Mr Nguyen by exchanging with him an AU$5 bank note with a known serial number. It is accepted by Ms Jiao, though there was no finding of fact on this issue, that there was evidence before the jury that this method of identification was common practice when cash was passed between criminal syndicates and money laundering syndicates. The sentencing judge must have been referring to this at [15] of his reasons when taking into account the “use of the process of identification”. On the Crown’s case, this was a significant matter going to the objective seriousness of the offending as it meant that the crime was one involving a degree of planning and contemplation.
	
	
	Once the identification was made, Ms Jiao accompanied Mr Nguyen to the casino car park and collected a sports bag from him. The couple then attended Ms Jiao’s hotel room for a short period of time where, according to his Honour’s understanding of the evidence, the bag was opened (see [4] of the reasons for sentence). His Honour referred to a backpack covered with a plastic bag. It contained Australian currency. Ms Jiao then went to the Sovereign Room at The Star and deposited the money, amounting to $624,340, into her casino account. His Honour noted that there was evidence from a relatively senior member of the casino staff as to the condition of the money: namely, that many of the bank notes were not in good condition; they were in some way soiled and gritty; and they were not wrapped in a way consistent with the way a bank would wrap currency (at [5]).
	
	
	Ms Jiao requested that $200,000 of the funds in her casino account be transferred to a Commonwealth Bank of Australia account in Brisbane in the name of a money remitter. The casino staff declined that request on the basis that they were entitled only to transfer money into accounts held in the name of the customer, but Ms Jiao was informed that she could withdraw cash and make a deposit into the nominated bank account directly. On 21 January 2013, Ms Jiao withdrew $300,000 in cash and took it to the Pyrmont branch of the Commonwealth Bank.
	
	
	Meanwhile, casino staff had notified the Australian Federal Police. Ms Jiao was arrested at the bank, being in possession of $300,000 in cash and the deposit and withdrawal slips from the casino as well as two mobile phones.
	
	
	Ms Jiao was interviewed by the Australian Federal Police. His Honour noted that Ms Jiao appeared to be co-operative and forthcoming with information. The Crown accepts that, during conversation with the police officers, Ms Jiao made statements to the effect that the cash belonged to a Mr Liu, whom she did not know and did not know how to contact; that she was depositing the cash into her Commonwealth Bank account before transferring it to another Commonwealth Bank account in the name of Anna Yu, that being an account of a money remitter who could release the funds in China once the money had been deposited; that the money was to be sent to a customer of her brother’s travel business in Taiwan; and that she worked at a money remittance business located in New Zealand which was managed by her son, Charles Harsono.
	
	
	The Crown notes that Ms Jiao later participated in an electronically recorded interview during which she made statements to the effect that the money exchange was facilitated by her elder brothers in Hong Kong; that her brothers had arranged for her to receive $625,000 from an unknown male at The Star who would identify her by the name “Jacqueline” and through the serial number of a $5 note in her possession; and that her brothers wanted her to send half the money to China.
	
	
	The Crown also notes that examination of the mobile telephones found in Ms Jiao’s possession at the time of her arrest revealed a number of text messages from her son, Charles Harsono, with instructions to Ms Jiao to make cash deposits including into a Commonwealth Bank account in the name of Anna Yu.
	
	
	Ms Jiao pleaded not guilty. She gave evidence at the trial as did her brother (Mr Shou Cheng Jiao) and two of her sons, Charles and William Harsono. Transcript of the hearing was not before this Court.
	
	
	Ms Jiao sought to defend the charge pursuant to s 400.9(5) of the Criminal Code on the basis that she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the money the subject of the charge was derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from unlawful activity.
	
	
	Her case at trial, as outlined in the Crown’s submissions on this appeal from which Ms Jiao does not demur, was that the Australian currency the subject of the charge had been obtained by her brother (Mr Sheng Chou Jiao) in order that one of Ms Jiao’s sons (William), who had operated a coffee cart in Taiwan, might move to Australia and open another such business in Sydney and so that Mr Jiao might purchase a “ranch” as a retirement property in Australia. It was asserted that the means by which Ms Jiao was to be identified by the possessor of the currency (i.e., Mr Nguyen), namely the use of the particular $5 note, was because Ms Jiao had told her brother that she was gambling and that it was inconvenient for her to leave the gaming tables and go to her hotel room (in The Star) to arrange some other form of identification such as her passport. Pausing here, it must be noted that such an explanation for the adoption of this process of identification was inherently implausible since Ms Jiao had to leave the gaming tables in any event to collect the sports bag from the car park, take it to her hotel room and then return to the Sovereign Room to deposit the cash.
	
	
	The Crown notes that Ms Jiao’s evidence was that, on taking receipt of the money, she banked it into her account held with The Star in order to increase her chances of obtaining further “perks” from the casino. The defence case was that the very same day after she took receipt of the Australian currency Mr Jiao happened to require those funds back in China, that Mr Jiao had made contact with her son Charles (who, as noted above, carried on business in New Zealand as a money remitter) in order to ask for him to arrange it to be transferred back to China to be converted to RMB currency and that Charles then made arrangements for the transfer of the money and communicated them to Ms Jiao.
	
	
	The submissions on sentence made on behalf of Ms Jiao (MFI 56 in the District Court) included that Ms Jiao believed, all the time until told otherwise by her brother, that the money would be banked into her bank account and that she believed that the money belonged to her brother “through a money remittance transaction”.
	
	
	The Crown points out, and Ms Jiao accepts, that there was no information provided by the defence at the trial as to the origin of the money other than an assertion that it had been “purchased” by Ms Jiao’s brother.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted (at [10]) that the issue raised by the s 400.9(5) defence was squarely put before the jury and that it had rejected that defence by the verdict of guilty which it returned. For Ms Jiao it is here submitted that, although the jury rejected her defence, it did not necessarily reject her evidence (confirmed by that of her brother) that she had acted at the request of her brother and that there was no evidence that Ms Jiao was involved in a wider criminal enterprise. There were, however, no findings of fact to that effect by the sentencing judge.
	


Money laundering provisions


	
	Section 400.9(1) of the Code provides that:
	


A person commits an offence if:

(a)   the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)   it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c)   at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more

Penalty: Imprisonment for three years, or 180 penalty units, or both.


	
	Absolute liability applies to the elements in subss 1(b) and (c) (see s 400.9(4)). For an offence under s 400.9, there is no fault element and hence no requirement to prove any knowledge or belief on the part of the accused that the money was the proceeds of crime (Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276 at [42]).
	
	
	The Crown emphasises that the legislature has drawn a distinction in s 400.9 between offences involving dealing with money or property the value of which is $100,000 or more (s 400.9(1)), in respect of which a maximum penalty of 3 years’ imprisonment and/or 180 penalty units is imposed, and offences involving dealing with money or property less than $100,000 (s 400.9(1A)), in respect of which the maximum penalty is imprisonment of 2 years and/or 120 penalty units. That distinction was introduced into the legislation on 19 March 2010. (Neither the second reading speech nor the explanatory memorandum for the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009 (Cth), which led to the 2010 amendments to s 400.9, provides any useful assistance in the present case.)
	
	
	The Crown points to the increase in the maximum gaol term and the greater maximum fine as indicating that an offence involving a dealing with money of $100,000 or more is regarded by the legislature as being substantially more serious than one involving amounts below $100,000 and submits that the paramount consideration in sentencing for a s 400.9(1) offence is the amount of money or property involved in the dealing.
	
	
	The Crown notes that the structure of the Federal money laundering offences in the Criminal Code is one whereby the maximum penalty rises according to a combination of the amount of money or other property involved and (though this is not relevant for a s 400.9 offence) the degree of culpability by reference to the offender’s state of mind or intended use of the money or property.
	
	
	In Shi v R, Bellew J, with whom Leeming JA and Fullerton J agreed, said (at [45]) that the structure of Division 400 of the Criminal Code, in which s 400.9(1) appears, is such that the offence created by s 400.9(1) falls at the lowest end of the scale (of money laundering offences). The Crown submits that this is not strictly accurate, having regard to the fact that the maximum penalty for a s 400.9(1) offence is equivalent to or exceeds a number of the offences created by other sections of the Criminal Code in Division 400. That this is so is evident by reference to the matrix appended to these reasons. It can be seen that for the offences in ss 400.3 – 400.8 the maximum penalty rises not only as the value of the money or property dealt with increases, but also according to whether the offender is negligent, or reckless, or has a belief or intention as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	So, for example, the maximum penalty for an offence under s 400.5(3) (dealing with $50,000 or more where the person is negligent as to the status or intended use of the money) is the same as that specified for an offence under s 400.9(1) – the relevant difference being that for the latter offence there is no requirement of negligence, but the monetary threshold is doubled. (Section 400.9 also applies only to a dealing with money or property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime, not to a dealing where there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime.) Once the monetary threshold is reduced to $10,000 or more, the maximum penalty for a negligent dealing is less than that provided for an offence under s 400.9(1) (see s 400.6(3)); once it is reduced to $1,000 or more, the maximum penalties for both reckless and negligent dealing are less than for the s 400.9(1) offence (ss 400.7(2) and (3)); and all of the offences under s 400.8 (dealing with money or property of any value), whether done negligently, recklessly or with the prescribed belief or intention, carry a lesser penalty than a s 400.9(1) offence.
	
	
	Presumably, the statement in Shi v R to the effect that s 400.9 falls at the lowest end of the scale of money laundering offences was drawing a distinction between those offences in which there is a fault element and the s 400.9 offences in which no fault element is required. However, in strict penalty terms, the offence under s 400.9(1) is at least at the level of seriousness as those referred to in [25] above. The Crown submits that, on any view of the legislation, s 400.9 is a very serious offence involving a departure from the common law concept of offending because there is no element of mens rea.
	
	
	There are a number of general statements in the cases concerning money laundering offences and the mischief to which they are directed. Most of these cases concerned offences under s 400.3 or s 400.4 of the Criminal Code, and thus additional considerations were addressed to those which arise under s 400.9.
	
	
	Some general statements are contained in R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 at 200-204 [16]-[42] (concerning ss 400.3 – 400.7); R v Guo; R v Qian [2010] NSWCCA 170; 201 A Crim R 403 at 414-418 [84]-[91] (concerning s 400.4); Majeed v R [2013] VSCA 40 at [34]-[40] (s.400.3); Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276 at [43]-[50] (s 400.9 offences after the 2010 amendments); and Almada v R [2015] NSWCCA 19 at [34]-[37] (again an offence under s 400.9 after the 2010 amendments).
	
	
	More generally, this Court in Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24; 259 FLR 42 (at [134]) adopted the following observations of Johnson J in his pre-trial decision of 19 August 2010 (R v Milne (No 1) [2010] NSWSC 932; 260 FLR 166 at [161]-[164]):
	


[161]   When provisions such as the money laundering offences contained in section 400 Criminal Code Act 1995 are enacted, it is clear that care must be exercised by a prosecutor in their use. As the authorities to which I have referred make clear, the money laundering provisions are broad with a capacity to extend to a wide range of circumstances. By their nature, they are likely to be intertwined with other criminal conduct.

[162]   By the enactment of these provisions, the Commonwealth has determined that criminal offences of this type are necessary to deal with the wide range of conduct which has manifested itself in contemporary society, with consequences adverse to the public interest including the revenue.

...

[164]    At a Commonwealth level, the money laundering offences in section 400 constitute a 21st century response to antisocial and criminal conduct commonly with international elements.


	
	The High Court quashed the s 400.3 conviction in Milne on an issue of construction concerning the term “instrument of crime” (Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149) referring to the money laundering provisions in general terms (at [7]-[14]).
	
	
	What is clear from Shi v R and the other authorities referred to above is that money laundering offences are regarded as very serious offences in respect of which the need for general deterrence is of particular significance. In the present case, his Honour accepted that general deterrence was an important factor to take into account ([12]).
	
	
	In passing sentence for a s 400.9(1) offence, the sentence or order ought be of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence (s 16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)), taking into account, insofar as is known to the court, the nature and circumstances of the offence (s 16A(2)(a)).
	
	
	Care is required to be taken so as not to breach the principles in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 at 389. In imposing sentence, the court is entitled to consider all the conduct of the offender, including that which would aggravate the offence, but is not permitted to take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence (see also Shi v R at [47]-[48]).
	
	
	At the same time, care is required to avoid a type of reverse De Simoni error, by taking into account on sentence for a s 400.9 offence the absence of features which would have rendered the offender liable to conviction for another money laundering offence punishable by a greater penalty. The point is illustrated in R v Guo; R v Qian at 419 [99]:
	


With respect to Mr Guo, an assessment of the objective seriousness of his crime involves consideration of factors referred to in the authorities set out at [85]-[91] above. Mr Guo dealt with an amount of $716,394.73. There was a significant degree of planning and deceit involved in the commission of his offence. Although he pleaded guilty to an offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime under s 400.4(2), the level of criminality involved for that offence may be characterised appropriately as high. It should be kept in mind that the maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment in s 400.4(2) applies only to offences of recklessness to a risk that the money was the proceeds of crime. It does not assist Mr Guo to contend that his crime was one involving recklessness rather than belief or intention that the money was the proceeds of crime, as the latter conduct constitutes a separate and more serious offence under s 400.4(1) with a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.

And see R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195; 234 A Crim R 324 at 335 [49]-[52].

Primary judgment


	
	When considering the objective seriousness of Ms Jiao’s offence, his Honour took into account that this was “not a fleeting or transitory” transaction, though observing in this context that it was not as serious as behaviour which might occur over some weeks ([13]); that the money involved was over six times the monetary threshold for the offence ([14]); and that the transaction as found by the jury was “obviously done” in circumstances where it was objectively reasonable to suspect that the money was the proceeds of crime ([15]). His Honour considered that the latter conclusion followed from the condition of the bank notes and the process of identification that had been adopted.
	
	
	His Honour made clear that, in taking into consideration that it was objectively reasonable to conclude that the money was the proceeds of crime, he was not attributing any subjective intention to Ms Jiao (see [15]). (It should be noted that the submissions on sentence for Ms Jiao had nevertheless emphasised that Ms Jiao had “honestly believed she was doing nothing wrong in taking the money”, had “not necessarily appreciat[ed] she was committing an offence”, and that, while found guilty, she still believed “that as far as she was concerned she was dealing with her brother’s money”.)
	
	
	His Honour concluded (at [16]) that the offence did not fall at the lowest end of this kind of offending, because of the amount involved and the fact that it was over a couple of days, but said that it was “far from the most serious example of this crime and probably falls just within the middle of the range of seriousness for crimes such as this” (my emphasis). The Crown does not challenge that finding, though it had contended in the District Court that the objective gravity of Ms Jiao’s offending was greater than mid-range. Similarly, Ms Jiao, while contending in her written submissions that his Honour’s finding was in substance a finding that this was at the bottom end of the mid-range of seriousness, conceded in oral submissions that in this appeal she could not so contend in the absence of an application by Ms Jiao for leave to appeal against sentence. (This Court was informed during the course of oral submissions that Ms Jiao has lodged an appeal against conviction but no attempt was made to bring this before the Court at the time of the hearing of the Crown appeal. On 7 May 2015, the Registrar was informed that the appeal was to be abandoned.)
	
	
	His Honour noted that Ms Jiao was not entitled to any discount for an early plea of guilty ([17]); that the Crown had acknowledged that Ms Jiao’s prospects of rehabilitation must be good, this being her first offence and the police acknowledging that there was no record of any other criminal behaviour on her part ([18]); and that Ms Jiao was a foreign national with no family here ([20]). His Honour accepted that there was no victim as such and that there was no actual loss because the money was confiscated ([21]). His Honour also accepted the submission for Ms Jiao that the offence was “relatively unsophisticated” and accepted that it was unlikely that Ms Jiao would re-offend ([21]).
	
	
	The Crown takes issue with the proposition that the offending was relatively unsophisticated having regard to the planning and contemplation involved in the use of the $5 bank note for identification, but again does not challenge that finding on this appeal.
	
	
	His Honour took into account that it appeared Ms Jiao was cooperative in her interview with the police as well as her age (55 at the time), the fact that she was a foreign national for whom a custodial sentence would be difficult, and the fact that she had no previous convictions ([23]).
	
	
	Having had regard to comparative cases, relevantly Shi v R, Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159 and Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41, and noting the importance of general deterrence and the fact that both the legislature and the courts regard this kind of offence as very serious, his Honour concluded that an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances was one of 6 months’ imprisonment.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence disclose no patent error of law and that, to succeed on appeal, the Crown must establish that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-1 [25]). In R v Bugmy (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 322, Bathurst CJ (at [12]) said that it was necessary to establish that the sentence was outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed, such that the appellate court concludes there must have been some misapplication of principle even though when or how is not apparent from the statement of reasons (citing Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538-9 [59] and Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605-6 [58]).
	
	
	The Crown also accepts that, being a Crown appeal on sentence, the primary purpose of the appeal is not the correction of error in this particular case but the laying down of principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons. This purpose will be satisfied if it can be demonstrated that, while the sentencing judge made no error of principle when sentencing, the sentence imposed nevertheless fell outside the range of sentences legitimately available (citing Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326).
	
	
	The Crown submits that in the present case the sentencing discretion has miscarried in the sense that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust, especially having regard to: the amount of money involved (just over six times the monetary threshold for the relevant offence); the conduct of Ms Jiao; his Honour’s characterisation of this as being offending in the middle range of seriousness; and the absence of any substantial mitigation beyond that of prior good character.
	
	
	As to Ms Jiao’s conduct, reliance is placed by the Crown on the fact that her role was (as Ms Jiao concedes) more than simply that of the receipt and deposit of the money. The Crown points to the element of planning involved in Ms Jiao flying to Australia and the arrangement of the $5 note identification process. The Crown also submits that, while the offence was not part of long running criminal conduct over many months, Ms Jiao’s offence involved more than a single episode, noting that there was time for contemplation between the receipt of the money and Ms Jiao’s successive attempts to transfer the money.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the description by his Honour of the role and involvement of Ms Jiao as not “fleeting or transitory” did not adequately address what the conduct actually was and contends that Ms Jiao had a considerable and intimate involvement with the money in that: she received the money in “less than straightforward” circumstances, she banked it into her account and she then took steps to transfer the money the next day. It is submitted that the conduct bore all the hallmarks of a professional money laundering arrangement for the remittal of the money under a cloak of respectability.
	
	
	For Ms Jiao, it is submitted that, despite the amount involved, Ms Jiao’s actions were “relatively brief and transparent”. Emphasis is placed on the fact that her dealing with the money took place over a short period (and that, had it not been a Sunday when she received the money, it could otherwise have occurred all on the one day); that the dealing was unsophisticated in nature, in that Ms Jiao used her own name not a false name and used an account in her name; that the offence was not at her own instigation (though there was no finding expressly as to this); and that it involved only one course of dealing with only one bundle of cash, with no attempt to “structure” the money through gambling or to “wash the money” by exchanging it for gambling chips (though it must be noted that there was in a sense the “washing” of money through its deposit into Ms Jiao’s casino account and subsequent withdrawal). Use of the $5 note identification procedure also belies the suggestion of an unsophisticated transaction.
	
	
	Insofar as the Crown submits that Ms Jiao’s role was more than that of a “bagman” or “mule”, it should be noted that in the context of drug supply and importation offences it is recognised that problems may emerge when a sentencing court attempts to categorise the role of the offender in the drug enterprise (as principal, courier, drug mule or the like) since in many cases the full nature and extent of the enterprise is unlikely to be known to the court (see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 279 [19]; R v Lee [2007] NSWCCA 234 at [25]; R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 126 [72](b)). In The Queen v Olbrich, it was said at 279 [19] that “[c]haracterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did”.
	
	
	In the same way, description of Ms Jiao’s offence as being “relatively unsophisticated” (as his Honour accepted at [21]) tends to mask or blur fact finding and assessment of objective gravity in this case. This is particularly so as that characterisation was adopted without a more complete recital of the facts and evidence, including the expert evidence concerning the use of the $5 bank note’s serial number.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission that the criminality of Ms Jiao’s offence was nowhere near the lowest end of this kind of offence (having regard not only to the amount of money and time period involved but also to the degree of Ms Jiao’s involvement, including in conduct that, according to the expert evidence adduced at the hearing, fell squarely within well recognised practices engaged in for the purposes of money laundering) must be accepted.
	
	
	The Crown further submits that there was no substantial mitigation beyond evidence of prior good character. In this regard, Ms Jiao points to the degree to which she cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence. It was not disputed that, but for Ms Jiao volunteering information as to the use of the $5 note for identification purposes, this would not have been known to the authorities. Insofar as the use of that process was a significant factor in leading to the objective conclusion that the money was reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, Ms Jiao’s co-operation with the authorities therefore seems to have been a critical element in the proof of the offence with which she was charged.
	


Comparative cases


	
	Both parties refer to comparative cases in support of their opposing submissions as to the sentence imposed on Ms Jiao. The Crown submits that when the s 400.9(1) offences in these cases are considered in isolation of the other offending there also being considered, it is clear that the sentence imposed on Ms Jiao was not consistent with the sentences imposed in those other cases.
	
	
	In Shi v R, the offender pleaded guilty to ten offences contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code and one offence contrary to s 400.9(1A) of the Criminal Code. The offender’s involvement was simply to receive and bank the money, with no element of transmission. She was found to be a low level participant in the criminal enterprise (a dispensable tool) with no autonomy. She had no prior criminal history and expressed remorse for her actions.
	
	
	There was a much greater amount of money in total (around $35 million) and the amount of money involved in the respective individual offending transactions was, on all but two or three of the eleven counts significantly greater than the amount in question in the present case. Relevantly, however, the Crown points to counts 1 and 3, which related to dealings with moneys around the same as that in the present case ($772,450 and $532,950 respectively). Ms Shi was sentenced in respect of each of those offences counts to terms of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months (the overall sentence imposed being 5 years and 6 months). On appeal from her sentence, Ms Shi was re-sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of 1 year and 3 months in respect of the respective s 400.9(1) offences (with no change to the 9 month sentence imposed in respect of the s 400.9(1A) offence). The Crown notes that this represented a sentence of just over 40% of the maximum penalty after the application of a combined discount of 30% (25% in respect of a plea of guilty and 5% for assistance).
	
	
	In Ms Shi’s case the assistance led directly to the discovery of a large quantity of cash and the arrest and prosecution of another offender (see [95]) and its significance was found to have been understated by the sentencing judge. In the present case, the assistance did not result in the prosecution of Mr Nguyen but Ms Jiao’s co-operation was clearly instrumental in leading to her own conviction.
	
	
	There was no need for the court to determine Ms Shi’s contention that the sentences that had been imposed were manifestly excessive, given that other of her grounds of appeal were made out. Nevertheless it is instructive to note that on re-sentencing the reduction in her individual sentences was a period of 3 months. In contrast, in the present case, in an offence involving a similar sum to those which were the subject of counts 1 and 3 in Ms Shi’s case, Ms Jiao received a 6 month sentence without the benefit of any discount for an early plea. The Crown submits that Ms Jiao’s conduct was objectively more serious overall and that the sophistication of the wider criminal enterprise in Ms Shi’s case is irrelevant because Ms Shi’s own role was non-autonomous, limited to receipt and deposit of the money.
	
	
	In Assafiri v R, the offender pleaded guilty to three counts of making a false statement and one count of possession of property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1) (the applicable maximum penalty of imprisonment there being 2 years). The sentencing judge was asked to take into account 19 further offences of money laundering as well as a mixture of State and Federal offences relating to the use of false identification or false statements in order to perpetrate the money laundering offences. The relevant offence for present purposes was the single s 400.9(1) offence which the Crown notes related to possession at a single point in time.
	
	
	While that conduct was part of protracted criminal offending over a period of six months using false identities in which the offender acquired two companies, opened five bank accounts, one in the name of one of his false identities and two in the name of each of the companies, the s 400.9 offence related to the possession of a sum totalling $290,020, around half the amount involved in the present case. It was accepted at the sentencing hearing that the offender did not own the money that he had transferred (relevant to the other charges) and that he was acting on behalf of another person. There was no discount for assistance (since the effectiveness of his assistance to the authorities was minimal).
	
	
	Mr Assafiri had pleaded guilty. He was of prior good character and it was accepted that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The sentencing judge had imposed a penalty of 9 months imprisonment for the s 400.9(1) offence. On appeal, that sentence was quashed and a penalty of 6 months’ imprisonment (25% of the applicable maximum term of imprisonment) was imposed. The Crown submits that this was a considerably lesser offence, at a single point in time, and Mr Assafiri had the benefit of a discount for his guilty plea, yet the period of imprisonment in the present case was the same.
	
	
	In Cahyadi v R, the applicable maximum term of imprisonment was again 2 years. The amount of money involved for the purposes of the s 400.9 offence was $155,600. The offender, who had pleaded guilty, had a criminal record for dishonesty and had used a false name to enter the country. The dealing in question related simply to the possession of the money but there was evidence that the offender was in possession of a computer program for making false passports and false driver’s licences, as well as several passport size photographs of a different person (relevant to other of the offences for which he was convicted). The offender had opened a false bank account and over just under a three month period that had been used on nine occasions to send $89,100 to an account in Indonesia, but the relevant s 400.9 offence related to bare possession of the moneys suspected of being proceeds of crime. The offender was sentenced to 1 year’s imprisonment.
	
	
	Finally, reference is made to Almada v R where the offending conduct occurred on a single occasion over a relatively short period of time, the quantum involved was just over double the minimum threshold of $100,000, and there was a plea of guilty. The offender had a prior criminal record for a few relatively minor matters but was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time. He had a longstanding drug use problem. His guilt in respect of a further offence (attempting to move out of Australia without a report a sum of cash exceeding $10,000) was taken into account at the same time. Mr Almada was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months with release on entry into a recognizance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act to be of good behaviour for a period of 3 years. This Court was clearly of the view that the sentence could not be characterised as manifestly excessive and refused leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Having regard to the above cases, the Crown submits that his Honour in effect sentenced Ms Jiao as if her offending was at the lowest end of the range of offences of this kind and that this was not the correct way to characterise the seriousness of her offence (namely this being in the middle of the range of seriousness) and was manifestly inadequate in the absence of any substantial mitigation beyond prior good character. The Crown argues that such a sentence leaves little room for a sentence of appropriate severity to have been imposed had the criminality been lesser or had there been any substantial mitigation present.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the key issue when sentencing for a s 400.9 offence is the amount of money involved, noting that in the present case the threshold was exceeded by more than six times, though noting the other matters identified as relevant by Barr AJ in R v Li at 204 [41]:
	


… It seems to me, without undervaluing the importance of the principal differentiating factors – minimum value of money or property and state of mind – that each case will have other variables that appear on sentence. Perhaps the most important will be an exact appreciation of what the offender did, what acts he performed and with what authority and over what period of time. The total value of money or property involved will be important, and whether the money or property belonged to the offender or to another. The degree of planning or deceit that led to the commission of the offence and whether actual loss resulted, and the extent of such loss, will be important. …


	
	Ms Jiao submitted that there was a significant disparity between her criminality and that of the other offenders in the comparable cases referred to on sentence, where the offences took place over a period of months, with “sustained criminal offending with much subterfuge”. In that regard, Ms Jiao pointed to the protracted nature of the criminal offending and use of false identities in Assafiri v R; the fact that in Cahyadi v R the offence was part of a “bigger picture” and the offender had a criminal record for dishonesty and had operated a false bank account; and that in Shi v R, there was a sustained period of offending over a period of two months involving multiple transactions and large amounts of money as part of a sophisticated “black money” scheme. In contrast, emphasis is placed on Ms Jiao’s co-operation with the police and the authorities.
	


Conclusion


	
	The importance of consistency in sentencing was emphasised by Gleeson CJ in Wong v The Queen, approved in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen. A review of the comparative cases shows a marked absence of consistency between the sentences there imposed and that which was imposed on Ms Jiao.
	
	
	Ms Jiao does not dispute that money laundering is a serious offence; that the amount of money involved is a paramount consideration; and that general deterrence is important. It is conceded that Ms Jiao played a significant role in the offending in this case and that she was certainly more than a “bag person” or mere courier. In that regard, it is accepted that Ms Jiao was not in the same position as Ms Shi who did no more than to receive money and deposit it.
	
	
	While emphasis is placed on the “one-off” nature of the offending, it is conceded that what Ms Jiao was doing only came to an end because of the intervention of the police. Ms Jiao stressed the unsophisticated nature of the offence and that her involvement was at the instigation of her family members (who gave evidence at her trial). It is conceded that the defence case did not grapple at all with the origin of the money, as opposed to the intended use of the money.
	
	
	For Ms Jiao it is submitted that the sentence of 6 months was adequate. That submission cannot be accepted. The money involved was six times above the monetary threshold. Ms Jiao’s involvement went beyond mere possession of the money or mere receipt and deposit thereof, though it was not part of an ongoing or protracted criminal enterprise. The offence included an element of planning (by reference to the use of the $5 note identification procedure). Ms Jiao actively took steps to divert the money. No discount was available by reference to a guilty plea. Having regard to the importance of general deterrence in the context of money laundering offences, a sentence of imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence in this case and a significantly longer period of imprisonment was required.
	
	
	We are satisfied that the sentence imposed on Ms Jiao was well outside the range of sentences appropriate in all the objective and subjective circumstances of the case, and having regard to the importance of general deterrence on sentence. The Crown has made good the claim of manifest inadequacy.
	


Residual discretion


	
	The Court retains the residual discretion to decline to intervene with the sentence below even where it is found to be manifestly inadequate (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [1]-[2]).
	
	
	In CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 317 ALR 308, the High Court made it clear that it is for the Crown, when asserting manifest inadequacy, to negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised (referring to the analysis of Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, in R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451 at 458 [12]).
	
	
	The Crown submits that in the present case there is no apparent reason why the residual discretion not to interfere should be exercised. Reference is made to the factors that were considered in R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81, albeit in relation to a different offence. There, this Court took into account that there had been no relevant delay in either the institution of the Crown appeal or the period within which there was likely to be a resolution of the Crown appeal. The same is the case here. The lodgement of the Crown appeal against sentence was some 11 working days after the sentence was imposed and the matter has been heard with expedition.
	
	
	In R v Harris, the Court also took into account that the Crown did not make any submissions relevantly different from those made to the sentencing judge and that the error made by the sentencing judge was not the result of any misstatement of the law or facts or any erroneous submission made by the Crown (at [65]). Again, that is the case here save that there has been some further elaboration of the structure of the offences in Division 400 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The Crown submits that there is no compelling reason to decline to intervene.
	
	
	In her submissions in response, Ms Jiao points to the nature and severity of the conditions imposed by a prison sentence (referring to s 16A(3) of the Crimes Act) having regard to her age (almost 58) and the fact that she is a foreign national from New Zealand separated from her long term partner, who resides in New Zealand, and her family (submissions p 7). It is submitted that the imposition of further custodial time would be onerous and that this is not warranted. Ms Jiao submits that general deterrence is addressed by a prison sentence having been imposed and that she should not be penalised for defending the charge. As to the last submission, the suggestion that Ms Jiao has been or would be penalised for defending the charge by the imposition of a custodial sentence is unwarranted. Relevantly, the consequence of her defending the charge was that no discount for an early guilty plea was applicable, as his Honour noted.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any distress or hardship, beyond that which one would expect someone in Ms Jiao’s position to suffer, as a result of Ms Jiao’s custodial sentence, or as a result of the prospect that a sentence of imprisonment might be increased if the Crown appeal succeeds. Insofar as she is a foreign national, the Crown does not submit that this carries no weight, but submits that in the circumstances it carries little weight – Ms Jiao having come to this country for the purpose of committing the offence (R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 239). As to the submission based on Ms Jiao being otherwise of good character, the Crown submits that this has limited weight where general deterrence is so important.
	


Conclusion


	
	The sentence imposed was well outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed consistent with the objective seriousness of the offending properly found and the importance of the need for general deterrence. The Crown has discharged the onus of negating any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised. The sentence passed was manifestly inadequate and a substantial increase is warranted.
	
	
	Taking into account the matters referred to at [69] above, but also noting that Ms Jiao’s co-operation with the authorities provided information that must have been instrumental to the objective conclusion that the money involved was reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, the appropriate course is to re-sentence Ms Jiao to a term of imprisonment for 16 months commencing on 19 December 2014 with release after 12 months upon entry by Ms Jiao into a recognizance under s 19AC of the Crimes Act to be of good behaviour for a period of 4 months. Such a sentence will maintain consistency with sentencing for like offences and allow room for appropriate differentiation in cases where there is a lesser degree of criminality and/or substantial mitigation.
	
	
	Ms Jiao will be re-sentenced accordingly. The Court orders will be as follows.
	


Order

1.   The appeal is upheld.

2.   The sentence is quashed.

3.   Ms Jiao is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 months commencing on 19 December 2014 and is to be released on 19 December 2015 upon Ms Jiao entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 4 months expiring on 18 March 2016.

2766632,R v Spicer [2015] NSWSC 519,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The deceased Katherine Foreman died at her home in the early hours of 27 October 2011, when the upstairs bedroom in which she was sleeping was set alight. The fire engulfed the home and the deceased was later found lying on the landing at the top of the stairs. It is not in dispute that petrol was poured inside the bedroom and ignited.
	
	
	Bernard Justin Spicer was indicted upon a charge alleging that on 27 October 2011 at Corrimal in the State of New South Wales he did murder Katherine Foreman. A jury found Mr Spicer guilty of the murder of the deceased on 5 December 2014 following a trial in Sydney that commenced on 17 November 2014. A plea of guilty to an additional charge of break, enter and commit an indictable offence had earlier been rejected by the Crown.
	
	
	The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies. In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 54B(2) and (3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).
	
	
	In performing the acts that led to the death of the deceased Mr Spicer acted in varying respects either directly in the company, or to an extent contemporaneously with the actions, of three other people. They have already either pleaded guilty to, or have been found guilty of, the murder of the deceased. They are Wendy Anne Evans, Bradley Max Rawlinson and Michelle Sharon Proud. Ms Evans pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased on 14 June 2013. A jury found Mr Rawlinson and Ms Proud guilty of the murder of the deceased on 11 April 2014 following a trial. On 28 July 2014 I sentenced them as follows:
	


1. Wendy Anne Evans to a term of imprisonment of 24 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2035, with a non-parole period of 18 years expiring on 20 December 2029.

2. Bradley Rawlinson to a term of imprisonment of 36 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2047, with a non-parole period of 27 years expiring on 20 December 2038.

3. Michelle Proud to a term of imprisonment of 20 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2031, with a non-parole period of 14 years expiring on 20 December 2025.


	
	The factual background to these proceedings is inexorably linked to these prisoners and to their respective involvement in the death of the deceased. It is therefore inevitable in describing matters relevant to Mr Spicer’s role that some reference to these people and to what they did will be necessary.
	


Factual findings


	
	I acknowledge that my fact-finding role is that described in Isaacs v R (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587. I am required to find the facts material to the sentence. To the extent that my findings are based on facts led at the trial, they must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. Any findings of fact that are adverse to the offender must be found beyond reasonable doubt. Matters in mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. A judge's finding of facts upon which the sentence is based is, ""both on what was necessarily implicit in the jury verdict and on his/her own impressions"": R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [196].
	


General background


	
	The deceased was a solicitor who practised in and around Wollongong. She lived at 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal. Wendy Evans is a former employee of the Department of Attorney-General and Justice and worked at various Local Courts over the years preceding the death of the deceased. Ms Evans met the deceased in 2008 through her work. They became friends in about November 2010.
	
	
	Bradley Rawlinson and the deceased had been in an intimate relationship on and off over a period of about four years prior to her death. They communicated regularly with each other during this time and were intimately involved even as late as the days preceding the death of the deceased. That relationship also to some extent coincided with or overlapped an intimate relationship that developed between Mr Rawlinson and Ms Evans and which was current at and following the death of the deceased.
	
	
	For some time leading up to the death of the deceased Michelle Proud and Mr Spicer had been in a de facto relationship. Ms Evans and Ms Proud met and formed a friendship. It appears that Mr Spicer and Ms Evans' then partner had both been inmates of the same correctional centre in 2008.
	
	
	In the period leading up to the events of 27 October 2011, Ms Evans contacted Ms Proud and asked her if she knew anyone who could bash the deceased. Although it has no direct bearing upon my deliberations in this matter, it is clear that Ms Evans did so at the request and on behalf of, or in consultation with, Mr Rawlinson. Mr Spicer later called Ms Evans and said that he would do it. It was agreed that Mr Spicer would be paid $3,000 for his assistance. It is apparent from telephone records that Ms Evans and Ms Proud and/or Mr Spicer made contact on 38 occasions between 14.18 on 25 October 2011 and 14.59 the following day. Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson made contact on 54 occasions between 17.06 on 25 October 2011 and 00.07 on 27 October 2011.
	
	
	At 11.43 on 26 October 2011, Mr Rawlinson withdrew $1,000 from a Commonwealth Bank automatic teller machine at Figtree. He deposited that amount into the TAB account of Peggy-Ann Case at 11.57. Ms Case is Mr Spicer's sister. Ms Case then received a call from Ms Proud telling her that ""a friend"" would deposit money in her account. At 12.33, Ms Case withdrew the money and gave it to Mr Spicer.
	
	
	Ms Proud and Mr Spicer then booked to stay at the Oasis Motel in Windang, with Ms Evans' assistance. That motel was located about 20 minutes’ drive from the deceased's home. The booking was made in Mr Spicer's name using Ms Proud's credit card.
	
	
	Ms Evans drove Mr Spicer and Ms Proud and their children to the motel on the afternoon of 26 October 2011. She later left the motel and met Mr Rawlinson at the house at which she was then residing, and he provided her with two keys to the deceased's house. Ms Evans then returned to the motel and collected Mr Spicer.
	
	
	At 00.40 on 27 October 2011, Ms Evans and Mr Spicer went to the K-Mart store in Figtree and purchased a 10-litre bucket, a water container and an aluminium torch. Mr Spicer paid cash for these items. They then went to two service stations. At the first of these they filled the water container with petrol. At the second they purchased a pack of firelighters and a cigarette lighter. From there Ms Evans and Mr Spicer made their way to the home of the deceased, passing the intersection of the Princes Highway and Bellambi Lane at Russell Vale heading north towards Woonona at 1.11. Three minutes later, that Hyundai car travelled through the same intersection heading south towards Corrimal. The car was then parked adjacent to a set of stairs that led directly up to Doncaster Street, Corrimal, about 25 metres from the deceased's home.
	
	
	A neighbour of the deceased noticed this car at the base of the stairs at about 1.30 as she drove home from her work. She saw a male and a female get out. The neighbour continued driving to her house in Doncaster Street, from where she saw the same two people now standing at the top of the stairs leaning against a railing. These people were Ms Evans and Mr Spicer. At about 2.20, Ms Evans and Mr Spicer entered the deceased's house using the keys provided by Mr Rawlinson.
	
	
	The deceased was at this time asleep in her bed. Mr Spicer proceeded to pour or to throw petrol from the bucket around the deceased's bedroom and possibly onto the bed where the deceased lay asleep. A firelighter was thrown into the bedroom. The petrol ignited immediately. They ran from the house. Fire consumed the bedroom within a very short time. Whilst fleeing from the house, Ms Evans dropped the two house keys. Mr Spicer picked up one of the keys and gave it to Ms Evans.
	
	
	The Fire Brigade arrived at the house at about 2.35. The upper level of the house was by then well alight, with flames visible from the bedroom window and the roof. The fire was extinguished and the body of the deceased was located on the small landing at the top of the stairs leading to her bedroom. It was the Crown case that the deceased was awoken after the fire started and attempted to escape, but was overcome by fire and smoke. She collapsed and died just beyond the entrance to her bedroom.
	
	
	Mr Spicer neither assisted the deceased nor called an ambulance or the Fire Brigade.
	
	
	A crime scene was immediately established. The key to the deceased's home dropped by Ms Evans was found on the roadway outside the house. It fitted the front screen door. The house did not show any signs of forced entry.
	
	
	An autopsy conducted by a forensic pathologist established that the deceased had inhaled smoke and soot, indicating that she had been alive and breathing during the fire. Petrol was detected on remnants of clothing worn by her.
	
	
	On 8 November 2011 Ms Evans deposited $1,000 into Ms Case's TAB account at 15.07 and Mr Spicer withdrew it at 16.57.
	
	
	At about 21.00 on 18 November 2011, Ms Evans spoke to Mr Spicer and Ms Proud. She asked them, ""You got the other thousand, didn't you?"" Mr Spicer responded, ""Yeah"".
	
	
	On 25 November 2011 at 14.26 Ms Evans put $350 into Ms Case's TAB account. Ms Evans then sent a message to Mr Spicer and Ms Proud at 15.19 saying, ""Sorry we just put 350 in now that's all we have.""
	
	
	Police seized the Hyundai motor vehicle on 14 December 2011.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial included Mr Spicer’s electronically recorded interview with the police. He originally maintained that he was uninvolved in the death of the deceased. However, when confronted with material suggesting that Ms Proud had told police the truth, he responded “This is fuckin’ bullshit man. It wasn’t supposed to happen.” Mr Spicer then proceeded to give police an account of his involvement in the death of the deceased that included the following matters.
	
	
	Mr Spicer said that Ms Evans rang him and said that she wanted to scare the deceased. He said that Ms Evans asked him if he knew anyone who would be willing to hurt the deceased. He said he did but that he did not want anything to do with it. He asked her, “What are you going to do?” and Ms Evans said to him, “Burn her car or something.” He said “All right, whatever.” He was then offered $3,000 “to do it”.
	
	
	Ms Evans told him that Mr Rawlinson would supply the keys to the deceased’s house. Ms Evans said, “All you have to do is just run inside or whatever, throw a bucket of petrol down and light it.” Mr Spicer said that he asked Ms Evans, “But what if Katie’s there?” He said Ms Evans told him, “She won’t be, I swear to you she’s not going to be home.” Mr Spicer told police that “all it was was just to scare the shit out of her.”
	
	
	Mr Spicer said that when Ms Evans and Mr Spicer drove to the deceased’s home he “ran up the stairs, I threw a bucket of petrol on there.” He said that Ms Evans threw a jiffy firelighter into the room and “the thing just exploded.” When this happened he was still standing “up the hallway.” They both then fled the house.
	
	
	Mr Spicer said that the following day, which I take to have in fact been later the same day, he saw on the news that someone had been in the house. He said that he rang Ms Evans and told her she had just “fucked [him] over for life.”
	
	
	Mr Spicer said that they had entered the house with the use of keys. There was a vehicle in the driveway in front of the house. He said he could not see inside the deceased’s bedroom as it was “pitch black in the whole house.” He said he did not know if anybody was inside the bedroom. He said he had never been in the house before. He followed Ms Evans who led him up the stairs. Mr Spicer said that Ms Evans lit the firelighter “and threw it in there.”
	
	
	When he got to the top of the stairs he stood at the door. Mr Spicer said that he threw petrol into the room. He said that he did not know how far into the room it went as he could not see in. The petrol he threw was in a bucket and had been transferred from the container shortly beforehand at the front of the house. Mr Spicer said that when the petrol ignited “the explosion was deafening.”
	
	
	Mr Spicer told police that when he bought the petrol he thought that all he would be doing would be “to throw it over the car and that was it.” He said that only changed when Ms Evans told him that there was a mobile phone in the bedroom that contained images of her in what amounted to a compromising pose, the inference being that the phone had to be destroyed.
	
	
	Mr Spicer agreed that as they ran from the house he saw Ms Evans drop something and that he picked it up. It was one of the keys to the house. Mr Spicer said that he was paid to do this job and that he understood that the money came from Mr Rawlinson.
	
	
	Mr Spicer was asked about Ms Evans. He said this:
	


“Q232   Yeah. Have you spoken to Wendy since?

A. Yeah, I’ve gone off me head at her too.

Q233   Yeah?

A. She fucked us over.

Q234   What do you mean, she fucked you over?

A. Well, she lied to us.

Q235   About what?

A. Everything.

Q236   Well, give me an example of what she lied about.

A. Well for starters she knew that chick was in that house.

Q237   How do you know that?

A. I don’t know, but I know she knew that that chick was in the house. Why, why target, well put it this way, she said to me, the next day, when I did speak to her, I turned around and I said, ‘Oh, what the fuck, what have you gone and done?’. Like I said, ‘Now you’ve just fucked me’. And she turned around and she goes, ‘Oh, I swear you won’t get in trouble for this, nothing’s going to happen to you rah, rah, rah’. And I said to Michelle, I said, ‘I know, I’m in trouble now’. Like, it doesn’t matter what you do, this shit always comes out. Like doesn’t matter how many bull shit stories they make up.

Q238   When you say they make up, who’s they?

A. Well they were trying to, I said to Wendy and that, I said, ‘If I go down for this Wendy’, I said, ‘You’re going to pay for it’. I said, ‘I’m going to take you down with me’. Because it was her job, like she, you know what I mean. And she turned to me and she goes, ‘I swear you’re not going to get in trouble’. And, yeah, and then when I said to her, ‘Oh, so now that Katie’s dead, like, how do you feel’. And she goes, ‘Oh, I can sleep now’. I said, ‘Yeah, well, I’m glad youse can, ‘cause I can’t’.”


	
	Mr Spicer continued to insist throughout the interview that he did not know that the deceased would be at home that evening. He said that he did not light the fire but only threw the petrol.
	


Other evidence


	
	Mr Spicer was later secretly recorded using a legally installed listening device having conversations in his home and in intercepted telephone calls following the fire but before his arrest. The text of these conversations would appear to indicate that Mr Spicer’s most pressing concern was the payment of the balance of the money that was owed to him for his role in setting the fire. This is in contrast to what he later said to the police when interviewed on the day of his arrest. In none of these recorded conversations does Mr Spicer express surprise or alarm at the fact that the deceased was killed as the result of anything done by him. He did not suggest or complain that he had been misled by Ms Evans.
	


Intention


	
	The Crown contended that I would be satisfied that Mr Spicer committed the offence with an intention to kill the deceased. That submission was supported by the (not altogether settled) proposition that an offence involving an intention to kill is generally more serious than one involving only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. I briefly examined the different possible views about this issue in R v Kristi Anne Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952 at [25] - [27]. It seems to me that this is a case where there is little difference objectively between an intention to kill and an alternative liability for murder.
	
	
	Accepting for present purposes that there may be little difference, either in this case or more generally, between the two possibilities, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer intended to kill the deceased. Much of what I have already referred to supports that conclusion. For example, the location and intensity of the fire is overwhelmingly supportive of the proposition that the fire was set with a view to killing the deceased. If the intention had been merely to cause serious bodily injury to the deceased, one might have expected either some other method of causing injury to have been used, such as direct physical assaults upon her as she lay in bed, or the setting of a fire in some location that may have caused injury to the deceased but permitted her to escape. The setting of a fire that must inevitably have led to an immediate conflagration within a small room with only one means of ingress or egress, is highly inconsistent with any other conclusion. That satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer intended to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Even more significantly, however, would appear to be the total lack of any reference by Mr Spicer when communicating with others after the death of the deceased, to any surprise or dismay at the fact that what happened on 27 October 2011 actually caused her death, as opposed to something less. If the intention were not to kill the deceased, one would have expected that issue to figure prominently and consistently in what Mr Spicer said in conversations detected by listening devices or telephone intercepts before he was arrested or realised that they were being recorded. Quite to the contrary, Mr Spicer’s conversations suggest that the death of the deceased was entirely anticipated. His unqualified post mortem demands for payment of the money that he was still owed are inconsistent with an intention only to scare the deceased.
	
	
	Moreover, the difference between the two types of intention may in effect be academic. The circumstances of the killing, even accepting the formation by Mr Spicer of no more than an intention to cause serious bodily injury, are so dangerous and extreme, that there is arguably little scope for the imposition of a discernibly different sentence.
	
	
	These matters are also relevant to submissions made on Mr Spicer’s behalf that the basis of the jury’s verdict could only be consistent with a finding of reckless indifference to human life. That was said to be because the evidence was not sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer had an intention to kill the deceased, as opposed to having a state of mind rising no higher than reckless indifference. A finding by me consistent with the jury’s verdict that Mr Spicer had either an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm could only be made if I were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was in the bedroom at the time he threw the petrol into her bedroom. That submission was supported by reference to Mr Spicer’s ERISP answer that he “just knew that something was going to go wrong” and that he “had a gut feeling that something was going to go wrong.”
	
	
	However, in my view, that statement falls foul of a number of problems to which I have earlier referred. His concern that something would go wrong, or that Ms Evans had “fucked him for life” never emerged at any time or in any context of which there is evidence before he was apprehended. He is not once recorded before his arrest complaining that things had gone wrong, or that it had all turned out in a way quite different to what he expected, but is in contrast concerned regularly and at times quite aggressively to inquire about his outstanding remuneration. In that respect I specifically take Mr Spicer’s intercepted offer on one occasion to accept less than he was owed to be an attempt to secure a quick payment rather than a reaction of surprise or remorse for the way things turned out.
	
	
	Moreover, the deceased’s car was parked in the driveway. It was the early hours of the morning. The petrol was not used to ignite her car, or some benign part of her residence permitting escape if she were present. The suggestion that the bedroom was targeted because there was a phone in that room is wholly inconsistent with Mr Spicer believing that the deceased was absent and satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer was aware of the deceased’s presence in the room. If it were otherwise the deceased’s apparently significant mobile phone could presumably have been located in what was a very small and (on this analysis) unoccupied room without the need to set it on fire. Mr Spicer could also at his leisure have entered the room to deposit the petrol as opposed to throwing it into the room from his asserted location at the doorway.
	
	
	The jury’s verdict is consistent with, although not limited to, them being satisfied that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was present in her bedroom when he threw petrol into it. Mr Spicer emphasises that he did not know the deceased was present in the room and that the jury’s verdict is equally consistent with satisfaction on their part that he acted with reckless indifference to whether or not she was. I consider that one further piece of evidence should be noted in this context. In his ERISP, Mr Spicer told the police that Ms Evans knew that the deceased was present. When asked how he knew that Ms Evans in fact was aware that the deceased was present, he responded, “I don’t know, but I know she knew that that chick was in the house. Why, why target, well put it this way…”. This was evidence before the jury which they were entitled to take into account in deciding whether or not Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was in the house. The italicised words, which appear inadvertently to have been spoken, and from which Mr Spicer somewhat clumsily but obviously sought to retreat, are in my view consistent with his appreciation that Ms Evans specifically wanted to attack (“target”) the deceased’s bedroom because she was there asleep on the night. Targeting the deceased’s bedroom is precisely what Mr Spicer admitted he did.
	
	
	I am in the circumstances satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer was part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. I am satisfied that he entered the deceased’s home in the company of Ms Evans in the early hours of the morning as she slept and threw petrol into her bedroom. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer was aware that the deceased was there when he did so.
	
	
	I was asked by the Crown to make a finding that Mr Spicer should be described as a “contract killer”. I am not certain what such a finding would contribute to the present debate. By his own admission Mr Spicer agreed to be part of the enterprise, although he disputed its content, in return for the payment of $3,000. What amounts to a pejorative shorthand adjectival characterisation of the events seems to me to be less helpful than a full understanding of my findings beyond reasonable doubt about what Mr Spicer did and what he knew when he did it. It becomes unnecessary in these circumstances to deal with submissions put on behalf of Mr Spicer that I should not make the finding in question.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Spicer that he should in effect be given some credit for the fact that his involvement was not simply for reward but inextricably linked to Ms Proud’s friendship with Ms Evans. However, I entirely reject this submission. Mr Spicer’s criminality, or the level of objective seriousness of his offending, is not diminished by the fact that the opportunity to commit the crime came to him through the friendship between his co-accused and his partner. The proposition has in my view only to be articulated to be rejected.
	
	
	A related submission was based upon the fact that Mr Spicer’s offending was linked to an opportunity, suggested by Ms Evans, for Mr Spicer’s and Ms Proud’s children simultaneously to have a short holiday by the seaside in Wollongong. It is accepted by me that Mr Spicer and Ms Proud lived in what could only be described as emotionally and economically impoverished conditions, and that their children were the unfortunate beneficiaries of these awful circumstances. As sympathetic as it is right to be with that fact, it is not possible to leverage the genuine concern that Mr Spicer may have had for his children as a means of minimising the consequences for him of his decision to commit a violent act upon the deceased. There is in my opinion neither a legally defensible nor morally justifiable basis for doing so.
	
	
	A completely different submission made on Mr Spicer’s behalf was that he was pressured or manipulated into agreeing to a change of plan at the last minute by Ms Evans. It was submitted that it was open to me to find that Ms Evans pressured or manipulated Mr Spicer to continue with the criminal enterprise even when the plan had changed. Mr Spicer contended that the plan had changed after he and his family had been taken to Wollongong where they were left without transport to return to Sydney or the means conveniently to do so. In the events that occurred, Ms Proud resorted to selling her children’s toys in order to raise money for their train fares.
	
	
	Mr Spicer told police in his ERISP that he had already taken the money to take part in the commission of the crime. He said that in those circumstances. “I didn’t have much choice.” He also said, “I didn’t want to do it but I didn’t want to pay the money back.” He also claimed that Ms Evans had told him that “This bloke will just fuck us over” which he took to be a reference to Mr Rawlinson taking some action if they did not proceed. Mr Spicer also told the police that he suggested that they leave the execution of their plan until the following day as they had been seen by the neighbour but that Ms Evans told him, “No, it’s got to be done now.”
	
	
	Ms Fleur Taylor, to whom some more detailed reference will later be made, is a psychologist who offered the professional opinion that Mr Spicer was “likely an individual who is susceptible to the manipulation and coercion of others in the community.” Mr Spicer told police that he had been drinking all day and that he had used ice prior to the offence. He told Ms Taylor about this alcohol and drug use. She opined that this would likely have caused a disruption to his ability to make pro-social choices and may have increased his vulnerability to be coerced by his co-offenders.
	
	
	It was submitted for Mr Spicer in these circumstances that his agreement with the change of plan due to pressure or manipulation was the probable explanation for his participation in the crime. It was contended that this also explained why Ms Proud was never aware that there was a plan to set the house on fire.
	
	
	These submissions are all based upon the proposition that the plan changed. That suggestion is entirely based upon Mr Spicer’s assertions to the police that it did. Mr Spicer has never given evidence, either at the trial or in the sentencing proceedings, so that his assertions have never been exposed to any forensic scrutiny or challenge. They must in my opinion be compared to the preparatory steps taken by him and Ms Evans in the hours leading up to the fire. The suggestion is that the original plan was to burn the deceased’s car. It seems to me to be highly unlikely that the paraphernalia purchased in advance would have been necessary in order to set a vehicle alight. For example, the front of the deceased’s premises was illuminated by a nearby streetlight. Notwithstanding that fact, it was for some reason necessary to purchase a torch. In my view that was entirely inconsistent with a plan to burn the car and entirely consistent with a plan to enter the unlit house.
	
	
	Mr Spicer and Ms Evans also purchased not only a petrol container but a bucket as well. The bucket was quite deliberately filled with petrol in order to facilitate its distribution. That would not have been necessary if the plan were merely to destroy the deceased’s car as there was unlimited access to it standing on the driveway in contrast to comparatively limited access to the deceased’s bedroom through a single doorway. Mr Spicer also told the police that he had been told that the deceased and Mr Rawlinson were “going to out [sic] together all night”, indicating that the need for a bucket in order quickly to disseminate the petrol over the car was not critical. The purchase of the bucket was in my view a deliberate strategy consistent with a plan to enter the house.
	
	
	Mr Spicer also told the police that Ms Evans told him that Mr Rawlinson would supply the keys to the deceased’s house. There would have been no need for the keys to the house in order to set fire to a car on the driveway. The need for the keys is highly, if not exclusively, consistent with a plan to enter the house.
	
	
	Mr Spicer and Ms Evans also purchased a firelighter. However, it is not in my view possible to say that that item was not also consistent with a plan to burn the car.
	
	
	In his ERISP Mr Spicer provided the following information:
	


“Q334 And at any point did you stop and go I’m not going to do this?

A. All night I was saying I didn’t want to do it.

Q335 But even when you were at the house, at Doncaster Street?

A. When I was at the house I just ran in, didn’t even think, didn’t stop, just wanted to get out of there.

Q336 Did you and Wendy speak about anything further just prior to going into the house? Did you speak about, once you left the house, what did you say to each other?

A. I just told her to drive.

Q337 Yeah.

A. And I didn’t speak to her all the way back to the motel”


	
	A number of matters would appear to flow from this. Mr Spicer elsewhere indicated in his ERISP that at the time the petrol was purchased he thought the car was going to be torched. It was submitted on his behalf that this was consistent with a late change of plan or logically a change no earlier than the purchase of the petrol. However, if the original plan was to burn the car then Mr Spicer’s reference to “all night I was saying I didn’t want to do it” must have been a reference to the plan to burn the car and not the plan to enter the house. Mr Spicer was asked if there was any discussion about anything prior to entering the house but that question would appear not to have been answered by him. That is surprising if his contention is now that he was confronted with a late change of plan that he was unable to resist. It is also difficult to reconcile with his admission that when he was at the house he “just ran in, didn’t even think.” There was also somewhat curiously no conversation about this alleged critical and significant change of plan in the car on the journey back to the motel.
	
	
	Perhaps most significantly, Mr Spicer told the police that Ms Evans originally described what he was recruited to do as, “all you have to do is just run inside or whatever, throw a bucket of petrol down and light it.” That description is wholly inconsistent with, and is contradictory of, Mr Spicer’s present submission that the original plan was merely to burn the car and that the plan changed.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the original plan was to enter the house and set fire to the deceased’s bedroom. I am similarly satisfied that there was no change of plan into the performance of which Mr Spicer was pressured or coerced. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spicer was not manipulated by Ms Evans to enter the house and set the fire.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	Ms Taylor interviewed Mr Spicer for the purposes of these proceedings. Her report dated 12 April 2015 was tendered without objection. Ms Taylor took a history from Mr Spicer that included the following matters.
	
	
	Mr Spicer is the only child of his biological parents. He has one older maternal half-brother who lived with his maternal grandmother when they were growing up. He also has three younger half-brothers and a younger half-sister born to different fathers. Mr Spicer said he had a difficult childhood characterised by physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence and parental drug and alcohol use, as well as paternal abandonment, rejection and emotional neglect. He never knew who his father was and has had no contact with him at any time. He unsuccessfully attempted to locate his father. His lack of a paternal relationship has created difficulties for him.
	
	
	Mr Spicer’s mother entered into a relationship with his step father when he was a baby. They are still together. His step father was a violent man who abused alcohol daily. His step father’s anger and aggression escalated when intoxicated and Mr Spicer became a witness to and the victim of regular physical violence. He also regularly witnessed his step father physically assaulting his mother. His attempts to intervene to protect her only meant that he became the victim of the same abuse. Mr Spicer’s mother also regularly consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication. Each of his mother and step father were regular cannabis users.
	
	
	Mr Spicer’s parents were strict. They owned a farm and all the children were expected to work on it. Mr Spicer was accordingly relatively socially isolated during his childhood. As a result he regularly sneaked out of the house to spend time with his friends and would be beaten by his step father upon his return.
	
	
	Mr Spicer went to live with his maternal grandparents for about a year when he was in his early teens. He had at that time been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. His parents told him that they did not want to deal with his “attention seeking behaviours” or with him “constantly getting into trouble at school”. He was placed on medication. His behaviour thereafter was characterised by dysregulation, deficits in managing his impulsive behaviour and diminished social skills.
	
	
	Mr Spicer did not experience cognitive difficulties at school and attained average grades. He became easily bored and found it difficult to sit still. He was good at sport but was prevented by his step father from engaging in such activities in order to work on the family farm.
	
	
	Mr Spicer was often in trouble at school and received multiple suspensions. He was expelled on one occasion for trying physically to assault a teacher who he considered had slighted his mother. He left school as soon as he was legally able to do so.
	
	
	He entered the concreting industry at the age of 16 and remained in it for 15 years thereafter. He has worked in warehousing, has a forklift driver’s licence and has worked on dairy farms. Most recently he started his own scrap metal business.
	
	
	Mr Spicer has a long history of poly-substance abuse that commenced when he was 16 years old. He then began consuming alcohol which rapidly escalated. He drank regularly to the point of intoxication. This continued for about five years. For the last ten years Mr Spicer has been consuming speed and ice. He attended the Drug Court program in 2008 without success. Mr Spicer’s drug use ceased about 15 months ago whilst incarcerated.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the preceding summary accurately reflects Mr Spicer’s history and personal circumstances as he related them to Ms Taylor.
	
	
	Mr Spicer also told Ms Taylor, entirely inconsistently with my finding, that he had no knowledge that the deceased was in her bedroom when he set it alight. He described himself as a “follower” in the offending behaviour and sought to minimise his role in the commission of the offence. Mr Spicer told Ms Taylor that he was motivated to engage in the offending behaviour as his co-offender was a friend of his partner and that he had no knowledge that the deceased was present at the time. Ms Taylor said that Mr Spicer was unable to provide any further insight into his motivation to engage in the offending behaviour, even taking into account his statements that he did not intend to harm anybody. He continually repeated that he could not understand why he had done what he did.
	
	
	Notwithstanding his minimisation and defensiveness, Ms Taylor reported that Mr Spicer claimed to experience remorse related to his actions. He said that he learnt of the deceased’s death the following morning when watching the news. He described feeling “sick to the stomach” and “devastated and horrified” that his actions had resulted in this outcome. Mr Spicer discussed the impact of his behaviour with Ms Taylor on not only the deceased but also in terms of the impact upon her family and friends. Mr Spicer acknowledged the grief that they must be experiencing.
	
	
	Ms Taylor considered that Mr Spicer would benefit from involvement in a program such as the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program. Ms Taylor expressed the opinion that Mr Spicer had a limited awareness and understanding of his negative emotional states and that it was possible that long term treatment and rehabilitation, focusing upon these issues and the skills required to manage them, may improve his prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Remorse


	
	As already noted in a different context, Mr Spicer did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. It is in these circumstances difficult to be satisfied that he has or has expressed any genuine remorse for his actions. Expressions such as feeling sick to the stomach or being devastated and horrified are literally appropriate but are devoid of relevant content when merely communicated to a medical practitioner unsupported by direct evidence before me and untested. Formulaic recitations of good words by Mr Spicer are unconvincing, particularly when associated with the maintenance of a simultaneous denial or minimisation of his role in the death of the deceased. That approach can helpfully be contrasted with the approach taken by Ms Proud in corresponding circumstances.
	
	
	If Mr Spicer were truly remorseful, it rather confounds common understanding for him to have declined a perfect opportunity to express it in his own words in the presence of the deceased's parents at the sentencing hearing. It seems to me to be all the more difficult to understand when the expression of what is said to be a genuine and sincerely felt emotion is simultaneously likely to advance at least my understanding of how Mr Spicer has felt following the death of the deceased. I remain troubled when I am asked to assume favourably to an accused person that he is truly remorseful, or in simple words, truly sorry, for what he has done, when the closest I am taken to hearing it comes from a second hand report of what a medical professional has managed to elicit during a clinical examination. The giving of direct evidence of remorse can also help to illuminate the distinction between true remorse and self-pity. Usually only one of those emotions is relevant for sentencing purposes.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	It was not suggested on Mr Spicer’s behalf that he could point to any statutory mitigating factors and none was otherwise conceded by the Crown.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	It is not in dispute that this offence was committed in company and in the home of the deceased. It was also the result of significant, albeit crude and unsophisticated, planning. Mr Spicer also has a criminal record which includes convictions for offences of violence: Mr Spicer has two convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900, which fall within the definition of serious personal violence offences for the purposes of s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	It was properly and uncontroversially conceded by counsel for Mr Spicer that this is an objectively serious offence of murder and that his conduct was associated with a high level of criminal culpability. I am however not satisfied, contrary to the Crown’s submissions, that it falls into the worst category of case. I was not satisfied of that in sentencing Mr Spicer’s co-offenders and I could not make such a finding in this case without offending the parity principle unless there were features upon the basis of which to distinguish Mr Spicer’s conduct. The Crown urged upon me that Mr Spicer committed this crime for reward. However, that reward was offered and paid by Mr Rawlinson upon whom I did not impose a life sentence.
	
	
	I note specifically with respect to Mr Spicer’s criminal record that it may not be used to increase the objective seriousness of an offence but rather that “retribution, deterrence, and protection of society may indicate a more severe sentence is warranted”: see R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76; R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253. In the present circumstances, however, it seems that Mr Spicer’s previous convictions for assault were the result of circumstances that arguably diminish their seriousness by casting them into an otherwise explicable, although not excusable, context.
	
	
	In forming my opinion that this crime is objectively very serious, I have specifically taken account of at least the two following matters.
	
	
	First, the circumstances of the deceased's death and the manner in which she died. The Crown referred in the sentencing proceedings for Mr Spicer’s co-accused to the fact that the deceased was incinerated. Such a description is on one view very emotionally loaded. Unfortunately, it is completely accurate. The deceased was confronted with what was an inferno that exploded in the quiet of the night in the home where she lived. It was unexpected and inescapable. The fact that the deceased was found such a short distance from her bed suggests quite strongly that she was quickly overcome by heat and smoke. She died alone, with no possible chance of escape from the blaze and no apparent prospect of survival even if she had. In the scheme of human understanding, it is difficult to contemplate a more frightening and excruciating way to die.
	
	
	Secondly, the fire that led to the death of the deceased was planned even if the level of planning was not particularly sophisticated. Mr Spicer and his co-accused executed a scheme to ensure that the deceased was killed. Her murder involved the premeditated purchase, from more than one location, of items guaranteed to start a fire that could not easily be avoided and that was highly likely to be fatal. This was not a case of a fire started in the downstairs laundry or even in the upstairs sitting room that might, in either instance, conceivably have offered the deceased a chance to escape. Whatever dispute there may be about whether petrol was poured on the floor around the deceased's bed or thrown into the bedroom from the doorway, the unavoidable fact is that it was done deliberately. The deceased's night clothing retained traces of petrol. Ms Evans, and in that sense also Mr Spicer, were provided with keys to the house so that they could enter it with ease. Moreover, the deceased’s death did not occur spontaneously or reactively or to the surprise of anyone other than the deceased.
	
	
	I wish to make it plain that in referring either generally or specifically to the level of planning involved in the commission of this offence, both in the context of an assessment of its objective seriousness, as well as an aggravating factor, I have only taken it into account once in forming my view about the proper sentence to impose.
	


Special circumstances


	
	No submissions were made to me about special circumstances. Even accepting that there will be a requirement for Mr Spicer to receive counselling or other related therapy or treatment upon his release, his likely parole period will be more than adequate to meet any such needs.
	


Deterrence


	
	The gratuitous nature of this crime calls for unambiguous condemnation.
	
	
	In whatever way this offence is described, it is clear that it involves the recruitment of Mr Spicer for a fee to engage in the commission of a violent assault upon a person in the sanctity of her home. Such conduct is inimical to the maintenance of a civilised society and is worthy of denunciation in the strongest terms. The sentence that I intend to impose is formulated to take account of the need to make it clear to anybody similarly disposed that punishment for such an offence ought as far as possible to reflect the community’s undiluted disapprobation of such conduct.
	
	
	As I said when sentencing Mr Spicer’s co-offenders, I remain even now completely puzzled about why the deceased was killed. She did nothing to anyone that set her apart from any but the most saintly and pious among us. Nothing that was said about the deceased that inspired such hatred for her was true or sufficient to justify what befell her even if it were. No one should be left in any doubt that scurrilous gossip and meaningless banter can never justify the taking of another person's life. I consider that there is a need generally to deter the commission of such evil conduct as the circumstances of this case have revealed.
	


Future dangerousness and rehabilitation


	
	Ms Taylor has noted that Mr Spicer continues to maintain both that he was unaware that the deceased was at home on the morning in question and that he was in any event a “follower” in the events that occurred. As the Crown quite fairly emphasises, both assertions are in clear conflict with the jury’s verdict. Mr Spicer’s continuing maintenance of this position does not provide me with any confidence that he has any realistic insight into or appreciation of the gravity of his conduct. If one accepts the somewhat blunt and cumbersome proposition that an acceptance by an offender that he has committed the offence of which he has been convicted is a precondition to the commencement of any rehabilitative process, it seems that Mr Spicer has not yet started on that course.
	
	
	I am unable to conclude that Mr Spicer has anything much beyond fair prospects of rehabilitation. It could hardly be said that the jury’s verdict in this case was a surprise or that the evidence tendered by the Crown at trial was anything other than very strong indeed. I mention these things in order to emphasise that Mr Spicer’s apparent refusal to acknowledge his guilt does not arise in circumstances where the maintenance of some arguably well-founded disappointment with the jury’s decision might be expected.
	
	
	I am wholly unable independently to predict Mr Spicer’s future dangerousness beyond the extent to which it is a function of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	I have specifically reconsidered and taken account of the victim impact statements from the parents of the deceased. I wish to make it clear, however, that I would have imposed the sentence that I intend to impose even if the statements from Mr and Mrs Foreman had not been provided to the court.
	


Police investigation


	
	Before passing sentence upon Mr Spicer, I want to make some comments, as I did when sentencing his co-offenders, about the work of the police investigators whose unfortunate task it became to try to discover who may have killed the deceased. The evidence that was gathered for presentation to the jury in this case was nothing short of remarkable. The electronic surveillance and the recovery of vast amounts of phone and SMS records were critical to the just prosecution of these offences. Interviews were also conducted with many scores of witnesses from the community, as well as with many other technical experts, and a very comprehensive brief of evidence was assembled as a result. The deceased died on 27 October 2011. Arrests were made 55 days later. The criminal justice system is often inaccurately criticised as slow or unwieldy or even broken. These criticisms inevitably emanate from a limited or mischievous understanding of how that system operates. The efforts of the policemen and policewomen in this case cannot be faulted and are deserving of public recognition.
	


General


	
	The deceased died in circumstances that were particularly callous and brutal. Her death was undeserved, avoidable and pointless. Mr Spicer permitted himself, for a pathetic reward, to become the instrument of others who bore her unexplained and inexplicable ill will. The deceased was obviously an energetic and talented lawyer, a loving daughter and a well-loved personality. The community in general and the deceased’s relatives, friends and professional colleagues in particular, are the worse for her death.
	


Sentence


	
	Mr Spicer was arrested on 21 December 2011. He has remained in custody referrable to this offence since then.
	
	
	Bernard Justin Spicer, for the murder of Katherine Foreman you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 32 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2043, with a non-parole period of 24 years expiring on 20 December 2035.

		19 May 2015",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766633,R v Thornton [2015] NSWCCA 94,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: This is an application for leave to appeal from the sentences imposed by the District Court upon the applicant for two serious assaults.
	
	
	On 22 October 2012 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment that contained two counts. The first count charged him with an offence under s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) namely that on 12 March 2011 he inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The second count charged him with an offence under s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 namely that on the same date he committed an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The first count attracted a maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment. The second count attracted a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 25 October 2013 the sentencing judge published reasons for judgment. Those reasons record that the applicant was sentenced on the first count to a fixed term of one year imprisonment commencing 31 May 2011 and expiring on 30 May 2012 and on the second count to imprisonment for a term of imprisonment of six years and four months commencing 31 May 2012 and expiring 30 September 2018. It is clear from the sentencing judgment that her Honour misunderstood the order in which the counts appeared on the indictment. This was an understandable error given the chronology of the offences. In any event her Honour subsequently published a further judgment correcting this mistake. Nothing turns on this.
	
	
	The effect of the sentences was that the applicant received a total sentence of seven years and four months commencing 31 May 2011 and expiring on 30 September 2018, with an effective total non-parole period of five years expiring on 30 May 2016.
	
	
	To pursue this application the applicant required an extension of time. An affidavit from the applicant’s solicitor adequately explained the delay in filing the appeal. The Crown did not oppose the grant of an extension. In my view the extension should be granted.
	


The offences


	
	There was placed before the sentencing judge a set of agreed facts. They can be relevantly summarised as follows.
	
	
	At around 11:35pm on 11 March 2011 the applicant, his co-offender, John Tozer, and some friends attended the “Phriction Night Club” in Penrith. At around 1:00am on 12 March 2011 the applicant and his co-offender, and a group of other males, were seen to be talking to the first of the applicant’s victims (the “first victim”). Closed circuit television (“CCTV”) footage from within the club shows the offender struck the first victim to the jaw knocking him unconscious. This conduct constituted the assault occasioning actual body harm. There is nothing in the CCTV footage to suggest that this assault was provoked. The first victim was assisted by security staff. As a result of the assault he suffered a headache and the left side of his jaw was swollen for approximately a week after the attack.
	
	
	The second victim was a friend of the first victim. He heard the commotion surrounding the attack upon his friend and saw his friend lying on the ground. He decided to call the first victim’s brother. He went to the foyer of the nightclub. While he was on the phone the applicant walked toward the exit. He noticed the second victim talking on the telephone. CCTV footage recorded the applicant watching him for a short time. It also recorded that the applicant “then moved another patron away from the area”. The second victim was unaware of the applicant’s presence as he had his back turned. As the second victim turned in the direction of the applicant the applicant punched the second victim in the right side of his face. The phone was knocked out of his hand. As he was falling to the ground the applicant punched the second victim twice in the head. At this point the co-offender joined the applicant and also hit the second victim in the head. The second victim slumped to the ground. The applicant continued to punch him as he sat on the ground with his back against the wall. The second victim covered his head with his hands as the co-offender kicked and punched him. The applicant also kicked the second victim.
	
	
	At this point security staff and some of the applicant’s friends intervened. The applicant and his co-offender then left the club. After the attack the second victim was unconscious. He was taken to the restaurant area of the club. He commenced vomiting, was confused and had a laceration under his right eye. He was taken to hospital. A scan of his face showed a complex fracture to the right side of his face in the region above the right eye. He had fractures to his cheekbone and his eye socket. He underwent surgery which involved the repair and reduction of his fractures and the insertion of titanium plates and mesh into the right side of his face.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 31 May 2011. He has remained in custody since then.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	The sentencing judge described the facts of the offences and then addressed the remainder of the sentencing task as follows.
	
	
	First, her Honour noted the applicant’s criminal antecedents. At the time of sentencing he was 39 years of age. His criminal record began in his late teens when he was convicted of malicious damage and assault. As an adult he accumulated convictions for resisting arrest, offensive behaviour, numerous assaults, as well as assault occasioning actual bodily harm, malicious damage and possession of drugs, among other offences. In July 2005 he was convicted of assaulting a police officer in the execution of their duty. He received a sentence of four months imprisonment, suspended on the condition that he enter into a bond under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In 2008 he was convicted of a number of assaults, including maliciously inflict grievous body harm. For those offences he served just over eighteen months in custody.
	
	
	Second, her Honour noted the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Her Honour found that the applicant’s childhood was “marred by violence” and an incident in which he was run over by his father and sustained a fractured ankle. The sentencing judge noted that his relationship with his parents had “been repaired in more recent times”. The applicant struggled at school and has poor literacy skills. He had suffered numerous head injuries over time as a result of violence. The sentencing judge observed that he “appear[ed] to be suffering” from some sort of “abnormal grief reaction” following the death of a nephew. The sentencing judge also noted evidence that there was work available to the applicant as a roof tiler upon his release and that he had expressed a wish to improve his relationship with his son.
	
	
	Third, the sentencing judge discussed at length the evidence from a psychologist called on behalf of the applicant, Ms Alison Cullen. In view of the complaint in ground 1 of the appeal it is necessary to describe this in more detail. Ms Cullen’s evidence was challenged by the Crown, however the sentencing judge accepted it.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that Ms Cullen had diagnosed the applicant with post-traumatic stress disorder and also considered that “at the time he committed these offences … he was also suffering from alcohol dependence”. The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had been “alcohol free since his incarceration and therefore the diagnosis of alcohol dependence no longer applies”. The sentencing judge described Ms Cullen’s ultimate opinion as follows:
	


“In the opinion of the psychologist the offender’s marked post-traumatic stress disorder, his preoccupation with avoiding unpredictable physical harm, coupled with his low IQ and his non-verbal abilities result in him acting aggressively, particularly when intoxicated. If upon his release he reverts to alcohol abuse and his symptoms go untreated, he is at risk of re-offending.”


	
	The references to the applicant avoiding “unpredictable physical harm” relate to assertions made by the applicant to Ms Cullen that he believed the first victim was about to hit him, and that the second victim was arranging for the first victim’s brother to bring guns to the nightclub.
	
	
	Fourth, the sentencing judge characterised the violence involved in each offence. Her Honour noted that the offender and his co-offender had “callously walked away” from the victims after they had assaulted them. Her Honour described their actions as showing a “callous disregard for the rights of others” and as “cowardly”.
	
	
	Fifth, her Honour addressed the relevance of the suggestion of alcohol abuse to his offending. Her Honour noted that the applicant knew “full well the consequences of abusing alcohol” as he chose to do. Her Honour then noted the opinion of Ms Cullen and concluded that the applicant:
	


“… is aware of mental health issues and he is aware of the impact that alcohol has upon him, yet he chooses to place himself in situations where he drinks to excess and then reacts violently towards others when he perceives he is under threat. That is a factor in my view which reduces any mitigation which would otherwise be given to his mental state.”


	
	In discussing general deterrence her Honour stated:
	


“He is certainly not an inappropriate medium for general deterrence. Alcohol fuelled violence is rife, the public should be entitled to attend licensed premises and enjoy a night out without the risk of being punched by extremely intoxicated, violent individuals. Sadly, it is not unheard of that such violence results in the death of innocent victims. Sadly now it is too common an occurrence. A substantial component for general deterrence is required in the sentences to be imposed.” (emphasis added)


	
	Sixth, her Honour was not prepared to accept that the applicant was “truly remorseful and contrite”.
	
	
	Seventh, her Honour noted that the pleas of guilty were entered on the date the matter was listed for trial. Her Honour allowed a 10% discount.
	
	
	Eighth, her Honour found that the applicant was “at risk of re-offending” and that “his prospects for rehabilitation are guarded”. Her Honour noted that the applicant had previously expressed an intention to change, but that “he continues to abuse alcohol and he continues to [mete] out violence to others”. The latter statement was a reference to evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant had fought with other inmates in gaol.
	
	
	Ninth, her Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances although her Honour varied the minimum ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term for the sentence on count 1 to account for the accumulation of the sentences on both counts.
	


Ground 1 of the appeal: Deficiency of evidence concerning intoxication


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal contends that there was “a deficiency of evidence upon which the learned sentencing judge could find intoxication as an aggravating feature beyond reasonable [doubt] at the time of the offences committed by the Applicant”.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground clarified that the complaint is that “there was a deficiency of evidence from which to infer that the applicant was intoxicated at the time of the offences”.
	
	
	There is no doubt that Her Honour sentenced the applicant on that basis that he was intoxicated. I have already described that part of the sentencing judgment in which her Honour addressed Ms Cullen’s evidence as to the interaction between the applicant’s documented history of alcohol abuse and his mental state and referred to the need for any sentence to deter “alcohol fuelled violence” such as that inflicted by “extremely intoxicated, violent individuals” (see [20] to [21]).
	
	
	This contention now being made on appeal is fundamentally inconsistent with the applicant’s case before her Honour. The point that was sought to be made on behalf of the applicant before her Honour was that the applicant’s violence was a product of the combination of his mental condition and alcohol abuse, but there were prospects of his violent tendencies diminishing because he was committed to addressing his alcohol problems. It was no doubt for that reason that Ms Cullen’s report was tendered. The advantage for the applicant in attempting to address his violent behaviour as if it was the product of excessive alcohol consumption was that, if he was sentenced on the basis that his violent assaults were the considered and premeditated acts of a sober person, then that was likely to lead to an even more gloomy assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Thus the proposition that the applicant was seriously affected by alcohol when he committed the assaults was the premise of the applicant’s case on sentence and of her Honour’s judgment. It was a premise that rejected the unrealistic possibility that this applicant, with his history of alcohol abuse, was sober when he attended a nightclub at 11:35pm and did not consume any more alcohol prior to committing the assaults some time after 1:00am. It was a premise that was otherwise supported by the evidence.
	
	
	As is to be expected, Ms Cullen’s report addressed the applicant’s history of abuse of alcohol in considerable detail. She identified one of the factors associated with his risk of reoffending was whether he resumed his alcohol dependence. In a section of her report entitled “Account”, Ms Cullen sets out what the applicant told her about the offences. He relayed to her his distorted belief that the first victim was planning to assault him and the second victim was encouraging someone to bring guns to the nightclub. This section of her report concludes:
	


“Mr Thornton confirmed he had consumed alcohol that night and explained that he typically masks ‘the panic attacks through alcohol’. He reiterated the grave fear he constantly carried with him concerning his reported susceptibility to die if physically assaulted again.” (emphasis added)


	
	As noted, Ms Cullen was cross examined before the sentencing judge. In her oral evidence she addressed at length the connection between the applicant’s alcohol abuse and his anxiety about being hit by others. For example, she was asked:
	


“Q.   Well so at least in his mind the consumption of alcohol gives him the ability to overcome his anxiety that he experiences about being hit?

A.   That can be the case, yes.

Q.   All right, and that prefaces the whole basis on which Mr Thornton puts it to you is that he needs or he feels the need to hit these people before they themselves hit him?

A.   That’s correct.

Q.   It’s a threat that in some way he perceives that he’s going to be struck by someone else?

A.   Yes which is actually not an uncommon thing in people suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, is this erroneous cognition of hyper vigilance and scanning the environment for potential threats, which coupled with alcohol use is then also affecting his ability to make assessments of risk.

…

Q.   And obviously the more – the larger degree of intoxication the more likely it is that there’s going to be some degree of affectation in that regard is that right, if he just had one or two drinks you’re not suggesting that that’s probably going to –

A.   That’s right, yep.”


	
	These answers were provided in a context where Ms Cullen’s written report confirmed that the applicant had told her that he had consumed alcohol on 11 and 12 March 2011.
	
	
	In his written submissions Counsel for the applicant contended that this material was only addressed to “a more general problem comprising part of the applicant’s criminal history”. This is incorrect. The report of Ms Cullen and her oral evidence was directed to a very specific problem said to have manifested itself on 12 March 2011, namely that the applicant’s post-traumatic stress disorder meant that, when he abused alcohol, the applicant erroneously perceived that people intended to hurt him. Ms Cullen tied her opinions to what the applicant told her about what happened on 12 March 2011 including his drinking. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was affected by alcohol on the evening of 11 March 2011 and accepted that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, but nevertheless regarded his conduct as a form of alcohol fuelled violence. Her Honour did not accept that he would address his abuse of alcohol in the future. The applicant now complains that her Honour acted on the basis that he was affected by alcohol when he urged that upon her Honour at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	In my view ground 1 should be rejected.
	


Grounds 2 and 3: Offences involved a single course of conduct and sentences were manifestly excessive


	
	Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal can be dealt with together. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred in imposing sentences that involved “complete accumulation” because even though “both assault charges … relat[e] to two separate victims” they “were in part a single course of violent conduct”. Ground 3 complains that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The essence of ground 2 concerns the sentencing judge's approach to concurrency, accumulation and totality. Her Honour adverted to the totality principle in the following part of the sentencing judgment:
	


“The issue of totality arises. Whilst it may be said that the injuries sustained by the victims was as a result of one course of criminal conduct there are certainly two victims and a gap between the assault upon the first and the assault upon the second. It is appropriate therefore that there be an accumulation of sentences to be imposed to reflect those matters.

I am asked to make a finding of special circumstances. Were it not for the accumulation of the sentence I would decline to do so.”


	
	This aspect of her Honour’s approach is not clear. Her Honour appeared to accept that there was at least some force in the submission that there was “a single course of violent conduct”. Her Honour did not expressly state that the totality principle had no application. Nevertheless her Honour not only regarded it as appropriate there be “an accumulation”, her Honour imposed sentences that were fully accumulated.
	
	
	Ordinarily, if the approach stated in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45] was being applied, it can be expected that sentences for assaults such as these that were close in time and otherwise connected would warrant some concurrency in the sentences that were imposed. In R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 (“Loveridge”) this Court addressed “five separate attacks” in the same area on five different victims with “different levels of outcome” for the victims. This was held to justify a “significant level of accumulation” for the various offences (at [275] per Bathurst CJ, Johnson and R.A. Hulme JJ). However a “significant level of accumulation” still contemplates some concurrency and that was reflected in the sentences imposed (Loveridge at [282]).
	
	
	The fixing of individual sentences prior to a consideration of principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality is not the only method of sentencing in such circumstances. Instead, a sentencing judge can lower each sentence and then aggregate them, although that is not the “preferable course” (Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [26] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ; “Johnson”; Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at p 63). While it is not clear, two matters suggest that was the course taken by the sentencing judge in this case.
	
	
	The first is that, as noted, her Honour expressly referred to the totality principle and appeared to accept its application.
	
	
	The second is that, in view of the findings in the sentencing judgment and the maximum penalties for each offence, the individual sentences for the two offences appear relatively lenient. Both of them involve extremely serious and unprovoked attacks. The attack on the second victim was particularly vicious. The applicant has a poor criminal record which includes a number of crimes of violence. There was no finding of remorse in his favour. Not only were his prospects of rehabilitation considered “guarded”, there was an appreciable risk of his reoffending, especially given his tendency to abuse alcohol.
	
	
	It follows that I would reject ground 2. Her Honour took into account the connection between the two offences in imposing the individual offences in a manner consistent with Johnson at [26]. It also follows that ground 3 should be rejected.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness I note that, had I upheld ground 2, I would not have intervened as I consider that no lesser sentence for each offence and overall is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912; ss 6(3)).
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	The applicant be granted an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal.
	
	
	Leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.

2766642,Boswell v R [2015] NSWDC 208,"Judgment


	
	This has been a very difficult case to decide. When I was sitting in Albury last year Jason Boswell had appealed to the District Court from a prison sentence he had received from Magistrate Greenwood. Mr Boswell gave evidence before me in Albury and I heard submissions from his counsel Ms C Mendes. After the second day and after hearing from Ms Mendes and Mr A Thomas, the solicitor for the respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, I adjourned his appeal to 27 February this year before me in Sydney.
	
	
	I granted the adjournment under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I had in mind - and said at the time - the provisions of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That sets out the purposes of sentencing. Lawyers often correctly say that the purposes of sentencing can point in opposite directions. A crime may require a person to go to gaol but on the other hand there may be an expectation that the offender be rehabilitated rather than go to gaol.
	
	
	When I adjourned the proceedings, I addressed Mr Boswell - who had been listening to the discussion between me and the lawyers - telling him that “it’s better for the community and for you to get yourself rehabilitated, back on track so that you don’t commit these sorts of crimes which you’re committing.” I said that I understood why the magistrate had sent him to gaol and that I was inclined to dismiss his appeal so that the gaol sentence would stand. I went on to say -
	


“[B]ecause you’re taking these steps to sort yourself out I’m going to adjourn your appeal to next year so when you come back you can show me how things are going, and if they’re going well, then I’ll probably suspend the sentence or hear what Ms Mendes says about alternatives to gaol.”

I indicated that I had not asked the prosecution what their attitude was, at that stage, to dealing with Mr Boswell’s case in that way.


	
	The case came back before me in February this year but Mr Boswell was unrepresented. The details are not important but the point was that he was not in a position to afford counsel because, I think, of a change in his circumstances. I was concerned about him appearing without representation and I agreed to adjourn the case again to check Ms Mendes’ availability so that he could retain her again.
	
	
	As it happened, Ms Mendes’ and my professional commitments did not provide an opportunity for the case to be brought on again until today. The matter was listed for 10 o’clock. Ms Mendes was flying from Albury this morning but fog prevented her from leaving. The case came on at about noon and I was provided with some reading material and I heard briefly from Ms Mendes and Mr C Allison who appears now for the Director of Public Prosecutions. The case resumed at about a quarter to 3 this afternoon. Evidence and submissions have just concluded and it is now just after ten to 6 on a Friday evening. I have decided to make my decision this evening in fairness to all parties and their legal representatives .
	
	
	One factor I have not mentioned is that the term of the sentence which was imposed by her Honour Magistrate Greenwood comprised a non-parole period which would have expired in less than two weeks from now, on 28 May 2015. In other words, had Mr Boswell not appealed he would be due for release on parole in just under two weeks from now.
	
	
	I should record the crimes that Mr Boswell was convicted of and which are the subject of his appeal. One is assault occasioning actual bodily harm which is domestic violence related. That is an offence against s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment to that offence, although the Local Court has a jurisdictional limit of two years imprisonment. The other offence was contravening a prohibition or restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order. That is an offence against s 14(1) of Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). Parliament has fixed a maximum of two years imprisonment to that offence.
	
	
	For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm her Honour imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment. For the contravention of the domestic violence order her Honour imposed a sentence of four months imprisonment. Her Honour accumulated both sentences so that the overall aggregate sentence was 16 months. It was specified to commence on the day her Honour imposed it, 29 September 2014. As I have said, her Honour fixed a non-parole period of eight months and that was due to expire on 28 May 2014. Mr Boswell spent about three days in custody before receiving appeal bail.
	
	
	I need to say something about the circumstances of the offence. There was an apprehended domestic violence order naming Mr Boswell as defendant and a woman named Amanda Pierce as the person in need of protection. It was in place when these offences occurred on 26 July 2014. Mr Boswell was not allowed within 100 metres of any premises where Ms Pierce was, nor was he permitted within 50 metres of Ms Pierce herself. Despite this, they evidently attended a club together in Albury and she was giving him a lift home in the early hours of Saturday morning, 26 July 2014.
	
	
	There is some question about whether or not they argued. The facts recorded that they did. Mr Boswell in evidence said that they did not. But what did occur is that there was some struggle as he took the keys from the ignition. She bit him and he then threw the car keys out of the window. The agreed facts record that he hit her “four or five times with a closed fist to the victim’s forehead and facial area”. He says it was no more than three times, but I need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was more than his verified account says and so I accept that it was three times. More importantly, however, is the fact that he inflicted the violence on her.
	
	
	I raised the questions of photographs. Mr Allison tendered (as exhibit D) some photographs today. They show a nasty-looking bruise on Ms Pierce’s face. There are other injuries which are in dispute. I do not need to make determinations about the details. It is enough that Mr Boswell has pleaded guilty to assaulting her physically and punching her in the face three times causing, as I repeat, a nasty bruise.
	
	
	Mr Boswell was arrested and charged. I might add that the injuries were described in the facts in a way consistent with how I see them as “a large swollen left eye socket, a lump in front of her left ear, numerous redness and swelling to her right wrist”. There are some scratches and a chipped tooth which are in dispute. Again, it is enough for my purposes that Mr Boswell caused the facial bruising by violently assaulting Ms Pierce.
	
	
	As I have said, I am not surprised at the sentence imposed by her Honour. Mr Boswell has a criminal record, not only in New South Wales but also in Victoria. In 2011 he received a good behaviour bond from the Local Court for stalking and intimidating someone with an intention to cause them fear. He was convicted again in the Local Court of contravening a restriction in a domestic violence order and given a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In 2013 he was convicted of a common assault and received a s 9 bond. He was called up on that bond which was extended to two years. Hence when he assaulted Ms Pierce he was in breach of that good behaviour bond. Mr Boswell has driving offences in Victoria as well as convictions for theft and burglary and one conviction for recklessly cause serious injury. The driving convictions in New South Wales and Victoria on occasion involved driving under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report prepared on 25 September 2014 noted that Mr Boswell had been referred for assessment relating to “his alcohol abuse issues”. That pre-sentence report was updated for the purpose of these proceedings and a supplementary report dated 11 March 2015 was prepared by Ms Samara Abbott. Two passages are of concern in that report which both counsel addressed in their examination, cross-examination and addresses. One is a note that “Mr Boswell self assessed that he feels as though he has never had an issue with the consumption of alcohol and that he is currently abstinent from consuming alcohol”. A second passage is an assessment by the author which pointed out that “Mr Boswell did not display any victim empathy and placed blame for the current charges on the victim.” When exploring a pattern of domestic violence he is quoted as saying: “You know how women like to get men in trouble”. The author notes that Mr Boswell “claimed not to be a violent person justifying all past violent convictions as the fault of the victim.”
	
	
	Mr Allison was obviously concerned about those remarks and cross-examined Mr Boswell about them this afternoon. Mr Boswell explained that the interview lasted no more than five minutes and that he did not have time to explain himself and that the references do not accurately state what he has said. Mr Boswell also explained an apparent inconsistency between a note by the Probation and Parole officer that Mr Boswell is abstaining from alcohol and a note from another counsellor who refers to him reducing his alcohol intake and drinking only occasionally.
	
	
	Mr Boswell is clearly well liked and highly regarded as an individual. He has strong and supportive references from former and current employers and personal references from women who know him well. In particular he is currently in a new relationship with Kristy Lehmann. In a letter to the court dated 12 May 2015 she points out that they are living together in Wodonga and that Mr Boswell has been “honest and open with me about the charges that he was facing and the predicament that he was in”. She too, like others, describes him as a “caring, kind and thoughtful person”. Significantly, she said that she has “observed over the last few months a number of changes in him and I believe that he has been doing everything he can to make himself a better person.” She thought that Mr Boswell “has benefitted from his meetings with parole officers and drug and alcohol counsellors and the men’s behaviour counsellor.” She notes that he expresses what appears to be genuine remorse when talking about his offences. She is “confident that Mr Boswell is committed to make positive changes in his life.” Ms Lehmann is a registered nurse working for Albury Wodonga Health. She points out, and I accept, that she has no criminal history and drinks only occasionally. She does not take drugs. Significantly, she says that “Mr Boswell understands that I will not put up with any nonsense in our relationship.” She is prepared to continue to offer “my love, encouragement and support” and that the community of Albury Wodonga would greatly benefit from his contribution if he was given another opportunity.
	
	
	I have reports from a men’s behaviour change program conducted through the St Vincent de Paul Society. It records that Mr Boswell participated well and understands “that change takes time and is an ongoing work in progress”. That is dated February this year. He is well regarded, as I say, by his employer. There is a report from a drug and alcohol counsellor who records that “Mr Boswell has identified the correlation between his drinking and resulting situations leading to his legal situation” and “has developed a self-awareness of his actions and the impacts they can have on others.” She thought that this has resulted in Mr Boswell “making positive changes in his life, gaining control over his thoughts and actions.” His GP has referred Mr Boswell to a clinical psychologist in Albury, Dr Brian Hickman.
	
	
	Mr Boswell is obviously a skilled welder who works with metal and I have seen photographs of some of his work which is clearly of a high quality and I can understand why he is highly regarded by employers.
	
	
	Ms Mendes called her client again today. I had asked the prosecutor in Albury not to commence his cross-examination down there but to wait until the case resumed in Sydney. Mr Allison came well prepared and cross-examined Mr Boswell very thoroughly and covered topics which I had hoped would be explored. The cross-examination revealed the truth of Ms Mendes’ opening submission in her address to me that her client is far from perfect. He was very defensive about his behaviour and played down his role in the various offences that he has been convicted of involving violence with women. He happens to be the only person I have heard evidence from, so I must bear that in mind. He also seemed to be somewhat defensive about his alcohol intake. At least one or two or more of the offences have been committed when Mr Boswell had been drinking. His criminal record involves a number of drink driving offences. He is a person who clearly has run into difficulty with the consumption of alcohol. By difficulty, I mean that his behaviour has resulted in committing offences. That means that he needs to give very serious attention to his drinking habits.
	
	
	Mr Allison pointed out correctly that not only is Mr Boswell deprived of leniency because of his criminal record but that he committed these offences whilst he was on a good behaviour bond. I will explain those two submissions. A person who comes before a court for sentencing if they have good character references and no criminal record will receive a benefit for that and receive a lesser penalty. A person does not get an increased penalty because of a record but is deprived of what might otherwise count in their favour. Mr Allison is right in that submission. The second point is that a court decided to release Mr Boswell on a good behaviour bond. Instead of complying with that good behaviour bond, he did the opposite and assaulted someone. Courts regard that as an aggravating factor in sentencing people.
	
	
	Mr Allison drew my attention, correctly, to s 14(4) of the Crimes Domestic and Personal Violence Act. It must be remembered that Mr Boswell has been convicted of an offence under s 14(1) of that Act. Subs 4 provides that unless I order otherwise -
	


“A person who is convicted of an offence against subs (1) must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment if the act constituting the offence was an act of violence against a person.”

This was an act of violence against a person.


	
	Ms Mendes realistically acknowledged that there was no alternative than a prison sentence for her client which is a question that I have to consider under s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. But the thrust of her submission was how the prison sentence should be served.
	
	
	Returning to Mr Allison’s submissions, he cogently pointed out that there have now been three victims of Mr Boswell’s domestic violence and he referred to the three women, the last being Ms Pierce. He emphasised the importance of specific and general deterrence as well as denunciation of the crime and punishment of the offender. He expressed significant concern about the observations made by the author of the most recent presentence report. He pointed out, which is consistent with my observation, that Mr Boswell minimises responsibility.
	
	
	On the other hand, Ms Mendes points out that her client has done all he could have done during the period of the adjournment. She points out that her client accepts the significant aspects of the violent offence he committed against Ms Pearce and she points to the benefit or progress he has made from assistance over the last seven months. She emphasises that in the long term the community is best served by the rehabilitation of an offender such as Mr Boswell who has not completed his rehabilitation but has clearly embarked on the correct path and, as she cogently pointed out, her client has come a long way since he attacked his former partner in July 2014. In contrast of course to Mr Allison, Ms Mendes emphasised the stronger purpose of sentencing in this case may be the rehabilitation of an offender within the community rather than the punishment which Mr Allison also correctly pointed out is another valid consideration.
	
	
	I have been in two minds about how to deal with this case. Both positions are strong. In the result I have decided that I will suspend the sentence which was imposed upon Mr Boswell. I appreciate that I am putting the community at risk in doing this. Mr Boswell’s record and the fact that he breached a previous bond are serious considerations, as correctly emphasised by Mr Allison who highlighted the importance of the protection of the community. Again, I acknowledge that in not sending Mr Boswell to gaol immediately I am increasing to some extent the risk in the community. However, on the other hand, that risk would still be present if Mr Boswell served a period of time in gaol and came out of gaol to commence his progress towards rehabilitation then.
	
	
	An important factor that I have taken into account is Ms Mendes’ point about her client undertaking everything that he was asked to do. I said to him in Albury that he should show me how things are going and if they are going well “then I’ll probably suspend the sentence”. I think the force of Ms Mendes’ point is particularly relevant to that observation of mine. Mr Boswell has seen a number of counsellors, has obtained reports and is undertaking a serious commitment to seeing a psychologist. To send him to gaol fulltime now would, I think, be somewhat unfair in light of what I said to him in Albury. In addition to that, as I observed, had he not appealed his non-parole period would be almost finished by now. Through unfortunate and unavoidable circumstances there has been a significant delay in his appeal being finalised. That means that Mr Boswell would commence a fresh gaol sentence almost at the time that he was due to be released. As Ms Mendes said, her client is far from perfect. That became obvious during his cross-examination. But I am prepared to provide him with the opportunity, with professional support and the apparently strong support of Ms Lehmann, to continue to deal with what his obviously an ingrained problem in his life. In suspending the sentence it means that for the next 16 months if Mr Boswell commits any further offences, be they serious or less serious, he is likely to go to fulltime gaol. As Ms Mendes pointed out he is, in effect, his own gaoler.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am going to make my formal order now Mr Boswell. If you would stand up. Ms Mendes and Mr Allison if you would be thinking about conditions of the bond.


	
	Under s 20(2) of the Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by varying the sentence. I vary the sentence by making an order under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period. I direct that Mr Boswell be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 16 months.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Now apart from conditions which we will fix in a moment, are they the only formal orders I need.

MENDES: In respect of both offences your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: Yes because it was an aggregate sentence, so her Honour imposed one sentence.

MENDES: But your Honour’s now imposing two suspended sentences. One for each.

HIS HONOUR: No because my understanding is that - and this is what exhibit A says - aggregate term of imprisonment of 16 months to be released, et cetera, and then it says sequence 1 imprisonment 12 months, sequence 2 imprisonment 4 months. So clearly what her Honour did was to accumulate them both completely to 16 months. Sorry. My understanding what her Honour’s doing is under section 53A whatever it is, and she specified as the section requires what the individual sentences would have been. So they would have been 12 months and 4 months but instead under section 53 whatever it is her Honour’s imposed one aggregate sentence. Now I might be wrong but that’s my reading of it.

MENDES: My understanding is precisely what your Honour has just indicated.

HIS HONOUR: Which means just one sentence.

MENDES: The difficulty is that your Honour cannot suspend an aggregate sentence, as I understand it. There’s nothing wrong with your Honour of course imposing the two suspended sentences, one in respect of each offence.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Mr Allison?

ALLISON: Suitable your Honour.


	
	I review my order. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of the sentence imposed by the Magistrate, I sentence Mr Boswell to 12 months imprisonment in respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and to a cumulative 4 months imprisonment to the offence of contravening the apprehended domestic violence order. The total sentence is therefore 16 months. Under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period. I direct that Mr Boswell be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 16 months.
	


MENDES: I am sorry, your Honour. My understanding is that you can’t actually impose a cumulative suspended sentence. So your Honour is entitled to impose a 12 month suspended sentence and then 4 months suspended sentence with respect to the other matter. If he was to breach the suspended sentence within the 4 month period then your Honour’s remarks on sentence would become relevant in that a sentence of 16 months would then flow cumulative. However, if your Honour imposed a suspended sentence of 4 months but the breach occurred after that, my understanding is your Honour would only then have the 12 month suspended sentence remaining.

HIS HONOUR: I am not following exactly, but what do you propose, what is the solution?

MENDES: If your Honour wishes to impose a 16 months suspended sentence it would be appropriate for your Honour to impose two suspended sentences each of 16 months.

HIS HONOUR: That means a Parker warning though.

MENDES: Effectively yes, but your Honour we wouldn’t wish to be heard in respect of that.

HIS HONOUR: If you talk to your client.

MENDES: I will just explain that.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Allison do you want to be heard on that solution?

ALLISON: I concur with that solution, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

MENDES: I have explained in a nutshell the Parker warning to Mr Boswell and he wishes to proceed with the appeal.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you Ms Mendes. So two sentences each of 16 months.

MENDES: Yes, 16 months.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t specify, because I am going to suspend them, whether they are concurrent or cumulative, I just sentence don’t I?

MENDES: Yes. Those questions are determined later, if at all.


	
	Mr Boswell, Ms Mendes has just explained to you, but I need to explain it to you. You are going to come away with two higher sentences than the ones that you came with. You came with 4 plus 12 equals 16. You are going to go away with two lots of 16. So instead of 4 months you are getting 16 months and instead of 12 months you are getting 16 months. But they will run at the same time so the effect is the same. But you need to know so far as your criminal record is concerned that when somebody is looking at your criminal record in the future they will see that I have imposed two 16 month prison sentences - yes suspended - but they are higher than the Magistrate and that could count against you at some stage if somebody said, they gave 16 months not just 4 and 12, the judge gave him 16 months. Do you want me to proceed?
	


APPELLANT: I understand that.

HIS HONOUR: You want me to proceed?

APPELLANT: Yes.


	
	Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm I impose a sentence of 16 months imprisonment. In respect of the offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order I impose a sentence of 16 months imprisonment. In the event that those sentences need to be served in prison they are concurrent. A Parker warning has been explained to the offender by his counsel and by me and I accept that he understands it and asks me to proceed. Under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of each of the sentences for 16 months and I direct that Mr Boswell be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 16 months.
	


HIS HONOUR: Have we got it right?

MENDES: Yes.

ALLISON: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now, conditions.

MENDES: Accept the supervision of NSW Community Corrections Service as they deem necessary--

ALLISON: Including, in relation to alcohol, anger management--

HIS HONOUR: Are you picking that up from the report?

ALLISON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: They think that he is unlikely to benefit from supervision.

MENDES: Yes. Your Honour he is subject to a s 9 bond that was imposed on 29 September last year for a period of 2 years, a condition that he accept the supervision of NSW Probation Service. So, notwithstanding that they indicate that he may not benefit, your Honour, he is already subject - perhaps if your Honour just makes that condition.

ALLISON: Your Honour, under tab 8 of the original appeal bundle--

HIS HONOUR: Yes I am just reading it, yes.

ALLISON: Yes, the original pre-sentence report. Your Honour in relation to Victoria, if I can perhaps pre-empt what your Honour is considering, what is done in Victoria is a matter for those authorities--

HIS HONOUR: I agree with that.

ALLISON: The Crown’s position is there should be some conditions in relation to the New South Wales s 12 suspended sentence, even if it mirrors it, it shouldn’t add in terms of aggregation of responsibility but if it could superimpose that same responsibility that would be ideal. It would seem that the responsibility, anger management, management of alcohol issues, in the Crown submission, they are key considerations.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I think you have got a point. Yes I am going to do it Ms Mendes.


	
	The conditions of the good behaviour bond are these:
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he notify any change of his residential address to the Registrar of the Distract Court at Albury.
	
	
	That he attend court if he receives a notice to do so.
	
	
	That he accept supervision from Community Corrections and accepts any reasonable recommendations and directions from that Service including for anger manager and alcohol issues.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Mr Bowell, it took me a while to make up my mind about your case. I was very close to sending you to gaol and there was a very good case made for it. You have heard what Mr Allison has said, your record shows it, but I am concerned about being fair to you and, as Ms Mendes said, you have done a lot in the last 7 months. You have had a hiccup in the middle, and so you are here in the middle of May instead of February. I am putting the community at risk letting you out because of your record and because you have breached these things before, but I am going to give you a go. You have got strong support obviously from Ms Lehmann and from your employer and, most importantly, you as Ms Mendes said you are on track, you have started. Now you are under supervision for 16 months, you know about that better than I do. Let them help you and continue the work that you have started. That will make you less of a risk to the women that you relate with and you have been a risk in the past to the women that you are intimate with and you do not want to put Ms Lehmann at risk--

APPELLANT: No.

HIS HONOUR: No. But you are a risk and so you have got to keep up the good work that you have started, do you understand? You have got to stay out of trouble no drink driving, no brawls, nothing. Because if you come back before me, and Ms Mendes will remind you and explain this, a suspended sentence good behaviour bond is different to a normal good behaviour bond that you have got from the Local Court. If you breach a suspended sentence good behaviour bond my hands are pretty tied. I have pretty well got to send you to gaol, the law says that. It is very hard for me not to send you to gaol. So you have got to understand that. If you get busted for PCA and come back before me there is little I can do apart from send you in, you have got to understand that. And certainly if you get into a brawl or anything like that it is the same. If you change your address from where you are now let them know at the courthouse so that they can track you down. If you get a notice to come to court, turn up, rather than have the police and sheriff chasing you, and most importantly let Corrective Services help you. They know to what extent to push you and not to push you, but let them help you. Do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else Mr Allison, Ms Mendes?

ALLISON: No, your Honour.

MENDES: No.

HIS HONOUR: Now it is 5 minutes to 7. It is an occupational hazard for me and my associate, we understand that, and counsel. But there is a court officer here and most significantly there are staff in the Registry and RSB, those who are recording these proceedings. My associate indicated to me that they couldn’t keep recording past 6.30. I indicated that that was not acceptable. So somebody I expect, perhaps more than one, is significantly inconvenienced as a result of me sitting on until almost 7 o’clock. A number of people have had their Friday night disrupted and I record my appreciation for that. It means that this case which has followed me from Albury, and has had some false starts, has now been finalised and I appreciate the contribution which those inconvenienced members of staff have made to the administration of justice. I will now adjourn.

		22 September 2015",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766655,Hamze v R [2015] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Saddam Hamze (""the applicant"") makes a bail release application pursuant to s 49 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	Button J refused a release application on 26 February 2015. Section 67 provides power for this Court to determine a further application.
	
	
	The applicant is to stand trial in the District Court at Parramatta on 19 October 2015 where he is to be indicted on charges of:
	


1.   Causing grievous bodily harm to John Hanna with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years; standard non-parole period 7 years)

2.   Specially aggravated kidnapping of John Hanna (s 86(3) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years)

3.   Stealing a motor vehicle (s 154F - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years)

4.   Intentionally destroying a motor vehicle by means of fire whilst in company (s 195(1A)(b) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 11 years)


	
	Mahmoud Atwa is to be jointly indicted with him on those charges. Adam Falzon is to be indicted on a charge of being a principal in the second degree to the first charge.
	


The prosecution case


	
	The Crown case, as summarised in written submissions, is that the offences were committed on 25 July 2013 by the applicant and his brother, Wesam Hamze, Mahmoud Atwa, Mahmoud Karanough, and an unidentified male. Adam Falzon played a role in luring the victim, John Hanna, to the vicinity of the Smithfield Tavern where he was punched and kicked by five men and shot in the thigh, thereby causing a broken leg. He was then bundled into his car and dropped at Auburn Hospital. His car was taken to Regents Park and set alight.
	
	
	The background to this was that Wesam Hamze wanted to buy a firearm. He made an arrangement with John Hanna that Hanna would obtain the firearm on his behalf. Wesam Hamze gave Hanna $5500 for that purpose. Hanna was not able to obtain the firearm and was not able to return the money. He tried to reassure Wesam Hamze that he would return the money or obtain the firearm and that he just needed more time.
	
	
	Believing that he had been ""ripped off"", Wesam Hamze became increasingly irate. He contacted a number of people including the applicant and informed them of the failed transaction. Wesam Hamze's phone was being intercepted by police at the time and recorded calls and text messages are a substantial part of the prosecution's evidence.
	
	
	Thinking that the victim was avoiding him and did not want to meet face-to-face, Wesam Hamze arranged for the co-accused, Adam Falzon, to lure the victim to a meeting. Falzon was successful in this respect. The applicant agreed to accompany Wesam Hamze to a confrontation with Hanna. Telephone intercepts and the location of cell towers their mobile phones accessed are said to establish their presence at relevant locations; specifically in relation to the applicant, the cell tower evidence is said to establish his presence at relevant times at Smithfield and shortly afterwards at Auburn and then Regents Park. Distinctive clothing identical to that worn by one of the assailants as depicted on CCTV footage in the vicinity of the Smithfield Tavern was found when the applicant's home was searched by police on 10 October 2013.
	
	
	John Hanna declined to assist police and has not provided a statement. He told police on the night of the shooting that he was assaulted and shot outside the Smithfield Tavern and that there were approximately four males involved; but he claimed he did not know who they were. On 31 July 2013 he gave an account to a police officer which included that Wesam Hamze and his brother Saddam were involved.
	
	
	According to a statement of facts prepared by police, the applicant was arrested on 2 January 2014. He denied involvement in the shooting, ever having been to Smithfield, and knowing Adam Falzon. He did admit to knowing John Hanna.
	
	
	The Crown submissions summarised that its case involves the following bodies of evidence:
	


Conversations between the applicant and his brother in which they discuss the latter's ""problem"" with the victim and the applicant's willingness to meet and assist.

Cell tower locations placing the phone used by the applicant at Smithfield, Auburn and Regents Park at relevant times.

Clothing consistent with that owned and worn by the applicant depicted in CCTV footage as being worn by a male at the scene of the shooting.

Statements made by the victim in which he named the applicant as one of the perpetrators.

A need to show cause


	
	Counts 1 and 2 are ""serious indictable offences"" in Part 3 of the Crimes Act that are alleged to have involved the use of a firearm. All of the offences are alleged to have been committed whilst the applicant was on bail for other matters. For these reasons, pursuant to s 16A of the Bail Act, the applicant must show cause as to why his detention is not justified. If he fails to do so, bail must be refused.
	


A need to determine whether any unacceptable risk


	
	If the applicant does show cause, then pursuant to s 19 it will become necessary to consider whether there is an unacceptable risk of the applicant failing to appear in court; committing a serious offence; endangering the safety of victims, individuals or the community; or interfering with witnesses or evidence. Bail must be refused if there is any such unacceptable risk. In approaching this task the Court must consider the matters listed in s 18.
	
	
	That the show cause requirement and the unacceptable risk assessment are distinct considerations is apparent from the text of the statute and was confirmed in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	


History of proceedings


	
	As indicated earlier, the applicant was arrested and charged on 2 January 2014. He was committed for trial on 27 November 2014. He was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on 25 February 2015. He is due to stand trial on 19 October 2015.
	
	
	The applicant's brother, Wesam Hamze has pleaded guilty and apparently is awaiting sentence.
	
	
	Mahmoud Rabee Karanough is an alleged co-offender who was charged on 19 January 2015. He is listed for a ""paper committal"" in the Local Court at Parramatta on 26 June 2015. His solicitor has been informed by the Crown that, if he is committed for trial, the Crown proposes that he be tried jointly with the applicant.
	


Criminal history


	
	The applicant has a criminal history which includes offences of driving whilst disqualified (x 4); possessing an anabolic or androgenic steroids (x 2); having custody of a knife in a public place (x 3); possessing a prohibited drug (x 4); supplying a prohibited drug; attempting to dispose of stolen property; making a false or misleading statement; having suspected stolen goods in custody (x 2); possessing a prescribed restricted substance (x 3); receiving stolen property; and possessing identity information with intent to commit an indictable offence.
	
	
	The applicant failed to appear in court when required on 28 May 2009, 7 November 2012, 2 October 2013 and 28 October 2013. He has 4 convictions for the offence of failing to appear. He was in breach of bail on 28 October 2008.
	
	
	At the time of the offences presently alleged, the applicant was on bail for other matters including for drug supply. He has committed offences whilst on bail in the past.
	


Police views


	
	A document setting out the attitude of investigating police to the applicant's release application adds the information that when he reported to police pursuant to a bail condition on 28 July 2013 he was wearing the same distinctive jumper and had the same bag as depicted in the CCTV footage from the crime scene. It also includes that such was the seriousness of the victim's injuries that he spent four weeks in hospital.
	
	
	The author, Detective Jamieson of the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad, also indicated that the applicant had been discharged from a community service order in 2010 with his file noted, ""Completed unsatisfactory"". While reporting on bail to Merrylands police station between 16 August and 25 September 2013 he provided four medical certificates for non-attendance. On 5 June 2013 he entered bail with a condition that he ""comply with all directions of the MERIT team whilst on bail"" but on 7 August 2013 was removed from the MERIT program with his file noted, ""Non-compliant"" and ""Very poor attendance"".
	
	
	It was noted that the applicant was found in possession of false identification documents and credit cards in July 2013. Investigation of that matter pointed to a credit/fraud syndicate. Police believe that if the applicant is released on bail he would be able to again access further false identification documents to either flee the jurisdiction or otherwise avoid prosecution.
	
	
	Another matter disclosed in the document is that at the time of the alleged offences the applicant was subject to a bail condition that he reside at a particular address in Guildford. Apparently, there is no such address.
	
	
	Having regard to the seriousness of the matter, Detective Jamieson asserts that police are fearful that if the applicant is released on bail he may interfere with witnesses and/or their families or cause harm to the victim.
	
	
	In a statement of facts prepared by Detective Jamieson it is alleged that between his house being searched on 10 October 2013 and his arrest on 2 January 2014 the applicant had been avoiding police by frequently moving his residence; living in hotels; and using false identity information.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	The solicitor for the applicant provided written submissions which raise the following points:
	


The applicant has been in custody since 2 January 2014 and will remain in custody for a further 5 months if not released on bail. There may be further delay given the proceedings concerning the alleged co-offender, Mahmoud Karanough is still pending in the Local Court. Reference was made to bail decisions under the repealed Bail Act 1978 (NSW) in which delay was held to be a significant factor. It was submitted that in this case the delay was an ""exceptional circumstance"".

The Crown case is not strong. It is a circumstantial case with ""deficiencies"". It was submitted, for example, that there is no evidence of identification of the applicant; of forensic evidence like DNA or fingerprints; of the applicant possessing a firearm; or of the applicant assaulting the victim, discharging a firearm, causing any injuries, of being involved in stealing, damaging or setting alight the victim's car. The applicant's solicitor noted that Button J did not find the Crown case to be overwhelming; he found that it ""could not be regarded as weak"".

The applicant is relatively young (now aged 24). This is said in the written submissions to be particularly significant given he ""has never previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment"". The latter is wrong; it was conceded in oral submissions that he was imprisoned for four months in 2011 for driving whilst disqualified.


	
	Submissions were also made asserting error in the judgment of Button J in his refusal to grant bail. This is not a review of the decision of his Honour. The Court must make its own assessment of the application. But one matter warrants comment: it was submitted that his Honour erred in having regard to matters relevant to the unacceptable risk test when considering the show cause requirement. There is nothing wrong with that; in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya at [24] it was recognised that matters relevant to the former may also be relevant to the latter.
	
	
	The submissions set out in detail the applicant's position in relation to various matters listed in s 18 of the Bail Act. They include that he has available to him a surety in the form of an acceptable person agreeing to forfeit $5000 if he fails to appear in court and that he is prepared to abide by conditions such as ""house arrest"" as part of an ""extremely strict bail regime"" directed to ensuring that he be of good behaviour and appear in court when required.
	


Determination


	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya it was stated (at [25]) that:
	


“The show cause test by its terms requires an accused person to demonstrate why, on the balance of probabilities (s 32), his or her detention is not justified. The justification or otherwise of detention is a matter to be determined by a consideration of all of the evidence or information the bail authority considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (s 31(1)) and not just by a consideration of those matters exhaustively listed in s 18 required to be considered for the unacceptable risk assessment.”


	
	There is some force in the applicant's solicitor's submission that the Crown case is not a strong one. Nevertheless, it appears to be a viable one.
	
	
	The time during which the applicant has been held in custody to date is relevant and of undoubted concern. The more predominant concern at this point, however, is the question of how much longer he may be expected to be in custody before there is a determination of his guilt or otherwise. With the current trial listing that will be in the order of 6 months, given the trial is estimated to require about a month's hearing time.
	
	
	However, the offences are extremely serious in their nature and a significant custodial sentence may be expected to follow if the applicant is convicted. Speaking generally, this provides an inherent risk that a person in the applicant's position may seek in some fashion to avoid such consequences.
	
	
	The applicant faces the difficulty that his compliance with bail in the past has been quite poor in terms of appearing in court when required and committing further offences. There must be very real concern about him complying with bail, even with strict conditions of the type that are proposed. It is difficult to give any weight to an assertion today from the bar table that the explanation for his past transgressions was a drug addiction which has now been addressed.
	
	
	Having regard to all of these circumstances, sufficient cause has not been shown on the balance of probabilities (s 32) to establish that the applicant’s further detention is not justified. The application should be refused.
	


Order


	
	Bail release application refused.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed upon him by Mahony SC DCJ in the Newcastle District Court on 9 May 2014.


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the following offences:
	



	
	Supply a prohibited drug contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years.
	
	
	Deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s193B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years.
	
	
	Possess a prohibited firearm contrary to s7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	The court was asked to take into account matters on two Forms 1. An offence of possess restricted substance (Sildenafil – Viagra) was taken into account under count 1 on the indictment and an offence of possess three rounds of .32 calibre ammunition without a licence or permit was taken into account on count 3.
	
	
	There were also related charges on a certificate pursuant to s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These offences comprised drive while disqualified and drive in a manner dangerous.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


Count 1 – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 12 September 2013 and expiring 11 September 2016, with an additional term of 2 years expiring 11 September 2018.

Count 2 – A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 9 May 2014 and expiring 8 May 2016.

Count 3 – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 9 May 2015 and expiring 8 May 2017, with an additional term of 1 year expiring 8 May 2018.


	
	The overall sentence was a total head sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months to date from 12 September 2013 and to expire on 8 May 2017. His Honour dealt with the two matters pursuant to s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 under s10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He disqualified the applicant from driving for 2 years from 7 December 2018 and a further period of disqualification for 10 years to date from 9 May 2014.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from those sentences on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in not giving effect to his finding of special circumstances.

Ground 2 – His Honour failed to consider whether time spent in custody in relation to the offences for which the offender was sentenced included a period when the offender was also serving a balance of parole for a prior offence.

Factual Background


	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 1 September 2012. These offences were committed while he was on conditional liberty. His parole was revoked and he was sentenced to serve the balance of his term of imprisonment from 1 September 2012 to 11 September 2013. It follows from the sentences imposed by his Honour that the applicant has been in custody in respect of these offences from 12 September 2013.
	
	
	In the early hours of 1 September 2012 the applicant was driving a white Commodore with two other unidentified passengers in the vehicle. As the vehicle approached a random breath test unit on Hillsborough Road Charlestown, it accelerated and was pursued by the police. The pursuit proceeded for a distance of about 1 kilometre, during which the vehicle driven by the applicant was speeding. The vehicle pulled into an apartment block and the occupants, including the applicant, ran off.
	
	
	The applicant was located and arrested. He was searched and cash was found in his pockets in the sum of $8,790 and in his wallet in the sum of $930. In the vicinity of the car, the following items were found: a blue and grey Nike sports bag containing a bundle of cash secured with an elastic band amounting to $5,350; two envelopes containing $5,700, i.e. a total of $11,050; a blue and black bum bag which contained $7,500 in cash; 71.49 grams of methylamphetamine in three bags; a small electronic scale; small resealable bags; a .32 double barrel keyring pistol and .32 calibre cartridges.
	


The sentence proceedings


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial, notwithstanding that some negotiations had taken place during the preceding week. His Honour allowed the applicant a discount of 10 percent on sentence for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The applicant had a poor criminal history in relation to offences for drug possession and supply which his Honour set out as follows:
	


15 December 2005 - supply of prohibited drugs and possession of an unregistered firearm (imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years);

2 July 2010 - supply of prohibited drugs (imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 years and 4 months).

The applicant was released on parole in respect of the most recent charge on 1 July 2012 and was on conditional liberty when the current offences occurred.


	
	His Honour took into account the following matters in relation to the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report, dated 24 March 2014, reported that his response to supervision had been traditionally poor. He was the youngest of seven children. An older brother had passed away from melanoma when he was aged 12 and another from injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident in about 2004. His Honour accepted that the applicant struggled with depression as a result of unresolved grief issues arising from those tragic events.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, the applicant had completed the first two stages of a drug rehabilitation program but had relapsed into drug use shortly after his conditional release on parole. The pre-sentence report assessed the applicant to be at high risk of re-offending. It noted that he had a long history of non-compliance with supervision compounded by his struggle to remain abstinent from illicit drug use. He was assessed as unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections because of his history of non-compliance and his need for more intense therapeutic treatment.
	
	
	A more recent pre-sentence report was received shortly before the sentence hearing. That report recorded that the applicant had completed a course at Long Bay in 2012 and that he stayed clean from drugs for three years whilst in custody but had relapsed a few months after release. The author of the report said that the applicant might well benefit from an Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program while in custody known as IDATP. This is a full-time drug and alcohol program presented at John Moroney Correctional Centre.
	
	
	The author of the report stated that the applicant was currently on anti-depressant medication (Avanza), but that no other mental health diagnosis had been made by Justice Health while he was in custody. She assessed him as still addicted to drugs, in particular, ice and amphetamines. She believed that he was motivated to attend residential rehabilitation but that the IDATP program might only be an option if he received a lengthy sentence.
	
	
	The applicant tendered a report of Dr Christopher Bench, psychiatrist, dated 27 April 2014. The applicant had been evaluated by Dr Bench via an audiovisual link on 23 April 2014. His Honour extracted the following information from the report.
	
	
	The applicant had commenced abusing alcohol from the age of 16, had commenced using cannabis at age 17 and amphetamines at age 18. His past psychiatric history included a diagnosis of depression and post traumatic stress disorder arising from his rumination about his brother’s death. Dr Bench thought that his history was consistent with a substance-induced psychotic disorder involving paranoid ideation of being watched and followed when using methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Dr Bench considered that the applicant had previously met the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder arising from the death of his brother in 2004, and that he met the diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder which was in remission. Dr Bench thought that he also met the diagnostic criteria for poly-substance dependence and for an anti-social personality disorder.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s recidivism, Dr Bench thought that the most significant factor in decreasing his risk of re-offending would be participation in a substance abuse treatment program. Dr Bench considered that he would require prolonged in-patient rehabilitation in order to increase his chances of remaining abstinent from drugs and alcohol. A positive factor noted by Dr Bench was that the applicant’s parents were highly supportive of him and had offered him a place to live in Muswellbrook on his release from custody.
	
	
	When considering the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour took into account the maximum sentences prescribed. His Honour considered that the fact that the offences had occurred while the applicant was on conditional liberty was an aggravating factor. His Honour took into account the amount of methylamphetamine, which he regarded as substantial, even though it was well below the prescribed quantity defined by the Act as a commercial quantity, i.e. 250 grams.
	
	
	His Honour noted that there was no evidence that the applicant was involved in the manufacture of drugs and that he was not at or near the top of any hierarchy in the distribution of drugs. Accordingly, his Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offending fell just below the mid-range of seriousness for offences of this kind.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to the sentencing principles set out in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He considered that general deterrence was an important matter to be taken into account for drug trafficking offences of this kind. Specific deterrence was also important, given the applicant’s history of offending. His Honour regarded the presence of large sums of money, the scales and the re-sealable plastic bags as indicia of drug trafficking for profit.
	
	
	His Honour specifically took into account that the applicant had been in custody since his arrest, that his parole was revoked and that he had served the balance of his previous term of imprisonment up to 11 September 2013.
	
	
	His Honour found special circumstances as follows:
	


“I find that there are special circumstances established pursuant to s 44 (2) of the Sentencing Act given the need for a long period of rehabilitation and in particular residential rehabilitation which may not be available whilst the offender is in custody.

He has a long-standing drug addiction to overcome together with the unresolved grief issues that he has carried for many years. I have also had regard to the pre-sentence report of Ms Ambler and to the offender’s suitability for the IDATP program that is available at the John Moroney Correctional Centre.” (ROS 10.3)

THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – His Honour erred in not giving effect to his finding of special circumstances.


	
	The applicant submitted that the individual sentences imposed by his Honour reflected his Honour’s finding of special circumstances in that the ratio of the non-parole period to the parole period was between 60 and 66 percent. However, the combined effect of the sentences produced a ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence of 73.3 percent. The applicant submitted that this result was contrary to his Honour’s express intention and in the absence of any reasons, was indicative of error.
	


Consideration


	
	There is no general rule that just because an overall sentence does not reflect a finding of special circumstances, a sentencing judge must, having found special circumstances in respect of individual counts, make a further adjustment to the ratio in respect of the total accumulated sentence. Each case depends upon its own particular facts.
	
	
	In a case such as this, where the express purpose for the finding of special circumstances was to satisfy the need for a long period of rehabilitation including residential rehabilitation, it is not only the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence which is important, but the actual periods involved are equally, if not more important (R A Hulme J in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [41]). Here, the parole period of 1 year and 4 months is not particularly long in the context of the need for long term rehabilitation, including a residential component.
	
	
	This issue was comprehensively examined by Hamill J (with whom Johnson J and I agreed) in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25. That was a case where the finding of special circumstances was based on a need for extended rehabilitation and on the fact that there was an accumulation of sentences. Hamill J referred to the observation of R A Hulme J in CM v R [2013] NSWCCA 341 at [40] where his Honour said:
	


“40   Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflected in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation. …”


	
	By way of elaboration of that principle, Hamill J said:
	


“82   Where a sentencing Judge makes clear that they are aware that the total sentence is in accordance with the “statutory ratio”, it is rare that this Court would intervene. In Houri v R the court declined to intervene in a case where an adjustment in respect of one sentence resulted in a sentence wherein the non-parole period was marginally greater than 75% of the overall term. R A Hulme J said at [34]:

“I do not believe that there was any inadvertence or miscalculation by the Judge. She imposed individual sentences and partially accumulated them to achieve the precise result that she said she intended. In the first passage quoted above she said that in the overall total sentence ‘the statutory ratio will not reduce substantially’. In the second passage she noted that ‘the total non-parole period is very close to the statutory ratio when one has regard to the total sentence, and that is what I intend in passing sentence’.”

83   Similarly in AB v R the Court declined to intervene when the sole basis of the finding of special circumstances was “by reason of the accumulation of sentences”.

84   Conversely, in cases where the finding of special circumstances was more broadly based then the accumulation itself and where the sentencing Judge has not clearly indicated their awareness of the fact that the total effective sentence will remain in accordance with (or close to) the “statutory norm” the court has intervened: see R v LWP; R v Thornberry; R v Keen; R v Street; R v Heron v R; M v R.”


	
	On my reading of his Honour’s reasons in this case, there is no indication of his Honour’s awareness that the total effective sentence would remain close to the “statutory norm”. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that error has occurred in the sense that the combined effect of the total sentence has not given effect to his Honour’s intention when making his finding of special circumstances. This ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Ground 2 – His Honour failed to consider whether time spent in custody in relation to the offences for which the offender was sentenced included a period when the offender was also serving a balance of parole for a prior offence.


	
	The applicant noted that at the time of his arrest, he was on parole for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug and that his parole was revoked as a result of his arrest for the present offences, i.e. the commission of the present offences was the sole reason for the revocation of his parole.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that because the commission of the present offences resulted in the revocation of parole, his Honour should have given consideration to whether the sentence for the fresh offences should run concurrently, cumulatively or partially concurrently with the period spent in custody serving the balance of parole. In that regard, the applicant relied upon s47(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which, inter alia, required the sentencing judge to “take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence”.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that when passing sentence, his honour gave no consideration to the question of whether the time spent in custody from the date of arrest was “time for which the applicant was held in custody in relation to the offence” for which he was being sentenced. He submitted that no consideration was given to the question of whether the sentence imposed could be backdated such that it was served concurrently or partially concurrently with the previous sentence. He submitted that his Honour assumed that the sentence should commence at the conclusion of the sentence for which parole was revoked.
	


Consideration


	
	It is incorrect to characterise the time spent in custody, as a result of the revocation of parole, as “any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence” as referred to in s47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 47(3) is directed to incarceration directly relating to the offence in respect of which the offender is being sentenced. The period in custody, as a result of the revocation of parole, was directly referable to the previous offending not this offending.
	
	
	A sentencing judge when considering a sentence of imprisonment is to take into account any time for which the offender was in custody in relation to the offence, i.e. the offence for which the offender is being sentenced (s24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. If the sentencing judge orders that a sentence of imprisonment commence on a date before the date of sentence, the court is to take into account time held in custody for the offence (s47(2)).
	
	
	There is no doubt, as the applicant submitted, that his Honour had a discretion to backdate the commencement date of this sentence so that it would be concurrent with or partly concurrent with the balance of parole (R v Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134; Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145). This does not mean that his Honour was obliged to exercise his discretion in that way. When parole is revoked as a consequence of the commission of a subsequent offence, whether the sentence for the subsequent offence should be backdated in that way is a matter for the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The relevant principles were set out by Simpson J in Callaghan. There Simpson J (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed) said:
	


“21    That the matter is discretionary appears to be the prevailing view of members of this Court. Even in Andrews and Kelly, the court accepted that a judge might backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then to be sentenced.

22    I maintain the view that a discretion exists. There is no clear rule which will govern all cases. The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.

23    It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period. It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole.

24    However, I am also of the view that, particularly where, as here, the re-offending has occurred within a very short time of release on parole, and the balance of term to which the offender is exposed is quite short, it may be appropriate to proceed on the hypothesis that the whole of the period spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is, as Hunt CJ at CL said, referable to the earlier offences and not to the subsequent offences.”


	
	Here, the applicant had only been on parole for two months at the time of committing the new offences. Another important consideration which was identified in Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280 at [52] was the similarity between the offences for which parole was being served and the offence then under consideration. Moreover, no submissions were made to his Honour on the issue raised in this ground of appeal nor as to backdating the commencement date of the sentence to a date earlier than 12 September 2013. Finally, there was no oversight in his Honour determining the commencement date for this sentence. His Honour was well aware of the revocation of parole and referred to it on more than one occasion.
	
	
	On that latter issue, Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said in Maroun Younes v R [2012] NSWCCA 259:
	


“27   It is also, in my view, noteworthy that no submissions were made by the applicant at the sentence hearing of the consequences of not backdating the sentence to the time of the arrest in terms of the ratio referred to above. It is not appropriate to approach the sentence hearing upon the basis that, if the sentencing judge does not backdate the sentence for the index offence to the time of the arrest, the applicant can argue for the first time in this Court that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the numerical consequence of a calculation that he did not suggest ought to have been performed at the sentence hearing: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [10]-[13], per Johnson J, Allsop P and Kirby J agreeing.”


	
	The observation which I made in Barnes v R [2014] NSWCCA 224 is also applicable to this case:
	


“28   Callaghan v R is a useful decision because of its review of previous decisions of this Court and the statements of principle therein. What should not be lost sight of is that the effect of that review is that the decision of a sentencing judge as to whether or not to make a new sentence partially concurrent or wholly cumulative upon a revoked period of parole involves the exercise of a discretion by that judge. The exercise of discretion has to be carried out in a principled way but it remains the exercise of a discretion.

29   For the applicant to succeed on these grounds, he needed to show that it was not open to Price J to exercise the discretion in the way in which he did. Unless the applicant could point to a specific error (which he could not) it was necessary for him to establish that the discretion was wrongly exercised on House v King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 49 grounds. This he has not done.”


	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Re-sentence


	
	The applicant has been successful on his first ground of appeal. On my review of the facts, I have concluded in accordance with the guidance in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [42] – [43]; 313 ALR 451 that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. Such a sentence should give effect to the express intention of the sentencing judge. Accordingly, I propose to retain the sentences imposed by his Honour but to increase the level of concurrency. This will produce an effective sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by Mahony SC DCJ on 9 May 2014 are confirmed except for the sentence imposed in respect of the offence contrary to s7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in respect of the possess prohibited firearm offence contrary to s7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 is quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 12 December 2014 and expiring 11 December 2016 with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 11 December 2017.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

	THE COURT:
	


Offences and sentence

On 8 April 2013 the applicant was arraigned on an indictment which charged that on 10 July 2011 he murdered Jazmin-Jean Ajbschitz (the deceased). The applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. That plea was rejected and the trial proceeded before a judge and jury. The trial concluded on 29 April 2013 when the applicant was found guilty of the offence of murder.


	
	The offence of murder is contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which there is a prescribed maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period for this offence of 20 years.
	
	
	Sentence proceedings were heard on 6 June 2013. On that occasion the applicant was sentenced in relation to two further unrelated charges to which he had previously pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 8 December 2011. The charges were contained in a separate indictment in the following terms:
	


Count 1 – That on or about 17 April 2010 the applicant did recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm upon David Lindsay. This offence was contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act for which the prescribed maximum term was imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 4 years.

Count 2 – That on or about 17 April 2010 the applicant did assault Kimberley Lasaqa thereby occasioning actual harm to her. This offence was contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act for which the prescribed maximum penalty was imprisonment for 5 years.


	
	On 21 June 2013 and 6 December 2013 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment as follows:
	



	
	In respect of the charge of assaulting Kimberley Lasaqa thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment, to commence 1 October 2011 and expire 30 June 2012.
	
	
	In respect of the charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon David Lindsay, a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, to commence on 1 April 2012 and expire 30 September 2014, with a balance of term of 10 months to expire on 31 July 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the charge of murdering the deceased, a non-parole period of 24 years imprisonment, to commence 1 April 2013 and expire 31 March 2037, with a balance of term of 8 years to expire on 31 March 2045.
	



	
	The total term of imprisonment is one of 33 years and 6 months with a total non-parole period is one of 25 years and 6 months. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 1 April 2037.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour accorded insufficient weight to rehabilitation in the structure and casting of the overall sentence.

Ground 2 – His Honour erred in holding intoxication to be an aggravating feature in all of the circumstances.

Ground 3 – His Honour accorded insufficient weight to the principle of totality in the structure and casting of the overall sentence.

Ground 4 – The sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The trial was conducted by both parties on the basis that the sole issue for the jury’s determination was whether or not the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to kill the deceased or intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. It was the applicant’s case that as a consequence of smoking crystal methamphetamine (ice) and consuming alcohol during the day on which he murdered the deceased, he was not capable of forming any relevant intention.
	
	
	At the time of her death, the deceased was aged 18 and the applicant was aged 25. They had met at a music festival in 2009 and commenced a relationship shortly thereafter which continued until the time of the deceased's death. It was a volatile relationship, which was marked by episodes of violence by the applicant towards the deceased.
	
	
	On the evening of 9 July 2011 the deceased spent the night with the applicant and returned home the following morning. At that time she lived in an apartment in Ultimo belonging to her mother, who had left Sydney only a few days before after having secured work in Western Australia.
	
	
	The applicant consumed alcohol and smoked ice in the hours leading up to the deceased's murder. There was no evidence as to precisely how much ice was smoked, or precisely how much alcohol was consumed. During the course of the afternoon and early evening of 10 July the applicant and the deceased communicated via text messages. Those messages exhibited a degree of volatility which was typical of that which characterised their relationship.
	
	
	During the latter part of the afternoon of 10 July the applicant met with a friend ""D"". After spending a period drinking at a local hotel, the applicant drove with D from the Campbelltown area to the city. He smoked a further quantity of ice on the way.
	
	
	Earlier in the day, the deceased had met with two female friends. The three of them went to another friend's place and had some drinks, before returning to the deceased's apartment at approximately 7pm. Following their arrival, all three of them commenced smoking cannabis. It was during this period that the deceased received a number of telephone calls from the applicant. On some of the occasions on which she received these calls, the deceased placed her phone on loud speaker thereby enabling one or both of her friends to hear what was said.
	
	
	The evidence of those friends concerning the conversations between the applicant and the deceased was that the applicant communicated in a voice which was ""very angry”. He made threats to kill the deceased and anybody else that she was with. In another conversation the applicant told the deceased that he was coming to see her to which she responded that he could come to the city to see her but she was not going out to see him.
	
	
	The applicant and D were seen on CCTV footage arriving at the front door of the apartment complex where the deceased lived at about 8.59pm. The applicant unsuccessfully attempted to use the security intercom system, before leaving shortly thereafter.
	
	
	The applicant and D returned to the front of the apartment complex at 9.02pm, at which time the applicant again unsuccessfully attempted to use the security intercom system. At approximately 9.04pm, a resident of the apartment complex allowed the applicant and D to enter. This resident activated the security lift and allowed the applicant and D to alight at the fifth floor. The applicant and D commenced to knock on the doors of other apartments looking for the deceased. He was unsuccessful in that endeavour and CCTV footage showed him and D going out onto the street at 9.21pm.
	
	
	The applicant sent a text message to the deceased at 9.35pm and advised her that the battery on his telephone needed to be charged. Following that telephone contact, the applicant returned to the apartment building by himself at 9.59pm. The deceased exited the lift and came into the foyer at 10.02pm. She had a short conversation with the applicant through the glass security door and at 10.03pm opened the door and walked outside. At 10.05 pm, the applicant and the deceased both entered the building and then the lift. This was the last occasion on which the deceased was seen alive. The applicant was next seen coming out of the lift and exiting the apartment complex at 10.31pm.
	
	
	The deceased was murdered by the applicant between 10.05pm and 10.31pm on 10 July 2011. The photographs of the crime scene showed the premises in complete disarray. Numerous items of furniture were upended and indiscriminately strewn about the premises. A dining chair had one of its timber legs broken, and a lamp lay smashed on the floor. There was an indentation in the wall, the shape of which was consistent with the bottom of the leg of a chair having been smashed into it.
	
	
	Deposited along the hallway leading to the bathroom were various items of clothing which had been worn by the deceased, including a scarf and a pair of ""leggings"". A shoe belonging to the deceased which she was seen to be wearing in the CCTV footage lay nearby. There were blood stains on various parts of the floor of the hallway leading to the bathroom. There was blood smearing present on an adjoining wall. There was further blood staining on the floor of the bathroom.
	
	
	The deceased's body was found lying in the area of the kitchen. Whilst there was no evidence of sexual assault, the lower half of her clothing had been removed in its entirety, and the upper half pulled up so as to reveal her breasts. The force with which the latter occurred was indicated by a corresponding tear in her clothing.
	
	
	Dr Brouwer, a forensic pathologist, gave evidence that the cause of the deceased's death was blunt force trauma injuries to the liver and heart caused by repeated stomping, and resulting in the right side of the deceased's heart being torn. Dr Brouwer's opinion was that the infliction of these injuries would have required the application of ""an extreme amount of force"" and that death would have occurred within a few minutes. In 20 years of experience, having performed what she described as ""a few thousand"" autopsies, Dr Brouwer said that aside from instances of high velocity motor vehicle accidents, she had never witnessed blunt force trauma injuries of the kind sustained by the deceased. In addition to these injuries, there was widespread bruising over the whole of the deceased’s body, multiple rib fractures and extensive haemorrhaging to the tongue and the muscles on the left side of the neck. She had extensive facial and head injuries. The injuries to the deceased’s right arm were consistent with her having attempted to protect and defend herself in the course of being attacked.
	
	
	The offender left the building at 10.31 pm. In contrast to his appearance at the time at which he entered, he was seen on CCTV footage to have pulled his hood over his head, and was pulling the sleeves of his top over his hands. He admitted in the course of cross-examination that he did this for the purpose of ensuring (inter alia) that no finger prints or DNA would be left on the inside of the doorway. Having left the premises he met with D and then both of them returned to the apartment complex at 10.34pm and unsuccessfully attempted to enter.
	
	
	At 10.38 pm, D called emergency services from a public telephone and requested an ambulance but gave the wrong address and no ambulance ever arrived at the deceased's premises. Over the ensuing days, the applicant made several attempts to contact the deceased. He was arrested within a few days of the murder having occurred.
	


SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS


	
	The primary judge accepted that the applicant had been smoking ice and consuming alcohol in the period leading up to the deceased’s murder. Although his Honour did not know the quantity of ice and alcohol which had been consumed, he was satisfied that the applicant was affected by those substances which had increased his aggression. His Honour found that despite his intoxication, the applicant was not confused at the time he killed the deceased and that he remained capable of ordered thinking. His Honour accepted the opinion of Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, who said that on the material which had been provided to him, the effects of the applicant’s use of ice and consumption of alcohol did not extend to his being confused at the relevant time. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant intended to kill the deceased and had held that intention from at least the time when he telephoned the deceased to tell her that that was what he was coming to do. His Honour found premeditation to that extent.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the offence was committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty. At the time when he committed the offence, he was on parole and subject to a s 9 good behaviour bond. His Honour regarded that as a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	His Honour raised for consideration how the applicant’s intoxication should be treated for the purposes of sentence. When the applicant was cross-examined, he agreed that he was using substantial quantities of steroids and ice. On that issue, the following exchange took place:
	


“Q. So by the time of 2005, you understood that if you took drugs and drank alcohol, your response in a situation that was, not a good one for you, would be to be acting in a violent way?

A. Yeah, I'd say so.

Q. Then by April 2010, when you attacked the two people in the street, Miss Lasaqa and Mr Lindsay, were you taking drugs at that time?

A. Yes.

…

Q. You knew after that time, didn't you, that if you took drugs and alcohol like that, you could respond very violently; do you agree?

A. After that time, yeah.”


	
	In relation to intoxication generally, his Honour said:
	


“78   Intoxication, whether it is brought about by alcohol or drugs, may explain an offence but will ordinarily not mitigate the penalty, except where the intoxication is the result of an addiction, and the original addiction did not involve a free choice. An offender cannot expect a reduction in sentence merely because the offence was committed whilst intoxicated (see Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at [26] citing R v Rosenberger (1994) 76 A Crim R 1 per McClellan CJ at CL with whom Price and R A Hulme JJ agreed).”


	
	His Honour’s conclusion in relation to the applicant’s intoxication was:
	


“82   The evidence in the present case does not support the conclusion that the offender smoked ice for the specific purpose of becoming aggressive. However, on the offender's own evidence his use of drugs was not out of character. Moreover, the link between that use and the virtual inevitability of increased aggression and violence on his part was something which he clearly understood, and of which he had been aware for a long period of time prior to the deceased's murder. He conceded in cross-examination that despite his awareness of such matters, he continued to take drugs.

83   It follows that at the time of the deceased's murder, and indeed for some considerable time prior to that, the offender knew that he had a drug addiction, and knew of the results which would inevitably flow from it (see R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381 at 387).

…

90   For all of these reasons, the offender's intoxication should be regarded as an aggravating factor. It is one which carries with it significant moral culpability for the predictable consequences of the choice that he made to continue taking drugs in the knowledge of their likely effect upon him (see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [173] - [207]).”


	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending. In doing so, he had regard to the relationship which existed between the applicant and the deceased, i.e. that the applicant was a powerful man who had violent tendencies, whereas the deceased had no such tendencies. His Honour took into account the circumstances of the murder involving as it did multiple acts of stomping and the use of a number of different objects to inflict injury. His Honour noted that the level of violence could be gauged not only from the deceased’s injuries, but from the substantial damage to the premises. His Honour took into account the terror which must have overcome the deceased in the final moments of her life when she was seeking to defend herself from a vicious and unprovoked attack. His Honour took into account that the applicant had been given the benefit of conditional release only three months before. His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending at above the mid range.
	
	
	His Honour assessed the applicant’s subjective case. His Honour noted that he was part indigenous and aged 27 at the time of sentence. The applicant had an unfortunate upbringing in many respects in that his parents separated when he was approximately 3 years old. He had a particular memory of his father, who on one occasion attempted to drown him. Following that incident, his mother, with him and his brother, moved away from his father. Despite that incident, the applicant had strong family support.
	
	
	He left high school in year 9 at the age of 15, without obtaining his School Certificate. He worked in various labouring jobs until the time of his arrest. He was 14 when he started using cannabis, 16 when he started using amphetamines and 18 when he first experimented with ice. By the age of 24, approximately 12 months before the deceased's murder, he was using ice on a regular basis.
	
	
	At the age of 18, the applicant formed a relationship from which a son, who is now 5 years of age, was born. The applicant had maintained contact with his son until the time of his arrest. Since his arrest, he had had little or no contact with the child but expressed a wish to ""be a father"" when he was released from custody.
	
	
	His Honour noted that it was against that background that he was required to consider the applicant’s remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	His Honour took into account that in his sworn evidence on sentence, the applicant had expressed, in quite specific terms, his remorse for his actions. When cross-examined, the applicant had not attempted to retreat behind his use of drugs as an excuse for his conduct. The applicant accepted his responsibility for the death of the deceased. His Honour concluded that the applicant’s expression of remorse was fulsome and insightful. His Honour found that the applicant’s evidence “contained statements which reflected an acceptance of responsibility for the deceased’s murder, as well as an acknowledgment and understanding (albeit belated) of the circumstances which had brought about his conduct” (Sentence judgment at [108]).
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant’s expressions of remorse were genuine and he took that into account when considering his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	When considering rehabilitation, the primary judge had regard to the applicant’s criminal history. He considered its importance lay not in its length, but rather in the nature of the offences which were committed. Included in the offences committed by the applicant in 2005 were:
	


“(i)    assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty (2);

(ii)    resisting police;

(iii)    carrying a cutting weapon;

(iv)    having custody of an offensive implement in a public place;

(v)    common assault; and

(vi)   assault occasioning actual bodily harm.”


	
	His Honour reviewed the facts of those offences and noted that they each involved significant violence. When cross-examined about these offences, the applicant admitted that he was abusing alcohol and drugs at the time.
	
	
	His Honour had available reports from two psychiatrists, Dr Allnutt (for the Crown) and Dr Nielssen (for the applicant). Dr Allnutt concluded:
	


“In my view the main factors that mediate his aggression are his temperamental impulsivity and substance abuse and dependence disorder.

In my view the offender presents with a number of rehabilitative needs that need to be addressed in order to reduce risks that he may pose and unless these are address (sic) he falls into a group of individuals with a relatively high vulnerability (or risk) to recurrent impulsive aggressive behaviour.""


	
	Dr Nielssen concluded that a critical factor in the applicant’s rehabilitation was whether or not he ceased his abuse of drugs and alcohol. Dr Nielssen said that the completion of a violent offender's program, and appropriate substance abuse programs, together with ongoing psychiatric review, were important components of any rehabilitation process. He concluded that the prospects for the offender's rehabilitation were necessarily dependent, either wholly or partly, upon him undertaking treatment to address his anger issues and his drug abuse, adhering to such treatment, and adhering to any conditions of his release.
	
	
	His Honour noted that in his evidence, the applicant had expressed a desire to undergo rehabilitative courses in respect of drug use and anger management.
	
	
	In reaching his conclusion as to rehabilitation, his Honour set out his reasoning as follows:
	


“125   There can often be difficulties in determining an offender's prospects of rehabilitation. The present is an example of such a case. On the one hand, the offender's expressed desire to undertake rehabilitation is laudable. On the other hand, the harsh reality is that this is not the first occasion on which he has expressed that sentiment. It is evident from the remarks of the sentencing judge before whom the offender appeared in April 2011 that the offender made not dissimilar statements on that occasion.

126   The offender agreed in evidence before me that he had told the sentencing judge on that occasion that he was committed to dealing with his problems. This was obviously not the case. Moreover, although the offender generally accepted that the onus had been upon him to address his problems, he gave some impression of wanting to ascribe blame to the relevant authorities for what he saw as their failure to provide him with appropriate forms of rehabilitative treatment.

127   The first step towards rehabilitation is an acceptance by the person concerned that there are issues which must be addressed. The second is the commitment to address those issues. The third is adherence to that commitment. On the offender's evidence before me, he has taken the first of those steps. Whether he takes the second and the third remains to be seen. I cannot disregard the fact that he expressed some commitment to rehabilitation to the sentencing judge in April 2011, only to abandon it within a short period of time.

128   I do accept that the offender appears to have a supportive family which will assist him in his rehabilitative efforts. I also take into account that he does not have any mental illness, nor any other issue which might impinge upon his ability to undertake the rehabilitative courses which have been identified. The essence of the opinions of Drs Allnutt and Nielssen is that, subject to a number of matters, the offender is at least capable of being rehabilitated over time, such that upon the expiration of any non-parole period it is possible that he may not represent any ongoing danger to the community.

129   In my view, the offender has some prospects of rehabilitation. However, whether those prospects are ever realised is necessarily dependent upon a number of circumstances, particularly those identified by Drs. Allnutt and Nielssen.”


	
	It was necessary for his Honour to sentence the applicant for the 2010 offences, as well as for the murder of the deceased. The individual sentences imposed for those offences have not been challenged, but the principles of totality and proportionality have been raised in respect of the extent of the accumulation and concurrency of those sentences. Accordingly, it is necessary to briefly review the facts of those offences.
	
	
	At approximately 10.30pm on 17 April 2010 the two victims, David Lindsay and Kimberley Lasaqa, were at licensed premises in Darlinghurst with a friend. They had both been drinking since approximately 7pm that evening. A discussion took place between Mr Lindsay and Ms Lasaqa and some friends outside those licensed premises. Standing nearby were the applicant and the deceased.
	
	
	For reasons which are not clear, an argument occurred between Mr Lindsay and the deceased in which Ms Lasaqa became involved. As Mr Lindsay and Ms Lasaqa were walking away, the applicant used his closed fist to punch Mr Lindsay on the left side of the face. This occurred when Mr Lindsay was not looking in his direction, the incident having apparently ended as far as he was concerned.
	
	
	The applicant immediately punched Mr Lindsay again to the other side of his face, followed by swinging his leg so that it connected with Mr Lindsay’s upper body. Mr Lindsay then lost consciousness and fell to the ground.
	
	
	When this occurred, Ms Lasaqa said to the applicant ""Yeah, you're a big man."" The applicant began yelling at her, moved towards her and swung his right leg towards her so that his foot just brushed her face. She raised her fists in front of her in order to defend herself and the applicant continued to yell at her and swung his closed fists at her face, missing her. To defend herself Ms Lasaqa struck at the applicant twice with her fist, connecting with his mouth.
	
	
	As soon as she hit the applicant, Ms Lasaqa moved backwards as he moved quickly towards her, swinging his arms with closed fists. Ms Lasaqa felt two blows to the side of her face which she described as being ""really hard"". The applicant then pulled her to the ground. While lying on the ground Ms Lasaqa felt two or three kicks to her stomach and the inside of her right leg. After being kicked in the stomach, she could recall very little else.
	
	
	The attack on Ms Lasaqa was witnessed by two security guards. One of them described hearing Ms Lasaqa’s head “crack” as the applicant delivered the first punch. The security guards described the applicant as delivering a ""karate"" style kick which struck Ms Lasaqa causing her to fall to the ground. Thereafter they observed the applicant kicking Ms Lasaqa’s head ""football style"" and stomping his foot down on her face while she was lying unconscious on the ground. They observed the applicant pick Ms Lasaqa up by the back of her head and force her head against the side of a parked car. They heard a loud thump and Ms Lasaqa slumped to the ground. The applicant only desisted in his attack upon her when the two security guards intervened. The applicant ran off before the two security guards could detain him.
	
	
	Police and ambulance assistance was called. Ms Lasaqa was bleeding from her mouth and her eyes were black and swollen. It was more than five minutes before she regained consciousness and was taken by ambulance from the scene. Mr Lindsay, who had also lost consciousness, regained it after a short time as he was lying on the ground. While Mr Lindsay and Ms Lasaqa each suffered extensive bruising to the face, and Ms Lasaqa suffered concussion, neither was left with long term injuries.
	
	
	His Honour characterised the applicant’s conduct in relation to those incidents as displaying a high degree of moral culpability. His Honour noted that they were committed when the applicant was intoxicated, in circumstances where he knew that the predictable result of his intoxication would involve aggressive conduct towards others. His Honour regarded the offending to be of a high order. The only mitigating feature was that the applicant pleaded guilty at an early point in time.
	
	
	In relation to totality and special circumstances, his Honour said:
	


““170   Mr Stratton submitted that I should find special circumstances on the basis that the offender was a young man with a limited criminal history. He submitted that in circumstances where the offender may face the temptation of drug abuse, it was in his interests, as well as those of the community in general, that the statutory relationship be varied so as to allow a longer period on parole.

171   In my view, the matters upon which Mr Stratton relied do not constitute special circumstances. In any event, the balance of the term that I have imposed is necessarily lengthy.”

172   In structuring the sentences I have had regard to the principle of totality (see Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610). The end result is that the balance of the term of imprisonment, as a proportion of the mandatory period, constitutes a slightly diminished proportion of the aggregate sentence. Where sentencing in respect of multiple offences has the effect of reducing, to below 75 per cent, the ratio that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence, it is sometimes the case that special circumstances are found in order to restore the statutory ratio to the overall result (see KW v R (No. 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84 at [3] per Simpson J, Harrison and Adamson JJ agreeing). However, for the reasons I have already expressed, I do not consider that a finding of special circumstances is warranted in the present case.

173   It has been observed that the ratio which is imposed by s. 44 of the Sentencing Act is calculated by reference to an individual sentence, not to an accumulated term of imprisonment comprising several sentences (see Hillier v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCCA 312 per Basten JA at [58] - [59]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v RHB [2008] NSWCCA 236). There is accordingly no general requirement that the proportion between the effective non-parole period and the aggregate sentence should not exceed 75 per cent (see Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 at [29] per Hidden J, Whealy JA and Johnson J agreeing) although where it does so, a sentencing judge should explain why such a course has been taken (see Connelly v R [2012] NSWCCA 144 at [32] per Rothman J, McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing; Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212 at [32] per Davies J at [32], Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing).

174   For the reasons I have already given, I am not prepared to find special circumstances in the case of the offender. The aggregate sentence at which I have arrived takes into account all of the matters to which I have referred. Moreover, the proportion between the effective non-parole period and the aggregate sentence only marginally exceeds 75 per cent.”


	
	His Honour noted that although the 2010 offences had occurred at the one time, they involved separate acts of criminality with separate victims and that there should be some partial accumulation of the sentences imposed. Senior counsel for the applicant at trial accepted that there should be some accumulation between the murder sentence and that for the 2010 offences.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – His Honour accorded insufficient weight to rehabilitation in the structure and casting of the overall sentence.


	
	The applicant submitted that rehabilitation was one of the cornerstones of the sentencing discretion (R v Cimone [2001] NSWCCA 98; 121 A Crim R 433 per Beazley JA at [19]). He submitted that having regard to the total non-parole period of 25 years and 6 months, it was clear that his Honour had given insufficient weight to the applicant having the “prospects of rehabilitation” which he had found. The applicant submitted that the aggregate non-parole period did not adequately reflect his Honour’s findings of fulsome, insightful and genuine remorse.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour had not adequately taken into account the mitigating factor of his drug use. His early use of and addiction to drugs was part of a difficult upbringing and more weight should have been given to it. The applicant submitted that insufficient weight was given to the low prospect of him re-offending, keeping in mind that he would be over 50 years of age when he was released. The applicant submitted that the effect of the non-parole period was to impose a “crushing sentence” which was antithetical to any prospect of appropriate rehabilitation taking place.
	
	
	Although this was not raised as a separate ground of appeal (as it should have been), the applicant submitted that his Honour’s discretion miscarried when he refused to make a finding of special circumstances. The applicant submitted that his youth, limited criminal history, his prospects of rehabilitation, his disadvantaged background, dislocated upbringing and accumulation of sentences, constituted special circumstances and his Honour should have made a finding to that effect. The applicant submitted that having made such a finding, his Honour should have then adjusted the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period so as to produce a figure significantly less than 75 percent.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was a substantial body of evidence to indicate that his prospects of rehabilitation were good to which his Honour did not give adequate weight - he had a supportive family to assist him in his rehabilitative efforts, his remarks and gestures of remorse were genuine, he had an understanding that drugs were a major contributor to his criminal behaviours and he had no intellectual barriers which would prevent him from dealing with recidivist risks.
	


Consideration


	
	A ground of appeal framed in terms of “insufficient weight” being given to a particular factor suffers a very significant preliminary difficulty. It accepts that consideration was given to the factor by the sentencing judge but then has to persuade a Court of Criminal Appeal that the sentencing discretion miscarried. Such a challenge can only be successfully mounted if error of the kind identified in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 is identified.
	
	
	In this case his Honour considered all of the positive considerations which favoured good prospects of rehabilitation, together with those which did not. There is no factor identified by the applicant which his Honour did not take into account. Having identified all of those matters, his Honour concluded, as he was entitled to do, that the applicant “had some prospects of rehabilitation”. A powerful consideration which influenced his Honour was that the applicant had three months before the murder told a court of his intention to become drug free and rehabilitate himself only to abandon that pursuit within a very short time. No error has been identified in his Honour’s approach or reasoning. The submission goes no further than to assert that his Honour should have arrived at a different result.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions take into account the positive remarks and findings of the primary judge in isolation, but fail to have regard to his Honour’s remarks as a whole. Genuine expressions of remorse and insight of themselves do not necessarily translate into good prospects of rehabilitation. They have to be balanced against other factors which bear upon this issue which as his Honour indicated, pointed towards a less positive outcome.
	
	
	The negative matters to which his Honour had regard were substantial and important. He took into account the applicant’s criminal history, containing as it did instances of violent behaviour committed under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He was on parole when the murder was committed. Despite being dealt with leniently and mercifully by the judge to whom he had indicated a firm intention to engage in drug rehabilitation, he abandoned that intention within a short time after being sentenced. His Honour was entitled to take into account the substantial violence associated with the 2010 offences.
	
	
	In those circumstances, his Honour was entitled to balance those negative considerations against his positive findings as he did at [125] – [129] of his sentence judgment. The challenge to his Honour’s findings as to rehabilitation has not been made out.
	
	
	His Honour refused to find special circumstances. His Honour was entitled to do so. To the extent that his Honour’s refusal to find special circumstances is relevant to this ground of appeal, his Honour pointed out that the balance of term was sufficiently long to accommodate any need for rehabilitation after the applicant was released on parole.
	
	
	As his Honour explained, the matters relied upon as constituting “special circumstances” were matters which could in certain cases constitute special circumstances but do not compel a finding to that effect. On the facts of this case, the decision whether or not to make such a finding involved an exercise of discretion by his Honour which has not been demonstrated to have miscarried.
	
	
	Similarly, on the facts of this case any reliance upon accumulation as constituting a basis for a finding of special circumstances is misconceived. The fixed term sentence imposed for assault occasioning actual bodily harm (the AOABH offence) expired long before the date on which the applicant was sentenced for all three offences. The sentence for recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm (the GBH offence) was to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the AOABH offence and the non-parole period has expired. The sentence imposed for murder was only 1 year cumulative upon the GBH offence, the remaining 18 months being served concurrently. The non-parole period for the GBH offence expired 6 months into the murder sentence and the entire sentence for the GBH offence will expire on 31 July 2015. The degree of accumulation when considered in light of the very lengthy sentence required to be served for the offence of murder had a negligible impact on the overall sentence and did not justify a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the ratio between the non parole period and the balance of term referred to in s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act only applies to individual sentences. His Honour also noted that where two or more sentences were imposed there was no requirement that the same ratio exist between the total non parole period and the total balance of term but it was “sometimes the case” that sentencing judges “restore[d] the statutory ratio”. His Honour did not adopt that approach because His Honour considered that the aggregate sentence imposed took into account the matters that might otherwise warrant a variation and the proportion of the effective non parole period and the aggregate sentence “only marginally exceed[ed] 75 percent” in this case. There was no challenge to this aspect of His Honour’s judgement.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – His Honour erred in holding intoxication to be an aggravating feature in all of the circumstances.


	
	The applicant accepted that he was a violent man and a drug addict. He accepted that the evidence at trial and in the sentence proceedings demonstrated that his intoxication was frequent. He submitted, however, that the instances of violence and aggression perpetrated by him were infrequent by comparison. He submitted that as a matter of logic, it followed that just because he became intoxicated by the ingestion of alcohol and ice, did not mean that he would necessarily act aggressively.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that contrary to his Honour’s finding, there was no nexus between his drug ingestion and the commission of the offence of murder. He submitted that there was no connection between the ingestion of drugs and the formation of the intent to kill. He submitted that the intention to kill was the result of a sudden onset of rage in which no premeditation was involved. He submitted that it was clear from the sequence of events that the murderous rage was rapidly followed by a degree of remorse as to what he had done.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the passages of cross-examination set out in his Honour’s sentence judgment went no further than to establish that he could respond violently while intoxicated by alcohol and ice, but would not necessarily do so. The applicant accepted that when he was using alcohol and ice he was a very dangerous and violent person but that situation would only arise in circumstances where he was provoked. He submitted that the evidence before the sentencing judge fell short of an admission by him that drugs were taken with a view to disinhibiting boundaries otherwise available to be called upon in resisting violent impulses.
	


Consideration


	
	The conclusion by his Honour that the applicant’s intoxication was an aggravating feature was well open. His Honour’s finding of aggravation was based on expert evidence that established that one of the effects of the use of ice was increased aggression. The applicant’s evidence was that he knew that fact, yet nonetheless continued to ingest ice and alcohol. The effect of his Honour’s finding was that the applicant continued to ingest ice and alcohol despite his knowledge that this brought about increased aggression on his part. That the applicant was aware of this connection was clear from the assurances which he made to a District Court judge three months before the murder that he had developed an insight into the effects of drugs and that he was committed to addressing his drug abuse problem. It is also clear from the evidence which he gave in the sentence proceedings when the following exchange occurred:
	


“Q. And it is true to say that you could predict that you would respond very aggressively and violently if you were abusing those types of substances, would you agree?

A. Yes.""


	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – His Honour accorded insufficient weight to the principle of totality in the structure and casting of the overall sentence.


	
	In support of this ground, the applicant relied upon the following statements of principle: Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 62-63 where the Court (Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron JJ) said:
	


“8   The totality principle is a recognized principle of sentencing formulated to assist a court when sentencing an offender for a number of offences. It is described succinctly in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd ed. (1979), pp 56-57 as follows (omitting references):

""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms:

'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong('); 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences'.""


	
	In Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 307 – 308 McHugh J said:
	


“The totality principle of sentencing requires a judge who is sentencing an offender for a number of offences to ensure that the aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved. In Kelly v The Queen O'Loughlin J, sitting in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, applied the following unreported remarks of King CJ in R v Rossi:

""There is a principle of sentencing known as the principle of totality, which enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes becomes so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect.""”


	
	By reference to those statements, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the principle of totality in that having partly accumulated the sentences a reduction in the non-parole period was warranted in all the circumstances. The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed by his Honour “look wrong” in that they are crushing so as to extinguish any rehabilitative aspect of the sentencing discretion. This was because the nature of the criminality was not so grave as to allow that principle of sentencing to be ignored.
	


Consideration


	
	As already pointed out, the extent of the accumulation was modest in the extreme and did no more than add a year and a half to the sentence for murder. This was despite the fact that the criminality in the AOABH and GBH offences was substantial. Such accumulation as occurred was of minimal significance in the circumstances of this case and did not reflect an error in the application of the totality principle.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.


	
	By reference to what was described as four “comparable recent cases”, the applicant sought to establish that the sentence imposed by his Honour was outside the proper range for offences of this kind. The cases relied upon were: R v Kennedy [2013] NSWSC 1940 (Bellew J); R v Ray [2013] NSWSC 767 (R A Hulme J); R v Richardson [2012] NSWSC 521 (McCallum J); R v Gittany [2014] NSWSC 49 (McCallum J).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that taking into account the objective features of the case, the applicant’s subjective circumstances, the total sentence imposed and the range that exists for not dissimilar cases, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	


Consideration


	
	As the High Court has pointed out, to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and the judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle (R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]).
	
	
	In Markarian the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said:
	


“25   As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ""manifest excess"", or in a prosecution appeal, as ""manifest inadequacy"".

…

27   Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. …”


	
	The reliance on four specific sentencing judgments in other matters, as a means of establishing some kind of benchmark against which the reasonableness of this sentence is to be measured, is not particularly helpful. Murder, like manslaughter, has been aptly described as a protean offence. Each case, to a large extent, depends upon its own facts. Axiomatically, differences in facts and circumstances will often lead to differences in the resulting sentence. While there are some similarities in the four cases to which the Court was referred, the differences are significant and substantial. For example, in none of the cases to which the Court was referred was the violence perpetrated against the victim as extreme as in this case. Having regard to the exceptionally violent nature of the murder, the terror and suffering experienced by the deceased, the absence of a compelling subjective case and the applicant’s limited prospects for rehabilitation, it cannot be said that the sentence is reflective of error of the kind asserted.
	
	
	No error of the kind identified in Markarian has been shown in this case. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Orders


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Offences and sentence

On 17 October 2014 the applicant pleaded guilty to six offences contrary to s233A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) namely facilitating the bringing or coming to Australia of a non-citizen person reckless as to whether that person had a lawful right to come to Australia or not.


	
	In addition to those offences, the applicant indicated his guilt for a further four offences under s233A, which he requested be taken into account on sentence, pursuant to s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each offence under s233A is imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court on 28 February 2014 as follows:
	



	
	Counts 1 and 2 – (taking into account the matters on the s16BA schedule) – imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months commencing 20 October 2012 and expiring 19 February 2018 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months expiring 19 April 2016.
	
	
	Counts 3 and 4 – imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months commencing 20 October 2012 and expiring 19 February 2018, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months expiring 19 April 2016.
	
	
	Counts 5 and 6 – a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 10 months commencing 20 April 2015 and expiring 19 April 2016.
	



	
	The sentences were entirely concurrent so that the total effective sentence was a period of imprisonment of 5 years and 4 months, commencing 20 October 2012 and expiring 19 February 2018, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months expiring 19 April 2016.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:
	


(i)   Error in finding without evidence that the common sense inference is that a person facilitating illegal travel is involved for profit.

(ii)   Error in finding that the offences were aggravated because they were committed for the purpose of financial gain; and

(iii)   By reason of a combination of the above grounds, a greater sentence than required by law was imposed on the applicant.

Factual background


	
	A Statement of Agreed Facts was placed before the Court. The applicant also gave evidence and was cross-examined. Despite the applicant having agreed to the Statement of Facts in his oral evidence, he sought to traverse parts of the agreed facts. The nature of this controversy will be elaborated in due course.
	


Counts 1 and 2


	
	The applicant facilitated the illegal entry of Mahdi Aldafai and Hazim Aldaffaay by Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel (SIEV) with the assistance of four other people – a Thai based person named Alfatlawi, an Indonesian based person Abu Anwar, a Malaysian based person named Abu Mustafa and a Sydney based person Ali Zedan. He did this in the following ways:
	



	
	made arrangements and negotiated prices for visas for both illegal entrants in Indonesia; and
	
	
	made arrangements with intermediary smugglers for transfers and accommodation for both of them.
	



	
	Before leaving Iraq, Hazim Aldaffaay contacted his relative, Ali Zedan, who lived in Sydney. He told Zedan that he would be travelling to Indonesia with his nephew and wanted someone to organise a hotel in Malaysia on his way to Indonesia. Zedan told him that he knew someone who travelled between Indonesia and Malaysia regularly who might help. He said his name was “Fadhill” and he would be in Malaysia.
	
	
	On 15 December 2011 the applicant rang an Indonesian telephone service and spoke with a male he addressed as Abu Anwar. He told Anwar that he had two “customers” and gave Anwar their names, passport numbers and dates of birth so that Anwar could organise visas for them. Anwar said it would cost $3,300 as there were many expenses – someone to look after them by picking them up, placing them in accommodation and taking them to restaurants. Anwar said that the same person would stamp their visas in their passport, book their flights and move them.
	
	
	The same day the applicant telephoned Zedan to obtain their full names in English, dates of birth and passport numbers to obtain visas for them. He told Zedan the two individuals would fly to Jakarta, two to three days after arriving in Malaysia on 18 December 2011. Later that same day, Zedan sent the applicant a text message with this information. The applicant immediately forwarded the text messages to Anwar.
	
	
	On 15, 16 and 17 December the applicant called Zedan to update him on the progress of the two individuals. Also on 17 December the applicant rang a Thai telephone number and spoke to Alfatlawi. Alfatlawi requested that the applicant bring photographs and a copy of the two individuals’ passports with him when he came to Malaysia.
	
	
	On 18 December the applicant called a Malaysian telephone number and spoke to Abu Mustafa. The applicant told him that two passengers from Iraq were arriving in Kuala Lumpur at 6pm the next day and that he wanted someone to go to the airport to meet them. He told Abu Mustafa that they would be flying Egyptian Air, that he would be sending him their flight details and that he wanted a room booked at the “Times Square Hotel” for them.
	
	
	Five minutes later, the applicant called Zedan and got the Egyptian Air flight number and arrival time from Bangkok. Immediately after that, he text messaged Abu Mustafa on his Malaysian number with the flight number and time of arrival. About an hour before the flight was due to arrive, the applicant called Abu Mustafa asking about the group. Mustafa said it was too early yet but he had organised an Iraqi chauffeur who had their particulars and would be there to meet them.
	
	
	Aldafai and Aldaffaay successfully arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 6.05pm. At 10.20 the applicant rang Abu Mustafa to ensure the group had arrived safely. When Abu Mustafa rang the applicant about thirty minutes later, the applicant passed this message onto him. At 11.15 the applicant received a call from Abu Mustafa who said the group were with him “now”. The applicant requested that Mustafa buy them a SIM card, get them to exchange $100 and then asked to speak with them. The applicant told them that they were to go with Mustafa and exchange $100 to $200 to cover their food and to purchase a SIM card so they could be in contact with him and also Zedan.
	
	
	On 19 December 2011 Zedan rang the applicant and told him that he had their “number” and would text message it to him. After the call, Zedan sent Aldaffaay’s mobile number to the applicant by text message.
	
	
	On 21 December 2011 the applicant departed Australia. While overseas, he visited Indonesia and Malaysia. On 21 March 2012 he returned to Australia. While in Malaysia the applicant met Aldafai and Aldaffaay in a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. He told them that the quickest way to Australia was by boat and that he could arrange the travel if they paid him. The agreed facts stated:
	


“26   Both eventually agreed to pay the offender $US10,000 each for the journey, $US5,000 which was paid at the restaurant in Malaysia and the remaining $US5,000 paid upon arrival in Indonesia. Both also gave the offender their passports which he handed back to them with an Indonesian visa just before they flew to Indonesia.”


	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings that he did not retain any of this money. He said that the way the paragraph read was misleading. He said that the meeting occurred in a shopping centre and not a restaurant but more importantly, that Amin was also present at the time and it was Amin who took the money. He denied in cross-examination that the reason he went to Malaysia at this time was to help Aldaffaay and Aldafai come to Australia. He claimed that he happened to be in Malaysia to find the smuggler who put his parents on an unsafe boat. By way of further background, his parents at an earlier point in time had unsuccessfully attempted to illegally enter Australia by boat.
	
	
	On the morning of 30 December Aldafai and Aldaffaay flew to Jakarta. That evening the applicant called Buka and told him that his “group flew this morning and arrived today. They are two customers and I have been busy with them all week in Malaysia”.
	
	
	Paragraph 29 of the agreed facts read:
	


“29   In Indonesia the offender arranged for a taxi for them and they were met by the offender’s wife, Julita, at a hotel and later met the offender at a restaurant where they paid him the remaining $US5,000 each. The offender then gave the money back to them and told them to give the money to a person called “Karimi”. Later that day Aldafai and Aldaffaay met Karimi and gave him $US5,000 each.”


	
	After the applicant’s arrest, Aldafai and Aldaffaay had no further contact with him. They made their own arrangements with people smugglers to come to Australia. They ultimately entered Australian waters on separate boats. On 4 July 2012 an RAN ship intercepted SIEV 367 within Australian territorial waters, about 170 nautical miles from Christmas Island. It was carrying 160 passengers of which Aldaffaay was one. On 8 August 2012 SIEV 402 was intercepted about 128 nautical miles from Christmas Island. It was carrying 211 passengers of which Aldafai was one. Neither Aldaffaay nor Aldafai had a valid visa authorising their entry into Australia.
	


Counts 3 and 4


	
	The applicant facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of Abdul Al Jadiri and Hiba Almayhi by SIEV with the assistance of his Indonesian based girlfriend, Lika Julita. He did this in the following ways:
	



	
	liaising with his girlfriend, Julita, to find and arrange accommodation for Al Jadiri and Almayhi in Indonesia.
	
	
	assisting these people to get in contact with intermediary smugglers.
	
	
	assisting in transferring money to Indonesia for them to pay for their fare to the smuggler who would take them to Australia by SIEV; and
	
	
	assisting in transferring money to them for their general living expenses whilst in Indonesia.
	



	
	In September or October 2011 Abdul Al Jadiri and Hiba Almayhi, who were husband and wife, left Iraq. They flew to Kuala Lumpur. Buka was the applicant’s co-accused and lived in Melbourne. Buka was the applicant’s best friend. Buka was Hiba Almayhi’s uncle. Buka had booked a room for Abdul and Hiba at the “Times Square Hotel” in Kuala Lumpur. The applicant travelled to Indonesia and assisted them with money for living expenses and with organising a smuggler.
	
	
	Between 3 November 2011 and 27 March 2012 the applicant spoke to Buka, Julita, Abdul Al Jadiri and Hiba Almayhi about Abdul and Hiba’s situation in Indonesia. Arrangements were then made for money to be given to them for living costs and to find a smuggler to move them to Australia. Money was sent from Buka to Julita to give to them to pay for their illegal travel by SIEV. Hiba told the applicant in a telephone call that she would need “7” from Buka. The applicant then telephoned Julita to arrange the transfer details. For example, on 13 November 2011 $5,000 was transferred by Behrouz Harvasi on behalf of Buka by money transfer at a post office in Melbourne to Julita. This was for Abdul and Hiba’s fare to Australia by SIEV.
	
	
	On 29 November 2011 in a number of telephone conversations between Buka and Hiba, Hiba told Buka that they had run out of money for living expenses and urgently needed $200. Buka contacted the applicant to arrange this through Julita. On 30 November 2011 the applicant arranged for Julita to meet up with Abdul and Hiba and to give them $200.
	
	
	On 5 December 2011 the applicant looked up on the internet the ocean weather and current marine data in the Australian region. About six hours later, Buka received a call from Abdul informing him that they had been on the ship for about an hour. A couple of hours later, the applicant rang Buka and told him that he had heard from Abdul and Hiba and that they had moved half an hour before the call. This coincided with the time that SIEV 287 was intercepted about 13 nautical miles from Christmas Island. The boat was carrying 167 passengers, including Abdul and Hiba. No person on the boat had a valid visa authorising their entry into Australia. A couple of hours later, the applicant rang Buka and congratulated him because the group had arrived, explaining that he had found out about the boat’s arrival on the internet.
	


Counts 5 and 6


	
	The applicant facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of Duaa Keyadi and her four year old son Ahmed by SIEV in the following ways:
	



	
	arranging accommodation;
	
	
	purchasing internal airline tickets, arranging visas; and
	
	
	assisting them to get in contact with other intermediary smugglers.
	


Duaa Keyadi was a relative of the applicant.


	
	Between 15 December 2011 and 27 March 2012 there were about 40 telephone conversations between the applicant, an Indonesian Malaysian-based smuggler named “Karimi”, an assistant “Matin” and Duaa Keyadi’s husband, Hassanain. While in Indonesia and Malaysia between 21 December and 21 March 2012 the applicant assisted Duaa and her son with their travel from Iraq to Indonesia.
	
	
	On 6 February 2012 Duua and her son left Iraq for Kuala Lumpur with the intention of coming to Australia with the assistance of the applicant. On 9 February the applicant received an email with Duaa and her son’s dates of birth and passport numbers. On 21 March the applicant received a call from the family in Iraq in which he told them he had moved Duaa and her son from Iraq and Malaysia. On 23 March the applicant spoke with Matin, who requested that he organise someone in Malaysia to provide Karimi, the principal smuggler, $1,000. The applicant called Akbar in Iraq for the money to be transferred.
	
	
	On 9 June 2012 SIEV 510 was boarded by an Australian Customs Vessel about 11 nautical miles from Christmas Island. The boat was carrying 120 passengers. No person on the boat had a valid visa authorising their entry into Australia. Duaa was not aboard the boat and there is no evidence that she ever reached Australia. However, on board was Duaa’s husband, Hussanain, as well as his four year old son, Ahmed, and another son aged 3 years.
	
	
	On 27 March 2012 the police arrested the applicant. It is not known how, following his arrest, Hussanain and his two children arranged to come to Australia by boat.
	


Item 1 on the Schedule – Facilitating the bringing or coming to Australia of Mohammad Karim


	
	The applicant did this for Mohammad Karim with the assistance of Akbar and Julita in the following ways:
	



	
	finding and arranging accommodation for him in Indonesia;
	
	
	assisting him to get into contact with intermediary smugglers, including “Haji Hussain”;
	
	
	assisting in the transfer of money to Indonesia for him to pay his fare to the smuggler who would take him to Australia by SIEV; and
	
	
	assisting in transferring money to Indonesia for him for general living expenses while he was in Indonesia.
	



	
	Between 3 November 2011 and 27 March 2012 in about 50 telephone calls the applicant spoke to Buka, Karim, Akbar, Julita and an Indonesia and Malaysian based smuggler known as “Haji Hussain” to facilitate Mr Karim’s illegal arrival.
	
	
	On 12 December 2011 Buka and Julita arranged accommodation for Karim in Indonesia. That afternoon Karim flew from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Buka discussed with Karim the cost of his illegal travel and arrangements were made to have money sent from Iran. However, as there were no money transfer arrangements between Iran and Indonesia, it had to be transferred via Australia. Arrangements were made for the applicant to do this. The applicant was due to arrive in Australia within days.
	
	
	On 19 December, Buka telephoned the applicant and told him that Karim needed the money and that his family would transfer the funds to Australia. That same day arrangements were made for $2,400 to be sent to Buka who would then transfer it to the applicant, who was leaving for Indonesia and could give it to Karim. On 20 December Buka called the applicant and instructed him to go to Safdari, an Afghani in Merrylands (Sydney), and collect $2,400 from him. On 21 December the applicant left Australia for Jakarta.
	
	
	On 7 January 2012 the applicant rang Buka and told him that the smuggler “Haji” said that they should not bring any baggage or identification with them and to ask Karim if he was ready. He told Buka that if Karim wanted his luggage, he needed to send it to him in Australia. On 11 January the applicant rang Buka. They discussed the fact that money had been collected but Karim had not left.
	
	
	On 12 January Buka rang the applicant. They discussed the fact that Karim needed a visa from the UN to prevent him being arrested. The applicant agreed to provide money to Karim for living expenses. Buka told the applicant to tell “Haji” to move Karim as he had already been paid. Karim was apparently scared to proceed further and Buka asked the offender to call Karim but “if he insists … then leave him”.
	
	
	On 13 January Buka told the applicant that Karim was settled and the sea was currently rough but he had been checking it. On 14 January the applicant told Buka that he had given Akbar 1 million and Buka said he would transfer $200 to Julita on Monday. On 19 January SIEV 299 was boarded by the RAN about 19 nautical miles from Christmas Island. The boat was carrying 57 passengers. No person on board had a valid visa authorising them to enter Australia. Karim was on board.
	
	
	On 20 January Buka called the applicant in Indonesia and told him that Karim had arrived. While nothing had been published on the internet, he had received a call from the Detention Centre to confirm their arrival. Buka was to add the $300 with the “others” and they would account to each other later.
	


Item 2 on the Schedule – Facilitating the bringing or coming to Australia of Bahare Shadfar


	
	The applicant did this for Bahare Shadfar in the following ways:
	



	
	assisted in transferring money for living expenses for Ms Shadfar while she was in Indonesia before her passage to Australia; and
	
	
	advised her on various smugglers and provided assurance that he would help her when she arrived in Indonesia.
	



	
	Between 3 November 2011 an 27 March 2012 the applicant spoke to Julita and an unidentified male in Malaysia named “Amin” to facilitate Ms Shadfar’s illegal entry into Australia by SIEV. On 17 December 2011 before he left Australia for Indonesia, the applicant received a call from “Amin”. Amin asked the applicant if he had someone in Indonesia to whom he could send $1,000 through a financial institution and deliver it to another person because this person did not have a visa and was afraid to collect the money. The applicant said he would organise this with Julita.
	
	
	A few minutes after this call, the applicant called Julita in Indonesia and asked her how much money she had. Julita told him after which he asked her to give Amin a call and to organise that the money be given to a friend, who had no visa. A few minutes later in a text message and call, the applicant told Amin to send him his friend’s number so he could pass it on to Julita and that Julita had about $400 to $500. Amin sent the applicant this information.
	
	
	The applicant then called Ms Shadfar. He told her that he was Amin’s friend from Sydney and asked her for her location and a time for her to meet an Indonesian lady to give her money. He also said that he was in Sydney but coming to Indonesia on Wednesday the 21st and that they would meet. The applicant called Julita and Ms Shadfar, organising them to meet each other and for Ms Shadfar to be given $500. The applicant called Amin and told him what he had arranged.
	
	
	In a conversation with Ms Shadfar, the applicant told her that a lady would be there to meet her in five minutes to give her some money. Ms Shadfar told him that she had been there from 21 October and that she had made an unsuccessful attempt to come by sea, and had just been released from the immigration building. When asked whether he knew Haji, he said he knew all of them “Hussain, Whalid, Mustafa, Amir, Mehdi, Sayed Mehdi, Abu Walid”. He went on to say that his job was to give her advice and that the weather was presently bad. He said “Don’t trust anyone” and later “Please don’t take any risk” and that the weather could not be trusted. There were no records of Ms Shadfar having a valid visa to enter Australia.
	


Items 3 and 4 on the Schedule – Facilitating the bringing or coming to Australia of Layth Al-Khazaali and Asam Al-Kinani


	
	The applicant and an Indonesian based Farsi associate known as “Matin” facilitated the proposed bringing or coming to Australia of these two men between 16 November 2011 and 27 March 2012. The applicant regularly spoke to Matin and these two men and an Indonesian and Malaysian based smuggler known “Karimi” throughout this period.
	
	
	The applicant facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of Layth Al-Khazaali and Asam Al-Kinani by:
	



	
	arranging for money to be collected from them for their journey;
	
	
	arranging accommodation for them in Indonesia;
	
	
	purchasing internal airline tickets and arranging visas for them; and
	
	
	assisting them to get into contact with other intermediary smugglers.
	



	
	On 16 November 2011 Al-Kinani telephoned the applicant. The applicant told him not to come now as the weather was not good and a boat capsized the other day. He also told Al-Kinani the best story to provide to officials. Al-Kinani was the next door neighbour in Iraq of Hussanain Kyadi and his wife Duaa.
	
	
	The agreed facts stated:
	


“99   Al-Khazaali left Iraq around 25 January 2012 after obtaining the offender’s number as a person he could speak to about how to get to Australia. Al-Khazaali negotiated with the applicant for his journey to cost $US11,000.”

The applicant said in evidence that he did not get any of this $11,000 but rather it was the expense of the journey in coming to Australia. The applicant said that he believed that it was the agent he was contacting that got this money.


	
	The agreed facts stated at paragraphs 103 and 104 that on 6 February 2012 Al-Kinani travelled from Iraq to Kuala Lumpur with the intention of coming to Australia with the assistance of the applicant. When he arrived, he stayed at a hotel where he gave $3,500 to “Ibrahim” after negotiating with the applicant on the phone. He also gave his passport to “Ibrahim”. The name, date of birth and passport number for Al-Kinani was emailed to the applicant. Later Al-Kinani flew to Jakarta. The applicant said in evidence that he did not know whether this $3,500 was part of the $11,000 mentioned earlier or not.
	
	
	In late January 2012 Al-Khazaali separately met with associates of the applicant known as “Iraj” and “Shadi” in restaurants in Malaysia. He paid a portion of the money to them and was smuggled to Indonesia by boat. On 21 March 2012 the applicant returned to Australia, after spending 3 months in Indonesia and Malaysia.
	
	
	On 24 March 2012 the applicant called “Matin” and told him that the sea conditions were good and asked when it would be. He was told it might be in the next two or three days. The same day he spoke to Karimi about the topic. On 26 March the applicant called Al-Khazaali and Al-Kinani asking how they were. They expressed hope that there would be news in the next few days. The applicant said he would organise “Matin” to contact them.
	
	
	Because the applicant was arrested on 27 March 2012, in April 2012 Al-Khazaali and Al-Kinani were forced to leave their accommodation by Karimi as the applicant was not able to honour the agreement. They had to find and pay other smugglers, who eventually arranged for them to get on a SIEV to Australia.
	
	
	On 9 June 2012 SIEV 345 was boarded by Australian Customs about 11 nautical miles from Christmas Island. The boat was carrying 120 passengers. No person on the boat had a valid visa authorising entry into Australia. Al-Khazaali and Al-Kinani were on board.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence about matters beyond those set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts. He said that it was his practice to visit Indonesia every three months to visit his family and his wife. He said that it was because of his own experience and that of his parents that he chose to assist people and not let them fall into the hands of crooked smugglers. He said that his telling Ms Shadfar not to trust anyone and not to take any risks supported what he was saying.
	


Proceedings in the District Court


	
	By reference to s233A(1)(a) of the Migration Act (Cth) which refers to a person who “organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia …” his Honour found that normally to “organise” would be more serious than to “facilitate” but that this might not always be so. His Honour then proceeded to assess the objective seriousness of the offences on the basis that the applicant was a facilitator.
	
	
	There was an issue before his Honour as to whether any of the offences were committed for financial gain. It was the applicant’s case that his motive was purely altruistic, humanitarian and not for profit. He said that his wife had earlier died as a result of which he had received an insurance payment of $250,000. It followed, so the applicant submitted, that he was not in need of money. He submitted that two of the persons whom he helped to come to Australia, Messrs Aldafai and Aldaffaay, were relatives of a friend in Sydney. Because they had helped the Americans in Iraq, they were both under threat of retaliation. He submitted that the persons in counts 3 and 4, Abdul Al Jadiri and Hiba Almayhi, were distant cousins. In relation to counts 5 and 6 he said that Duaa was his first cousin.
	
	
	On this issue the Crown submitted that by analogy with the approach adopted by the courts in respect of drug importation offences, his Honour should draw a “common sense” inference to the effect that a person facilitating illegal travel was involved for profit unless there was persuasive evidence to the contrary. In support of that submission and generally, the Crown referred to the large sums of money which had either been paid to the applicant or which the applicant had arranged to be passed onto other persons.
	
	
	On this issue, his Honour concluded:
	


“I find he acted from a combination of motives, a combination of personal gain and altruism. I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons. The common sense inference that a person facilitating illegal travel is involved for profit; the agreed facts refer on a number of occasions to the offender “negotiating” the price of things; they also refer at para 9 to the offender telling Abu Anwar that he had “two customers.” His demonstrated extensive and businesslike knowledge of what was involved to smuggle people from Malaysia via Indonesia to Australia, as well as his regular travel to these areas. That is notwithstanding the relationship that he gave evidence about and the insurance money that he also spoke about.

Overall I find,

(a)   the offender was a facilitator who acted for a combination of personal financial gain and altruistic motives, with one exception which I will mention in a moment. The evidence does not enable quantification of that financial gain to be assessed. His role, as I have taken the trouble to detail the facts in great detail, was varied and integral. He was involved in most stages;

(b)   it necessarily involved putting lives at risk;

(c)   it involved overall bringing or attempting to bring ten non-citizens into Australia over the five month period from 3 November 2011 to 27 March 2012. …” (ROS 16.5 – 17.3)


	
	His Honour concluded that attempting to bring 10 illegal immigrants into Australia over a 5 month period was people smuggling in a comparatively minor way, compared to the numbers on board each SIEV. Balanced against that, was the integral role which the applicant played in the people smuggling process. In relation to counts 5 and 6, his Honour concluded that no financial gain was involved but that otherwise there was little to differentiate the offences.
	
	
	His Honour regarded specific and general deterrence as important considerations. This was because the object of the Migration Act was to regulate in the national interest the coming into and presence in Australia of non-citizens. By reference to what Mason P said in R v Feng Lin [2001] NSWCCA 7; 119 A Crim R 194, his Honour took into account that the unlawful entry of non-citizens into Australia was a serious violation of the country’s sovereignty and national security and that “it undermines the attempted equities of an organised immigration and refugee system; it exposes the participants to exploitation and risk to health and life and it imposes significant costs upon the Australian public”. His Honour noted that another effect of people smuggling was that many other deserving people, who might otherwise have secured lawful entry into Australia, were its indirect victims.
	
	
	In accordance with s16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) his Honour reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. He was aged 36/37 at the time of the offending and was 39 at the time of sentence. In addition to the applicant, his mother gave evidence. There was a psychiatric report to the effect that he was not suffering from any psychiatric issues.
	
	
	He was born in Iraq, one of nine children. When he was about five, his family was deported to Iran. He was a very good soccer player and was in the Iranian under 17 team. He also played professional soccer.
	
	
	In 2000 he left Iran and made his way to Indonesia, paid a people smuggler and made the dangerous journey to Ashmore Reef by boat in May 2001. He said that when he did this, a friend of his in Sydney put him into the hands of trusted people in Indonesia. He quickly got a visa to stay in Australia because of his soccer talents. Nevertheless, he appears to have encountered difficulties in that he had convictions for shoplifting and larceny in 2003, as well as a conviction for stealing property as a clerk/servant in 2005. He was fined for these offences. Because of those convictions, his Honour did not treat the applicant as a person of prior good character but otherwise did not regard them as relevant.
	
	
	The applicant worked as a machinery operator in 2002/2003 and was in South Australia for 6 years where he was employed as a cleaner with a soccer club and with whom he played soccer. He also did work as a contractor installing floors and floor coverings. For a number of years before committing these offences, he took trips to Malaysia and Indonesia which ranged from weeks to months at a time. When taken into custody for these offences, he was unemployed.
	
	
	In January 2006 he married. His wife was of Turkish background, but born in Australia. There were two children of the union. His wife suicided in the home by hanging herself in September 2008, apparently as a result of depression which she suffered after the second baby. After his wife’s death, the applicant took his son to Indonesia to be with his parents who were then refugees there. He left his daughter with relatives in Australia.
	
	
	In 2008 his parents (with his assistance) tried to enter Australia by boat but were intercepted and sent back to Indonesia. They ultimately obtained legitimate residency in Australia in 2011 as part of the Family Reunion Immigration Program. The applicant’s two children were aged 6½ and 8 at the time of sentence. Since the applicant went into custody, they have been living in Sydney with his mother.
	
	
	In a letter to the court, the applicant said that his intention was “to help make this dangerous journey a little safer for my family and dear friends. Never did I imagine that by doing so I was breaking the law”. This was confirmed in his oral evidence when he said that he did not realise that what he was doing was a crime until his lawyers told him that such was the case. This evidence was rejected by the sentencing judge. Apart from its inherent improbability, his Honour referred to the applicant’s evidence in cross-examination that when he came to Australia by boat himself and paid cash to people smugglers, he knew that it was not legal. Nevertheless, his Honour took into account as a mitigating factor the element of altruism in the applicant’s motivation for committing these offences.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the applicant’s oral evidence that he recognised that what he had done was wrong. His Honour also took into account that the applicant had made statements shortly before his plea of guilty to the effect that he was doing so in order not to waste the insurance money. His Honour concluded:
	


“Whilst I consider that he acknowledges that what he has done is contrary to Australian law, I consider that morally he feels as though he has done nothing wrong.” (ROS 21.3)


	
	His Honour rejected the Crown submission that the applicant posed a high risk of re-offending. He did so because having been arrested and sentenced for these offences, the applicant would now have come to the notice of the authorities so that it would be difficult for him to re-offend. His Honour assessed the risk of such re-offending as low to moderate. In relation to his life outside the offending, his Honour concluded that his rehabilitative prospects were good. This was because of his work ethic, his family support, his love of family and children and his plans for the future.
	
	
	His Honour gave modest weight to the applicant’s inevitable distress at being unable to continue to see his children while he was in custody and that this would make his experience of imprisonment more onerous. His Honour took into account that the applicant had been held in maximum security for a year.
	
	
	The applicant’s custodial history was that he was arrested and charged on 27 March 2012. On 24 May 2012 he obtained Supreme Court bail, but was re-arrested on 19 December 2012 for breach of his bail conditions. It is for this reason that his Honour backdated the commencement of his sentence to 20 October 2012.
	
	
	His Honour allowed an unspecified discount for the applicant’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice by pleading guilty. The trial was fixed for eight weeks commencing 8 October 2013 and the plea was entered on 17 October 2013. His Honour took into account that apart from his plea of guilty, the applicant had not co-operated with law enforcement agencies.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – Error in finding that evidence that the common sense inference that a person facilitating illegal travel is involved for profit.

Ground 2 – Error in finding that the offences were aggravated because they were committed for financial gain.

Ground 3 – By reason of a combination of the above grounds, a greater sentence than required by law was imposed.

These grounds of appeal raise the same issue and can conveniently be dealt with together.


	
	The applicant submitted that his oral evidence in the sentence proceedings as to his motivation for offending should have been accepted by his Honour. This was because it was internally consistent and was consistent with his actions over the period. He submitted that there was no evidence to contrary effect.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the analogy sought to be drawn by the Crown between the facilitation of people smuggling and drug supply offences was not valid. He submitted that to the extent that his Honour relied upon that analogy and “common sense”, his Honour was in error. What was required was some evidence to substantiate his Honour’s finding (Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that because this erroneous finding was taken into account by his Honour when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending, it was necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant without having regard to that finding.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that to the extent there was any evidence that his offending was motivated by financial gain, that evidence was not capable of establishing that fact beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that by reference to his oral evidence, there was ample evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities that he was not so motivated.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was not open to the Crown to rely upon paragraphs 26, 28 and 29 of the Agreed Statement of Facts when the accuracy of those paragraphs had been challenged by his sworn evidence in the sentence proceedings. He submitted that despite extensive cross-examination on those issues, his evidence remained unshaken. The applicant also relied upon what he identified as a wrong translation in that the word “customer” in his language (Persian) did not carry a business or money connotation.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that on the whole of the evidence it was more probable than not that he had no financial motive for the offending but was doing it out of a genuine concern for the 10 illegal immigrants whom he assisted. He drew particular attention to the following:
	



	
	from his own experience and that of his parents he was well aware of the dangers to which illegal immigrants were exposed when attempting to come to Australia;
	
	
	he had a connection, either directly or indirectly, through friends and relatives to each of the illegal immigrants whom he assisted;
	
	
	he was primarily facilitating the transfer of money to the illegal immigrants to assist their coming to Australia; and
	
	
	that some of the intercepted telephone calls showed that he was checking weather conditions for boats supported this submission.
	



	
	There were no separate submissions as to Ground of Appeal 3, other than the proposition that once the financial motivation element was removed from the objective seriousness of the offending, consistent with the approach which his Honour followed in respect of counts 5 and 6, the sentence should be reduced.
	


Consideration


	
	The challenge by the applicant to that part of his Honour’s reasoning which relied upon “common sense” and the analogy with drug importation has to be upheld. Such an approach has nothing to do with “common sense” and the analogy sought to be drawn by the Crown is false. The question of the applicant’s motivation for his offending had to be decided by reference to the evidence in his case.
	
	
	Although his Honour erred in taking that matter into account, the evidence justifies a finding beyond reasonable doubt that part of the applicant’s motivation for the offending involved financial gain.
	
	
	On that issue, it is appropriate to prefer the contents of the Agreed Statement of Facts to the oral evidence of the applicant. The Agreed Statement of Facts was signed on each page by the applicant and carried on its last page an attestation by the interpreter, who read the document to him in Persian, that the applicant “understood everything”. Moreover, the Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered in the sentence proceedings as an agreed document without objection or qualification being made at the time by senior counsel then appearing for the applicant. Both in evidence and in cross-examination, the applicant accepted that the Statement of Facts was agreed and acknowledged that he understood that he was to be sentenced on the basis of its content (T.6.19 – AB 17; T.30.24 – AB 41). The applicant gave evidence that the Agreed Statement of Facts was explained to him by his lawyer, was translated to him and that he had understood it before he agreed and signed the document (T.30.24 – AB 41; T.33.25 – AB 44; T.33.14 – 33.35 – AB 44).
	
	
	While there may be some ambiguity in the Agreed Statement of Facts if one carefully parsed each phrase and word, the overall effect is that large sums of money were being handed to the applicant. Some money was passed on to other parties but some apparently not. He was active and experienced in negotiating the amounts of money to be paid to various persons in the people smuggling network. Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the statement contain assertions that the applicant could arrange travel to Australia by boat if Aldaffaay and Aldafai “paid him” with the total cost being $US10,000 each. Each of them paid $US5,000 to the applicant in the restaurant at that time. Apart from his oral evidence, which his Honour only accepted in part, there was nothing in the Agreed Statement to indicate that the $US10,000 which the applicant received at that time was totally disbursed on their behalf, rather than being in part retained by the applicant.
	
	
	In his oral evidence, the applicant disputed that such an event occurred in a restaurant and asserted not only that the location was different, but that another person “Amin” was present and it was to that person that the $US10,000 was given. This evidence is quite inconsistent with the Agreed Statement of Facts and that document should be preferred to the oral evidence.
	
	
	Paragraph 26 of the Agreed Statement of Facts made it clear that the $US10,000 was in fact handed over to the applicant at that time. If there were any doubt that is clarified by the use of the word “also” in the next sentence relating to the handing over of passports. What happened at the restaurant in Malaysia is to be contrasted with what happened in paragraph 29 in Indonesia when the second payment of $US10,000 was returned by the applicant.
	
	
	Apart from the applicant’s obvious familiarity with financial negotiations with not only people smugglers but intermediaries along the way, there were other indications in the Agreed Statement of Facts of a commercial element in financial transactions involving the applicant. At paragraph 83 of the Agreed Statement of Facts, there is a telephone conversation between the applicant and a smuggler in the course of which they agreed to “account to each other later”. Similarly, paragraph 114 of the agreed statement refers to Al-Kinani and Al-Khazaali being “kicked out of the villa” by a smuggler “as the offender wasn’t able to honour the agreement”. There is a distinctly commercial element in that material.
	
	
	In addition, the applicant accepted that he was directly involved in negotiating prices, arranging for money to be provided to the passengers by way of international money transfers and other financial arrangements, such as payment for accommodation.
	
	
	It is clear from the applicant’s personal circumstances that being out of Australia for approximately four months between December 2011 and March 2012 involved considerable hardship for the applicant in that he was separated from his children and from his family and was apparently not receiving any money. While one can understand a desire on his part to see his girlfriend, Julita, from time to time, it strains credulity that the applicant would be so active in the affairs of others during a four month period without there being some financial incentive. This is particularly so when he appears to have been very conscious of money matters in that he agreed to plead guilty so as to save legal fees.
	
	
	These were all matters which his Honour took into account (see [58] hereof) and could be properly taken into account in addition to the flawed “common sense” factor.
	
	
	Indirectly, the applicant’s oral evidence in the sentence proceedings provides further support for a partial financial motive. Contrary to what was in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the applicant was at considerable pains to deny that he had received any money and was generally attempting to minimise his role overall by asserting that he did not know that people smuggling was illegal. This is illustrated by the following evidence:
	


“Q. You went there [Malaysia] to get money from them?

A. WITNESS: No I didn’t get any money from them.

Q. Well, you $5,000 each from them according to your own agreed facts, didn’t you?

A. WITNESS: I didn’t, I didn’t get any money your Honour, not even one cent.

Q. They each paid you $5,000 didn’t they, US dollars?

A. WITNESS: They didn’t, they did not pay me one cents, your Honour.

…

HIS HONOUR:

Q. Just go back to paragraph 26.

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Let’s read it together slowly.

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. And tell me what is wrong or not quite clear in these sentences, all right?

A. WITNESS: Yes, your Honour.

Q. “Both eventually agreed to pay the offender $10,000 each for the journey.”

A. WITNESS: Didn’t – not to pay me, he should pay the person called Amin, he was at the table and he took the money.

Q. Amin was there?

A. WITNESS: Amin was there at the table yes sir. The agent he was paying for visa for them.

Q. “$5,000 which was paid at the restaurant in Malaysia and the remaining $5,000 paid upon arrival in Indonesia. Both also gave the offender their passports which he handed back to them with an Indonesian visa just before they flew to Indonesia”. Is this sentence right, and I will just read it again, “Both also gave the offender their passports” ---

A. WITNESS: They did give it to Amin yes. Yeah, yeah I know – no, no it’s wrong. The money and the passport paying by Amin to agent he pay for them for visa, yes.

Q. So strictly speaking it should read –

A. WITNESS: It should Amin there, the passport and the money to the fourth person which was in the restaurant called Amin, on the same table, he pick up everything ….” (T.28.1 – 29.17; AB 39 – 40).


	
	The applicant’s evidence left the sentencing court to resolve the apparent conflicts between the agreed facts and his oral evidence. The sentencing judge did so in a way which was in part adverse to the applicant. He was entitled to do so.
	
	
	In R v Michael Arthur Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335, an offender gave evidence which was at variance with the agreed facts. Howie J (with whom Dunford J agreed) said:
	


“34   … It is for the tribunal of fact to weigh the evidence of the offender and determine whether to accept it to the required standard: R v O’Neill (1979) 2 NSWLR 582 at 597. That is so even where the Crown does not call witnesses but relies upon depositions or formal statements: R v Blanchard (NSWCCA, 10 September 1991, unreported). It seems to me that it must be so where there is tendered what purports to be an agreed statement of facts.

35    The touchstone in the finding of facts by a sentencer is, of course, fairness to both parties. I see nothing unfair to an offender in the refusal of a sentencer to act upon his or her evidence, even if the evidence is undisputed by the Crown, at least where the offender has the onus of proof because it is a matter of extenuation or mitigation. …

36    But in my view this Court is not required on an appeal by an offender to infer that the sentencing court dealt with the offender in accordance with his or her evidence or to hold that the judge should have done so, even where the Crown did not dispute the evidence at the sentencing hearing. …

37    Where, as here, there is an agreed statement of facts placed before the sentencing judge, and there is also material either inconsistent with, or in amplification of, some aspect of the facts in that statement, the sentencing judge should not act upon that material without having brought it to the attention of the parties during the course of submissions so that the parties can deal with it. If the judge determines to sentence the offender on a factual basis other than in accordance with the agreed statement of facts, clearly the judge should refer to that matter during the course of the remarks on sentence. But if the sentencing judge determines to sentence the offender on the basis of the agreed facts, ignoring the material inconsistent with, or in amplification of those facts, then in my view there is no requirement for the judge to refer to the other material either during submissions or in the course of the remarks. Neither party can complain if the sentencing judge acts upon their formal agreement as to what are the relevant facts.”


	
	Dunford J, in a short concurring judgment, said in R v Falls:
	


“5    I agree with Howie J that by setting out in his Remarks on Sentence the facts virtually in accordance with the Agreed Statement of Facts, the learned sentencing judge indicated that he was sentencing the applicant on the basis of those facts and disregarding the evidence of the applicant in so far as it was inconsistent with, or additional to, those Agreed Facts, and implicitly rejecting the propositions that his only purpose was to have a conversation with her and that he withdrew from the attempt for any reason other than that the complainant screamed and ran away.

6    His Honour was entitled to take this approach, and I see no error in his so doing. It was for the sentencing judge to find the facts for the purposes of sentencing from the material before him including the Agreed Statement of Facts: GAS and SJK v The Queen [2004] HCA 22 at [30]- [31]. If an accused pleads guilty on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts, I do not see how he can complain if the judge sentences him on the basis of such Agreed Statement, and this Court should proceed on the same basis.”


	
	Those principles have been followed and applied recently in Zammit v R [2010] NSWCCA 29, Ishac v R [2011] NSWCCA 107 and Khanwaiz v R [2012] NSWCCA 168. In Zammit Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) held at [26] – [29] that it was open to a sentencing judge to sentence in accordance with the statement of facts which had been tendered by the Crown without objection, even where it was not stated to be an agreed document, despite the fact that the offender had given contradicting evidence after its tender. This is equally true in this case.
	
	
	The sentencing judge, however, did not reject the applicant’s evidence out of hand but found a combination of motives, i.e. not that he was motivated solely by financial gain but that there was altruism involved as well. As his Honour appreciated, such motives were not mutually exclusive. His Honour’s finding that they co-existed was open on all of the evidence. It follows that, although the sentencing judge erred in reasoning, the conclusion he reached was correct and the error was therefore not material. Accordingly, Grounds 1 and 2 have not been made out and it is unnecessary to intervene.
	
	
	However, if the error were material and it is necessary to intervene, the reasoning at [82] – [95] hereof leads me to the same conclusion, i.e. the applicant was in part motivated by financial gain. It follows that in the re-exercise of the sentence discretion in which this Court must engage (Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [42]) I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	As was pointed out in Kentwell:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. ...”


	
	Leaving aside the question of whether it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant’s offending was in part motivated by financial gain, I agree with his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending and his Honour’s analysis of the applicant’s subjective case. None of these matters have been challenged and they accord with my own assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	The offences committed by the applicant were objectively serious. They were committed on numerous occasions over a significant period of time. They were not isolated incidents. The applicant’s role as a facilitator was an integral, varied and crucial role which required him to become closely involved in travel arrangements, price negotiations, visa applications, cash transactions and deal directly with intermediaries and smugglers and the criminal network involved in illegally trafficking persons who in many cases were desperate to come to Australia. As the applicant would have realised from his own experience, his conduct put numerous lives at risk.
	
	
	A matter to which his Honour did not refer to but which is important is the element of moral culpability involved in the applicant’s deliberate flouting of the laws of Australia relating to facilitating the entrance of illegal immigrants. It is clear that the applicant was well aware that what he was doing was illegal but he persisted in engaging in a complex series of arrangements specifically designed to circumvent those laws.
	
	
	I also have regard to the fact that the sentence imposed by his Honour was in many respects a favourable one from the applicant’s point of view. Each of the three groups of offences was quite distinct and involved separate offending. While the existence of an underlying theme and unifying factor would justify a considerable element of concurrency, the separate nature and elements of each group of offences would in normal circumstances have involved some cumulation of the sentences. This is particularly so in respect to counts 1 and 2 in relation to which the four matters on the schedules needed to be taken into account pursuant to s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). There should, at the very least, have been some differentiation between the sentence imposed for counts 1 and 2 and the sentences imposed in respect of the other counts.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, in addition to the matters already referred to by his Honour, I am satisfied that no lesser a sentence than that imposed is warranted in law.
	
	
	It follows that Ground 3 has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL, in particular the conclusion that the sentencing judge's error was immaterial. However, I would conclude that it was immaterial because, on the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his Honour's conclusion as to the financial motive of the applicant was not only open but the fact.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I have read the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in draft. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed, but prefer to explain my conclusion in my own words. The Chief Judge's detailed analysis of the issues allows me to do so briefly. That a comparison was drawn in the Crown's submissions to the sentencing judge between the importation of prohibited drugs and the transport of people was unfortunate. The judge's acceptance that there was an element of altruism in the applicant's conduct belies the legitimacy of any such comparison. The inference that a person facilitating ""illegal travel"" is involved for profit is neither one based on common sense nor one that finds any logical support in the features of the drug trade. The Crown submission on that issue went further, effectively inviting a reversal of the onus of proof (submitting that the putative ""common sense"" inference should be drawn unless there was persuasive evidence to the contrary). I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the analogy was false and should not have been adopted by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The critical issue is what flows from that conclusion. In Kentwell at [42] (set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL), the High Court explained the content of this Court's task in circumstances where the discretion of the sentencing judge has miscarried. In such a case, it is the duty of this Court to exercise the discretion afresh, without pausing to assess ""whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome"". The principal error in that case was that the judge had acted on what was later understood to have been a wrong principle (error of the kind explained in the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120). There can be no doubt, in such a case, that the sentencing judge's discretion has miscarried.
	
	
	Here, the burden of the complaint is that the judge allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination. Not every reference by a sentencing judge to an extraneous or irrelevant matter will lead inexorably to the conclusion that the judge's discretion has miscarried. I am not persuaded that the discretion miscarried in the present case. There was a factual contest as to the applicant's motivation for his offending. After hearing the applicant's evidence, the judge made a finding of fact that the motive was mixed. Reading the remarks on sentence as a whole and having regard to the course the proceedings on sentence took, although the judge referred to the so-called ""common sense inference"" as one of the reasons for that finding, I am not persuaded that the exercise of his discretionary power in determining the appropriate sentences for the offences was affected by that irrelevant consideration. Accordingly, although I would not necessarily have reached the same conclusion myself, I am compelled to the conclusion that no basis has been established for this Court to intervene.

2766671,Taleb v R [2015] NSWCCA 105,"Judgment


	
	PRICE J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 9 September 2013 the Appellant stood trial before her Honour Judge Huggett DCJ and a jury on six counts as follows:
	


Counts 1– 4:   Indecent assault. The maximum penalty is five years’ imprisonment;

Court 5:   Sexual intercourse without consent. The maximum penalty is 14 years’ imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of seven years;

Count 6:   Commit an act of indecency towards a person over 16 years. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 18 months.


	
	The Appellant was convicted in respect of counts 1, 4 and 5 but was found not guilty in relation to counts 2, 3 and 6.
	
	
	On 14 February 2014 he was sentenced by Judge Huggett as follows:
	


Count 1:   A fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 14 February 2014 and expiring 13 February 2015;

Count 4:   A fixed term of imprisonment for 20 months commencing 14 February 2014 and expiring 13 October 2015.

Count 5:   A non-parole period of three years' imprisonment commencing 14 February 2014 and expiring 13 February 2017 with an additional term of three years expiring 13 February 2020.


	
	The Appellant now appeals against his conviction and sentence on the following grounds:
	


(1)   The trial judge erred by excluding questioning of the Complainant, Ms Wedervang and Dr Houston that showed the presence of male DNA in the bra and low vaginal swab and erred in disallowing questions on prior sexual experience and the content of text messages that showed sexual contact or experience.

(2)   The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence.

(3)   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Facts associated with the offending


	
	Both the Complainant and the Appellant gave evidence. The evidence of the Complainant was as follows.
	
	
	The Complainant was born on 14 July 1994. At the time of the offences, April 2012, she was 17 years old living with her family in Panania.
	
	
	The Complainant first met the Appellant when she visited the Fitness First gym in Granville with a friend on 6 April 2012. When she went to the reception area she met the Appellant for the first time. The Appellant worked at the gym. He was wearing the Fitness First uniform and she had a conversation with him. He asked if he could mind her handbag while she worked out at the gym. She allowed him to do that.
	
	
	Two days later the Complainant located a note in her handbag that said ""Fitness First"" with the message ""Call me"" and a mobile telephone number on it. The Complainant did not know who owned the number. She sent a text message.
	
	
	On 14 April 2012 the Appellant sent a text message to the Complainant asking her if she wanted to go for a drive. She agreed. The Appellant asked if it was okay if he brought a friend and again she agreed. The Appellant and his friend picked her up from near her house somewhere between 9:30pm and 10pm on that day. The Appellant introduced his friend as ""Carlos"" who was driving a small four door car. They drove to the wharf side of the Georges River in the Georges River National Park on River Rd, Revesby.
	
	
	They parked the car and the three of them sat in the car listening to music and smoking cigarettes. There were no other cars in the car park. After a while the Appellant invited the Complainant to walk with him down to the wharf. Carlos remained in the car. As they walked to the wharf the Complainant noticed that the Appellant was limping and using a pair of crutches. He told her that he had had a motorcycle accident.
	
	
	The Complainant and the Appellant sat down on the wharf and after some small talk the Appellant moved closer and started to kiss the Complainant on her neck. She moved away and told him not to do that. The Appellant smiled and laughed and told the Complainant to relax.
	
	
	He then pushed the Complainant onto her back and began to kiss and lick the left side of her neck and suck very hard. This caused the Complainant pain. She tried to move away from the Appellant, saying ""Don't do that"". In a subsequent medical examination conducted on 15 April 2012 Dr Houston observed that the Complainant had a bruise to the left side of her neck which the Complainant said she did not have prior to 14 April. This conduct formed the basis of Count 1 in respect of which the Appellant was found guilty.
	
	
	The Appellant then moved one of his hands and squeezed the Complainant’s left breast firmly from outside of her clothing. It caused her discomfort. The Complainant told him to stop and she bit one of his wrists. This formed the basis of Count 2 in respect of which the Appellant was found not guilty.
	
	
	The Appellant then rang Carlos to ask him to come down to the wharf. When he arrived, the Appellant told Carlos to stay at the wharf whilst he and the Complainant walked back to the car.
	
	
	Both the Appellant and the Complainant got into the back seat of the vehicle. The Appellant removed his t-shirt and asked the Complainant to sit on his lap. When she did so the Appellant started to kiss her again and lick around her neck. He had his hands firmly around her waist. The Complainant tried to move her head to get away from him. However, he kept kissing and licking her neck. This formed the basis of Count 3 in respect of which the Appellant was found not guilty.
	
	
	The Appellant then pulled down the Complainant’s bra and exposed her breasts. He commenced to suck and lick the right breast with what she described as “a lot of force, it hurt, it caused pain”. She tried to move her torso away from the Appellant and said loudly, “Stop, no, don’t do that”. Dr Houston observed that the Complainant had a bruise or bite mark to her right breast. The Complainant said that she had no such bruise or mark prior to that evening. That conduct formed the basis of Count 4 in respect of which the Appellant was found guilty.
	
	
	The Appellant then pushed the Complainant onto her back and lay on top of her with his chest against her chest. He unzipped her jeans and, as she struggled, he inserted a finger into her vagina which caused pain. The Complainant told the Appellant to stop and said “No”. After a period of struggling, she desisted, saying in evidence that “He wouldn’t stop so I kind of gave up”. She estimated that the Appellant’s finger remained inside her vagina for approximately ten minutes. Dr Houston observed that the Complainant had a bruise on her left thigh which the Complainant said was not present prior to that evening. This conduct formed the basis of Count 5 in respect of which the Appellant was found guilty.
	
	
	After the Appellant removed his finger from the Complainant’s vagina, he sat up, pulled down his pants and revealed his penis which was in a semi-erect state. He asked the Complainant whether he would get anything in return to which she replied ""No."" The Appellant then got out of the car, went to the back of it and commenced to masturbate until ejaculation. This conduct formed the basis of Count 6 in respect of which the Appellant was found not guilty.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards Carlos returned to the car. The Complainant was in the back seat of the car. Carlos sat in the front passenger seat and the Appellant drove the vehicle from the park to a place near the Complainant’s home where she got out of the car.
	
	
	Soon after arriving home the Complainant initiated a series of text messages with a family friend, Mr Islam Omar, who was a police officer. In those messages she made complaint regarding the actions of the Appellant.
	
	
	On 15 April 2014, after urging by Mr Omar, the Complainant made a formal report to the police and participated in a medical examination by Dr Houston.
	
	
	On 29 April 2012 police spoke to the Appellant because a van he was driving was parked in the middle of the street at an intersection in Auburn. When they checked his licence they ascertained there was a notification in relation to the Appellant arising out of the allegations that the Complainant had made against him. The Appellant was invited to attend Auburn Police Station and agreed to do so.
	
	
	At the police station he was asked if he knew a girl by the name of Dina and he said that he did not. He was placed under arrest and agreed to participate in an ERISP. During the ERISP he denied knowing a girl with the Complainant’s name and said that he did not know what the police officers were talking about when they referred to an incident of a sexual nature that took place at about 10pm on 14 April at Georges River National Park on Henry Lawson Drive, Revesby. He also denied that he had any friends by the name of Carlos.
	
	
	The police officers then put to him the details of the complaint and the Appellant said that he did not know what they were talking about, that he did not know the girl concerned, that he had never been to Revesby and that he had not put his phone number in her bag.
	
	
	The police identified the Complainant’s phone number as being in the Appellant’s phone and they read the texts that had passed between the Complainant and the Appellant. The Appellant claimed that none of those texts refreshed his memory about the matter. He denied the allegations that were put to him.
	
	
	When he gave evidence at the trial the Appellant admitted that he did not tell the police the truth in the ERISP and said that he did so because he was scared.
	
	
	The true position, according to the Appellant in his evidence, was that the sexual interactions that took place on the night concerned were all consensual. In fact, on the Appellant’s account of the events, the Complainant had initiated the contact almost from the moment she got into the car when she pulled down his hoodie and tickled him with her nails on his neck.
	
	
	The Appellant called evidence from the person he had introduced to the Complainant as Carlos whose name was Kahled Raad. Mr Raad was not present at the time the sexual interaction took place, either at the wharf or in the car. The significance of his evidence for the Appellant was that he said that everything between the Appellant and the Complainant appeared normal. They were laughing and talking. Nothing stood out as being unusual.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Appellant was born in Lebanon in 1992 and at the date of sentence was aged 21. He was one of six children. He was born with a form of cerebral palsy known as cerebral diplegia which required the use of crutches. The Appellant had received treatment from the Children's Hospital at Westmead from the age of five and had undergone many operations. He had metal plates in his hips but he still experiences a great deal of pain.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that he was raised in a loving environment with significant support from his parents and siblings who assisted him with his needs at home.
	
	
	The Appellant completed his Higher School Certificate in 2010 and subsequently completed an Advanced Diploma of Information Technology at the Australian Careers Business College in Parramatta. Following the completion of his Diploma he worked as a receptionist at Fitness First, Granville.
	
	
	He was single at the time of the sentence hearing but previously had been in a couple of intimate relationships.
	
	
	There was no history of alcohol or illegal drug abuse, mental health problems nor antisocial behaviour. He had no criminal convictions.
	
	
	Although he maintained his innocence and had tended to minimise his offending behaviour and showed no empathy towards the Complainant, as the Sentencing Judge found, he indicated a willingness to engage in counselling to address his offending behaviour.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report said that his risk of re-offending was low to medium. The Sentencing Judge found that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable to good.
	


Appeal against conviction

Ground 1:   Exclusion of evidence

Ground 2:   Unreasonable verdict


	
	The Appellant submitted that the verdicts of not guilty on counts 2, 3 and 6 called into question the guilty verdicts on counts 1, 4 and 5. The principles have been comprehensively analysed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 especially at [23] and [34]. Subsequently, in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) said:
	


[135]  …But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

[136] In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations: …


	
	The Appellant submitted that grounds 1 and 2 were not entirely discrete from each other. This was because of the Crown’s suggested reason for the guilty verdicts on counts 1, 4 and 5 and the not guilty verdicts on counts 2, 3 and 6, being that they could only be explained by the presence of bruising related to the events that gave rise to counts 1, 4 and 5. In other words, the most obvious reason that the jury distinguished between the counts was that there was some other objective evidence (bruising) that supported counts 1, 4 and 5.
	
	
	The Appellant accepted that the rationale for the distinction made by the jury in the counts in respect of which there was conviction and those for which he was acquitted was the presence of bruising. In that way, the Appellant submitted, the possible causes of the bruising was a highly relevant matter and ought to have resulted in the Trial Judge permitting questioning about other sexual activity engaged in by the Complainant. Without that other evidence the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. I shall, accordingly, consider the grounds together.
	
	
	A voir dire was held at the commencement of the trial on a Notice of Motion filed by the Appellant which sought the following order:
	


Pursuant to s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) the Defendant seeks Orders that:

Leave be granted to cross-examine the complainant in relation to:

   (a)   the history taken by Dr Houston;

(b)   the finding made by Ms Wedervang;

(c)   the communications sent and received by the complainant at or around the time of the alleged offence.

(a)   Report of Dr Houston


	
	The report of Dr Houston was in the form of an expert certificate pursuant to s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The examination of the Complainant was carried out on 15 April 2012. In the report Dr Houston recited the history given including that after she arrived home the Complainant had a long shower. The report also noted that she complained of pain in her genital area which had settled and pain for bruises on her thigh from the struggle.
	
	
	Under the heading “7. Answers to direct questions” the following appeared:
	


Since the incident she had changed her clothing and showered. Her last menstrual periods started about 23/3/2012. She had not had sexual intercourse within 7 days of the examination.


	
	The report then went on to note the bruising apparent on clinical examination. Dr Houston also took a buccal sample and both a vulval and a low vaginal swab.
	
	
	In the last paragraph headed “Opinion, based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge” Dr Houston relevantly said:
	


She has bruises on her left neck and right breast consistent with a human bite. She also had small bruises, whose pattern was consistent with ‘fingertip’ bruising on her left thigh, in keeping with a struggle.

(b)   Report of Lisa-Ann Wedervang


	
	Ms Wedervang examined the swabs taken by Dr Houston and also the Complainant’s bra to see if DNA was present. Her Certificate disclosed the following:
	



	
		
			
			1b
			
			
			Low vaginal swab
			
			
			The DNA recovered (using the Y-filer System originates from an unknown male and could not have originated from Rabih Taleb (Barcode No XPS00200318).
			
		
		
			
			…
			
			 
			 
		
		
			
			2i
			
			
			Bra inside right cup
			
			
			The DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from at least three individuals. Due to the complexity of the mixture, the profiles of the individual contributors could not be determined.
			
		
		
			
			2ii
			
			
			Inside left cup
			
			
			The DNA recovered is a mixture that originates from at least three individuals. The major component of the mixture has the same profile as [the Complainant]. The minor component is too complex to determine the profiles of the individual contributors.
			
		
		
			
			2iii
			
			
			Inside lower right cup
			
			
			The DNA recovered originates from an unknown male and could not have originated from Rabih Taleb (Barcode No XPS00200318). This profile has been entered onto the DNA database.
			
		
	


(c)   Text messages


	
	The SMS messages on the Complainant’s phone were reproduced.
	
	
	The events complained of took place in the period 9.30pm to 10.45pm on 14 April 2012. The first of the messages sent by the Complainant is recorded at 10:49pm to a friend Youseff Nader. The message said:
	


I need to meet up with u ASAP just got sexual assaulted...Dnt call now coz his dropping me off now

It seems likely that this message was sent by the Complainant from the back of the car as she was being driven home.


	
	At 11:10pm she sent a message to another friend Alec Cohen saying:
	


Um just got sexual assaulted

That was followed at 11:19pm by another message to Alec Cohen which described briefly what had happened in the back of the car that constituted counts 3, 4 and 5.


	
	Thereafter, commencing at 11:30pm there are a large number of messages between the Complainant and Mr Omar until 1:26am the following day, 15 April.
	
	
	At 3:43am on 15 April the Complainant sent a description to Mr Nader of what happened that was similar to what had been sent to Mr Cohen the night before.
	
	
	From 12:51pm on 15 April until 3:30pm on that day there are numerous messages exchanged between the Complainant and a person known as Jason Samman who appears to be someone the Complainant communicated with through Facebook. Those messages make no reference to the sexual assault and can be regarded as very flirtatious messages involving discussions about sexual matters and perhaps included the sending of sexual images to or from the complainant.
	
	
	Thereafter, there are text messages to and from Mr Omar until 7.06pm on 15 April interspersed with text messages to and from Jason Samman of a similar kind to those referred to in the previous paragraph. They are followed by messages with Mr Nader that suggested he was coming to the Complainant’s house. The last of those messages on 15 April was at 8.51pm. They resumed at 3.53am on 16 April and continued until 6.17am. The messages to and from Jason Samman resumed at 4.51am and continued through 16, 17 and 18 April. There were a few further messages with Mr Omar on the afternoon and evening of 16 April.
	


The legislation

The trial judge’s rulings


	
	The Sentencing Judge’s reasons for the ruling on the voir dire were as follows (at T31, 9/9/13)
	


My ruling will be that I would not allow questions pursuant to 293 about, at this stage anyway, about presence of another male person's DNA on the bra or the low vaginal swab and I would not allow questions to be asked of the complainant about text messages that might suggest sexual content or sexual activity between her and another person, because in my view pursuant to 293, this isn't a formal ruling, I'll give you a formal ruling, pursuant to 293(6). Even if it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution the matters referred to in subs (a) I do not consider that the accused would be unfairly prejudiced by you not being permitted to ask about those matters because you would still be able to place evidence before the jury about her demeanour and behaviour after the alleged offences and you would be able to have evidence placed before the jury that there was nothing inculpatory insofar as DNA is concerned, relevant to your client and that there can be a number of ways in which the injuries that the doctor describes seeing could be occasioned.

And as far as 293(4) the evidence firstly does not conclusively confirm that any sexual activity that she may have taken part in was at or about the time of the commission of the prescribed sexual offence because there is the DNA, it's not clear what the DNA was from, when it was placed there, the circumstances in which it was placed there and it could be up to five days old. The DNA on the bra, the bra wasn't taken until three or four days after the alleged offence and to come within subs 4 the events have to form part of a connected set of circumstances and that these other events in my view do not form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged sexual offence was committed there of another male person at some other time and some other occasion and in my view the probative value of that evidence is low and would not outweigh the distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission and I would allow you to ask her questions related to her behaviour after the alleged offences that she was engaging in messaging many people.

The messages were about all sorts of things that it would be inconsistent with her being sexually assaulted, about what she might want to eat, inviting people to her place, catching up with people, seeing other people perhaps exchanging photographs with people which behaviour would be perhaps inconsistent with a person who had been sexually assaulted in the manner in which she said she had.

So that at this stage is what the rulings will be but as I said that could well change depending on what the complainant says. (emphasis added)


	
	Thereafter, further debate ensued particularly with regard to Dr Houston’s report and the injuries that had been noted. Her Honour then said (at T 42):
	


And in my view I maintain what I said earlier that at the present state of the evidence I would not allow questions to be asked about DNA on low vaginal swabs, DNA on the bra, the right cup of the bra, but pursuant to subs 6 and I take into account the difference of opinion in Tubou [R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243] and Rahme [R v Rahme [2004] NSWCCA 233] - the accused is entitled to a fair trial and in my view where the Crown is - or evidence will be placed before the jury of injuries, the accused is entitled to explore those injuries and to ask the complainant whether those injuries could have been caused in some other way, including whether they could have been caused by sexual contact with another person. If she says no, then that is - as far as the evidence goes subject to there being a further application - if she says yes, well we will deal with that if and when that occurs.

But Mr Todd, I would allow you to ask her whether - she saw the doctor on that night, the Sunday night wasn't it?

TODD: Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Had she in the preceding several days, and I don't know, three or four days or several - I don't know Mr Crown whether you have a view on whether it be 3 days, 4 days, several days, some days - but perhaps more specific, then she will understand what you are asking her-

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Yes.

HER HONOUR: -had she engaged in any activity with another person that, to her knowledge, caused her a mark to her neck, bite mark to her breast, and bruises to her left thigh. And at this stage I would not permit questions about whether she had the - well I suppose we will need to see what she says. If she says no she hadn't - and what she is being asked is not 'have you engaged in sexual activity with people' but 'have you engaged in sexual activity that caused bruising to occur, or caused bite marks.'


	
	However, there were a few other exchanges relevant to those rulings. Shortly after what appears at [54] above her Honour said this (at T 33.1):
	


In relation to Dr Houston I don’t necessarily agree that that final paragraph in its complete form is admissible where she talks about it being the result of a struggle and things of that nature. I think she can say I observed certain things, namely para 9 and the picture perhaps over the page, para 10 and that in my opinion what I observed on my examination is consistent with what the complainant alleged. Do you wish Mr Crown that it goes further that --

TRIAL ADVOCATE:   No your Honour.


	
	Shortly afterwards, the trial advocate said (at T 34):
	


In cross-examination it would be made clear that the doctor is not suggesting that she can say these injuries must have been occasioned by that sexual act.


	
	Despite her Honour saying that she was not giving a formal ruling at that stage but that she would give a formal ruling, she did not ultimately do so. It may be regarded as unfortunate that a formal ruling was not given on so significant a matter. It seems to have been overlooked in the desire not to delay the trial. Nevertheless, a reading of the trial transcript discloses that the parties largely worked on the basis that what was set out in [54] and [55] above constituted her Honour’s rulings with respect to the three areas of evidence argued at the voir dire.
	



	
	The bruising 
	



	
	Counsel for the Appellant at the trial was permitted to ask the Complainant and Dr Houston about the bruising. Consistently with her Honour’s ruling about Dr Houston’s evidence the Complainant was asked this question in cross-examination:
	


I suggest to you that any bruising or marks that you displayed to Dr Houston may have been the result of consensual, vigorous sexual activity in the days leading up to 15 April 2012.

The Complainant answered “No”.


	
	In cross-examination Dr Houston gave the following evidence:
	


Q:   …and could it be that of course, these bruises were present prior to 14 April 2012?

A:   It’s possible, yes.

Q:   From some possibly consensual vigorous sexual activity?

A:   Well, I couldn’t say.

Q:   One way or the other?

A:   All I can say, it’s possible.


	
	Notwithstanding what the trial judge and the trial advocate had said in the passages set out in [56] and [57] above, when Dr Houston was being examined by the trial advocate the transcript discloses the following:
	


Q:   You’ve given evidence of having taken a history of the complaint from Ms Serry. You’ve given evidence of having observed these three areas on her body which appear to show bruising.

A:   Yes.

Q:   Are you able to say, based on your training, your qualification and experience, as to whether or not those injuries are consistent or inconsistent with such --

HER HONOUR:   Mr Crown, I won’t allow that question.


	
	At the conclusion of Dr Houston’s evidence the trial advocate raised with her Honour in the absence of the jury the fact that her Honour had indicated earlier that she would allow a question along the lines of whether or not what she observed was consistent or not with what the complainant alleged. The Trial Judge said that she thought the Crown was going to ask something along the lines of the final paragraph of the report (at [44] above) but she thought, in any event, that the jury could draw its own inferences from the injuries.
	
	
	Her Honour’s disallowance of the trial advocate’s question was favourable to the Appellant.
	
	
	Counsel for the Appellant addressed the jury about the evidence of bruising. He said this (at T 31-32, 17/9/13):
	


After this alleged physical assault on at least two occasions, wharf and car, we have Dr Houston’s evidence that an analysis is done and bruising, as you will see, there is only a photograph of the neck, but there is a suggestion of bruising in other parts, not bruising consistent with what we say you’ll expect to see, in someone that has been forcibly assaulted in that way.

…

Dr Houston’s evidence is, again, important because bruising relied on by the Crown is not in the places you would expect to see, and it is not of the type that is immediately or can only be seen as having occurred the night before. You can’t date them. That’s the evidence of the prosecution. You don’t know where they have come from. I say to you, ladies and gentleman, that they could have come from anything, anywhere and anytime. It is inconsistent with the Crown case, because as I said and keep saying, you would expect far more bruising on far more parts of the complainant’s body.


	
	It is to be noted that counsel for the Appellant did not make reference specifically to Dr Houston’s evidence during cross-examination that the bruising could have been caused by consensual sexual activity at another time.
	


(b)   The DNA evidence


	
	In addition, evidence was permitted that any DNA found was not the Appellant’s DNA.
	
	
	When Ms Wedervang gave her evidence the Crown Advocate obtained from her that the Accused’s DNA profile was not able to be identified on the low vaginal swab, that she would not expect DNA from the finger of a person who had digitally penetrated the vagina of the Complainant still to be present and detectable 24 hours after an incident and that she was not able to find a DNA profile matching the Accused on any of the areas of the bra which had been tested.
	
	
	She was asked about the way DNA is deposited and on which surfaces it is more likely to be detected. There was then a question and answer as follows:
	


Q:   In this particular case, the bra was collected by the police four days after the alleged incident. Does the condition and the way in which the bra was kept in the period of time before it was collected by the police – could that affect whether or not you could detect a person’s DNA four days later?

A:   It would, especially, for instance, if the bra had been worn during those four days. You have a higher chance of any foreign DNA being removed, especially if it was by – it was placed there by touch, the chance of being removed by being worn will affect – any obvious recovery of that foreign DNA.


	
	In the absence of the jury the Appellant’s counsel complained about that question and answer which it was said suggested that the absence of the Appellant’s DNA on the bra could be explained away by some means. That led her Honour to tell the jury when they returned:
	


You have evidence from her that the accused's DNA was not detected on the three areas of the bra she tested, one on the left cup, I think, and two areas on the right cup. There is no evidence before you as to what happened to the bra after it was put on by Ms Serry. She said it was pulled down in the car. Certain things occurred. She put her clothes back on. You have no evidence as to what happened to the bra, essentially once she got home and in the four days between getting home and when it was picked up and provided to the police. So there is no evidence before you as to whether it was worn, as to the condition in which it was kept, and you must not speculate as to that and I direct you to disregard that part of Ms Wedervang's evidence where she talks about whether it has been worn or the condition. That's just guesswork because you have no evidence before you as to whether it had been worn or the condition in which it was kept or what happened to it for that four days.

You will remember I said to you that you determine the case only upon the evidence and in a sense, Ms Wedervang there has speculated. She doesn't know if it has worn. So to say wearing could remove it would be an unfair assumption to make, because there is no evidence of that. So you must disregard that final answer. Don't disregard though, of course, the evidence she gave that she tested the bra and the accused's profile was not detected on. (sic)


	
	Counsel for the Appellant addressed about the DNA evidence including the fact that the Appellant’s DNA was not found on the bra notwithstanding that it was alleged that he sucked and licked on the Complainant’s breast.
	


(c)   The text messages


	
	The text messages that the jury saw were contained in exhibit D. They were the text messages that passed between the Complainant and Islam Omar commencing at 11:30pm on 14 April 2012 (Number 2119) and concluding on 16 April 2012 at 7:37pm (Number 2241).
	
	
	On the third day of the trial prior to the Complainant giving her evidence counsel for the Appellant raised with her Honour matters concerning the text messages about which he was entitled to cross-examine the Complainant. He produced a document that became MFI 2 which identified the text messages by number, with a statement of what it was he wished to establish by cross-examination.
	
	
	When counsel for the Appellant cross-examined the Complainant about the text messages the following evidence was given:
	


Q.    Ma'am, do you have now before you a document that has got D1 on the outside of the yellow envelope?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Can you open it up for me. I want you to turn the pages over until you get on the left-hand side a number that's 2144.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Do you see that that seems to be, if you look along the columns, an outgoing message?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Without sounding it out aloud, just read that to yourself if you wouldn't mind.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    If you look back across at the columns, the third one along has a time and date. Do you see that?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Which would suggest it's 15 April 2012 at around 12.53pm. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    So this is the afternoon after the events you say took place on 14 April 2012. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Is it correct to say that you had been to the gym that day or not, do you know?

A.    Probably, if I said I was at the gym, then I was at the gym.

Q.    You have no independent recollection today.

A.    What do you mean by that?

Q.    I mean, you don't remember today whether you went or not.

A.    No, I don't remember.

Q.    Below that, if you could just look at those messages and read them just to yourself all the way down to 2166 over the page.

A.    Okay. Do you want me to read them?

Q.    Just to yourself. Don't read them aloud.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Those messages would appear to end at 3.30pm on 15 April, that is the ones I've asked you to look at. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    In general, do you agree with me that it seems that the messages convey you talking about daily usual matters such as buying chocolate, for example?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Just joking with your friend.

A.    Yes.

Q.    I suggest to you that that's inconsistent with you having just the night before been subject to a sexual assault or an attack.

A.    Can you please repeat that.

Q.    Yes. The content of those messages would appear to be you just acting, if you like - I withdraw that. The content of the messages seem to suggest you were just talking and joking with a friend about chocolate and talking about the gym and things like that. Do you agree with that?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that that would be inconsistent with you having just the night before been sexually assaulted.

A.    Why would it be inconsistent?

Q.    You're just talking normally about normal everyday things. You had been to the gym.

A.    Yes, but why should I tell this person, I don't - I don't know who this number is. Maybe I wanted to keep it personal, you can't just say something happened to you, like, out there to, you know, maybe it was a person I didn't want to tell.

Q.    Can I ask you to go over the page now to 2177. Do you see that?

A.    It's - is it highlighted in red?

Q.    Yes.

A.    Yes.

Q.    If you just read that to yourself and on to 2182.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Do you see that, for example, 2177 is around about 6.40pm on 15 April?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Then there's, it would appear, another message 2178. Is that right? 6.44pm.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Then other messages between 6.45 and 6.46. Do you see that?

A. Which ones?

Q.    2179 to 2182.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Which I suggest to you is sharing some images and other sort of friendly texts. Would you agree with that?

A.    Yes.

Q.    But at the same time you're also messaging Islam Omar. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

…

HER HONOUR:    I think she agreed that at the same time as those friendly texts and sharing images, you sent a message to Islam Omar.

WITNESS: Yes.

TODD

Q.    Which again I suggest shows that you are just speaking to someone else and speaking what seems to be a normal way to this person, but at the same time speaking to Islam Omar about a complaint. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Which would again suggest that you, I submit to you, madam, have not been recently sexually assaulted. Do you agree or disagree with that?

A.    I disagree.

Q.    If I can just ask you finally to look at 2188 to 2195. Again, without reading them aloud, just look at them again, please.

A.   Yeah.

Q.    Which takes us from 6.53pm on 15 April to 7.05pm on 15 April, doesn't it?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Where I suggest again the messages show that you're engaged in essentially joking, playful banter with a friend. Is that right?

A.    I guess so.

Q.    But then shortly after that you're again receiving some messages from Islam Omar. Is that right?

A.    Yes.

TODD: There's nothing further, your Honour.


	
	The jury did not have the document that was ultimately MFI 3 that contained the details of all of the text messages including those that had been cross-examined about. Consistently with Her Honour’s ruling on the voir dire counsel for the Appellant did not ask any questions about the texts suggesting they involved sexual banter or sexual related matters, although they did in fact suggest those things.
	
	
	It is, perhaps, noteworthy that the Appellant’s counsel did not seek to tender a table including all the text messages except the ones colour-coded red (those which the trial judge excluded by virtue of s 293). It seems likely that this was a tactical decision because such a tender would have disclosed complaints to a number of people apart from Mr Omar.
	
	
	In his final address to the jury counsel for the Appellant said only this about the text messages:
	


The next relevant thing that happens is on the Crown case there is these text messages sent, and they are before you. You will have your opportunity to look at those. But if I may, ladies and gentlemen, note the cross-examination that while text messaging the following day, there is a number of occasions when the text messaging is – and she accepts this – about things that are of a friendly nature, with her friends about chocolate and the like, going to the gym, and even at one stage while she is texting with Islam Omar, sharing some joking images with a friend, which we say you will find is inconsistent with her having been recently sexually assaulted.

The Appellant’s submissions


	
	The Appellant submitted that he should have been permitted to go further than simply asking if the bruising was explicable by other consensual activity, and to put that it was not caused by the matters alleged.
	
	
	In his written submissions the Appellant argued that sub-paragraphs (4)(a)(i) and (ii) of s 293 were satisfied in relation to the text messages together with the history taken by Dr Houston and the findings of Ms Wedervang, in that the temporal connection was established given the continuation of reliance by the Crown of the Complainant’s evidence beyond the initial contact with Islam Omar. The suggestion of continued sexual activity satisfied sub-para (i) and was “connected” under sub-para (ii) by the evidence of the Complainant being in the form of text messages. The Appellant submitted that no narrow approach should be given to the required connection in accordance with R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543 at 544.
	
	
	The Appellant further submitted that it would be open for a jury to find that a woman who had been sexually assaulted would be unlikely to have engaged in further consensual sexual activity shortly thereafter.
	
	
	The link between the three matters (the bruising, the DNA evidence and the text messages) was identified by the Appellant in his reply to the Crown’s supplementary written submissions on the appeal. The Appellant sought to put evidence before the jury by cross-examination that the bruises did not relate to the circumstances in which the complainant said they were caused. The evidence of the DNA and the text messages were sought to be put before the jury since the bruises were said to be relevant to sexual activity and to show that they were relevant to sexual activity other than the sexual activity charged.
	
	
	In his oral submissions, Mr James QC argued that it was sub-s (4)(c) that was engaged. This was because the issue was said to be whether or not the injury was attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person. The question which arises from this reliance on sub-s(4)(c) is whether it was relied upon before the trial judge and, therefore, whether Rule 4 applies.
	
	
	An examination of the transcript makes it clear that paragraph (4)(c) was not only not relied upon by the Appellant at the trial but was expressly abjured. The transcript records the following:
	


HER HONOUR:   …So I don’t, insofar as the bra and the vaginal swab is concerned, I don’t see how, when you get the benefit that your client’s DNA is not in areas where it might be, to lead evidence of that is directly contrary to s 293 and you either have to come within sub-section – somewhere there within subs (4) and it can’t be (b) because it’s not to do with the relationship between your client. It can’t be (c) because even though there is injury your client does concede sexual intercourse. It can’t be (d), it can’t be (e).

TODD:         No. We don’t know about (f).

HER HONOUR:   No and I can’t rule on (f) at this stage.

TODD:         No.

HER HONOUR:   So therefore it’s either 4(a) or 6(a).

TODD:         Yes.

TRIAL ADVOCATE:   Yes your Honour. So it would seem your Honour that the provision was designed to --

HER HONOUR:   Some of these exceptions, they are not mutually exclusive because they overlap with one another because equally sexual intercourse could form part of subs (a) or (b) or – sexual activity includes sexual intercourse and if each was – there’s obviously some overlap and the other sections in (a), (b) and (d) talk more generally about sexual experience or sexual activity.

TRIAL ADVOCATE:   But (c) deals with injuries.

HER HONOUR:   Yes it does.

TRIAL ADVOCATE:   And my submission about (c) is that it would seem that provision was designed to allow cross-examination about injuries where the identity of the accused was in issue and where the accused is saying, well I wasn’t even there, or it didn’t occur, so a live issue is, well could it have occurred by some other reason.

HER HONOUR:   What do you say to that Mr Todd.

TODD:   Sexual intercourse your Honour as defined, it’s got nothing to do with the sucking on breast, as defined, 61H(1) in para (c)(i) is all about sexual intercourse and the repetition of the words in (ii) is clearly attributable to some penile, vaginal, or some other insertion because it is talking about injuries in that context. Semen, pregnancy, disease or injury attributable to the sexual intercourse as defined therefore it has no application here.


	
	The Appellant submitted that it was enough that the exceptions to s 293 were invoked and that for Rule 4 purposes it was not necessary that all bases be articulated. I do not agree.
	
	
	In Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195 Simpson J said (speaking of various sections of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):
	


[70]   What happened in the present case, as I have earlier outlined, was that counsel for the appellant objected, on discretionary grounds, to the admission of the whole of Mr Gould’s statement. He did not at any stage argue that it, or any part of it, was not admissible under s165(2); he argued, presumably invoking the judicial discretions conferred either by s67(4) or s135, that the evidence ought to be excluded. He also appears obliquely to have relied upon s137. Neither s67(4) nor s135 is a section directed to admissibility – each is a section reserving a discretion to the court to exclude evidence of the character identified. S137 is, properly characterised, a section directed to admissibility. The nearest counsel could be said to have come to an argument that the evidence was inadmissible was to put to the trial judge matters that might be construed as raising s137, pursuant to which (in a criminal case), if a court is of the view that the probative value of a particular piece of evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendants, then the court is obliged to exclude that evidence – that is, once the judgment is made that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, then s137 renders the evidence inadmissible.

[71]   In fact, counsel never drew attention to, or even mentioned, any of these sections. The legal foundation on which he put his objection has to be divined from the rather cryptic submissions he made.

[72]   Once the decision had been made that those objections failed, he made no further objection as to the admissibility of any individual part of Mr Gould’s statement.

[73]   Nevertheless, counsel for the appellant argued in this Court that, once objection is taken, rule 4 has no further application. That is, that once objection – that is, objection of any kind, and on any basis - is taken on any ground to a particular piece of evidence, then rule 4 will not operate to prevent the raising of an entirely different objection to the same piece of evidence.

[74]   To accept the appellant’s contention would be to cast an extraordinary burden upon trial judges. It not infrequently happens that evidence, whether oral or documentary, is tendered, and objection is taken to the whole of the evidence of a witness, or of a document. An obvious example is an electronically recorded interview with the person subsequently charged. These frequently are extremely lengthy documents. On the appellant’s argument, if objection were taken to the whole of such an interview, on the ground, for example, that it was not voluntary, and, if that objection were resolved against the accused, and no subsequent objection taken to any individual part of the interview, it would, nevertheless, be incumbent upon the trial judge (at the risk of falling into appellable error) to determine the admissibility of every individual answer given in the interview. The judge would be required to take that course without knowing the contents of the brief (at least of counsel for the accused), and frequently without having been enlightened as to the true issues in the proceedings. The proposition only needs to be stated to be seen as untenable.

[75]   There are, however, some passages in the authorities said to support the contention of counsel for the appellant. One such is R v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570, a decision to which I was a party. There, in a joint judgment, this Court said:

“If an objection was indeed taken, although counsel may not have formulated the basis thereof as precisely as might have been expected, leave to argue this ground is not required. If, on the other hand, and as appears more likely, no objection was taken, leave is required: Criminal Appeal Rules, r4.”

The Court in that case did not find it necessary to determine the application of rule 4, holding that the error there identified was fundamental and of such potential significance that, if necessary, leave ought to be (and was) granted to argue the point.

[76]   I cannot accept the appellant’s proposition. S6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides for a number of grounds of appeal, including, relevantly “the wrong decision of any question of law”, and “that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. The contention of the appellant is that the evidence was wrongly admitted. Admission of evidence involves a question of law. The appellant must be taken to be raising a ground that the decision to admit the evidence involved the wrong decision of a question of law. Judges decide questions that are put before them by the parties for determination. In Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297, with reference to rule 4, McHugh J commented that, where objection has not been taken at trial, the trial judge cannot be said to have made an error of law, because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. That reasoning is equally apposite where, as here, a relevant ruling has not been sought. The question that was put before Blackmore DCJ for determination was whether, in the exercise of his discretion, he should reject the whole of Mr Gould’s statement. Since the questions under s165(4) and s135 involved discretionary determinations, those determinations may only be reviewed on appeal on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The question under s137 involves an evaluation, the result of which dictates whether the evidence is or is not admissible. That evaluation too, may only be reviewed on the principles stated in House. If the grounds established that (and they obviously do not), it would be open to the appellant here to argue error of law in the determination not to reject the whole of the statement under ss67(4), 135 or 137. Yet the appellant now seeks to argue, not that there was any House-type error in the exercise of discretion, or in the s137 evaluation, but that two parts of the statement were not admissible by reason of the provisions of the Evidence Act. This is a far cry from the objection that was taken at the trial. The judge has made no error of law in that respect, because is was never put before him for determination.

[77]   I recognise that on one very literal construction of the words in rule 4, the appellant might draw some comfort. However, closer analysis of the rule strips that comfort away. The “decision” in question was not a decision (made over objection) that the two passages now in contention were admissible evidence; such a decision was never made, because the judge was never called upon to make such a decision. The decision he made was a decision, made after consideration of discretionary matters, and evaluation, that Mr Gould’s statement, in its entirety, would be admitted.

[78]   In my opinion, the appellant requires leave under rule 4 if he is to be permitted to argue this ground.


	
	Although James J and Hall J in Vickers  reserved their opinion on the point, the passage was approved in this Court in Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245 at [26], Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283 at [129]-[130] and Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 at [54]-[55]. I consider that those passages in Simpson J’s judgment correctly state the law with regard to rule 4.
	
	
	If it was not argued below that the evidence should be admitted by reason of the exception in paragraph (4)(c), and where counsel for the Appellant agreed that paragraph (4)(c) did not apply, it must be concluded that the point was not taken below. It is not enough to say that reliance was placed generally on s 293: Vickers at [76]. Ordinarily a party is bound by his or her counsel’s conduct of a case. The Appellant would need to demonstrate that the approach by the Appellant’s counsel at the trial has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	For reasons which will become apparent, counsel’s agreement with the trial judge that paragraph (4)(c) had no application was correct. In those circumstances, reliance now by the Appellant on para (4)(c) means that rule 4 applies.
	


Section 293(4)(c)


	
	To bring himself within this exception the Appellant needed to show (i) that he did not concede the “sexual intercourse so alleged” and (ii) that the evidence was relevant to whether the presence of (relevantly) injury was attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged against him. In addition, the tailpiece to the subsection needed to be satisfied.
	
	
	The relevance was said to be that the injury being the bruising could have come from other vigorous sexual intercourse or sexual activity. The DNA evidence and the text messages suggested other sexual activity and the Appellant ought to have been allowed to explore in cross-examination that other sexual activity. The Appellant submitted that if Dr Houston had known of the DNA evidence and the evidence of the text messages suggesting further sexual activity her opinion about the cause of the thigh bruising might have been different.
	
	
	Although the Crown made oral submissions at the hearing of the appeal that the bruising to the thigh was not attributable to the sexual intercourse that submission was abandoned in subsequently filed submissions dealing with paragraph (4)(c). That abandonment was properly made: Dimian v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 358.
	
	
	The injury is therefore a relevant one for paragraph (4)(c).
	
	
	However, the Appellant is unable to satisfy the requirements of sub-paragraph (4)(c)(i) because he does concede that sexual intercourse took place. The sexual intercourse was digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina. The Appellant submitted that he did not concede the “sexual intercourse alleged” because that sexual intercourse was intercourse without the consent of the complainant.
	
	
	The question is, therefore, whether “sexual intercourse alleged” is a reference only to the physical act or whether it includes the issue of consent in its description or classification. There are a number of reasons why the Appellant’s construction of the paragraph should be rejected.
	
	
	First, “sexual intercourse” is defined in s 61H(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 293 applies to prescribed sexual offences, a number of which are offences involving sexual intercourse. Section 293 was originally enacted as s 409B of the Crimes Act.  It may be taken, therefore, that when s 293 uses the term “sexual intercourse” it means the same thing as the definition in s 61H of the Crimes Act because that Act creates the offences which the Criminal Procedure Act declares to be prescribed sexual offences. That definition deals only with the physical acts that constitute sexual intercourse. Matters touching consent are found in the individual sections which create the offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the present offence charged under s 61I had three elements, being (1) that the Appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, (2) that the complainant did not consent to that sexual intercourse, and (3) that the Appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. In that way, it can be seen that the issue of consent is not contained within the “sexual intercourse” itself. The Appellant admitted (1) so that element was made out. In that way, and because consent was a separate element, the sexual intercourse alleged was conceded. The Crown’s submission should be accepted.
	
	
	Secondly, resort may be had under s 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) to the Second Reading Speech whether to confirm the ordinary meaning of a provision or to determine the meaning of an ambiguous provision in legislation. When the predecessor of s 293 was introduced as s 409B of the Crimes Act the Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Assembly relevantly said:
	


For example, the complainant alleges that the sexual assault caused certain injuries, perhaps bruising or cuts. If the accused denies that intercourse occurred at all, and says that the offence must have been committed by someone else, it would not be fair to deprive him of the right to cross-examine the complainant as to whether the complainant had, at around the relevant time, been having intercourse with another person or other persons. Such another relationship might, of course, explain the true identity of the attacker. However, where the accused is not denying that he had intercourse, and his defence is that the complainant consented to intercourse, he should not be entitled to cross-examine about the complainant's sexual behaviour with other

persons, unless such cross-examination would be permitted under another sub-section of new section 409B. [emphasis added]


	
	Thirdly, the cases which have considered paragraph (4)(c) have tended to the view that the paragraph is speaking of the physical act of sexual intercourse.
	
	
	In R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243 Heydon JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed) said:
	


[67] Since the argument fails because of the tailpiece to s105(4), it is not necessary to decide whether, even if s105(4)(c)(ii) is satisfied, the construction advanced by the appellant of s105(4)(c)(i) is wrong. If it were correct, then any divergence between the account offered by a complainant and the account offered by an accused person would mean that the exception created by s105(4)(c) to the rule of exclusion created by s105(3) would cease to exist in all cases in which s105(4)(c)(ii) was satisfied. S105 is not a provision the policy or drafting of which excites universal applause, but it is unlikely that its correct construction would cause it to have virtually no application over significant areas. A person accused of sexual intercourse without consent has three choices: to plead guilty; to plead not guilty and contend that intercourse carried out by the accused was not proved; or to plead not guilty and contend that lack of consent is not proved. The appellant's construction would mean that in all contested cases where s105(4)(c)(ii) was satisfied, the s105(4) exception would apply because s105(4)(c)(i) was satisfied by reason of either a denial of intercourse or a denial of consent. However, in the circumstances it is not necessary, and therefore it is undesirable, to reach a final view on the construction of s105(4)(c)(i).


	
	In R v Mosegaard [2005] NSWCCA 361 the appellant was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. He conceded that those acts of sexual intercourse took place but said they were by consent. The complainant alleged other acts of sexual intercourse during the relevant events but those acts were neither charged nor conceded by the appellant. He sought to cross-examine the complainant in relation to earlier acts of sexual activity with other people on the basis of various injuries said to have been sustained by the complainant.
	
	
	McClelland CJ at CL (with whom Grove J and Smart AJ agreed), having first noted at [148] that Tubou had not resolved problems associated with s 293(4)(c), said:
	


[149] It was not made plain which acts of intercourse were denied. Furthermore, as I understand the position the issue at the trial was not whether the complainant had consented to the relevant acts of intercourse (they were not denied) but whether injuries to the complainant, which were said to support the allegation of lack of consent, could have been due to the earlier acts of sexual activity with other people.

[150] In these circumstances there are two primary questions which must be resolved. Firstly, is the exception limited to the acts of sexual intercourse the subject of the charges and secondly, the meaning of injury in s 4(c)(ii).

…

[153] To my mind subs (4) should be confined to the acts of sexual intercourse the subject of the charge. Unless construed in this manner there could be many cases where the evident purpose of the prohibition intended by this section would incidentally be overcome.

[154] In the present case the complainant gave evidence of sexual intercourse beyond the matters charged, being part of the complete sequence of events. The appellant accepts that the intercourse charged occurred and accordingly accepts one aspect of the central issue in the proceedings. The other acts of intercourse are relevant because they reveal the sexual relationship between the appellant and the complainant together with the complete sequence of events and accordingly, the Crown was obliged to tender that evidence. However, by putting the “secondary” sexual conduct with the complainant in issue the accused says that he is able to explore the sexual activity of the complainant with other persons.

[155] The matter can be tested in this way. If in the present case only the three acts of intercourse had been alleged and the appellant accepted that they occurred, but says they were consensual, s 4(c) could have no work to do. There would simply be no issue on which the subsection would provide that the evidence could be tendered. It would be a surprising result if because other acts of intercourse are alleged, but not charged, and denied, the accused has the opportunity to introduce evidence of prior sexual activity. (emphasis added)


	
	In R v Baden Cram [2008] NSWDC 225 Hulme DCJ (as his Honour then was) said:
	


[14] Next it was contended that the exception in s293(4)(c) was made out. In view of what I have said earlier about the equivocal nature of the injuries, I do not accept this. Moreover paragraph (c) does not apply in any event because this is not a case in which the accused ""does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged"".


	
	If “sexual intercourse so alleged” means sexual intercourse without consent, it is difficult to see what work there is for s 293(4)(c)(i) to do, because every person accused of such an offence would satisfy the sub-paragraph. The views expressed by McClellan CJ at CL, Heydon JA and Hulme DCJ should be followed. The reference in the sub-paragraph to “sexual intercourse” is a reference to the physical act. In the present case that act is conceded. The Appellant does not fall within s 293(4)(c). There was no miscarriage of justice.
	


Section 293(4)(a)


	
	To bring himself within this exception the Appellant needed to demonstrate that the relevant other sexual activity (i) took place “at or about the time of the commission” of the offence charged, and (ii) the evidence of such sexual activity formed part of a “connected set of circumstances” in which the offence charged was committed. In addition, the tailpiece to the subsection needed to be satisfied.
	
	
	Section 293(4)(a) has been discussed in a number of cases in this Court. A fairly broad and liberal approach was taken in R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543 in a somewhat unusual case where the complainant alleged three acts of sexual intercourse against the appellant. The complainant had been drinking with the appellant, the complainant’s boyfriend and another woman. Within an hour of the alleged sexual assaults by the appellant the complainant had consensual sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. It was held that both limbs of paragraph (4)(a) were satisfied in the circumstances.
	
	
	In JWM v R [2014] NSWCCA 248 Hall J (with whom RA Hulme and Davies JJ agreed) said:
	


[63] The following matters, in my opinion, are relevant in determining the scope and application of the second limb contained in s 293(4)(a):

   (1) The legislative purpose behind s 293(3), as earlier discussed.

   (2) The fact that the exceptions to s 293(3), including in particular s    293(4), are expressed in restrictive terms. In other words, they are not    broadly expressed.

   (3) The provisions of s 293(4)(a)(ii) require consideration of:

   (a) The full circumstances in which the alleged prescribed    sexual offence or offences was/were committed must be    identified;

   (b) The relevant “events“ are those that “ … form part of a    connected set of circumstances“ in which the alleged    prescribed sexual offence was committed. Such “events“    includes occurrences, and (on the approach of Basten JA in    GEH [GEH v R [2012] NSWCCA 150]) “non-events“;

   (c) A “connected“ set of circumstances includes a related set of    circumstances, that is, that have a relationship or association    with other circumstances.

[64] As Basten JA observed in GEH, supra, there must exist a particular association between an “event“ (which must be taken to include a non-event) and the specified circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence(s) was/were committed.


	
	By contrast with Morgan, in R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335 Simpson J (RA Hulme J and Barr AJ agreeing) held that evidence of a complainant’s sexual interest in another man in a bar on the evening she alleged a later sexual assault by the accused was not relevant, with the result that s 293 was never engaged. However, even if the evidence was relevant it satisfied neither limb of paragraph (4)(a).
	
	
	Simpson J said:
	


[67] First, the evidence was not, and was not capable of being, relevant. The issue in the trial, as declared by counsel for the respondent, was whether, in the early hours of 18 May 2012, the complainant had in fact consented to sexual connection (by cunnilingus) with the respondent. …

[68] That the complainant had exhibited sexual interest in another man (whether or not at or near the time the offence is alleged to have been committed) is irrelevant to any question concerning her consent to sexual engagement with the respondent.

[69] … The issue is a simple one: it is now clearly understood that the willingness of a person (whether male or female) to participate in sexual activity with one person does not, and cannot be taken to, connote willingness to participate in sexual activity with another. For the same reason, the evidence is not relevant either to the respondent's knowledge (or lack thereof) of the absence of consent by the complainant, or any belief in her consent that he might assert.

[70] The judge's conclusions that the evidence indicated ""a general sexual willingness on the part of the complainant"", and that it ""might act as some sort of antidote to the evidence that the complainant had, in the past expressly disavowed any interest in intimacy with the [respondent]"" betrays an impermissible approach to the question of consent in the prosecution of allegations of sexual offences. The reasoning contains an unstated premise. The unstated premise is that a person who engages sexually with another person will, or is likely to, engage sexually with any other person. It is a patently false premise. Section 293 was introduced into the legislation (originally as s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900) for the specific purpose of putting an end to offensive and demeaning cross-examination that proceeded on the basis that evidence of consent by a person (then invariably female) to sexual engagement with one person (person A) provided the foundation for an inference that that person also consented to sexual engagement with another person (person B). That process of reasoning has been banned from the criminal courts, first by s 409B of the Crimes Act, and subsequently by s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Yet that is precisely the process of reasoning disclosed in the passages of the judgment set out above, and the inference that was explicitly drawn. That inference was the basis for the decision to admit the evidence of the complainant's sexual interest in the stranger at Kings Cross.

[71] The submissions made on behalf of the respondent, that the proposed evidence ""needs to be seen in the wider context in which the complainant was showing particular interest in the respondent"" perpetuates the erroneous approach. Potential evidence that the complainant exhibited an interest in the respondent was not in issue on the appeal. Such evidence (if in proper form) would almost certainly be admissible, supposing that the respondent asserted that the complainant consented, that he did not know that she did not consent, or that he believed that she did consent. It was the inferences to be drawn from her apparent interest in another man that were in issue. Those inferences - as sought on behalf of the respondent - were that, because of her apparent interest in the stranger, she was ""sexually available"", or that it signified ""general sexual willingness"", or that her sexual interest (availability) was ""general"". Those inferences were simply not permissible. Evidence that the complainant showed signs of sexual interest in the respondent could not be strengthened by evidence that she showed signs of sexual interest in another man.

[72] The evidence was not relevant and ought to have been excluded on that basis. The finding that the evidence was relevant was erroneous.

…

[78] The third error lay in the application of sub-s (4)(a)(i), that is, in the finding that the evidence related to sexual experience or sexual activity ""at or about the time of the commission of the offence"".

[79] The proposed evidence was that the encounter with the stranger had taken place at some time in the early hours of the morning at Kings Cross. Much occurred in between that encounter and the events giving rise to the charge against the respondent. The party had returned to the boat, had settled on a sofa, and the complainant had fallen asleep. Mr McManus had left the area to sleep elsewhere. The complainant's encounter with the man in the bar (the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced) did not take place ""at or about the time"" of the events giving rise to the charge. Several hours intervened.

[80] The fourth error concerned the application of sub-s (4)(a)(ii). It lay in the conclusion that the two events (that is, the meeting with the stranger and the complainant's sexual interest in him, and the alleged offence) ""form[ed] part of a connected set of circumstances"". The only connection between the events was the presence of the respondent, the complainant, and Mr McManus throughout the evening. There was no relevant connection between the complainant's asserted interest in the stranger and the circumstances in which the offence allegedly was committed by the respondent.


	
	What is relied on in the present case are text messages showing the complainant engaging in sexual banter the day after the alleged assaults, and DNA evidence suggesting other sexual activity within days of the assault alleged. It is difficult to see, in view of Simpson J’s analysis in Burton how the evidence could be relevant in the first instance. It is precisely the sort of evidence that s 293 was designed to exclude. Even if the evidence of Dr Houston is additionally considered to provide some other explanation for the bruising, arguably making the evidence relevant, neither limb of paragraph (4)(a) is satisfied. In a similar analysis to the position in Burton at [79], much occurred between the events complained of and the subsequent text messages.
	
	
	More particularly, even allowing for what Basten JA said in GEH at [13] that in some circumstances the temporal element in (a)(i) and the relationship element in (a) (ii) should be read together, it cannot be said that there is any connection between the events complained of and the matters sought to be introduced by the appellant to enable (a)(ii) to be satisfied in the present case.
	
	
	In Baden Cram the complainant had consensual sex with another man earlier on the same night at the same party. The accused sought to introduce that evidence in reliance (inter alia) on s 293(4)(a) to provide an alternative explanation for an injury alleged by the complainant to have resulted from the non-consensual intercourse. Hulme DCJ said:
	


[12] He first contends that the evidence of the sexual activity with N forms ""part of a connected set of circumstances in which the prescribed sexual offence was committed"". That is the exception in s293(4)(a). In my view the only relevant connection between the two circumstances is that they occurred on the same night. It is more a matter of coincidence than relevant connection.


	
	In the present case, what the Appellant relies upon is the presence of the DNA and text messages on the day following the assaults which are said to suggest that the complainant may have been visited by a person with whom she was communicating by text messages and who might have been a boyfriend or someone with whom she was having some sort of sexual relationship.
	
	
	As the trial judge noted in her reasons for her ruling, it was not clear what the DNA was from (it was not from the Appellant), the bra was not taken to be examined for three or four days after the assaults and the DNA could have been present for up to five days. Further, it is pure speculation from the text messages 2202 to 2217 that anyone in fact visited the complainant, let alone had sex with her. Those messages were exchanged between 8.46pm on 15 April and 9.23 am on 16 April. The evidence was that the complainant went that night, somewhere between 9.30 and 10.30 pm to the hospital to be examined.
	
	
	Unlike some other cases where s 293 has been considered (Morgan, GEH, Tubou and even Baden Cram) where other sexual intercourse was admitted by the Complainant, there was no such admission in the present case. All that can be said here is that it is likely there was some sexual activity within about 4 to 5 days because of the presence of the DNA. The evidence that it occurred the following night was pure speculation. In those circumstances, the temporal element in (4)(a)(i) is not established.
	
	
	The submissions that the relationship element in (a)(ii) is established because the text messages continued over a few days must be rejected. In the first place, it is not established that the sexual activity suggested by the DNA was related to the text messages or took place at some point in the midst of them. Secondly, the mere fact that the Complainant was continuing to send text messages does not make any later sexual activity connected to the events associated with the assault. The relationship element in (a)(ii) is not established.
	
	
	If I am wrong about these matters, it is necessary to consider the tailpiece to the subsection.
	
	
	The trial judge’s rulings were, if anything, favourable to the Appellant. He was permitted to cross-examine the complainant about other vigorous sexual activity and about certain text messages suggesting that she had not been sexually assaulted, without the full context of those messages being before the jury which would show multiple early complaints. DNA evidence suggesting sexual activity with a person or persons other than the Appellant was before the jury. The trial advocate was not permitted to ask the doctor if the bruising was consistent with the sexual assaults alleged. On the other hand Dr Houston was asked by the Appellant if the bruising could have come from consensual vigorous sexual activity and she said that it was possible.
	
	
	All of these matters meant that the probative value of what was sought to be asked was slight indeed. It was suggested that Dr Houston’s evidence might have been different if she had been provided with the other evidence in circumstances where the complainant had denied any other vigorous sexual activity. However, she had already admitted that it was possible the bruising could have come from consensual vigorous sexual activity.
	
	
	Mr James QC submitted that the Appellant should have been able to put to the complainant that the bruising arose from other consensual sexual activity in which she engaged at or about the time of the alleged assaults and that the bruising had not been caused by the Appellant. However, the complainant denied the former proposition which was allowed to be put to her. Further she gave evidence that the bruising was not present before the assaults.
	
	
	Where the probative value was so slight, it was easily outweighed by any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer. The tailpiece to the subsection is not satisfied.
	


Section 293(6)


	
	For this subsection to apply it would need to be shown that it had been disclosed or implied in the prosecution case that the complainant had or had not taken part in sexual activity, and that the accused might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined in relation to the disclosure.
	
	
	The Appellant relied upon what was contained in Dr Houston’s report under the heading “7. Answers to direct questions” where the complainant told Dr Houston that she had not had sexual intercourse within 7 days of the examination (see [42] above). The Crown had notified the solicitors for the accused on 30 August 2013 that the Crown would not be relying on that statement.
	
	
	In circumstances where the Crown stated that it did not intend to rely on the statement it cannot be said the information was (or would be, since this was a motion prior to the trial) disclosed in the case for the prosecution. In Spratt v Director of Public Prosecutions [2010] NSWSC 355 part of the complainant’s statement provided evidence of her relationship and sexual experience with a person (not the accused) prior to the alleged sexual offence committed by the accused. Sometime after the statement was served the DPP notified the defence that the Crown would not rely on those parts of the statement dealing with that sexual experience of the complainant. The accused argued that the evidence had been disclosed in the case for the prosecution and that it, therefore fell within the exception in s 293(6).
	
	
	Hidden J said:
	


[15] …Section 293(6) is concerned with the case presented by the prosecution at a hearing, whether in committal proceedings or at trial. Regardless of the nature of the case, it is not uncommon for the prosecution, in discharge of its duty of disclosure to the defence, to serve material which is not admissible in its case and upon which it does not propose to rely. That material does not become part of the prosecution case simply because it was served.


	
	A similar view was reached by Giles JA (with whom James and Harrison JJ agreed) in Rolfe v R [2007] NSWCCA 155 at [55] and by Hulme DCJ in Baden Cram at [19]. 
	
	
	I agree with the view expressed in these cases. The Crown has an obligation to disclose relevant evidence. However, not all of that evidence may be led by the Crown. The concern about unfair prejudice to the accused if not permitted to cross-examine on the material disclosed or implied in sub-s(5)(b) points strongly to the conclusion that “case for the prosecution” is a reference to the case presented or to be presented in court and not a reference to anything referred to in material provided by the prosecution. Where, as here, the Crown has said that material will not be relied upon, s 296(6) is not engaged.
	
	
	Despite those matters the jury distinguished amongst the counts charged in a way that is explicable by bruising in relation to each of the three counts that resulted in guilty verdicts. The acquittal in relation to Count 6 is explicable by the nature of what was alleged. The Appellant engaged in an act of masturbation outside the car in which the complainant was seated. The jury could easily have concluded that there was no act of indecency “towards a person” being the complainant. The other two counts where not guilty verdicts were recorded involved word against word with no supporting evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied from examining the evidence and the summing up that there was evidence on which the jury could reasonably have convicted the Appellant whilst at the same time acquitting him on counts 2, 3 and 6. The trial judge was not in error in excluding the evidence sought to be admitted by the Appellant involving cross-examination of Dr Houston regarding her history taking, Ms Wedervang about her findings, and of the Complainant regarding the text messages concerning sexual banter and other sexual activity involving her.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal in relation to Ground 2 but dismiss the appeal on grounds 1 and 2.
	


Appeal against sentence

Ground 3 – The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	The overall sentence was a non-parole period of three years with an additional term of three years. That was in fact the sentence imposed for count 5 with the sentences for counts 1 and 4 being fixed terms of imprisonment that were made wholly concurrent with the sentence for count 5. The appeal against sentence was, as senior counsel for the Appellant acknowledged, really a complaint against the sentence for count 5 although he suggested that the imposition of the two fixed terms for counts 1 and 4 might have had the effect of increasing the sentence on count 5.
	
	
	No complaint was made about the Sentencing Judge’s approach in principle either to her factual findings, her assessment of the medical evidence concerning the Appellant, or her approach to the sentencing in principle.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that, while there was no hierarchy of offences covered by the sections the offending was at a reasonably low level. The Appellant further submitted that an examination of other cases raised the equal justice principle of consistency in sentencing.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that while the Appellant did not cause substantial harm to the complainant bruises were occasioned in the course of the commission of counts 1, 4 and 5. Furthermore, a degree of force was used. The Sentencing Judge accepted that there was no gratuitous violence nor acts of degradation nor humiliation. However, the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant expressed her lack of consent both by words and action until such time as she ceased struggling because the Appellant would not stop. Her Honour said that actual knowledge as to lack of consent was objectively more serious than a reckless state of mind.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that there was no hierarchy as to the seriousness of the various kinds of intercourse recognised by the law but said that the nature of the intercourse and its duration were relevant to a consideration of objective seriousness.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the pre-sentence report stated that the Appellant’s risk of re-offending was low to medium. Her Honour thought that his age, his lack of record and considerable family support meant that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable to good.
	
	
	Although general deterrence was an important factor in sentencing for sexual offences, her Honour did not consider that specific deterrence had any significant role to play given her finding that the offending by the Appellant was an aberration.
	
	
	Her Honour noted the standard non-parole period but said that she had determined that there were reasons for the imposition of a non-parole period less than was the standard non-parole period prescribed. These matters related primarily to the nature of the sexual intercourse and the absence of gratuitous violence. Count 5 was not, however, properly characterised as being at the very bottom of the scale of relative seriousness given that the Appellant had actual knowledge of her lack of consent and the fact the act of intercourse was of a relatively long duration.
	
	
	Her Honour found that special circumstances were present.
	
	
	As I have said, the Appellant effectively received a non-parole period of three years with an additional term of three years for two indecent assaults and an act of sexual intercourse without consent that was not at the bottom of the scale of relative seriousness. As noted earlier, the maximum penalty for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent was 14 years’ imprisonment and there was a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	Although the offending was opportunistic the guilty verdicts encompassed two separate occasions on the night concerned. The first was down near the wharf and the second was some little time later in the car. The complainant had made it clear to the Appellant at the wharf that his advances were unwelcome. Despite that, he acted a second time when they were in the car and notwithstanding the complainant’s protests about what constituted an indecent assault the Appellant persisted in his actions resulting in sexual intercourse over a period of ten minutes during which the Complainant again protested.
	
	
	The Appellant drew attention to a number of cases which were said to be comparable and provided a schedule of other cases involving offences against s 61I. There is a wide variation, as one would expect, in the sentences imposed, with the sentences tending to show an increase after a standard non-parole period was provided for the offence concerned. It cannot, however, be said that the sentence imposed even for count 5 alone is out of the range of sentences shown in the schedule. Even if it could be said to be on the high side it is within the appropriate range. If any adjustment were made to the sentence for count 5 there would need to be an adjustment in terms of concurrency and accumulation for one or more of the indecent assault offences: s 7(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	In my opinion, it cannot be said that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust (Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357) and is not therefore manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal in respect of Ground 2 and in respect of the sentence.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	SCHMIDT J:    I agree with Davies J.

2766678,R v Simmons (No 8) [2015] NSWSC 627,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	For the last 14 weeks Tony Simmons (who I will refer to as “the offender”), has been on trial on an indictment containing two counts. First, the murder of Andrew Russell between 1 and 20 June 2009 at Sofala and, second, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm of Mr Russell on 20-21 March 2009 at Kelso.
	
	
	On arraignment he pleaded not guilty to count one and guilty to count two. The trial was by judge alone and yesterday I found the offender not guilty of murder: see R v Simmons (No 7) [2015] NSWSC 574. On his plea of guilty, and on the evidence adduced in the trial, he was convicted of the count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In the course of the trial, I heard various accounts of the assault. These came from the offender himself, his girlfriend (Jodi Biles), a friend of the offender (Jakob Peters), a neighbour (Joanne Skinner), and the step-sister of Mr Russell (Kiara White). Ms White provided a version to the police completely at odds with the version she gave in evidence. I suspect that there may be truth in both versions of events.
	
	
	Based on all of that evidence, my findings as to the facts of the assault are these:
	



	
	In March 2009 the offender, his girlfriend and two of their children were living with the victim at 9 Cripps Place Kelso. The victim was the leaseholder of those premises.
	
	
	On 20 March 2009 the offender was at a party and the victim was at home with Jodi Biles, the children and his step-sister, Kiara White, who was visiting.
	
	
	At some stage the victim called police complaining that his sister was refusing to leave. The radio operator said that he appeared to be drunk. A Constable Flynn attended at around 10.40 pm. The victim was asleep. She spoke to Ms Biles and Ms White. Then she left.
	
	
	At some stage, probably after that attendance by the police, the victim got into a heated argument with Jodi Biles. This resulted in a physical altercation during which Ms Biles punched the victim and the victim fell face first on to a concrete path in front of the house. He suffered an injury to his face, an abrasion or similar. It was not serious. The victim locked Jodi out of the house and the children were still inside.
	
	
	Jodi called the offender who returned home. There was a minor physical altercation between the offender and the victim. The offender left to return to the party. He warned or threatened the victim, “if anything else happens, it will be on.”
	
	
	Some time after that, Ms Biles again called the offender complaining about the victim's conduct. He returned home. There was then a fight but, according to Ms Biles, the offender was doing most of the fighting. He repeatedly punched the victim and then kicked him and I infer from the evidence that he kicked him when he was on the ground.
	
	
	Police attended again in the early hours of the morning. The victim had severe swelling and bleeding to his face. The offender had grazing to his knuckles and he told police that that resulted from punching the house. The victim was taken away in an ambulance.
	



	
	As a result of the assault the victim suffered a number of injuries:
	



	
	Multiple bruises all over his body;
	
	
	Tenderness to his upper spine;
	
	
	Bruising to his upper arm and shoulder blade;
	
	
	Trauma (but no fractures) to his left knee and elbow; and
	
	
	Prominent soft tissue swelling (but no fractures) around the face and eyes, particularly the right eye.
	



	
	In addition to the physical injuries occasioned by the victim, the evidence in the trial also showed that Mr Russell also suffered significant emotional scars. He was afraid to return to the premises in Cripps Place and had arranged to move to new assisted housing rather than to return there. In the meantime he was drifting between his father's home and that of his cousin Jamie. The victim was a sickly man who suffered from a severe liver disease and autoimmune hepatitis.
	
	
	I accept that the offender was intervening on behalf of his girlfriend but I do not accept that there was provocation on the part of Mr Russell in the sense that it is a mitigating feature either at common law or under s 21A(3)(c). However I take into account the fact that the offender was called to the scene by Jodi Biles and was motivated to protect her and her children. As far as I can tell that is the only matter that mitigates the criminality to any substantial degree.
	
	
	A significant aggravating feature is the fact that the victim was vulnerable as a result of his ill health. The act of kicking such a man is a particularly cowardly act.
	
	
	Another feature relevant to the proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is the fact that the offence was committed in the victim's home. As I have said, the victim was afraid to return there after the assault. Of course it was also the home of the offender and Ms Biles. Reference was made to a case of EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199 where it was held by RA Hulme J:
	


“It is an aggravating circumstances where an offender intrudes into the home and not where the offender and a victim reside together.""


	
	That matter is not free of controversy and the Court of Criminal Appeal (including his Honour, RA Hulme JA) has said that it may need to re-examine that statement of principle and that it may not accord with the plain words of s 21A(2)(eb): Melbon v R [2013] NSWCCA 2010 at [1]-[2] and [43]-[44]. See also Montero v R [2013] NSW CCA 214 and the comments of Kirby J in Oh v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [40].
	
	
	I do not have to attempt to resolve this issue here as the learned Crown Prosecutor has expressly indicated that it does not rely on the matter as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(eb). However, I do take into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the crime the fact that the victim was in his own home and in a sense had nowhere to which to escape.
	
	
	Weighing up all of those features I assess the objective criminality as being high. It is a serious example of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal record commencing in 2004. There are a number of driving offences, some of which were obviously quite serious and resulted in community service orders and periodic detention. There are also drug offences, a serious dishonesty offence (“break and enter”) and offences of violence. The criminal record continued after the commission of the present offence. That is relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation but is not part of his antecedent (or prior) criminal history.
	
	
	Prior to the present offence he was given a bond under s 10 for destroying property in 2004. In 2005 and 2006 he was fined $800 and $300 for two separate offences of common assault and was also fined $200 for breaching a domestic violence order.
	
	
	Since the commission of this offence he was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond for common assault in July 2009. He breached that bond one month later by committing an offence of on-going supply of drugs and was then sentenced to three years' imprisonment with an 18-month non-parole period.
	
	
	In March of 2011 he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for affray. In July he was sentenced to four months imprisonment for the break and enter.
	
	
	Between September 2012 and January 2013 in the course of the undercover police operation that led to his being charged with murder, the offender expressed a willingness to involve himself in a diverse array of criminal offences. This included [REDACTED]. At one stage he told the undercover officers that he was willing to do anything.
	
	
	The offender's prior convictions disentitle him to leniency. His subsequent offending and willingness to commit offences are relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation. On the evidence available to me I find that his prospects of rehabilitation are poor. I do not go further and find that his record is an aggravating feature in the sense that I can positively find that he represents a future danger to the community.
	
	
	There is a good deal of evidence before me that the offender has been a user of drugs for many years. I am told that he has undertaken urine testing while in gaol. I suspect that if he remains free of drugs he may have some prospects of living a useful life.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the offender has shown any remorse at all for his conduct towards Mr Russell. The evidence of his conversations with undercover police suggests that he has no remorse at all.
	
	
	There has been a substantial delay between the time of the commission of the offence and today's sentencing proceeding. Delay is often an important feature of the sentencing exercise. However in the circumstances of the present case delay cannot properly be considered as a mitigating feature. For one thing there is no evidence of rehabilitation in the intervening period. The evidence is to the contrary. The offender committed further offences including offences of violence after this offence and has been on remand since January 2013. There is no evidence of his progress while in custody. More significantly, the reason for the delay is that the offender lied to police and allowed his then girlfriend, Jodi Biles, to take the blame for the assault. In fairness to the offender, it seems that Ms Biles hatched this plan herself but the offender was more than happy to go along with it.
	
	
	On 24 July 2009 the offender made a statement in full knowledge that Mr Russell had gone missing. The offender deliberately misled the police as to his involvement in the assault. He said that he had only hit Mr Russell once. He was more than happy to let his girlfriend take the blame.
	
	
	I must take into account the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 199 (NSW) and I do so.
	
	
	It is conceded on behalf of the offender that the only appropriate sentencing option is one of full time imprisonment. I considered suspending the sentence taking into account the lengthy period of pre-sentence custody and the offender's need for supervision on release. The benefit would be a longer period of supervision in the community than that that would occur if a full time gaol sentence is imposed.
	
	
	However, a suspended sentence can only be imposed if the total sentence is less than two years. Further, I have concluded that a suspended sentence would fail to reflect the need for denunciation of the offender's conduct and deterrence of other offenders. This was an example of alcohol-fuelled violence and such conduct must be deterred.
	
	
	Accordingly I have concluded that the only appropriate sentence is one of full time imprisonment. I have considered the statistics provided by the Judicial Commission with the circumspection that is required and I am of the view that the sentence that I propose falls within the appropriate range that is disclosed by those statistics.
	
	
	It is difficult to assess the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty in circumstances where both parties have at all times been focussed on the more serious charge and where the evidence relating to the assault was always going to be led in the trial for murder. However, the plea was not entered until the matter came to the Supreme Court. As I understand it the plea was entered on arraignment. That plea disclosed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice but its utilitarian value was not high. I will allow a discount of around ten per cent. The parties, both of whom are represented by extremely experienced counsel, agree that that is about right in all of the circumstances.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on the murder charge on 16 January 2013. However, he was not charged with the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence until 26 July 2013. It is appropriate that the sentence commences on that date. Again both experienced counsel agree that that is an appropriate commencement date for the sentence.
	
	
	I consider that a starting point of three years is appropriate taking into account all of those factors. Allowing for a discount of just under 10% for the plea of guilty, the total sentence will be one of two years and nine months. Making a very slight adjustment to the usual 75% ratio required by s 44 by way of rounding, the non-parole period will be two years. I do not think it is necessary but, if it is, I make a finding of special circumstances under s 44 to enable that slight rounding down to occur.
	
	
	Mr Simmons, for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm I sentence you to a non-parole period of two years commencing on 26 July 2013 and expiring on 25 July 2015. There will be a balance of term of nine months expiring on 25 April 2016. In accordance with s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I direct that you are to be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	ADDENDUM: In revising this ex tempore judgment since imposing sentence I realised that I did not refer the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty under s 59 Crimes Act 1900 is 5 years. I confirmed this in the course of submissions and took it into account in the synthesis of legal and factual matters relevant to the appropriate starting point for the sentence.

2766690,Kentwell v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 96,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Rothman J in draft. In these circumstances, I can state my reasons and conclusion relatively briefly.
	
	
	Rothman J has set out the charges on which the applicant was sentenced, the sentences imposed and the summary of the facts surrounding the offences, contained in the judgment of Bellew J in Kentwell v R [2013] NSWCCA 266 (first appeal) at [11]-[31], Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing.
	
	
	Although this Court in the first appeal found that each ground of appeal was made out, an extension of time to seek leave to appeal was refused as, in the Court’s opinion, the errors in sentencing did not result in substantial injustice.
	
	
	On appeal, the High Court held that the approach taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal was erroneous: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 (High Court judgment). The Court stated that the discretion to extend time was to be exercised by consideration of what the interests of justice required in a particular case. The plurality held that in an application for an extension of time based on an asserted “Muldrock error”, it was an error to introduce a consideration of whether refusal of the application would occasion substantial injustice. Further, it was emphasised that the principle of finality had no part to play in considering whether the discretion to grant an extension of time should be exercised: High Court judgment at [30]-[32].
	
	
	The plurality stated that courts should refrain from formulating guidelines for the exercise of the discretion to extend the time for seeking leave to appeal: High Court judgment at [30]. However, the High Court also held that the applicant’s prospect of success, should the application be granted, was relevant to the determination of the interests of justice in such an application: High Court judgment at [32].
	
	
	The High Court emphasised that upon the error being identified, the task of this Court under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), in considering whether some other sentence was warranted in law, was to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. The plurality accepted the remarks of Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [19], that the task of the Court was to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, “taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides”: High Court judgment at [40]-[42]. The conclusion of the plurality on this question was in the following terms:
	


“[43]   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.” [internal citations omitted]

Should an extension of time be granted


	
	In my opinion, an extension of time to seek leave to appeal should be granted. I agree with the conclusions and reasons of Bellew J in the first appeal that each of the grounds of appeal were made out. However, I do not consider it necessary for the purpose of considering this issue to determine whether the errors the subjects of Grounds 2 and 3 were or were not immaterial: first appeal at [45], [51]. In particular, I agree with the conclusion of Bellew J that the mental illness suffered by the applicant rendered him “an inappropriate vehicle through which to deter others from similar offending”: first appeal at [65].
	
	
	Further, as was made clear in the High Court judgment, the delay in bringing the application for leave to appeal was through no fault of the applicant: at [14]-[16]. Indeed, the circumstances in which the application comes to be determined, some six years after the applicant was sentenced, tends to weigh in favour of granting leave rather than against it.
	
	
	Finally, as pointed out by Rothman J, the applicant has taken substantial steps towards rehabilitation during the period of his imprisonment: below pars [94]-[95].
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is appropriate in my opinion that leave be granted.
	
	
	As Rothman J has pointed out, the application for an extension of time was not opposed by the Crown.
	


Disposal


	
	As I have indicated, I agree, for the reasons stated by Bellew J in the first appeal, that the grounds of appeal have been made out. It is thus necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Rothman J has dealt with the objective seriousness of the offences, the applicant’s subjective circumstances and his rehabilitation since his imprisonment in pars [64]-[81] and [94]-[96] below. I agree with his Honour’s remarks. Further, I am prepared to accept that the removal of the applicant from his natural parents and his consequent difficulty in adjusting to a “white fella’s world” (see the Pre-Sentence Report of Probation and Parole Officer Bryson dated 6 September 2006) is evidence of a deprived background and social disadvantage which may mitigate the sentence, consistent with the principles in Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260 at [53]; Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [37]-[44]; Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; 149 CLR 305 at 326 per Brennan J.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I agree with Rothman J that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. Taking into account the matters to which I have referred to above in par [13], I am of the opinion that the following orders should be made.
	
	
	The orders I would make are as follows:
	



	
	Extend the time for bringing an application for leave to appeal up to and including 28 June 2013.
	
	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on 20 February 2009.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by the District Court on 20 February 2009 on the applicant be quashed and the following sentences be passed in substitution therefor:
	



	
	Count 1: recklessly cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 6 April 2008 and concluding 5 October 2011 with a remainder of term of 18 months concluding 5 April 2013;
	
	
	Count 3: malicious damage, contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, a fixed term of 1 month to commence 6 April 2008 and conclude 5 May 2008;
	
	
	Count 4: sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 2 April 2010 and concluding 1 April 2014 with a remainder of term of 1 year concluding 1 April 2015;
	
	
	Count 5: assault, contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900, a fixed term of 3 months, commencing 2 April 2010 and concluding 1 July 2010;
	
	
	Count 7: sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 6 August 2011 and concluding 5 August 2015 with a remainder of term of 4 years concluding 5 August 2019.
	



	
	The overall sentence is imprisonment of 11 years and 4 months consisting of an overall non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months, commencing 6 April 2008 and concluding 5 August 2015, with a remainder of term of a further 4 years concluding 5 August 2019.
	
	
	The applicant is first eligible for parole on 6 August 2015.
	



	
	ROTHMAN J: Philip Charles Kentwell, hereinafter the appellant, seeks an extension of time to appeal sentences imposed on him. If the extension of time were granted, the appellant seeks leave to appeal and to appeal the sentence. The extension of time, the leave to appeal and the appeal were heard concurrently.
	
	
	It is necessary to set out the unfortunate litigious history of this matter. On 20 February 2009, the appellant was sentenced by Johnstone DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta for a number of offences. The sentence for each offence occurred after a guilty verdict by a jury. For one offence with which the appellant was charged (Count 6), the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	The charges and sentence imposed were as follows:
	


“Count 1: Recklessly causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 10 years and the standard non-parole period for which is 4 years’ imprisonment and for which the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years to commence on 6 April 2008 and to expire on 5 April 2012;

Count 2: Was an alternative Count to Count 1 and therefore does not need consideration.

Counts 3 and 6: Malicious damage contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 5 years and as a result of the not guilty verdict in relation to Count 6, the appellant was sentenced only for Count 3 to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month to commence on 6 April 2008 and to expire on 5 May 2008;

Count 4 and 7: Sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 14 years and the standard non-parole period for which is 7 years’ imprisonment, and for which the appellant was sentenced, in relation to Count 4, to a fixed term of imprisonment of 7 years to commence on 6 August 2008 and to expire on 5 August 2015, and in relation to Count 7 a term of imprisonment of 11 years comprised of a non-parole period of 7 years to commence on 6 April 2009 and to expire on 5 April 2016, with a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 5 April 2020;

Count 5: Assault, contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is two years’ imprisonment and for which the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 months’ imprisonment to commence on 6 December 2008 and to expire on 5 March 2009.”

   (ROS)


	
	Initially, there was no appeal against sentence. It is appropriate to note, at this juncture, that the sentencing remarks relied upon the approach to standard non-parole period arising from the judgment of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. No application for leave to appeal was filed within time, although a Notice of Intention to Appeal against Conviction and Sentence was filed and not pursued. The circumstances of that situation are set out in Kentwell v R [2013] NSWCCA 266 at [7] (the first appeal judgment).
	
	
	Following the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, the appellant sought leave to appeal out of time for “Muldrock error”, namely the sentencing judge’s application of the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way, which approach was disapproved in Muldrock. It should be borne in mind that the sentencing judge was, at the time of sentence, bound by the judgment in R v Way. The High Court had earlier refused leave to appeal in R v Way.
	
	
	The application for extension of time came before the Court and was dealt with by judgment dated 14 November 2013: the first appeal judgment. The extension of time was refused. From that judgment the appellant successfully appealed to the High Court of Australia. The order of the High Court of Australia set aside the first appeal judgment and remitted the application for extension of time to the Court for determination.
	


Facts


	
	The first appeal judgment summarised the facts relating to the matter, which summary is taken from the Remarks on Sentence. No issue is taken with the summary, which is in the following terms:
	


“[12] At the time of the offending, the applicant had known the victim for about four years. From about January 2007 they formed an intimate relationship as a result of which the applicant would stay over at the victim’s premises four or five nights per week. In August 2007 the victim made a complaint to the police about the applicant and he was charged with various offences including assault, stealing and contravening a domestic violence order. He was released on bail and thereafter renewed his relationship with the victim.

[13] On the afternoon of 29 October 2007 the applicant went to the victim’s home when he was affected by alcohol. When the victim was in the kitchen making coffee, the applicant approached her from behind and poured liquid over her head. Without warning he then smashed a beer bottle over her head causing her to fall to the floor. As the victim lay on the floor the applicant kicked her several times in the ribs, causing her immediate pain and difficulty breathing. The applicant refused the victim’s request to call an ambulance.

[14] The victim tried to leave the premises and told the applicant she was going to her sister’s. As she walked outside the applicant grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the ground. He then kicked her in the chest area and pulled her back inside. Once inside the applicant again kicked the victim before ordering her to get up.

[15] There then followed an interlude as the applicant tried to comfort the victim, telling her to sit next to him on the couch. The victim did so out of fear but within a short period the applicant started yelling at her and began to throw various objects within his reach including the victim’s mobile phone, remote controls for the television and DVD player, an ash tray and a glass candle holder that smashed at the other end of the room.

[16] When the victim went over and knelt down to pick up the smashed candle holder the applicant again attacked her, hitting her over the head and shoulders with a metal bracket from an air conditioner. The applicant then appeared to calm down and sat in the lounge room. Because she was in fear of the applicant, the victim did not leave the premises or contact the police. She continued to experience difficulties with her breathing, her head was sore, she was aching and she felt nauseated. She went to the bathroom and showered before getting into bed.

[17] The applicant then called out to the victim from the lounge room asking if she wanted a “doorey”, which meant sex. The victim said no. Over the course of the next few hours the applicant repeatedly requested sex, and the victim repeatedly refused.

[18] The applicant then came into the bedroom. The victim again told him that she did not want to have sex as she was in too much pain from the earlier assaults. The applicant said:

Fucking girls only have to spread their fucking legs. It won’t hurt.

[19] The victim did not want to have sex with the applicant but at this time could see that he was not going to stop his demands. Accordingly, she said to him:

If you do it just get it over and done with quickly.

[20] The applicant then removed the victim’s underpants and commenced penile intercourse by penetrating her vagina from behind. The applicant was much larger than the victim and as a consequence, she was affected by his heavy weight and experienced severe pain. She begged the applicant to stop and she started to cry. The applicant allowed her to move into a foetal position but did not stop the intercourse and told her to “stop blubbering”. The applicant continued to have penile/vaginal sexual intercourse until he ejaculated.

[21] After the intercourse had ended, the applicant remained in the bed. The victim attempted to sleep but was unable to do so because of her pain. She did not leave as she was in fear of the applicant and as the night continued her breathing was laboured. The applicant complained that she was making too much noise and told her to “shut up”.

[22] The following morning the applicant awoke at about 7.30 am and asked for sex. The victim replied:

No Didge, I can’t because I can’t do this. You can’t keep doing this to me anymore.

[23] The applicant then left the premises, following which the victim sought treatment from a medical centre. She was diagnosed (without X-Rays being taken) as having fractured ribs and was told to take painkillers. She returned to her home and went back to bed.

[24] On 2 November 2007 the victim saw her General Practitioner. X-Rays taken on that occasion established that she had fractures to her fifth, sixth and seventh right ribs, as well as to her fourth left rib. There was also evidence of trauma to her fifth and sixth left ribs.

[25] Later that same afternoon, the applicant arrived at the victim’s premises with a companion named Nash. The applicant and Nash started drinking in the lounge room and as the applicant became affected by the alcohol he started to accuse the victim of sleeping with Nash. The victim denied this allegation and told Nash to leave. The applicant and the victim sat together on the lounge, at which time the applicant began igniting a cigarette lighter on and off, at one point applying the flame to the victim’s forearm. After she pulled her arm away the applicant began lighting small pieces of paper on the coffee table before beginning to hit the victim whilst calling her a “fucking mole” and a “whore”. He then started to twist her arm, at which time she retreated to the bathroom. The applicant continued to accuse the victim of having “sex with wogs” before telling her to “get her arse out of the bathroom”. The victim went back into the bedroom where the applicant grabbed her and held her up against the wall next to a cupboard.

[26] The applicant then said he wanted something to eat, at which point the victim made a meal for him, before going to bed. The applicant then asked her for sex. The victim repeatedly said she did not want to, telling the applicant she was in too much pain. The applicant responded by saying:

Just spread your legs. That’s all you have to do.

[27] The victim again told the applicant that she was unable to breath properly and that the pain was too much, to which the applicant responded:

You won’t feel it.

[28] Feeling that she had no choice, and although she did not want to have sex with the applicant, the victim said:

Just get it over and done with please and hurry.

[29] The applicant then commenced to have penile vaginal sex with the victim as she lay on her stomach. As he did so, the victim experienced severe pain to her injured ribs and chest, telling the applicant:

I don’t want to do it …. I’ve got broken ribs …. Didge I can’t do this. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t.

[30] The applicant ignored these pleas, and continued until he ejaculated.

[31] On 6 November 2007 the applicant again sought medical attention and on this occasion disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted. She then made a statement to police.”

Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Grounds of Appeal remain as they were when initially filed on 26 June 2013. They are in the following terms:
	


His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120;

His Honour erred by increasing the balance of term and thereby impermissibly increasing the length of the sentence for the s 61I offence on 2 November 2007 to reflect a finding of special circumstances;

His Honour erred in setting a fixed term of imprisonment for the offences which carry a standard non-parole period – the s 35(2) offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and the s 61O offence of sexual intercourse without consent on 29 October 2007;

His Honour erred in his consideration of the psychiatric evidence.


	
	Leaving aside the debate that has occurred as to whether a fixed term represents the non-parole period or the entire sentence, the Court has long held that the combination of s 44(1) and s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires the setting of a non-parole period, in the case of those prescribed offences for which there exists a standard non-parole period. It must be said that, after the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock, there seems a philosophical inconsistency in the exercise of the Court’s sentencing discretion between the approach to be taken to setting a non-parole period for standard non-parole period offences and the prohibition on imposing a fixed sentence for such offences. Nevertheless, the statute prevails over any perceived philosophical inconsistency.
	
	
	Abundant authority is to the effect that a non-parole period must be set for standard non-parole period offences. The construction of the statute to that effect depends upon the express discretion to impose fixed sentences for other offences. The exercise of the sentencing discretion must be “consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies”; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 624 [26]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [27].
	


The Extension of Time


	
	In remitting the application for extension of time to this Court, the High Court held that the discretion to extend time is to be exercised by consideration of what the interests of justice require in the particular case: at [30]. The Court acknowledged that those interests will often pull in different directions. The prospect of success of the appeal should the extension be granted is a relevant factor but the assessment of that prospect does not end with the establishment of error. It also entails consideration of the determination required to be made under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 as to whether, having regard to the material placed before this Court, some other (less severe) sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.
	
	
	The material relied upon by the applicant has persuaded me that the interests of justice require that the extension of time be granted in the present case. Although the delay is lengthy, the reasons for the delay are adequately explained. The sentence imposed entailed specific error, with the result that this Court’s discretion to re-sentence is enlivened. The evidence and submissions relied upon in support of the contention that some other (less serious) sentence is warranted in law are, in my view, such as warrant the grant of an extension of time.
	
	
	In coming to that view, I have taken into account the initial Notice of Intention to Appeal, the unfortunate situation in which the Aboriginal Legal Service considered they were in a conflict of interest and could no longer act, and the refusal of the Legal Aid Commission to grant Legal Aid, which, together, in these circumstances, were the fundamental reasons an appeal was not lodged at an earlier time.
	
	
	Further, there are manifest or identifiable errors in the principles applied on sentence. The foregoing comment is not a criticism of the sentencing judge, who, at least in relation to the alleged Muldrock error, applied the law as it then existed. It is recognition that the High Court in Muldrock restored the appropriate level of flexibility in the sentencing process that, hitherto, may have been confined by the principles applicable under this Court’s construction of the statute in R v Way.
	


Ground 1: Muldrock Error


	
	As was required at the time that the sentencing exercise was undertaken, the sentencing judge applied R v Way.
	
	
	The importance of the principle established by the High Court in Muldrock should not be underestimated. Error has occurred of the kind identified in Muldrock. The sentencing judge used the standard non-parole period for offences, for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed, as the starting point for the sentence to be imposed and added or subtracted for various factors. That approach was, in hindsight, an error. The ground of appeal is made out.
	


Ground 2: The Misuse of Special Circumstances to Lengthen the Head Sentence 


	
	The sentencing judge decided that, in relation to the offence in Count 7, special circumstances existed on the basis of the appellant’s psychiatric condition and drug and alcohol abuse. His Honour then determined that the offence itself was mid-range in culpability and set the standard non-parole period of 7 years with a remainder of term that was longer than would have been imposed if the prescribed statutory ratio were applied.
	
	
	As a consequence, counsel for the appellant submits that the finding of special circumstances led to an extension of the balance of term of imprisonment, rather than a reduction in the non-parole period, in order to afford a longer potential parole period.
	
	
	It is an error to use the finding of special circumstances to lengthen the head sentence in order to provide for the potential of an extended period on parole. Special circumstances have greater relevance in circumstances where one is mandated to fix a standard non-parole period, or to fix the statutory ratio for non-parole period to remainder of term, and gives reason for the amelioration of such a restriction. The effect of the finding of special circumstances may, if it be appropriate to give effect to that finding, be used to reduce the non-parole period that would otherwise have been determined. Special circumstances may not be used to lengthen the head sentence, beyond that otherwise considered appropriate.
	
	
	There were a number of aggravating and ameliorating factors associated with this offence and with the other offences, which his Honour outlined. His Honour’s finding that the two offences of sexual intercourse without consent were in “the middle range of objective seriousness” was a finding made prior to the adumbration of the aggravating and mitigating factors that his Honour recited by obvious reference to the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the sentencing judge thereafter (see [35] of the Remarks on Sentence) remarked that there was nothing in the mitigating and aggravating factors that warranted a variation in the standard non-parole period. As a matter of the proper interpretation of his Honour’s Remarks and of that which his Honour intended, his Honour’s sentence on Court 7 was infected by the error described above, namely, using special circumstances to lengthen the head sentence, rather than reduce the non-parole period. This ground of appeal is also made out.
	


Ground 3: The Setting of a Fixed Term of Imprisonment for a Standard Non-Parole Period Offence


	
	I have already remarked on a possible philosophical inconsistency between continuing a restriction in a sentencing judge’s capacity to impose a fixed term of imprisonment for an offence that carries a standard non-parole period and the flexibility that is required in the sentencing process, as emphasised by the High Court in Muldrock and Markarian.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the discretion reposed in a sentencing judge must be exercised in accordance with the statutory regime, regardless of the judge’s view of the appropriateness of the regime.
	
	
	On the basis of authority of this Court, it was inconsistent with the combined effect of the provisions of s 44(1) and s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to impose a fixed sentence for an offence for which a standard non-parole period has been prescribed. As a consequence, there is error in the process of fixing that sentence and this ground of appeal has been made out.
	


Ground 4: The Consideration of the Psychiatric Evidence


	
	His Honour below analysed the evidence before him.
	
	
	In particular his Honour referred to the two reports of Dr Allnutt of 11 September 2008 and 19 February 2009. He quoted, at some length, from each report.
	
	
	As is correct, his Honour noted that the opinion of the psychiatrist was entirely dependent on the psychiatrist’s acceptance of that which the offender had told him. His Honour expressed a degree of scepticism as to the truth of those statements.
	
	
	Having done so, his Honour, nevertheless, took Dr Allnutt’s reports and opinion “at face value”, because of Dr Allnutt’s renowned reputation as a respected forensic psychologist. However, his Honour took the view that the offender’s medical condition did not justify his behaviour and did not have any connection with the sexual offences. His Honour was entitled to come to that view.
	
	
	I note that for mental illness to be an ameliorating factor in sentence, the illness need not be causative or connected to the commission of the offences; it need only be relevant to moral culpability or such as to diminish the appropriateness of the offender as a vehicle for general deterrence or denunciation. In the first appeal, the Court upheld this ground. I am not so convinced that the ground is made out, but in the circumstances of the other errors, this ground could have no effect on the result of the appeal. Whether the ground is made out depends on the manner in which the sentencing judge utilised the lack of connection and his Honour’s comments seem to disclose some ambivalence in that regard. It is unnecessary to deal with the ground further.
	


Consideration of the Appeal 


	
	There is identifiable error in the sentencing process, based upon that which is stated in the Remarks on Sentence. Those errors include at least the application of the principles in R v Way, as distinct from the principles later established in Muldrock; an increase in the length of the head sentence on account of special circumstances, resulting in a lengthier term of imprisonment being imposed for one offence; and the setting of a fixed term of imprisonment for an offence which carried a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal do not suggest that there is manifest excess. Nor do the grounds of appeal criticise the sentencing judge’s application of the principles of totality or suggest manifest error in the application of those principles. Nevertheless, there is identifiable error conceded by the Crown and, subject to the grant of leave to appeal and the effect of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, re-sentencing should occur.
	
	
	The appellant is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with law and a person who is serving a current period of imprisonment is entitled to know that the period of imprisonment is authorised by law.
	
	
	While I do not suggest that the foregoing would always determine an application for an extension of time in which to appeal a sentence, given the disclosed errors and the interests of justice, it is sufficient to warrant the grant of an extension of time to appeal against the sentence imposed on the appellant in this case and I would propose that the Court grant the extension of time for which the appellant applies. The Crown, in this appeal, does not oppose the extension of time.
	


The operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912


	
	As stated, subject to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and the grant of leave to appeal, given that the extension of time is to be granted, re-sentencing must occur. In that context, the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act needs to be reiterated.
	
	
	In Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284, Spigelman CJ, with whom Latham J expressly concurred and with whom Kirby J, at least implicitly, concurred, discussed the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The Chief Justice said:
	


“[8] The dominant and active verbs in s 6(3) are both in the present tense, ie if the Court of Criminal Appeal ‘is of opinion’ and ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law’. The employment of the past tense in the phrase ‘should have been passed’ is distinctly subsidiary. It is employed in order to reflect the fact that, when the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes, it does so with effect from the date of the original sentence.

[9] This interpretation is consistent with the reference in s 6(3) to s 5(1). That section permits an appeal ‘against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction’. The appeal is from the sentence that has been passed by the sentencing judge. However, the reference in s 6(3) should not be understood as saying ‘should have been passed by the sentencing judge’. It should be understood as an institutional reference, ie ‘should have been passed by the Court’.

[10] When the Court of Criminal Appeal turns its mind to forming the opinion which s 6(3) requires, it must do so by reference to the facts as they exist at that time, insofar as the Court permits evidence of those facts to be placed before the Court.”


	
	I, respectfully, agree with the conclusion of Spigelman CJ. The pluperfect subjunctive phrase “should have been determined” denotes an act completed prior to the point in the past to which reference is given or implicit. The subjunctive mood denotes the hypothetical nature of the action. The use of the present tense in the phrases “is of opinion” and “is warranted” renders the pluperfect subjunctive phrase subsidiary, as Spigelman CJ noted.
	
	
	It is this Court’s current opinion as to whether a lesser sentence is warranted that is operative and required. That opinion must be based on the evidence before the Court at the time the opinion is formed. The use of the word “is” in each operative phrase emphasises that approach, particularly because the word “if” ordinarily occasions the use of the subjunctive mood. The legislature’s deliberate use of “is”, instead of the subjunctive “were”, or somewhat awkwardly “be”, emphasises that present tense, non-hypothetical aspect.
	
	
	In other words, once the Court has granted leave to appeal and found error by the court below, the concluding words of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act require the Court to determine whether, on the correct application of the law and on the facts as we now know them to be (including any additional facts tendered for sentencing purposes), a lesser sentence “is warranted”, in which circumstance that lesser sentence “should have been determined” and should now be imposed.
	
	
	In Baxter, Spigelman CJ discussed some conflicting authority, or arguably conflicting authority, and made it clear (as have a number of other judgments of this Court) that the test in relation to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is not “manifest excess” and the discretion that is exercised under the provision requires a consideration of “the full range of matters that inform the sentencing discretion”: Baxter at [15].
	
	
	In concurring with the reasons of Spigelman CJ, Latham J referred to comments of the Court in some cases as to the necessity to have “material error”. Her Honour made it clear that a proper analysis of the authorities clarified that “materiality” in that sense meant an error that could possibly affect the result: Baxter at [83].
	
	
	In doing so, her Honour referred to the passage from R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353 in which Sperling J (with whom Giles JA and Levine J agreed) referred to an error “which cannot have made any material difference to the result”. In that sense, Latham J referred to a “material error” being one that “has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, regardless of whether it can be demonstrated that the error has in fact influenced the sentencing outcome”: Baxter at [83].
	
	
	Once error of the kind to which the High Court referred in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 is identified (or manifest), the only question is whether the error is “formal or trivial or immaterial”: R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 at [56] (Simpson J with whom Johnson and Rothman JJ agreed).
	
	
	In the submissions before the Court in these proceedings, the appellant referred to “technical error”, a term which, in my view, imports even greater uncertainty and ambiguity. The operation of the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is an exception to the orders that would otherwise be required and is part of the “resentencing” process, by allowing the Court, in presently exercising its sentencing discretion, not to alter the sentence already imposed.
	
	
	Nevertheless, there will be cases in which error is identified which could not possibly affect the result. I decline to call them “technical” errors and I prefer, given the comments in Baxter and the comments of the High Court in Kentwell, not to call them “immaterial”. In my view, where error is disclosed, it is only when an effect on the outcome is impossible that error can be disregarded and, on that ground, leave refused.
	


Leave to Appeal 


	
	In my view, if error were identified, the effect of which could not possibly have affected the result, then the proper course is to deny leave to appeal. Once leave is granted, then the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, would require the quashing of the sentence and the passing of another sentence in substitution therefor, unless, in the re-sentencing exercise, the Court were to come to the view that no less severe sentence is warranted in law. In so doing, the Court has regard to the present circumstances, rather than those before the sentencing judge at the time that error occurred.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, and the quality and nature of the errors that have occurred in the sentencing process, it could not be said that these errors are immaterial (as that term was used by Latham J above) or technical (as the term was used by the appellant in his submissions). Leave should be granted and re-sentencing is required.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	The principles to be applied on sentencing are well-established and the purposes well-known. The provisions of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act reflect the common law principles as to the objectives of sentencing. Those objectives include: ensuring that an offender is adequately punished for the offence committed; general deterrence, being the imposition of an appropriate sentence on this offender in order to discourage others from engaging in such criminal conduct; specific deterrence, being the prevention of this and other crimes by this offender; protection of the community from the offender; promotion of the rehabilitation of the offender; the rendering of the offender accountable for his actions; denunciation of the conduct giving rise to the offence; and recognition of the harm done to the victim of the crime, the victim’s family and the community: see s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. The foregoing are guideposts to the appropriate sentence, which often point in different directions.
	
	
	As is clear from the statements of principle above, the Court at this stage is required to determine for itself the objective and subjective circumstances that apply to the offence and the appellant and determine an appropriate sentence. Because the exercise of discretion below is vitiated by error, the sentence under appeal carries no significance in that re-sentencing process. The objective circumstances of the offending have already been summarised. Most of the subjective circumstances were set out in the Remarks on Sentence and summarised in the first appeal judgment.
	
	
	Before embarking upon an analysis of the subjective circumstances, it should be stressed that the offending was extremely serious, involving as it did serious sexual offences committed in a domestic situation, together with additional acts of violence. Each of the contraventions of s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (sexual intercourse without consent knowing that she was not consenting) is a serious offence committed in circumstances of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm by the breaking of the complainant’s ribs. However, that circumstance is the subject of a separate charge and care must be exercised not to “double-count” that effect.
	
	
	The s 61I offences were each mid-range, the malicious destruction of property was a low range offence and the assault (count 5) was also a low-range offence. I also accept that the offence under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act (count 1), being the reckless causing of grievous bodily harm by breaking the complainant’s ribs, was mid-range for that offence. Taken together, the criminal conduct was serious and required full-time custodial sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	Moreover, these offences were committed while the appellant was on conditional liberty, which increases the weight that ordinarily would be given to specific deterrence. The appellant has a lengthy criminal record and has been imprisoned on prior occasions.
	
	
	As a consequence of that last mentioned factor, the appellant is not entitled to the leniency that might otherwise be shown to a first offender. Otherwise, the criminal history does not reflect offences of the kind with which the appellant was here charged and is to be sentenced. The criminal history does not point starkly to a need for specific deterrence of this kind of criminal activity. Ultimately, the criminal history cannot lead to the imposition of a sentence which does not proportionately reflect the gravity of the offence in question: Veen v The Queen (No 2) at 477.
	
	
	Since the original sentence proceedings, the subjective circumstances of the appellant have altered. By affidavit of 18 February 2015, the appellant refers to his undertaking of the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Programme (VOTP), which he has been successfully completed. Further, the applicant has not been charged with any breaches of prison discipline and has been treated, medically, for the schizophrenia, of which psychosis there was previous evidence.
	
	
	While in prison, the appellant has undergone employment training and also works on artwork and paintings, which he has taken up since his incarceration.
	
	
	In the course of the affidavit, the appellant said:
	


“[15] My children are the most important people in my life. They live with their mother, Barbara. It is now almost seven years since I have seen them. Luciana is now seven years old and Ruby is twelve. I have kept in contact with them by telephone. I still speak with them on Saturdays and Sundays when they stay at their Nonna’s home. I also write them letters. I look forward to the day I am released on parole and can see them again.

[16] I want my children to know me. I grew up deprived of knowledge about my natural parents, my brothers and sisters and my parent’s Baarkindgi culture. I was taken away and adopted out to a white family when I was 12 months old.

[17] I was able to meet my mother in around 1996. By chance, I had met my cousin in gaol who was able to put me in contact with her. I saw my mother a few times before she died in 2000. I never met my father. My first meeting with his side of my family was when I attended his funeral from custody in 1997.

[18] Both of my parents suffered poor health and died when they were fairly young. My cousin, with whom I had contact for a while, has also now passed away.

[19] I have not felt a part of the Kentwell family for many years and especially since my adoptive mother died in 2007. The Kentwell children do not want contact with me.”


	
	He has been described by prison officers, in their regular reports, as fully engaged in the rehabilitation process, having also undergone the Violent Offenders Maintenance Programme and developed insight into his own previous and current behaviour, which current behaviour is described as “excellent”.
	
	
	Apart from the developments in the subjective factors applying to the appellant, there is little or no challenge to the findings of fact by the sentencing judge, which, to the extent that there is no challenge to those findings, I adopt. It is appropriate to repeat some of the more salient features.
	
	
	The sentencing judge summarised the applicant’s personal circumstances as having been born in Broken Hill to Aboriginal parents and adopted out to a non-Aboriginal family at 12 months of age. The applicant described himself as “a black fella in a white fella’s world” and had trouble in school due to his Aboriginality: (Pre-Sentence Report, Exhibit 4 on Sentence).
	
	
	The Appellant grew up ignorant of his Aboriginal cultural heritage, drank alcohol because he felt out of place at school and has suffered from a drinking problem from the age of 15. He was asked to leave home (being the home of his adoptive parents) when he was 17 years of age due to his drinking and fighting.
	
	
	The applicant attempted suicide in about 2004. Due to contact with a cousin in prison he met his birth mother in 1996. She died in 2000. He never met his biological father, who has died.
	
	
	Further to the foregoing, and as may be obvious from the reference to medication, there are psychiatric reports, in particular from Dr Allnutt of 11 September 2008 and 19 February 2009. The 2008 report refers to the appellant manifesting ongoing auditory hallucinations and ongoing symptoms of a psychosis. At that time, he had no memory of the alleged offences and was reluctant to discuss his mental state. Continuing medication was recommended.
	
	
	By 19 February 2009, little had changed. Dr Allnutt referred to auditory hallucinations, the difficulty in distinguishing between the effects of methamphetamine induced psychosis and schizophrenia and the effect of the drugs giving rise to the persistence of psychotic symptoms.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt, in his 19 February 2009 report, expressed the opinion:
	


“There is evidence to support the conclusion that [the appellant] was experiencing delusional beliefs compounded by auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference which incorporated his girlfriend leading him to form the view that she was being unfaithful to him and that these symptoms were active at the material time that the alleged offence occurred.”


	
	The sentencing judge took the view that the appellant had a history of mental health problems and, although the sentencing judge expressed a degree of scepticism of the symptoms described by the appellant, he accepted Dr Allnutt’s opinion and accepted that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the appellant. The sentencing judge was not prepared to accept that the mental illness was in part causative of the offence. Nor, on one view, was the sentencing judge prepared to give less weight to denunciation and general deterrence on the basis that the appellant was an inappropriate vehicle for each, given his mental illness.
	
	
	The events since the sentencing suggest that the scepticism expressed by the sentencing judge, although understandable, was misplaced. Exercising the discretion now, and given the circumstances of the offender as they are, the appellant is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence.
	
	
	Further, it is my view that the psychiatric issues suffered by the appellant at the time of the offence, particularly the paranoia and hallucinations were, even if not causative of the offences, such as to diminish the appellant’s moral culpability in committing the offences.
	
	
	Lastly, I turn to the issue of the sentencing judge’s treatment of the appellant’s personal background. The sentencing judge, in his Remarks at [32] said:
	


“I am not satisfied that the offender’s Aboriginal background has any relevance to the commission of the offences. I do, however, believe that his Aboriginality is relevant to sentence, and I take it into account in the sentencing process as a mitigating factor in so far the principles in R v Fernando require it.”


	
	The reference to R v Fernando is a reference to the judgment of Wood J, as his Honour then was (R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58). In the judgment at pp 62-63, Wood J summarises a number of factors, derived from prior cases and learned papers, concerning the principles to be applied arising from a deprived or particular kind of background. The judgment in Fernando and subsequent judgments make it clear that the principles apply to any person “irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group”: Fernando at pp 62 of the report.
	
	
	In Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260, Simpson J (with whom Fullerton and RA Hulme JJ agreed) said:
	


“[50] In Fernando, Wood J set out a series of sentencing propositions that have too often been taken to have been designed specifically for Aboriginal offenders. So to approach that decision is to misunderstand Wood J’s intention.

[51] Indeed, Wood J stated this expressly. Proposition (A) and (B) read:

(A) The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group but that does not mean that the sentencing court should ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offenders’ membership of such a group.

(B) The relevance of the Aboriginality of an offender is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but rather to explain or throw light on the particular offence and the circumstances of the offender.

[52] That the Fernando propositions were intended to apply generally was stated in R v Hickey (NSWCCA, 27 September 1994, unreported) and re-stated by Wood J in R v Morgan [2013] NSWCCA 230; 57 NSWLR 533 at [20] and [21].

[53] Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime. Particularly relevant, in the circumstances of that case (and this) is the impact of alcohol addiction or dependence. In the proposition lettered (E), Wood J said:

(E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects.

It is this proposition that senior counsel for the applicant argued was here applicable, but was rejected by the sentencing judge.

[54] By way of response, the Crown argued:

23. The Crown in response submits that, even though the applicant says that his offending is alcohol related, he does not come from a remote part of the community, and he was familiar with the legal system from an early age. In any event, the mitigating effect of being an Aboriginal person loses much of its force, where the offender has committed similar serious offences in the past: R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202.

The Crown went to hypothesise that this applicant had, in fact, been given the benefit of a Fernando approach to sentencing in the past. Examination of the applicant’s history suggests that this is a reasonable inference.

[55] Notwithstanding that, in my opinion this ground has been made out. It was an error for the judge to say that there was “little evidence” to show that the applicant was raised in a community:

the toxic features of which prevented the development of a proper attitude to law abiding behaviour.

[56] The Pre-Sentence Report disclosed an early history of social deprivation, to the extent that, from the age of seven, the applicant was removed from his mother’s care. He has had no relationship with his father. He has had little education. He succumbed to drug and alcohol use as early as 13 years of age. His upbringing was unstable, in part by reason of attempts on the part of his grandmother to deal with his drug and alcohol use.

[57] It is no answer to say that he did not come from “a remote part of the community”; social deprivation, resulting from alcohol consumption (or otherwise) is not confined to remote areas or communities.


	
	The foregoing recitation of principle was expressly approved by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571.
	
	
	There are two aspects to the statement of approach by the sentencing judge that require comment. First, it is not “Aboriginality” that is relevant to sentence as a mitigating factor. That which is relevant is the personal circumstances of the appellant to which his Aboriginal descent may be relevant.
	
	
	Secondly, as Wood J in Fernando, Simpson J in Kennedy and the High Court in Bugmy, all make clear the factors adumbrated by Wood J are a non-exclusive set of factors, derived from previous judgments and learned papers. Fundamentally, they describe circumstances of social deprivation, violence and the like that ameliorate the moral culpability of an offender and allow the Court to understand the circumstances that gave rise to the criminal offending. Those circumstances include reasons for an offender’s recourse to violence and anti-social behaviour.
	
	
	In Fernando, the circumstance that was stressed was a family environment of alcohol abuse and violence. That is not a circumstance that pertains to the appellant. The appellant was, as has been set out, adopted by non-Aboriginal family and was denied knowledge of his culture and was denied an environment that supported him as Baarkindgi.
	
	
	In R v Lewis [2014] NSWSC 1127, I dealt with the sentencing of a person of Aboriginal descent who had been adopted by Caucasian parents and the social exclusion and discrimination occasioned by that factor or as a result of it. Not every person in that situation will suffer in the same way. Mr Lewis did. The appellant did. During the course of the sentencing of Mr Lewis, I said:
	


“[37] The offender (or more accurately his counsel) seeks to rely on the principles summarised by the Court … in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. See the High Court judgment in R v Bugmy [2013] HCA 37 ; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [18] and [36]–[43]. This is not a traditional Fernando case. Those principles are well known and I will not now repeat them. They largely deal with persons, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, from a deprived background where abuse of alcohol and physical abuse are accepted norms of conduct.

[38] The offender’s exposure to such an environment really results, as earlier stated, from his attempt to find a peer group arising from his exclusion from social groups at school and in his neighbourhood. It does not reflect his home environment. Nevertheless, there are analogies.”


	
	I proceeded in Lewis to rely upon studies in the United States of America relating to the effect on behaviour of social exclusion and discrimination. It is unnecessary to reiterate those comments or refer in detail again to the studies.
	
	
	Those studies disclose, somewhat counter-intuitively, that social exclusion from the prevailing group has a direct impact and causes high levels of aggression, self-defeating behaviours, and reduced pro-social contributions to society as a whole, poor performance in intellectual spheres and impaired self-regulation. While intuitively, for those who have not themselves suffered such extreme social exclusion, the response to exclusion would be greater efforts to secure acceptance, the above studies make clear that the opposite occurs.
	
	
	Thus, a person, such as the appellant, who has suffered extreme social exclusion on account of his race, even from the family who had adopted him, is likely to engage in self-defeating behaviours and suffer the effects to which earlier reference has been made. This is how the appellant has been affected.
	
	
	Circumstances such as that are akin to a systemic background of deprivation and are a background of a kind that may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience: Bugmy at [41] and [43]. As a consequence, this background of social exclusion will, on the studies to which detailed reference has been made in Lewis, explain an “offender’s recourse to violence…such that the offender’s moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced”: Bugmy at [44].
	
	
	The studies by Professor Baumeister, reference to which is contained in the judgment in Lewis, make clear that such extreme social exclusion will likely result in anti-social behaviour and most likely result in criminal offending. However, in each case, there must be evidence to suggest the application of these principles and the effect of the exclusion. In this case, the evidence in relation to the appellant of that factor is substantial.
	
	
	Moreover, the appellant’s rehabilitation whilst in prison, during a period when those factors were sought to be addressed, as were the effects of his mental illness, discloses a basis for diminishing his moral culpability for the offences and a view that his rehabilitation prospects are strong.
	
	
	Since his incarceration, the appellant has undergone anger management programmes (self-referred); completed, as earlier stated, the VOTP and a Maintenance Programme in relation to it; applied to complete the Sex Offender’s Programme; worked in employment in gaol in a manner that has been described by prison officers as constructive and his behaviour “excellent”; had continuing arrangements with Aboriginal welfare; undergone courses on drugs and alcohol; and completely abstained from drugs.
	
	
	As a result, it seems his anti-social behaviour has been ameliorated considerably and he has had no disciplinary charges whilst in prison. All of these are factors which stress the capacity of the appellant for rehabilitation and affirm the need for supervision of the appellant over a longer period than the prescribed ratio would allow in order for these steps towards total rehabilitation to be supervised in the community.
	
	
	Taking all of these factors into account and, in particular, the subjective factors that have arisen since his incarceration, it is my view that a lesser sentence is warranted.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as earlier stated, the offences, particularly the sexual offences, are extremely serious. The subjective circumstances described above indicate that the appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation; is a less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence; and those circumstances lessen the otherwise obvious need for specific deterrence. The seriousness of the offences warrants appropriate punishment and there still exists room for some deterrence, general and specific. A sentence must be imposed, bearing in mind the subjective circumstances, which is appropriate for the seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	Since drafting the foregoing, I have had the opportunity to read, in draft, the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. Without resiling from any aspect of these reasons, I agree with the Chief Justice and with the order he proposes.
	
	
	MCCALLUM J: I have read the judgments of the Chief Justice and Rothman J in draft. I agree that the time within which to appeal should be extended, for the reasons stated by their Honours. I agree that grounds 1, 2 and 3 have been made out. In the circumstances, it is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion as to ground 4. I agree with the remarks of Rothman J on re-sentencing. I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice, for the reasons stated by their Honours.

2766692,R v Eyre [2015] NSWDC 385,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: At one stage the offender, Aaron Robert Eyre and the person whom he later stabbed, Joshua Harrow, were quite good friends. They had a falling out over the loan of some tools. The offender claimed that Mr Harrow had not returned all the tools which he borrowed. Whether he did or not is impossible to determine, but even if the offender was correct, nothing could possibly justify his response.
	
	
	The offender and Mr Harrow lived in the same suburb. Sometime after the falling out Mr Harrow went to visit a friend of his, Mr Richard Gardiner, who lived in the same villa complex as the offender. Mr Gardiner was not home so Mr Harrow sat on the porch, waiting for him and drinking. As he waited he noticed the offender, amongst other people, outside a flat a short distance away. All of a sudden Mr Harrow saw the offender appear. Mr Harrow stood up and was stabbed by the offender repeatedly. Blood squirted everywhere. Mr Harrow managed to get away and run the short distance to his home where he discovered that his mobile phone battery was flat and that he was bleeding quite heavily. Accordingly he went to a neighbour who summonsed both the ambulance and police through a triple 0 call.
	
	
	Mr Harrow gave evidence in court that the offender stabbed him with a knife, but to police soon after the events I have just described, he said he was not sure if it was a screwdriver or a knife. Although it probably does not matter the nature of the injuries which I will soon describe to Mr Harrow clearly suggest the accuracy of the evidence Mr Harrow gave in court, that is that he was stabbed by Mr Eyre with a knife.
	
	
	The offender was arrested that night. He was not interviewed for some time because he was seen to be deeply asleep, later explaining that this was because his girlfriend had slipped him two tablets of his anxiety medication as he was being arrested. When he was eventually interviewed by police he told a very different story to the one Mr Harrow told, claiming that he was the victim in the matter and that the wounds that Mr Harrow had suffered must have been caused by him rolling on the knife while they were both wrestling on the ground. By their verdict the jury have clearly rejected the version given by the accused and accepted beyond reasonable doubt Mr Harrow’s evidence as to how he came to be wounded. It is of course on that basis that I will sentence the offender. I will sentence him on the basis that he, without warning, approached Mr Harrow and stabbed him a number of times.
	
	
	There were three wounds and a smaller scratch all to the left side of Mr Harrow’s body and arm. Of course therefore the offender used the knife multiple times. The doctor who reviewed Mr Harrow after he had been treated in the emergency department gave evidence about those injuries. One of the wounds was 8 centimetres long and was deep enough to expose the muscle, a depth of perhaps 1 to 2 centimetres. Another injury was 4 centimetres long which penetrated about 1 centimetre, not down to the muscle, with a third significant wound being 2.5 centimetres long, that also not being deep enough to penetrate to any of the deeper structures such as the ribs or muscle.
	
	
	The photographs of those wounds show that a significant number of sutures were required. Mr Harrow was kept in hospital overnight and left hospital about 6.00 pm on the following day. The doctor who gave evidence had not reviewed Mr Harrow since then but felt at the time that he did see him that the prognosis was good with no disability anticipated.
	
	
	The Crown today tendered a victim impact statement in which Mr Harrow does claim residual difficulties of a physical kind. In view of the medical evidence I am not satisfied that the consequences for Mr Harrow are as bad, at least physically, as he describes. When giving evidence in the trial Mr Harrow in my view exaggerated the injuries that he had received and so I will sentence Mr Eyre on the basis of the medical evidence as to what would be anticipated from injuries of the kind the doctor saw rather than the physical consequences that Mr Harrow claims in his victim impact statement.
	
	
	Of course Mr Harrow speaks also of psychological consequences. I have no trouble at all accepting that a person who has been stabbed in circumstances such as Mr Harrow described would have ongoing psychological consequences, would be more anxious, would be less likely to go out. Such consequences for a victim of violence, a victim of a stabbing, are commonplace and entirely to be expected from actions such as those of the offender in this case.
	
	
	Quite clearly this was a serious offence and the evidence well justified the verdict of guilty to the charge of reckless wounding. The community is rightfully concerned about the use of weapons to settle disputes and in the circumstances of this case the offender’s attack upon Mr Harrow represented a significant breach of the peace, the effects of which went far beyond simply wounding Mr Harrow.
	
	
	A number of people were around when the stabbing took place and a number of people were around to view the consequences for Mr Harrow.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of the offence of course a significant factor to be considered is the nature of the injuries, I have already spoken about that. The objective seriousness of offences of reckless wounding require more than a consideration of the nature of injuries inflicted. In this case it has to be remembered that the offender stabbed Mr Harrow repeatedly without warning. It is fortunate in the extreme both Mr Harrow and the offender that the injuries were not more significant.
	
	
	The offence has a maximum penalty of seven years with a standard non‑parole period of three years. I have taken both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period into account in determining the sentence that I have decided to impose upon the offender.
	
	
	He has a lengthy criminal history including offences of violence. His prospects of rehabilitation, I am satisfied, are poor. He continues to commit criminal offences, including offences of violence despite sentences of some significance having been imposed upon him in the past. At the time of this offending he was working which is very much a positive thing to be said in his favour, but unfortunately there is little to suggest that the offender would act any differently if similar circumstances presented themselves in the future. There is, for example, no evidence of remorse. There is no evidence that the offender is sorry for what he did. Indeed he continues to claim and maintain a version of events which is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury.
	
	
	I have been assisted by a number of reports tendered today, a presentence report, a Justice Health report and a report from a psychologist. Of course a large part of history recorded in those reports comes from the offender himself. The psychological report reveals that the offender told the psychologist a number of very distressing things about his upbringing but in the same interview he also claimed that he was only saying a number of those things to reduce the likely sentence he would get. Take for example his claim to have been sexually assaulted as a child. He disclosed this, apparently for the first time, in preparation of reports leading up to these proceedings. How am I supposed to know whether he is telling the truth or not? Mr Eyre did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings before me, so all I have is untested statements in a document. Indeed the psychologist herself said this:
	


“I am unclear how accurate the events Aaron described are.”


	
	On the other hand his very presentation is, as the psychologist recognised, indicative of an upbringing which, to say the least, was challenging. The psychologist continued after the passage I have just quoted by saying:
	


“Nevertheless his presentation in interview and profile and assessment indicated a man who has experienced significant trauma which remains unresolved.”


	
	I am prepared to accept that finding of the psychologist whatever the precise nature of the trauma that the offender has experienced. I also accept that the offender is currently experiencing major depression and anxiety. That is a factor which will mean that the offender does his time in custody harder than a person who is mentally well. It also means that there should be less weight given to the need for general deterrence, although that must still remain an important part of this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	I cannot see how major depression and anxiety significantly affects the offender’s moral culpability at the time he committed the offence and so I will not take that factor into account to any great extent.
	
	
	As I was reminded this morning this offence is one which is within the jurisdiction of the Local Court, however it would have been quite wrong for the matter to have been dealt with in that Court. This was an offence of such seriousness that the jurisdictional limit in the Local Court is exceeded by a significant extent.
	
	
	I mentioned before that I will give less weight than normal to the principles of general deterrence but specific deterrence remains a matter of prime importance. I spoke briefly about the offender’s lengthy history of offences, including offences of violence. He has harmed Mr Harrow in a very violent manner. I have to choose a sentence which will deter him from acting that way in the future. I have already mentioned the absence of remorse or any other evidence indicating that the offender is likely to change his attitude towards violence upon release from custody, and so specific deterrence is of even more importance in this case than in many others.
	
	
	I will make a finding of special circumstances as the offender asks. His depression and panic disorder, while not a significant factor in the commission of this offence, still do need to be the subject of some treatment upon the offender’s release from custody. However the non-parole period I will shortly announce is, I am satisfied, the least which properly reflects all the circumstances of the case before me.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since the date of his arrest on 29 January 2014, so his sentence of imprisonment will commence from that day. I impose a sentence of imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years, to date from that day 29 January 2014 with a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 28 January 2017 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

2766694,R v Simmons (No 7) [2015] NSWSC 574,"INTRODUCTION


	
	HIS HONOUR: At around 8pm on 2 June 2009, Andrew Russell was “jaundiced, intoxicated and a bit all over the place”. Against the wishes and advice of Jamie Waring, his host and second cousin, Mr Russell left his temporary, part-time home at 3 Slim Street, West Bathurst intending to go to the nearby Dudley Hotel to drink some more. That was at about 8:30pm. What he did next is not known. A stranger may have seen him, around 6 km away, walking in the middle of an intersection on the Great Western Highway at Kelso shortly before 11pm. His family and friends have not seen or heard from him since.
	
	
	Around 3 months earlier, on 20 March 2009, Mr Russell was assaulted by his then house mate Tony Simmons. That incident occurred in a house they were sharing at 9 Cripps Place, Kelso. It arose as a result of an incident between Mr Russell and Simmons’ then partner, Jodi Biles. Mr Russell ended up in hospital as a result of the assault. He had some injuries to his face. I will refer to this as “the March assault”. After the incident, the various occupants of the house in Cripps Place moved out. There is no evidence that Mr Russell ever returned there. Jamie Waring said that Mr Russell was too scared to go back.
	
	
	Almost four years later, on 16 January 2013, Tony Simmons was arrested by police and charged with Mr Russell’s murder. He is now on trial and I must determine whether the evidence establishes his guilt.
	
	
	Immediately before his arrest, Simmons made a detailed confession to the crime. His confession followed a sophisticated and cleverly executed undercover police operation by which Simmons was deceived over a period of four months. The learned Crown Prosecutor said in opening the trial that the case against Simmons depends on an acceptance that the statements he made to the undercover police officers in the final stages of the investigation are a true representation of his conduct towards Mr Russell. Simmons’ case is that the confession, and admissions that he made to undercover police officers in the previous week or so, were false.
	
	
	A few days after Simmons was arrested, police charged another man, Kieran Moore with the murder. That charge was based on the things that Simmons had said during the undercover operation. The charge was later reduced to accessory after the fact to the murder committed by Simmons. Before the trial proper commenced, certain evidence against Moore was held to be inadmissible: R v Simmons & Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189. The Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no further proceedings against Moore. Moore was called as a witness in the prosecution case against Simmons.
	
	
	On 19 March 2015 I made an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that the trial be conducted by judge alone, sitting without a jury: R v Simmons (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259. The trial commenced on 25 March 2015. The Court heard evidence from 53 witnesses, including the accused, over 26 sitting days. This included 6 days in Bathurst when a number of local witnesses were called. Fourteen locations in Bathurst and around the nearby town of Sofala were visited as part of a view conducted on 1 April 2015. The balance of the trial was conducted in Sydney and Darlinghurst.
	
	
	I heard counsel’s addresses on 6 and 8 May 2015. I then reserved my decision. I am now in a position to deliver my verdict. These are my reasons for that verdict. I will first set out the legal principles by which I am guided in reaching my verdict. I will then provide a narrative of the evidence including my findings as to which parts of the evidence I accept and which parts I do not accept. Finally I will articulate the reasons at the core of my decision and then I will announce the verdict.
	


Legal Principles


	
	Section 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act requires me to state the principles of law that I apply as well as the findings of fact upon which I rely. Section 133(3) says that where the law requires a warning to be given to a jury, I must take the warning into account in dealing with the matter. I will first set out the general principals of law that I apply and any relevant warnings. I will apply those to the evidence and facts as I summarise them. I will then set out the evidence and the findings of fact upon which I rely in reaching my verdict.
	


Presumption of innocence


	
	The fundamental starting point is that the accused enters the courtroom clothed with a presumption of innocence. He is not required to prove his innocence. The law and the tribunal of fact presume that he is innocent.
	


Onus and standard of proof


	
	The legal consequence of the presumption of innocence is that the prosecution bears the onus of proof. The onus never shifts. It remains on the Crown from beginning to end. The accused bears no onus. He is not required to prove anything in the trial. He is not required to prove that he is innocent.
	
	
	The standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. Those words and that phrase have their ordinary English meaning. Suspicion, no matter how grave, is insufficient to justify a conviction.
	
	
	The matters that the Crown needs to establish beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements of the offence. The Crown is not required to prove the truth and reliability of every disputed fact or to establish everything that its important witnesses said in evidence.
	


Essential elements


	
	In the context of the present case, to sustain a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder, the Crown must prove the following things beyond reasonable doubt:
	



	
	That Mr Russell is in fact deceased.
	
	
	That the accused did an intentional act that caused Mr Russell’s death.
	
	
	That the accused did that act with an intention to kill or with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or acted with reckless indifference to human life. Grievous bodily harm means really serious injury.
	



	
	None of the relevant defences or partial defences (such as self-defence, provocation or substantial impairment) have been raised in this case. I will not consider them further.
	
	
	Neither party suggests that the alternative verdict of manslaughter arises. However, if I am satisfied that the accused killed Mr Russell but have a reasonable doubt as to his intention, the accused might be guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. That would arise if I was satisfied that the accused killed Mr Russel by means of an unlawful act (an unlawful assault) which was objectively dangerous in the sense that it carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.
	


Drawing inferences from direct evidence: circumstantial reasoning


	
	I am able to, and will, draw inferences from the established evidence. However in doing so I must first be satisfied of the primary facts. I need not be satisfied of primary facts beyond reasonable doubt. There is no particular standard of proof to be applied to the individual items of evidence. Rather, it is the combination of facts or evidence that may lead me to infer the existence of facts that are not, or cannot, be proved by direct evidence.
	
	
	Some intermediate facts may be so crucial to the process of reasoning that they are indispensable to the chain of reasoning leading to the inference of guilt. If there are such intermediate facts, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. One intermediate fact that must be established beyond reasonable doubt is that Mr Russell is dead.
	
	
	When it comes to drawing the ultimate inference of guilt, I must not draw such an inference unless it is the only reasonable inference, or only reasonable hypothesis or conclusion, available on the evidence.
	
	
	Mr Young SC in opening the case said that there was a reasonable explanation for the accused’s admissions to the undercover police officers apart from the conclusion he was telling the truth and is guilty of murder.
	


Consciousness of guilt


	
	A particular species of circumstantial evidence upon which the prosecution relies is evidence of a consciousness of guilt. This is evidence that does not establish a direct admission but is relied upon as conduct that can only be explained by the fact that the accused knows that he is guilty.
	
	
	The Crown put to the accused and submitted to the Court that certain things said by the accused were lies. These include statements he made in evidence as well as in a written statement to the police on 24 July 2009. However, the Crown does not rely on any of the alleged lies as evidence of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	The Crown does rely on evidence that the accused attempted to influence a witness (Melissa O’Donoghue) as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The Crown also relies on five other things allegedly said by the accused as demonstrating an awareness on his part that he is guilty.
	
	
	The evidence of consciousness of guilt is not capable of establishing guilt by itself. It is tendered as corroborative evidence. Before using any of this evidence as corroborating the guilt of Mr Simmons, I must be satisfied of two things. First, I must be satisfied that the thing in question (that is, the particular statement or the attempt to influence the witness) actually occurred. Secondly, I must be satisfied that the only explanation for the evidence (that is, the statement or the attempt to influence the witness) is that the accused was aware that he was guilty of the murder of Mr Russell.
	
	
	Juries are often warned to be cautious in using evidence of consciousness of guilt because it is difficult to know how or why an innocent person may act in particular circumstances. Juries are urged to consider any other possible explanation for the statement or actions of the accused that are said to be motivated by a consciousness of guilt.
	


Identification


	
	Two witnesses gave disputed evidence concerning sightings of Andrew Russell. The Crown relies on a sighting by Michael O’Neil shortly before 11pm on 2 June 2009 on the corner Littlebourne Street and the Sydney Road (Great Western Highway) at Kelso. This is significant because the location nominated by the accused (to undercover police) as the place that he and Kieran Moore picked up Mr Russell was a relatively short distance to the west (that is, on the bridge between Kelso and Bathurst). The defence relies on a sighting by Jennifer Coloton on 17 June 2009 on the same bridge. This is significant because it undermines the prosecution assertion or case theory that Mr Russell was murdered late on 2 June 2009.
	
	
	When considering various parts of the evidence that rely on the personal identification of Mr Russell, I must remind myself that evidence of identification can be unreliable. I must consider the particular circumstances in which the observations were made, whether the deceased was known to the identifying witness, the circumstances of the observation (including the lighting conditions and length of observation) and other factors which I will set out more fully when I consider the evidence of the two witnesses.
	
	
	The evidence is not “identification evidence” as defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That definition captures evidence of “an assertion by a person to the effect that an accused was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person” who was seen at the scene of the crime or in a place connected to the crime. The evidence of Mr O’Neill and Ms Coloton concerns identification of the missing person, not the accused. For this reason, the provisions of the Evidence Act concerning identification evidence do not apply. Thus, there was no question as to the admissibility of the evidence pursuant to ss 114-115. Further, there is no requirement for a warning as to the reliability of the evidence under s 116 or s 165(1)(b).
	
	
	However, the nature of the evidence is subject to the same issues of reliability that affect identification evidence as defined in the Evidence Act. It is “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”: see the chapeau to s 165(1). There is no reason to distinguish between the evidence on the basis that Mr O’Neill’s evidence supports the Crown case while Ms Coloton’s evidence is potentially exculpatory and if a warning is to be given in relation to one witness, it should be given in relation to both: Australian Law Reform Commission Report, 102 Uniform Evidence Law (8 February 2006) at [13.44]-[13.45] referred to in Odgers’ Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition) at [1.4.2900]; see also RELC v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 383; 167 A Crim R 484 at [80]; cf R v Rose [2002] NSWCCA 455; 55 NSWLR 701 at [297] (Wood CJ at CL and Howie J), [343]-[348] (Smart J).
	
	
	I will direct myself accordingly in relation to the evidence of both witnesses. I will identify the individual reasons for caution when I refer to the evidence of the two witnesses. For present purpose I direct myself that:
	



	
	Evidence of identification may be unreliable.
	
	
	The history of the law shows that witnesses commonly make mistakes when giving evidence of identification.
	
	
	Even the most confident and honest witness can be mistaken when giving evidence of identification.
	
	
	Studies have shown that there may be little, or no, correlation between the confidence with which a witness gives evidence of identification and the reliability and accuracy of their evidence. See, for example, Loftus & Doyle, Eyewitness Testimony (1987) 88-89; Krug, The Relationship between Confidence and Accuracy (2007) 3(1) Applied Psychology in Criminal Justice 7.
	
	
	Features that can affect the reliability of identification evidence include:
	



	
	The length of the observation.
	
	
	Whether the witness knows the person that they purport to identify and how well they know them.
	
	
	The lighting conditions.
	
	
	The length of time between the observation and the identification.
	



	
	These warnings do not mean that Identification evidence is unreliable. They merely require the evidence to be scrutinised and considered carefully.
	
	
	Because of the dangers of identification, it is generally considered to be desirable for the witness to be provided with an array of photographs (or, if possible, group of suspects) depicting a selection of individuals of generally similar appearance. This avoids the possibility of the witness being influenced sub-consciously by suggestion. That is not always practicable and in the present case, the police were not (at the time) investigating a crime but attempting to locate a missing person.
	


Admissions


	
	In considering the admissions made (or, in some cases, allegedly made) by the accused I must first consider whether I accept that the admission was in fact made. I must then consider whether or not the admission is reliable and/or true. In relation to the evidence of some of the witnesses who gave evidence of admissions, I must treat their evidence with caution for various reasons to which I will return when I discuss the evidence.
	
	
	I remind myself that if the trial were being conducted with a jury, s 165(1)(b) may have required a warning that evidence of admissions may be unreliable. The parties agreed that I should take such a warning into account in relation to the disputed admissions. The basis of this consensus is that such evidence is not properly recorded and may be unreliable. It is not necessarily unreliable and the warning merely requires that the evidence be subject to close scrutiny before it is acted upon. Such evidence is easy to fabricate and may arise as a result of misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the accused’s words. Once given, evidence of oral admissions is difficult to refute. I must consider carefully the quality of the evidence of the admissions and the credibility of the witnesses who gave the evidence.
	


Out of court statements by witnesses


	
	Many of the witness in this case were examined and cross-examined about statements that they had made in the past and about statements that other people (witnesses and non-witnesses) had made in the past. The basis upon which this evidence was tendered, and the way it can be used, varied from witness to witness and from statement to statement. In some instances the prior statement was put to the witness to remind them of matters that they may have forgotten (s 32 Evidence Act). In other instances, the prior statement was inconsistent with the evidence given in court and was used to undermine the credibility of the witness’ testimony (ss 38, 106 Evidence Act).
	
	
	In the present trial, there were occasions when the witness accepted that they had made the previous statement and that the previous statement was true. In those instances, the prior statement was adopted as the evidence of the witness. On other occasions, the witness denied making the statement or could not remember all or part of the statement. In yet other instances, the witness accepted that they had made the previous statement (or something similar) but said that the previous statement was untrue.
	
	
	Where the making of the previous statement was not admitted, or where the truth of the statement is denied, the evidence is generally not admissible to prove the fact contained in the out of court statement. It is hearsay (s 59 Evidence Act). However, there are a variety of exceptions to the hearsay rule (see ss 60, 65-66, 66A Evidence Act). Further, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of admissions (s 81 Evidence Act). Neither party relies on any out of court statement as evidence of the truth of what was said in that previous statement.
	
	
	The most significant example was an “off the record” statement made by the former co-accused (Kieran Moore). This evidence came from Mr Moore himself and from his step father (Mr Fazio). When the evidence was introduced, the learned Crown Prosecutor said that he relied on the evidence as proof of the facts asserted in the out of court statement. Objection was taken to the statement being used in that way. In his closing address, the Crown said that he did not rely on the evidence for that purpose but only to prove that the matters asserted by Fazio were in fact said by Mr Moore. After closing addresses and in the course of discussions as to the appropriate legal principles, the parties agreed that it was appropriate to limit the use of the evidence under s 136 Evidence Act. Accordingly, I will not consider the evidence of what Mr Moore said in his “off the record” conversation with police as evidence that the contents of that statement are true. The use of the evidence is limited to two purposes. First, it can be used in support of the prosecution’s attack on Mr Moore’s credibility. Second, the prosecutor relies on the coincidence between what Moore said, what the accused told the undercover police and the location and timing of the possible sighting of Mr Russell by Mr O’Neill.
	
	
	Where hearsay evidence is admitted (for a hearsay purpose, that is, to prove the truth of the hearsay statement) a jury is generally warned that hearsay evidence may be unreliable (s 165 Evidence Act). However, in the present case none of the out of court statements are relied on for a hearsay purpose. In relation to the second way in which the Crown seeks to use Mr Moore’s off the record statement, it is appropriate to approach the matter with a degree of caution, noting that there is no recording of what was said and that there are differences between the versions of the conversation provided by Mr Fazio and Mr Moore.
	


Witnesses and fact finding


	
	I am entitled to accept part of a witness’ evidence and reject other parts. I have watched the witnesses closely and considered both what they say and their demeanour. I am conscious of the fact that “scientific research has cast doubt on the ability of Judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances”: Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [31]. Where possible, I will look to objectively established facts, contemporary materials and the apparent logic of events.
	


Unreliable evidence and witnesses requiring a cautious approach


	
	Evidence of certain classes of witnesses is known to be potentially unreliable. That does not mean that their evidence is unreliable in this case. It means only that before acting upon the evidence of such witnesses I must examine it closely and exercise caution.
	
	
	Examples of such witnesses are those in relation to whom a warning under s 165 might be required if the case were being conducted with a jury. Evidence was given in this case by prison informers (Kypros Kypri and Luke Davis) and also by at least one witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings (Kieran Moore). There is some evidence of the involvement of three other witnesses (Jamie Waring, Kelly Burns and Jodi Biles) but that evidence is so slight and unreliable that it is inappropriate to treat their evidence with caution on this basis.
	


Prejudice, bad character and tendency


	
	There is a great deal of evidence that demonstrates that Mr Simmons was a person of bad character both at the time Mr Russell’s disappearance (mid 2009) and at the time of the covert police investigation (September 2012-January 2013). This includes evidence that he assaulted Mr Russell in March 2009, misled police as to his involvement in the assault and allowed his partner to take the blame for the assault. There is also evidence that he used and trafficked in illegal drugs including methylamphetamine (“ice”) and was involved in crimes of dishonesty. During the course of the covert investigation he willingly took part in a wide variety of criminal activities staged by the undercover operatives. [REDACTED].
	
	
	I must not use this evidence to reason that he is a person of bad character and therefore more likely to commit the offence. I must not reason that he is a person with a tendency to commit crime and therefore is more likely to have murdered Mr Russell. The evidence was admitted to place into proper context the admissions he made to the undercover police.
	
	
	I can (and do) take the March assault into account as evidence of animosity between the accused and Mr Russell and as evidence of motive.
	
	
	I am entitled to (and do) take into account evidence of his dishonesty and bad character in assessing his credibility as a witness.
	
	
	Finally, I may take the evidence into account to rebut any suggestion of good character. For example, the accused claimed in cross-examination that he would not lie on oath for religious reasons.
	


THE EVIDENCE


	
	I will now provide a summary of the evidence given by the witnesses called at the trial and the other factual material upon which my decision is based. The summary will largely be in the order in which the evidence was adduced. Where there were breaks in a witness’ evidence, I will summarise the evidence as a whole rather than in fragments. In the course of summarising the evidence, I will indicate some of my factual findings. This will include findings as to the credibility of the witnesses and inferences that may arise from their evidence. However, I will not indicate the ultimate findings of fact until I have considered all of the evidence.
	
	
	The trial initially sat for two days in Sydney on Wednesday and Thursday 25-26 March 2015.
	
	
	The first witness was Bruce Herbert. Mr Herbert is Mr Russell’s father. He described the health problems that Mr Russell had throughout his life. He was diagnosed with hepatitis at a young age and had another disease affecting his liver. In 2009 he was on a waiting list for a liver transplant. However he was never provided with the liver transplant, partially because he drank alcohol to excess and was never healthy enough to have the operation. Mr Russell had lived with his mother in Queensland before he moved back to Bathurst with his girlfriend in 2005. He lived at 9 Cripps Place, Bathurst until the March assault. His girlfriend and he split up around 18 months before he disappeared. The accused and his girlfriend Jodi Biles moved into the premises around 12 months after that.
	
	
	Mr Herbert recalls going to the hospital in March 2009 and seeing the injuries to his son that had been caused in the assault. He said that his son lived with him and his partner for a time and then stayed for a short time with his cousin Jamie Waring. Waring lived in Slim Street, West Bathurst.
	
	
	Mr Herbert gave evidence of his contact with Mr Russell on 2 June 2009. That is the date of Mr Herbert’s birthday. He attended a funeral for a local resident, Wayne (“Whacker” or “Whack”) Quinlan. His son was not at the funeral. His son attended his premises at about 3:30pm and was wearing new running shoes that he had recently bought. He thought those runners were red. His son arrived with a birthday present, drinking glasses with a Parramatta Eels motif. One of the glasses was broken because the present was dropped on concrete and Mr Russell indicated that he would return them to the place of purchase to try to get them replaced. He then left, saying that he might visit with Mr Waring and drink some bourbon, and then go to see if he could get the glasses replaced.
	
	
	Mr Herbert did not see him again. Mr Herbert said that he reported his son missing to the police on “around 18 June 2009”. (Other evidence suggest the report was made on 20 June 2009.) His report followed his son’s failure to attend the Bathurst Local Court.
	
	
	Mr Herbert said that his son did not own a car and “walked everywhere”. When asked about his son’s habit when receiving his pension, Mr Herbert said that he used to “blow it all” on his friends who used to use him for his money.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was established that Mr Herbert’s memory was that his son left his house at around 4pm on 2 June 2009. He said that it was about 15 minutes to walk into town from his home. Mr Herbert said that Jamie Waring lived only a few blocks from him. He agreed that in a statement to the police he said that his son had a “drinking problem” and also that he and his son argued about his son’s drinking.
	
	
	Suzanne Wallace is the domestic partner of Bruce Herbert and lived with him in June 2009. She confirmed much of Mr Herbert’s evidence although there were some minor and unimportant variations. For example she put the time of Mr Russell’s visit at between 12 and 1pm and said that he stayed for a couple hours. She also said that the new shoes that Mr Russell had just bought were black-and-white or black-and-white checks
	
	
	She confirmed that when Mr Russell left he had intended to replace the glasses that had been broken and also said that he intended to go and have a beer with Jamie Waring. She said that he had also mentioned purchasing a new ‘phone that day. She said the next day she saw Casey Benger who told her that he hadn’t seen Mr Russell since the day before. She said that she saw some glasses similar to the ones that Mr Russell had given to Mr Herbert as a present at or near the Knickerbocker Hotel in Bathurst.
	
	
	She became concerned for Mr Russell when he did not attend the Local Court on 15 June 2009. She told the Magistrate that he was probably in hospital. However when she checked Mr Russell was not at the hospital. She then checked whether he was “locked up” and discovered that he was not in the custody of the police. It was at that point, on about 20 June 2009, that she and Mr Herbert went to the Bathurst Police Station and reported Mr Russell missing.
	
	
	Senior Constable Erin Lloyd gave evidence of her attendance at 9 Cripps Place Kelso on 20 March 2009. She was responding to a radio message that indicated that Andrew Russell had complained about his sister Kiara White refusing to leave the premises. She attended the premises and Mr Russell was asleep. In the radio message it was said that he appeared to be drunk. She spoke with Jodi Biles and Kiara White and left. She received a number of messages on 21 March 2009 in the early hours to return to the address. She did so and found that other police were already in attendance. She noticed that the accused was “agitated” and that he was shouting in the direction of the house. Mr Russell was responding by shouting back at him.
	
	
	She noticed that Mr Russell had severe swelling and bleeding to his face and that Mr Simmons had no injuries apart from grazes to his knuckle that were explained as having been caused when he punched the house.
	
	
	From what was said to police at that stage, she believed that Jodi Biles assaulted Mr Russell, but later a interview with Mr Russell suggested that Tony Simmons was the assailant.
	
	
	She applied for an apprehended violence order on behalf of Mr Russell but the order eventually lapsed when she was unable to make contact with Mr Russell. On 10 April 2009 the accused declined to make a statement about the assault. She became aware that Mr Russell was reported missing on 21 June 2009 and made a number of enquiries in an attempt to locate him. She spoke with Mr Russell’s step-father who lived in Wee Waa as well as his stepmother and a number of other people who knew Mr Russell. None had heard from him since 2 June 2009.
	
	
	She also made enquiries with a bank where Mr Russell was known to be a customer. She discovered that there had been a Centrelink payment into his bank account on 16 June 2009 but that this money had never been withdrawn. The manager of the bank placed an alert on the account to notify police if there was any action on the account. It seems that there has been no action on the account since 2 June 2009.
	
	
	She was cross-examined in relation to a COPS event which she had prepared and which had been updated with each additional report. Her understanding was that Jodi Biles contacted Tony Simmons and asked him to come back to the house and he returned with a man called Jakob Peters. It was then that the physical altercation with Mr Russell occurred.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Tammy Smyth interviewed Mr Russell at the Bathurst Hospital at 8:45am on 21 March 2009. She noticed a number of injuries to his face. Mr Russell said that is was the accused who had assaulted him. Mr Russell said that the assault had something to do with a break and enter incident that involved a fish tank. On information that there may be a visual recording of the incident on the accused’s telephone, she examined the telephone but found no footage. On 20 June 2009, Susan Wallace and Bruce Herbert attended the police station trying to locate Mr Russell. She checked the police system and ascertained that Mr Russell was not in police custody “anywhere”. She also contacted Bathurst Base Hospital and was told that Mr Russell had last been admitted in March 2009 (that is, at the time of the assault). She attempted to contact Mr Russell’s mother (Joanne Russell) in Queensland and his step-father (Greg Thomas) in Wee Waa. She had “negative results” from all of those inquiries.
	
	
	In cross-examination DSC Smyth agreed that Mr Russell asserted that the assault was motivated by the fact that Mr Russell had refused to take the rap for a break and enter involving a stolen fish tank. She agreed that this was inconsistent with a previous police interview in which Mr Russell “had admitted being in possession of it [the fish tank] in circumstances where it may give rise to either a receiving or a goods in custody charge”. She agreed that she attended premises at 1 Whiteman Place Bathurst in response to a complaint by a Sharon Kelly and was told by the accused that he had an argument with Ms Kelly because “she wouldn’t sell him drugs”. She said that when she looked at the accused ‘phone, she saw a single image of Mr Russell. She had not forwarded that image to herself but agreed that the picture may have included the accused sitting next to Mr Russell. She agreed that Kelly Burns told her that she had not seen Mr Russell “since 3 June 2009”.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable MacLean was involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Russell since June 2009. On 24 June 2009, he attended 9 Cripps Place Kelso (Mr Russell’s residence) and found nobody in residence. He noticed blood stains on the wall of a hallway that he believed related to the assault in March 2009. He noticed medications (including Prednisolone) and prescriptions in the name of Mr Russell. On 26 June 2009 he made inquires about the bank accounts of Mr Russell and then attended the residence of Kelly Burns in Slim Street Bathurst where he was provided with some clothes and prescriptions belonging to Mr Russell. He canvassed the area around Cripps Place and made inquiries with the local bus company (Selwoods). There were no bus bookings in the name of Andrew Russell on 2 June 2009. He executed a search warrant on 3 Slim Street Bathurst and returned to the unoccupied house at 9 Cripps Place. Forensic samples were taken and a coffee table was seized from the house at Slim Street. Enquiries with a local refuge showed that Jodie Wright had been collected on the evening of 2 June 2009. (That evidence was relevant to Ms Burns’ statement to DSC Smyth that she had last seen the deceased on 3 June 2009).
	
	
	DSC MacLean made investigations into a white Hyundai Excel registered AK06VN in the name of Jodi Biles and took possession of car seats from a Ford Falcon once possessed by Tony Simmons. He also looked into a telephone box at the corner of Mitre and Lambert Streets. He attended the Dudley Hotel and ascertained that there had been two purchases of VB beer (Mr Russell’s preferred brand) on the night of 2 June 2009, one at 9:17pm and one at 10:23pm. Nobody at the hotel recognised a photograph of Mr Russell.
	
	
	On 1 and 6 September 2011, DSC Maclean was involved in a covert operation whereby Jodi Biles entered Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital wearing a listening device and spoke to Kieran Moore, the man alleged to be Mr Simmons’ accomplice. DSC Maclean also obtained a warrant enabling police to record telephone calls between Jodi Biles and the accused while the latter was in custody at Wellington gaol. He also interviewed the accused about an unrelated matter while he was in gaol. The accused said that he did not want to speak about the disappearance of Mr Russell at that stage. DSC Maclean also obtained various medical records relating to Mr Russell.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Maclean agreed that investigators had seized the coffee table at Slim Street because they had information that “Mr Russell’s head may have come in contact with that table through some misadventure at some stage at the house”. He thought that information may have been from an anonymous “Crime Stoppers” report.
	
	
	Paula Morrison is currently serving a seven year sentence for an offence in the nature of kidnapping. She used to work in the car park near Coles in Bathurst working on the trolleys and, as such, she is well known. She knew the main players involved in the case and in particular knew both the accused and Mr Russell. She gave evidence of three specific events, all of which appear to be disputed.
	
	
	The first incident was when she was speaking to Mr Russell around the corner from Coles and noticed the accused and some other people come up in a car. She thought it was a silver grey coloured car. The accused was in the passenger seat. Other people present were Jodie Wright, Chris Taylor, Jakob Peters and Jamie [Waring]. There was some argument and when the car pulled up (and, I infer, Mr Russell saw the accused), Mr Russell ran off. It seemed that she had given a different version to the police in terms of precisely where this happened. She said that she didn’t think that she attended Whack Quinlan’s funeral (which was 2 June 2009) and that she could not remember that day. The relevance of this is that there is no temporal point of reference to this incident. It seemed that the Crown expected the evidence to show that this incident occurred on 2 June 2009 but it did not do so.
	
	
	The second incident involved a woman called Jodie Wright. Jodie told her “something about her knowledge of Andrew Russell’s disappearance”. The conversation started on a friendly basis but the witness became upset “after I heard a couple of the things she said”.
	
	
	The third incident is potentially the most incriminating. However, I am unable to accept that the incident occurred at all. Ms Morrison said that she was followed in a car occupied by the accused and some other boys who she didn’t know. In cross-examination she said that Will (the accused’s brother) and Jamie Waring were in the car. She said “they told me to stop asking questions about Andrew Russell or I’d go missing, like Andrew Russell”. In evidence in chief she said that the accused uttered those words. However, in cross-examination, she said that it was “actually Jamie, it wasn’t Tony” who said that. Further, the cross-examination established that the words alleged do not appear at all in the interview she made with the police. DSC Maclean interviewed her in August 2009 in a police car. The interview was sound recorded. While she said something about the incident, on that version, the only words spoken were first that she asked the people in the car “what’s the problem?” whereupon Will (the accused’s younger brother) said “Just go Tony. Come on. Let’s go.” I do not accept her explanations for the absence of the version in the recorded interview. She seemed to be asserting that the police had somehow misinterpreted her words or failed to put the conversation in the statement. This explanation ignores the fact that this was not a statement where the witness tells the police something and the police then record it in writing. This was an interview that was recorded and then transcribed. As Mr Young attempted to point out to Ms Morrison, these were her words, not the words of the police.
	
	
	I will give Ms Morrison’s evidence very little weight.
	


BATHURST SITTINGS


	
	The Court sat in Bathurst from 30 March 2015 to 7 April 2015 and heard evidence from 24 local witnesses. There was also a view of some 14 locations in Bathurst and in the environs of Sofala.
	
	
	Ian Wilson lived in the street that backed onto Cripps Place in Kelso and knew Mr Russell from seeing him walking around there. On Wednesday 22 July 2009, police attended Mr Wilson’s premises to ask about the disappearance of Andrew Russell. He said that he saw Mr Russell walking up through a paddock that connected the two streets. He said this was “a week or so beforehand” although the point of reference to this was unclear in his evidence in chief. In cross-examination, he said that the sighting was “a couple of days before” he heard that Andrew had gone missing. That would put it around 18 June 2009. He also said that it was a week or two before he made his statement on 22 July 2009 – he would put it “up to two weeks before police came to his house”. That would place the sighting in the first week of July.
	
	
	If Mr Wilson’s evidence were accepted, it does some violence to the Crown case theory that the murder of Mr Russell occurred on 2 June 2009. However, his evidence was far from convincing and I do not accept it. I find that he was mistaken as to the date he last saw Mr Russell.
	
	
	Peter Flanagan lived in Slim Street Bathurst and said that he last saw Andrew Russell at Bruce Herbert’s house on Bruce’s birthday. It was the same day as Whack Quinlan’s funeral, that is 2 June 2009. He said that Mr Russell said he was going into town to buy Mr Herbert a birthday present and some new joggers. His current joggers were a little the worse for wear (or “fucked” as Mr Flanagan put it). He conceded that his memory and evidence may have been affected by his state of intoxication and that he had told the police that he was drunk since the time he woke up.
	
	
	Luisa Denaro went to school with the accused. She visited him and Jodi at Cripps Place with her partner John Carney and was told by the accused that he had hurt his hands in a fight. She was shown a photograph (by somebody other than the accused) on a mobile ‘phone depicting Mr Russell with two black eyes and was shown a bed which had blood stains on it. The case proceeded on the basis that this occurred sometime after the March assault. She was told that the motive for the assault was that Mr Russell was flirting with Ms Biles. Her evidence as to where this conversation occurred was challenged in cross-examination, there being some evidence suggesting that Ms Biles and the accused left the Cripps place house very soon after the incident.
	
	
	Lisa Smith (nee Birmingham) knew the accused but did not know Andrew Russell. She gave evidence of a gathering of 7-8 people at the home of Sarah Hitchins at which the accused said to her “I didn’t kill him.” She said he admitted assaulting him and had a vague memory that this occurred in West Bathurst. She said this happened on “race weekend” which is to say in October 2009. By that stage rumours were circulating implicating the accused in Mr Russell’s disappearance. She also gave evidence of a person called Skye Laffin saying that she had heard that Mr Russell ended up in Ms Smith’s boot. She took this as a suggestion that she had assisted the accused in disposing of the body. She called the accused who denied any involvement. He said, “I only bashed him. I didn’t kill him. It’s all bullshit.” In cross-examination she said that the accused was “pretty pissed” at the gathering at Ms Hitchins’ and that he was big-noting himself. She also said that she was only 40% sure that she was told that the assault happened in West Bathurst. In re-examination Mrs Smith agreed that the form that the “big-noting” took was to brag about not killing Mr Russell but assaulting him.
	
	
	Jennifer Coloton was a nurse at the Bathurst Base Hospital. She met Andrew Russell a number of times when he was being treated at the hospital. She first met him about a year before July 2009 when he was in the “transit lounge” which is the slang term for the discharge unit at the hospital. She saw him again two weeks later and told him that he should take better care of himself. She saw him again 6-8 weeks later and spoke to him. Mr Russell was a regular at the hospital. The last time she saw him at the hospital was in March 2009 when he was in a ward being treated for injuries caused by an assault.
	
	
	17 June 2009 was Ms Coloton’s birthday and she and a Mr Langford went to Bunnings. This involved traveling east on the Sydney Road from Bathurst towards Kelso. On a bridge known as the “White Bridge” she saw somebody who she believed at the time was Andrew Russell. Her level of certainty of that belief has changed over time.
	
	
	A week or so after her birthday, work colleagues told her about media reports that Andrew Russell was missing. This caused her to approach the police. She told the police that she was “absolutely positive” that the person she saw was Mr Russell. She told her partner (Mr Langford) that she was 98% certain. However, her evidence in chief was couched in far less positive terms.
	
	
	Given that her evidence of seeing Mr Russell on 17 June 2009 is contrary (and thus adverse) to the Crown case that Mr Russell was killed by the accused on the night of 2 June 2009, I granted leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine. She was reminded that there was a long period of time between her last certain observation of Mr Russell (in March) and the sighting on 17 June 2009. She agreed that she had told police that he was walking in a different manner to what she had previously seen. When she had seen him at hospital he “shuffled” with his head down and shoulder hunched. The man she saw on 17 June 2009 was walking upright and briskly. Her thought was that Andrew must have “turned a corner”. She agreed with the Crown Prosecutor that she based her identification on the length of the man’s hair and the appearance of his face. In retrospect, she conceded that she could not be positive that the man she saw on 17 June 2009 was Andrew Russell.
	
	
	She was then cross-examined by Mr Young SC. She conceded that the observation was made in “bright daylight” and that, in spite of the differences concerning his gait and posture, she was “absolutely certain” that it was Mr Russell when she first spoke to police. She agreed that she knew that her evidence was contrary to other evidence in the investigation and that this “played on her mind”. How she became aware of this was not made clear.
	


Dangers of Ms Coloton’s identification evidence


	
	In considering this evidence, I must remind myself about the dangers of visual identification evidence. Although this is not evidence tendered against the accused, it is still appropriate to remember that the history of the criminal law is littered with examples of eyewitnesses making mistakes when providing identification evidence. Even very confident and certain witnesses can be mistaken when it comes to making visual identification of other people. In this case, the witness herself acknowledges that she is no longer “absolutely positive” that the man she saw was Mr Russell. The following matters may affect the reliability of the identification:
	



	
	She was in a car travelling at around 70km/h so that the duration of her observation must have been limited. There is no evidence that they stopped or slowed down to make the observation or to confirm the identification.
	
	
	She and the man observed were both travelling in an easterly direction. Thus, for the most part, her observations were from behind. This reduced her opportunity to observe the man’s face.
	
	
	The posture and gait of the man observed were inconsistent with Ms Coloton’s knowledge of the posture and gait of Mr Russell.
	
	
	Ms Coloton had not seen Mr Russell for at least two and possibly three months.
	



	
	Against that, I must also consider:
	



	
	The lighting conditions were ideal for her observations.
	
	
	Mr Russell was reasonably well known to the witness.
	
	
	She immediately (thought that she) recognised Mr Russell and said something to her partner.
	
	
	As soon as she heard that Mr Russell was missing, she contacted the police and made a statement. This was shortly after the purported identification and she said that she was absolutely positive that the man that she had seen was Mr Russell. She told her partner that she was 98% sure that it was him.
	
	
	The observations as to Mr Russell’s gait may have been affected by his ill-health at the times she saw him. On the other hand, other witness also referred to his stoop and the fact that he walked with his head down. It is known that he was not well on 2 June 2009.
	



	
	Like the evidence of Ian Wilson, Ms Coloton’s evidence cannot stand with the Crown’s theory that Mr Russell was murdered on 2 June 2009.
	
	
	Brett Langford was Ms Coloton’s partner. He was present in the car when Ms Coloton believed that she saw Mr Russell on 17 June 2009. He confirmed her evidence that it was her birthday and they were travelling to Bunnings at Kelso to look at tiles. He stressed that Ms Coloton could only have seen the man “briefly” because they were travelling at 70km/h. However, he agreed that she said “I haven’t seen him for a while” meaning that he had not been into the hospital for a while. This confirmed Ms Coloton’s immediate recognition of Mr Russell as the man walking south on the Sydney Road on 17 June 2009. He said that the man was walking south on the footpath on the left hand side of the road and that the car he was driving was in lane 2 (of 4), that is the centre left lane heading east. He accepted that Ms Coloton said that she was “98% certain” that the man she had seen was Mr Russell.
	
	
	Joanne Skinner lived in Cripps Road near the house where Mr Russell, the accused and Jodi Biles were living at the time of the assault in March 2009. She was woken one evening by noises coming from across the road at 9 Cripps Place. She had a clear view and saw Tony Simmons hitting Andrew. She said that after the first assault she did not see any injuries or blood on Mr Russell. She said that she spoke to Tony who was blind drunk and said he was just teaching Andrew how to fight. Later there was a more serious fight and she saw that Mr Russell had a swollen eye.
	
	
	She claimed that after the police and ambulance came, Andrew Russell was playing up and only got into the ambulance after he was “tasered”. She said this more than once. There is no other evidence that Mr Russell was tasered during this incident and it would be a surprising eventuality given that he was the victim of the assault and had obvious injuries. I reject that part of Ms Skinner’s evidence and my rejection of that part makes it very difficult to place much reliance on anything she said.
	
	
	Luke Salter was a resident of Sofala and a long term friend of the accused. He and the accused used to go trail bike riding together. One of the locations was near a waterhole on the Turon River about 2-3 km “upriver” from Sofala. Locals know it by the name of “Jackie Kirins”. It was so named for a former resident of the area. Mr Salter said that one occasion after they had been riding, the accused said that the area would be a good place “to get rid of someone” or “to bury a body”. In view of things that the accused later said to undercover police officers, this is a potentially important conversation. I will set out the relevant portion of Mr Salter’s evidence:
	


“Q. Now do you recall back at the time you spoke to Detective Hadley about 18 months before that do you recall motorbike riding with Tony Simmons?

A. Yeah, I know the one you're talking to. Again that's a reference to, it's like the statement that he made to me while I was out motorbike riding about it being a good place to bury a person.

Q. Tell us about that conversation?

A. We were out just riding, just doing the usual. Had a few beers and what not after we've had a ride and he just jokingly said it in like, I don't know whether he was serious or not, but being so many mine shafts and so secluded he said it's a good place to get rid of someone if you don't want to find anyone.

Q. This lady has to take down every word you say.

A. Yeah.

Q. So you've got to go a bit more slower.

A. A bit slower, yeah, sorry.

Q. Start again. That last sentence?

A. Yeah, he said, in reference like, after we had a few beers and what not, whether he was joking or what not, ""That's a good place to rid of someone.”

Q. Were they his words?

A. Pretty much to the words, ""A good place to bury a body"" were, I think, was his exact words.

Q. What did you say?

A. I just laughed it off. Tony's always been a bit of a crap talker, if you know what I mean.

Q. He was a bit of a what?

A. A bullshit artist. You know, likes to exaggerate a small story beyond what it is or beyond its capabilities.

Q. Is that what you thought it was?

A. Yeah, just laughed it off.

Q. But it was something you remembered?

A. Oh, it was just, yeah. With everything that happened afterwards, it's just something that's kinda stuck in me head.”


	
	In cross-examination it emerged that this conversation occurred many years before. When it was put to him, Mr Salter agreed that he had not been trail bike riding with the accused since 2005 or 2006. (The accused later gave evidence that he did not even know [Salter] until he “was 10 – about 2010 - 2009”.) In answer to a question from me Mr Salter said:
	


“Q. Mr Salter, are you saying that the remark that you say was made by Mr Simmons was made some years before you heard anything about the disappearance of Mr Russell?

A. I had I knew nothing about anyone missing at that time and it's just you know, it's just something that stuck in me head. You know, it's not something that you'd normally say.”


	
	He gave descriptions of the topography of the area around the waterhole and detailed evidence about the number of mine shafts in the area and the nature of those mine shafts.
	
	
	Casey Skinner is the daughter of Joanne Skinner. She lived in Kelso not far from her mother and the house where Mr Russell, the accused and Jodi Biles were living in March 2009. She claimed that the things she told police were her mother’s version of events. Contrary to her police statement she said that she had not seen a video depicting the assault of Mr Russell. She said that all she saw was a blur. Contrary to the statement, she said she was not present when Tony Simmons picked up a chest of drawers and that he did not (then) say that he had seen Andrew Russell and given him a “touch up”. Under force of the Crown’s cross-examination she said that there was a conversation when the chest of drawers were dropped off. She said that what the accused actually said was, if he saw Mr Russell in the future “he was going to give him another touch up”. As best as I could understand it, she said that this occurred sometime in mid-June.
	
	
	If true, this evidence makes it unlikely that the accused had already killed Mr Russell because he would have not cause to threaten to assault him in the future. However, I propose to disregard Ms Skinner’s evidence altogether. She was an entirely unsatisfactory witness. She made a variety of excuses for what she said in her statement. She said she was very young and under the influence of her mother. She said her mother had tried to make her say that she had witnessed the assault. She said that she was anxious and nervous and that the police “twisted my words around”. She said she suffered from anxiety.
	
	
	Rebecca Cassidy was another unhelpful witness. She claimed to have little or no memory of any relevant event or conversation and explained this by saying:
	


“At or around that time I was diagnosed with depression, so that's why my memory is vague at the moment.”


	
	The Crown sought to revive the witness’ memory by providing her statement. She remained vague and her evidence was unhelpful.
	
	
	Melissa O’Donoghue gave evidence of a conversation she had one night when she and Graeme Hinchcliffe were staying at the home of Jodi Biles and the accused. She said that there were other conversations where the accused said that the reason for the first fight was that Mr Russell wanted to learn how to fight. But other incidents were motivated “mainly over jealousy”. One incident occurred because Mr Russell had attacked Jodie and she was out the front of the house, very upset, when the accused came home. This made the accused angry. She gave evidence of one particular conversation which occurred on a day when accused and Graeme had played Xbox all day. They had then gone to get some beer and the accused was chopping up some cannabis. Jodi was still playing Xbox and the accused, the witness and Mr Hinchcliffe were sitting at a table. She described the conversation:
	


“A. To be honest, I don't exactly recall how we even got on that actual subject about Andrew, but yeah, well, we started talking about my partner was asking him what had happened before, 'cause we knew about Andrew having to be in hospital and everything on that previous fight and then the other fight had got brought up and Tony had said that they were drinking one night and Jamie was sleeping with two Jodies sorry, Kelly and Jodie, this other Jodie at the time. Tony was with his Jodi and Andrew was getting a bit carried away, drunk, getting a bit sleazy with the girls and that's what the big problem was about and Tony got a bit upset because he tried doing something to Jodie and so he started punching into him and he said that ""I just kept hitting him a few times and then he dropped to the ground and he was crawling along"", he said, his words were, ""He was crawling along like a caterpillar and then he stopped moving"" and then he said sorry, before that he said he had a table leg and he was hitting him and then, all of a sudden, he stopped moving and he thought maybe he was just out of it, like knocked out. And he said he tried kicking him and stuff and then he wasn't moving and that's when he realised like he wasn't even alive and then he said that he told the women and kids to get out of the house and he got rid of Andrew. He didn't tell me where he got rid of him and he didn't tell me who had helped him get rid of him.

Q. Did he say where that took place?

A. Well, I was under the impression, from what was being said that Jamie's, that's what they told me, that they went to Jamie's and Kelly's place.

Q. That is, Jamie Waring's place?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And Kelly?

A. And Kelly.”


	
	Ms O’Donohue’s cross-examination was delayed by two days because of an incident that occurred upon her leaving the witness box on 30 March 2015 (this resulted in the trial being adjourned on 31 March while the incident was investigated by police) and the view on 1 April 2015. She resumed her evidence on 2 April. She gave further evidence in chief concerning two incidents in which she alleged that she was approached by a person (Rachel Hadley) and asked to modify, change or recant her evidence.
	
	
	Ms O’Donohue said that after she gave evidence on 30 March 2015, Rachel Hadley approached her outside court:
	


“I - as she first walked up to me, I said, ‘I'm sorry about everything that's happened.’ She placed her arms around me and said, ‘It was okay’ and she stated ‘that Tony has been thinking. He said, ‘Why don't you just get up on the stand and say that it was all a lie?’ He was just saying it to, sort of, big note himself in a way in front of my partner, Graeme’, like giving himself a big reputation.”


	
	Ms O’Donoghue said that Rachel Hadley had also spoken to her when they bumped into one another at Bathurst gaol when they were each visiting an inmate there. On that occasion, Ms Hadley suggested that Ms O’Donoghue “recant” and “just take back the statement”. She said that this happened about 8 months ago.
	
	
	Ms O’Donoghue’s evidence of the admissions allegedly made by the accused did not stand up to Mr Young’s challenge in cross-examination. By the end of the cross-examination I was completely convinced that I could not act on her evidence. I found her demeanour to be theatrical and unconvincing. More importantly, it emerged that she had made a significant prior inconsistent statement and may have had a motive to lie to the police. I did not believe her evidence.
	
	
	The first matter that raised a question mark over her credibility was the fact that, having heard this alleged confession to murder (or manslaughter) she did nothing for a number of weeks. She then made an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers, identifying herself only as Melissa.
	
	
	That first call was made at around the time that the witness knew that there were warrants out for her and that she may be arrested for breaching parole. She said the timing was just a coincidence and that she had made the call “for my conscience” and “because I want that poor boy put to rest and I was scared for my safety. I don’t want to be involved in this.” She agreed that she had told Crime Stoppers that:
	


“Tony was boasting how he killed Andrew Russel by bashing him with the leg from a coffee table with the help of Jamie Waring.

When Tony realised Andrew was dead he stuffed him into the boot of his car. I asked Tony what the fight was about and he said it was over his girlfriend Jodi Biles.”


	
	She agreed that she had not made a formal written statement until 12 May 2011. In that statement she said that she thought that the fight was about Jodi Biles but it could have been over Jodie Wright. She denied saying that to the police or at least could not remember it. She also denied knowing that the precise location of the incident and did not know that the address was in Slim Street Bathurst.  
	
	
	However, she was then cross-examined about a conversation she had with police at Bathurst Court House on 4 April 2010. The cross-examination was based on a note taken by a police officer at the time and there was no objection to the cross-examination. The note made specific reference to Slim Street. Ms O’Dononghue denied ever referring to that address.
	
	
	There was then cross-examination on a note taken in the cells a month later when the witness was arrested on the warrants. Again, there was no objection or suggestion that counsel was not accurately putting what was recorded by the police officer. That note recorded her as saying:
	


“Simmons started saying that he was present at 3 Slim Street the night he went missing, referring to Andrew. Simmons went on to say that Russell started trying to seduce Jodie Wright which angered Jamie Waring. Waring proceeded to beat Russell with a coffee table. Simmons admitted that he assisted Waring in beating up Russell. This occurred on the lounge room floor.""


	
	That version of what the accused admitted is entirely different to the evidence the witness gave in her evidence in chief. She steadfastly denied having said it although she later claimed to have said “Jamie and Andrew had had issues over Andrew being sleazy with the girls, yes”.
	
	
	The witness also denied that she was motivated by the fact that she was going to court for the breach of parole and thought she could obtain some benefit from the police. She denied that police had provided her “with any assistance in any way, shape or form around the time she made the statement in May 2011”. She was then shown a letter in which the same detective to whom she had made the statement (Detective MacLean) had sought to assist her with housing. At that point the witness split hairs:
	


“A. Not relocation. I didn't have a house. I was homeless with a young child. He was trying to get me into a refuge because I had nowhere to live.

Q. Did you forget that, did you, when I asked --

A. Yes, I did, to be honest.”


	
	When the letter was marked for identification, and without having been asked a question, the witness volunteered:
	


“WITNESS: May I just say that I have never received anything from the police, anything from the department for this. I have only recently got a place and it's my third child. I've lived on the streets most of my life. So, no, the police have not helped me in any way. I have a support letter with me, which I forgot about, yes.”


	
	The witness agreed that her partner, Graeme Hinchcliff, made a statement on 27 July 2011 (a couple of months after her statement) and that they had spoken to one another about the matter. She denied concocting the story and said “there must be a lot of people in this world that think alike then because, if we’ve all concocted the story, then we must all be psychic”. When asked who she was talking about, the only person she nominated was Mr Hinchcliff. In fact, as far as I can tell, there is no other evidence of a similar confession and all of the people supposedly present at the time of the events subject of the confession (Jamie Waring, Kelly Burns, Jodi Biles and Jodie Wright) have given no evidence that anything of the kind actually took place.
	
	
	As I have said, I did not believe her evidence when she gave it. However, I must return to consider the confession that she alleges in the light of all of the other evidence in the case. In particular, her evidence received direct corroboration from her partner Graeme Hinchcliffe.
	
	
	Graeme Hinchcliffe gave a similar account of the alleged admission attested to by Ms O’Donoghue. He said that while he believed that Jamie Waring was present, the accused did not say that Mr Waring assisted. In this respect there was some inconsistency in his version of the conversation and that of Ms O’Donoghue. He said that he had a “vague recollection” of being told that;
	


“… they’d wrapped him up in carpet or lino or something. May have. Don’t quote me. It was a long time ago.”


	
	He initially agreed that he was present when Melissa made the call to Crime Stoppers. However, in cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:
	


“Q. What I want to suggest to you Mr Hinchcliffe is that what you've just told us and what you told the Crown and certainly what you told the police is not an accurate reflection of what this conversation was about at all, what do you say?

A. I'd like to know how you come to that conclusion.

Q. What I'm putting to you is that what you've done when you spoke with the police is simply to repeat what you heard Jodie saying over the phone?

A. How could I hear Jodie saying anything over the phone?

Q. She was talking to a police officer at Bathurst Police Station over the phone when you were there?

A. Was she?

Q. I beg your pardon. You told us about moving house and who you moved in with and you told us that you were aware that Melissa had made a call to the police, remember?

A. After we had moved out of Tony's house.

Q. And you see, you told the police that you were sitting next to her when she was on the phone?

A. I was.

Q. And you overheard what she said on the phone?

A. Yes.

Q. Well, I suggest to you what you've eventually told Detective McLean is simply to repeat some of what Melissa said to the police?

A. No, I I don't agree with what Tony's been charged with, whether he's innocent or guilty, I do not agree with the whole situation behind it all. Andrew was not a well man.

Q. Well, I am not asking you to make a speech.

A. Okay.

Q. I am putting to you that Tony didn't say these things—

A. Well, I am putting to you—

Q. —and you are simply backing up what Melissa told the police?

A. I'm putting to you I wouldn't be sitting here right now if he didn't say these things.”


	
	Unlike his partner, Mr Hinchcliffe’s evidence was not completely destroyed by cross-examination. However, I found the exchange to which I have just referred unconvincing. Further, he did nothing for well over a year about the fact that he had heard what amounted to a confession to murder. He said that his memory was “shot” and agreed that he now knew that there was another incident involving an assault on Mr Russell which was caused by his treatment of Jodi Biles.
	
	
	I will return to consider the evidence of this alleged admission in the light of all of the evidence in the case.
	
	
	Michael O’Neill gave evidence of the last sighting of Andrew Russell before, on the prosecution case, he was picked up and murdered by the accused. Like the evidence of Ms Coloton, the evidence is in the nature of identification evidence and must be treated with some caution. There is no doubt in my mind that Mr O’Neill (like Ms Coloton) gave honest evidence. The question is whether the evidence is reliable. I remind myself of the general issues of reliability that surround evidence of identification.
	
	
	Mr O’Neill was driving his son to work at around 10:45pm on 2 June 2009. He was travelling east on the Sydney Road (Great Western Highway) and was making a right hand turn into Littlebourne Street (the Oberon Road). He saw a man standing in the intersection, on the road, effectively not moving. He then drove his son to the Simplot factory and returned to the intersection. The man was still in the intersection. He was standing in the path of Mr O’Neill’s vehicle. Mr O’Neill told him to “Get off the road. It’s dangerous” and told him to go and sit on the grass verge. Mr O’Neill was 3 metres from the man and they were looking directly at one another for around 10 seconds. At one stage Mr O’Neill agreed that it was at around 10:30pm but it may have been a little later than that (based on the time of a 000 call). Although it was night time and dark, Mr O’Neil said the street lighting made the lighting conditions “quite good”. He could see the man “very well”. The man moved in the direction of the grass verge but Mr O’Neill did not think that he got that far. In other words, he was still on the roadway, in the intersection. Mr O’Neill made his left hand turn, pulled over and called “000”. There is a record that the call was made shortly before 11:56pm. He then left the area and saw a police car heading in the direction of the intersection.
	
	
	Mr O’Neill was contacted by the police at “some point in time after that”. He said that he made a statement on 4 August 2009 but was shown a photograph by police about two to three weeks after the sighting. Evidence given by Detective Fawkner later in the trial established that Mr O’Neil was shown the photograph on 25 June 2009.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr O’Neill said that when he was shown the photograph he was “very confident” that it depicted the person he had seen at the intersection. He agreed that his statement said that he was “quite confident”. He thought that the distinction between that state of certainty and “very confident” was a matter of “semantics”. (An investigators note tendered in evidence toward the end of the prosecution case said that he told Senior Constable Gunning that he was “fairly certain” that the photograph depicted the man he saw on 2 June 2009.)
	
	
	He said that there had been some discussion between himself and his son at the time when he first saw the man in the intersection (“what’s this guy doing” or “he going to get hit there”) but was not aware whether his son was ever approached by police to make a statement or identification. He agreed that he had been shown photographs of a man inside a retail store and that he could not identify these as being the man in the intersection. However, he said that he had seen those photographs previously in the media. Those photographs were the still images taken form the CCTV at Chip-N-Dales newsagency, later tendered as exhibit C.
	


Dangers of identification evidence of Mr O’Brien


	
	I remind myself of the dangers that attach to identification evidence. In relation to Mr O’Brien I note the following matters to which I must pay particular regard:
	



	
	While Mr O’Brien was a particularly impressive witness, there is no established correlation between the confidence with which a witness purports to identify somebody and the accuracy and reliability of that identification.
	
	
	Mr O’Brien was identifying a stranger.
	
	
	Mr O’Brien was driving at the time of the first observation and the period of the observation must have been very short.
	
	
	The observation took place at night.
	
	
	There was a period of around 3 weeks between the time of the observation (2 June 2009) and the time of the identification of the photograph (later shown to be 25 June 2009).
	
	
	The “identification” was of a single photograph. He was not shown an array of photographs requiring Mr O’Brien to select or distinguish. I should stress that this is not meant to be a criticism of the police. There was no legal requirement that he been shown an array and the process was part of a missing person investigation.
	
	
	Mr O’Neill had seen the still images from the CCTV at Chip’N’Dales in the media before making the identification but said that those had insufficient detail for him to make an identification.
	



	
	Against that:
	



	
	Mr O’Brien was a very impressive witness.
	
	
	He was focussed on the man from a relatively short distance (about 3 metres).
	
	
	The street lighting was good.
	
	
	He was sufficiently concerned to speak directly to the man and to call 000. This suggests that he was focussed and concentrating during the period of the observation.
	
	
	The observation was not “fleeting”. He saw him for a short period as he was driving to his son’s work and for a longer period (around 10 seconds), during which time he was looking straight at him, on his return.
	



	
	Jamie Waring was a cousin of Andrew Russell’s father. He became friends with Andrew and his sister (Kiara White) when they were growing up. Mr Waring described Mr Russell’s liver condition and his alcohol problem. Mr Russell used to consult Mr Waring about problems he was having. He described Mr Russell coming to his place with blood on his jacket after he was released from hospital following the March assault. After that, Mr Russell stayed between his father’s house and Mr Waring’s house at 3 Slim Street Bathurst. Mr Russell was worried about being out at Kelso by himself after the incident in March.
	
	
	On 2 June 2009 Mr Russell was at 3 Slim Street. Also present were Mr Waring, Kelly Burns, Jodie Wright and Mr Waring’s children. All but Mr Waring and one of the children, who was sick, went into town. (The fact that Mr Waring did not go into town brings into question Paula Morrison’s evidence that he was present during the first incident she described.) Mr Russell intended to buy his father a birthday present and a new pair of shoes for himself. When Mr Russell returned he had bought some shoes and then left to visit his father. He returned about 8 o’clock and Mr Waring described him as “Major shit faced, yeah … too drunk for my liking.” Mr Waring was worried about the amount Andrew had drunk “because of his liver and what not, like you know what I mean”.
	
	
	Mr Waring wanted Andrew Russell to stay at home and refused his invitation to go to the Dudley Hotel for a drink. Mr Russell left. Mr Waring believed he was going to the Dudley Hotel and hoped that he would return to 3 Slim Street. The Dudley Hotel is a short distance (1.2 km) from 3 Slim Street. Mr Russell did not return and Mr Waring has not seen him since. In the weeks before 2 June 2009 the pair had seen one another regularly.
	
	
	At the beginning of his evidence, Waring denied having anything to do with Mr Russell’s disappearance or death. This denial was elicited in the context of evidence from Melissa O’Donoghue and Graeme Hinchcliffe that the accused told them that Waring was present or involved in the assault of Mr Russell with a chair leg that led to his death.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Waring agreed that in June 2009 he was in a relationship with both Kelly Burns and Jodie Wright. He confirmed that he had no contact with the accused around the period of 2-5 June 2009. He was unaware whether Mr Russell had “any feelings towards Jodie Wright” but agreed that Mr Russell was “worried that I was seeing Jodie when I should be with Kelly, you know what I mean like”. He denied that he had gone away or “gone AWOL” on the 3rd and 4th June 2009. However, he stayed at 3 Slim Street (Kelly’s place) and avoided Jodie. Kelly told Jodie that he was not there. (As I understand it, this cross-examination arose out of evidence that was expected to come from Jodie Wright that Mr Waring had gone missing in the days after 2 June 2009. As it turned out, Jodie Wright did not attend to give evidence.)
	
	
	On 2 June 2009 he had consumed enough Bourbon to make him “feel comfortable”. This was a “ten pack” of “Woodstock”. There was no evidence as to exactly how much alcohol this entailed although I suspect it would be enough to make most people quite drunk. Mr Waring explained that he was a seasoned drinker (my words).
	
	
	He gave evidence about being placed in the same cell as the accused while at Wellington Gaol. He agreed that he did not believe that this was a coincidence and that it was possible the cell was being monitored by listening device. It was in that context that he said to the accused that he would deal with the accused if he found out that the accused had anything to do with Mr Russell’s disappearance. He was asked whether the accused said anything to the effect that the accused was being blamed for Mr Russell’s disappearance and that if he found out that Mr Waring was involved he would belt him. He replied:
	


“No, he said to me, like, he basically denied having to do anything with it, you know what I mean, like. And him belt me, well, yeah, I'd like to see that, you know what I mean, but that's a different story. You know what I mean, like, yeah.”


	
	Kelly Burns lived at 3 Slim Street with Mr Waring and confirmed much of his evidence. There were some minor inconsistencies in the timing of events on 2 June 2009 but generally they presented a consistent account of Mr Russell’s movements that day. She said that she went into town with Jodie Wright, Mr Russell and her daughter and met up with Casey Benger. They looked in several shops for a pair of shoes. Eventually he bought a pair from Payless Shoes in the new Woolworths plaza. The shoes were like those depicted in Ex D. They went to Chip-N-Dales newsagency where Andrew bought some Parramatta Eels drinking glasses for his father’s birthday. Ms Burns agreed that Ex C showed Andrew in the newsagency. They went to the Knickerbocker Hotel for a drink. At that point they separated and Mr Russell bought some VB twist tops and headed to visit his father.
	
	
	Andrew arrived back at Slim Street at around 7pm. He was drunk and jaundiced. He was there for about 1 ½ - 2 hours and then headed off for The Dudley Hotel. When he left, “there was me, Jamie, Jodie Wright and my daughter and two sons” at 3 Slim Street. At around 9:30pm Jamie walked Jodie Wright to the corner shops where she was to be picked up and taken to a refuge where she was living. Jamie Waring stayed at the house for the next four days and Jodie did not come around during that time. Jodie tried to telephone but Ms Burns “wouldn’t let him answer the ‘phone”.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Burns agreed that Andrew was “jaundiced and very alcoholic”, well and truly affected by alcohol and “a bit all over the place”. He had a Velcro wallet that Jamie had given him. She said he had got around $600 in benefits that day. She said that medication found at her home belonged to Andrew Russell and that he had picked up a script that day “for all his medications”.
	
	
	She was asked why she did not report Mr Russell missing if she had expected him to return and she said:
	


“A. Because I didn't realise he had gone missing. I figured by the next day I thought he'd gone to his dad's place. And then the day after that someone had told me that they'd seen him and that he was fine, and Jodie Wright told me that she'd seen him out at Kelso and that he was okay and that he was heading to Queensland to go and live with his mother. And then all of a sudden everyone else started stories and told me that he was fine. And then when Sue rang me four days later saying that she hadn't seen him and hadn't seen him for four days, that's when I worried. I do apologise for that.

Q. But it was only four days before she rang you, was it?

A. Four days later after 2 June so it would have been like 6 June she rang me to ask me if I'd seen him.”


	
	In answer to questions from me she said that the conversation with Jodie Wright where Ms Wright said that Andrew was in Kelso occurred on 3 June 2009 in Kings Parade. She said that she had never heard of Paula Morrison.
	
	
	Kiara White is the daughter of Susan Wallace and the step-sister of Andrew Russell. She gave an account of the March assault that bore almost no resemblance to a version that she apparently provided to the police on the night of the incident. That version was recorded in a police note book and signed by Ms White. The original version did not refer to the accused hitting Mr Russell at all. The version she gave in Court made no reference to Mr Russell’s conduct toward Jodi Biles or his aggressive behaviour on the night. Her evidence in chief was as follows:
	


“Q. What was happening?

A. They were just full on arguing. They were - Tony was punching into Andrew. It was just - I don’t know how to explain it.

Q. Did you see any injuries to Andrew at that stage?

A. Yes.

Q. What were they?

A. His nose was bleeding. There was blood running down his face.

Q. Was there another person there, Jakob Peters?

A. Yes.

Q. What was he doing?

A. He was filming it.

Q. Filming it?

A. Yes.

Q. With what?

A. A phone.

Q. What, an iphone or a mobile phone?

A. I couldn’t tell you what - it was a mobile phone. I couldn’t tell you what sort of phone it was.

Q. This is while Tony Simmons was punching Andrew Russell?

A. Yes.

Q. It was being filmed by Jakob Peters?

A. Yes.

Q. Was Jodi Biles there?

A. Yes she was.

Q. What was she doing?

A. She was watching it.

Q. She was watching them?

A. Yep.”


	
	The cross-examination elicited the following from the police note book entry:
	


“When Jodie got home, me, Jamie, her and the girls were sitting in the lounge room and Andrew was sitting at the table at the back of the house. Jodie and I were talking to each other and not really paying attention to Andrew. Jodie said to me, ‘Kiara, can you stay here til Tony gets home cause I don’t feel safe with Andrew.’”

“I think Andrew must have heard her say this cause Andrew then stood up and started yelling at me to get out. I don’t know why but he didn’t yell at Jamie or Jodie to get out, just me.”

“He kept yelling at me, ‘Get out, Kiara. Now.’”

“Jodie told Andrew that I wasn’t going anywhere til Tony got back. He was out with his mates. But Andrew just wouldn’t listen. After yelling at me to get out for about five minutes, Andrew got up from the table he was sitting at and stumbled over to Jodie, the girls and I. We were all on the lounge, she was sitting on the futon and Andrew came and stood over her and looked down at her. He started yelling at Jodie, ‘Kiara’s got to get out. It’s my place. You’ve got no say in it.’ Jodie stood up and said, ‘I’ve had bigger men stand over me and I’m not scared of you, Andrew.’ Andrew got up in Jodie’s face and said, ‘You keep going, I’ll punch you in the face.’ One of Jodie’s little girls, I think it was Tori, got scared by all the yelling and started crying. She got up off the lounge and started hugging Jodie’s leg. I can’t remember what he said to Jodie then but he looked down at the little girl and started yelling at her, ‘Stop your crying. I’m sick of you, you whinging kid.’ When he started yelling at the kid, Jodie told him to stop but he just said he would yell at whoever he wanted.”

“Jodie had hold of Tori by this time and she passed her to me. Andrew got real agro at this but I don’t know why. He was mumbling stuff. He shoved her to her shoulders and she went backwards. He called her a slut or a stupid slut and tried to slap her. She put her hands up to stop him, so the slap didn’t get her head. She shoved him back and he fell on his arse. He got so angry. This was all near the front door. He turned around, crawled a bit, then got up and he started shoving Jodie to the front door.

He was screaming, ‘Get out, get out, it’s my house. I don’t want you here no more’, and then he went to hit Jodie. He had a closed fist so it would have been a punch. It didn’t hit her though cause she pushed out and pushed him out the front door. Jodie stood there and said, ‘That’s what you get’.

Andrew got up again but it took a while cause he sort of crawled up the wall. He was so cranky he was furious. He yelled, ‘Don’t push me out of my house’, and then just went at Jodie again. He was trying to push her out the front door and was yelling at her.

I thought he was going to hit her and so did Jamie. I had to hold Jamie back cause he wanted to help Jodie. Jodie then pushed Andrew back from her and he stumbled back and fell down the front stairs. He sort of turned around a bit and fell face down. Andrew was lying on the ground for a while so I brought Jodie inside and didn’t really worry about him.”

[As to the fall down the stairs, she was asked “And he fell face down on the cement path, is that right? and replied “As far as this says. I can’t recall.”]

“After a while Andrew got up and came inside. His face had a lot of blood. It was swollen. I asked him if he wanted an ambulance and he told me, no. He sat back down at the table out the back. He was sort of yelling and mumbling but I couldn’t really understand him so I didn’t worry.”

“About 10 to 15 minutes later Tony came home and Tony got a big aggro and started asking us what happened? He then told Andrew, ‘What have you done to my wife? I’m going back out and if you touch anyone you’re dead’. Tony then just left.”

“Jamie and I stayed with Jodie and the girls and Andrew just passed out on the lounge. Jodie, Jamie and I then went and hung out in Jodie’s room. A while later the police came. I didn’t call them but they asked if we were okay? We told them we were. Andrew was asleep in the lounge room and wouldn’t wake up. Not long after the police left, we all fell asleep in Jodie’s room. I don’t know what time this was.”

“I don’t know how much later it was but Tony came home again. I stayed in the lounge room with the girls. I could hear Andrew yelling. He was yelling ‘Get out, get out, it’s my place.’ I heard him yell, ‘Tony, get out the front. I’m going to flog you.’ Tony said something like, ‘You’re not worth it’. I didn’t go out I just stayed in the room with the girls.”

“Andrew was pretty violent tonight. He’s always violent when he’s drunk but he was a bit worse tonight.”


	
	Ms White claimed that she could not remember saying the things recorded in the note book and essentially claimed no memory of those things happening. However, she acknowledged that it was her signature and that she must have provided the police with that version. I treat Ms White’s evidence as to what happened during the March assault with considerable caution. I suspect that she gave a tailored account when first spoken to by the police. Why she did that is unknowable. Perhaps, she was angry with Mr Russell. However the omission of details such as the accused throwing punches and Mr Russell being taken away in an ambulance is remarkable. She now gives an account with the knowledge that her step-brother has gone missing and that the accused is on trial for murder. I simply do not know what parts of her evidence are true.
	
	
	I do, however, accept that she made some attempt to find Mr Russell once it was realised that he was missing. She put up posters and went to places that she knew he frequented. She did not find him and has not seen him since 2009.
	
	
	Wayne Burns is Kelly Burns’ brother. He was at 3 Slim Street on 2 June 2009. He saw Andrew Russell and said that Andrew left the house shortly before he (Mr Burns) departed. He said that Andrew said that he intended to go up Slim Street and get some Chinese. There is a Chinese restaurant amongst the tiny group of shops at the location known as Michelle’s Corner. Mr Burns did not recall that Mr Russell was particularly drunk but said that he may have been.
	
	
	Trevor Peters is the accused’s uncle. In 2009 he had a mobile telephone number 0422 153 815. He said that police approached him in August 2011 and asked him about three calls, 1 on the night before (2 June 2009) and two the following morning. He agreed that a young man called Corri Maguire was staying with him at the relevant time. He lived near the shops known as Michelle’s Corner and that there was a pay ‘phone at that location. He said that he later moved to Penrith and sometimes the accused would stay at his place. He initially said that he didn’t notice anything unusual about his nephew’s behaviour during those visits but then acknowledged that the accused was using ice at the time.
	
	
	Jacob Flood was a neighbour of the accused. He bought a tropical fish from the accused. The accused showed him a photograph and told him it was a photograph of Andrew Russell. Police officers interviewed him in 2013 about evidence that suggested that he may have had some involvement in the disappearance of Mr Russell. He denied that he had any such involvement then and he denies it now. He also denied that he played any role in the disposal of Mr Russell’s body. He denied saying anything to a man called Billy Warrington to the contrary and he denied speaking to Jodie Wright about the matter. He said that he did not speak to Jodie as “I think she’s an idiot”.
	
	
	Sharon Kelly knew both Andrew Russell and Tony Simmons. She last saw Mr Russell at the Bathurst Court House on 25 May 2009. She had received various text messages and other information about Mr Russell’s disappearance. This caused her to call Crime Stoppers. She described the source of her information as rumour resulting from “yabbering”.
	
	
	Jakob Peters was another unsatisfactory witness. At one point he said:
	


“A. I can’t tell you exactly what happened. Like honestly I’m in a rehab program at the moment trying to sort my life out. I’ve had a long life of drug abuse and my memory is not that great so I can’t really tell youse what happened when I don’t know, when I can’t remember exactly what happened.”


	
	His answers on most subjects were vague and uncertain. For the purposes of s 38 of the Evidence Act, I formed the view that the witness was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence in relation to matters in relation to which it was reasonable to suppose he had knowledge. I granted leave for the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine him generally and on an interview with police on 13 March 2012. While Mr Peters acknowledged that he must have told police the things read to him from the interview, for the most part, he did not remember saying them or did not remember the incidents to which his interview related.
	
	
	Piecing it together as best I can, the following emerged from Mr Peter’s evidence in chief:
	



	
	He had a serious drug addiction at the time and his memory of events is poor.
	
	
	He was (and remains) a close friend of the accused. He had regular telephone contact up to the time of Mr Russell’s disappearance and for some years after that. At least part of the telephone contact between them was drug related.
	
	
	He was present at Cripps Place Kelso during the March assault and was of the view that the accused “overstepped the mark” and “bashed Andrew”.
	
	
	Either he or the accused took photographs or made a video recording of the incident on a mobile telephone.
	
	
	He drove with the accused in the car on a number of occasions.
	
	
	He had gone to Sofala fishing and swimming with the accused more than once. They had attended Wallaby Rock and another water hole to the east of Sofala (turning right through the town as you drive into Sofala from Bathurst). From the description provided by the witness and the evidence obtained on the view, the second water hole may have been “Jackie Kirins”. It is a spot a few kilometres out of town where there is a camping area and what might be taken to be a “4 wheel driving spot”. (It was many miles from the location on the Red Hill Road where the accused eventually took the undercover police.)
	
	
	At some stage Mr Peters went on a trip to the Sydney Casino with the accused and Kieran Moore.
	
	
	On return from that trip, he was dropped at or near Lena McFarlan’s house, near the fruit market on Sydney Road. That may have been the night of a party at Grace O’Hearne’s place. The party was to celebrate Grace’s 16th, 17th or 18th birthday.
	



	
	In view of the evidence of Mr O’Brien (the sighting of Mr Russell on the Sydney Road on the evening of 2 June 2009) and the admissions later made to undercover police (picking Mr Russell up on the Sydney Road), the temporal link between Grace O’Hearne’s birthday party and the accused and Mr Moore dropping Peters on the Sydney Road is potentially important. His evidence in chief (under cross-examination pursuant to s 38 was as follows):
	


“Q. You remembered going to the casino?

A. Yeah vaguely, yes.

Q. You remembered coming back and being dropped off near Lena McFarland’s house, near the fruit market?

A. Yeah, vaguely, yes.

Q. You remembered that that was the night that you went to - you remembered and you told the police this in 2012, that that was the night that you went to Grace O’Hearne’s birthday party?

A. Yeah, ‘cause they kept asking me about her whereabouts or something that night and it always puzzled me, I ended up looking through Facebook and that certain night, I can’t remember the date was, but there’s photos of me with Grace O’Hearne on her 17th or something birthday or 18th, I’m not sure.

Q. It might have even been her 16th birthday?

A. It might have even been her 16th.

Q. Right. That was the night when you went to her party that you got dropped off near Lena McFarland’s place at the fruit market after having been with Tony Simmons and Kieran Moore?

A. Possibly, I don’t know, don’t remember 100 per cent.

Q. The reason you looked it up on - you had looked it up on Facebook was to try and confirm where you were on that particular night, is that correct?

A. Yeah, they kept asking where I was on the - some certain night.

Q. Right, that night being 2 June 2009, you recall that?

A. Yeah, if that’s the date, well that’s when it was, well that’s when it was, I don’t remember that date, like, that’s—

Q. You recall in 2012 being asked about telephone records that the police had got for the night that Andrew Russell went missing. Do you remember the police asking you about that?

A. Vaguely, I mean I remember the police harassing me a lot about it, well not harassing me but always wanting to talk to me about this thing.

Q. Right, you remember the police wanted to talk to you because there was phone contact between you and Tony Simmons on that night?

A. No, sort of, vaguely, there was a lot of talk about all our contact that I had with Tony.”


	
	Another potentially significant part of Mr Peters’ evidence concerned the question of whether he had ever been told by Mr Simmons that he had picked up Mr Russell:
	


“Q. The police then went on to ask you about whether Tony Simmons had ever said anything to you about picking up Andrew Russell. They asked you this question, at 276, “Did he ever tell you anything about picking up Andrew Russell?” and you said - this was your answer, “I think I remember them saying that they picked him up one time and they gave him a lift.” Do you recall that?

A. No, not really. Then again, what’s that question in relation to? Like they were living with him and they did used to give him lifts, so--

Q. Well your answer was, and I’ll read it to you again. The question was this, “Did he ever tell you anything about picking up Andrew Russell?” and your answer was, “I - I think I remember them saying that they picked him up one time and they gave him a lift.” The next question was, “Who’s ‘them’?” and your answer was, “Him and Jodie.” And the police officer said, “Right” and you said, “Cause Jodie, she was the one that had the licence. She was the one always driving.” That was your answer or they were your answers on that occasion?

A. Okay.

Q. Do you remember Tony Simmons telling you something about picking up Andrew Russell?

A. No, not that I can remember.”


	
	The evidence did not improve under cross-examination by Mr Young. He continued to provide non-committal answers along the lines of “not that I can remember”, “yeah, vaguely, yes”, “no, sort of, vaguely” and “as far as I am aware”.
	
	
	The witness agreed that he had no specific knowledge about the night that Andrew Russell went missing. He said that the police were interested in a text message that had been sent to him by the accused. The question of whether the trip to the casino was the same day that he was dropped on the Sydney Road and the same day as Grace O’Hearne’s party became even less certain. He agreed that when the police asked him whether the party and the Casino trip occurred before or after Mr Russell went missing he replied, “I wouldn’t have a clue”. The witness seemed to be surprised when he was told that 2 June 2009 was not a Friday or Saturday night and then said that he could not recall whether the party was on a weekend (Friday or Saturday night) or during the week. (I note that 2 June 2009 was a Tuesday.)
	
	
	The other significant part of his evidence that was weakened in the course of the cross-examination concerned the timing of the return to Bathurst after the Casino trip. He was asked whether the group got back to Bathurst in daylight and he replied “yeah I think so yeah.” He went on to say:
	


“Because I remember we were in Sydney of a night time and we obviously would have come back and it would have been the next day, I’m guessing. So it would have been two separate days I’m thinking.”


	
	He was also reminded that he told the police that (on the night of the 16th birthday party) he had seen Tony Simmons later that night when Simmons came around to Zane O’Conner’s where the witness was drinking with “Brodie, Zane and Sam”. That evidence, if it can be relied upon, has some significance to both cases. On the one hand, the evidence is capable of undermining the suggestion that the accused picked up Mr Russell after dropping the witness off on Sydney Road. On the other hand, it may place the accused in or near Kelso late in the evening on the night of Mr O’Neill’s purported sighting of Mr Russell.
	
	
	The cross-examination also sought to establish (and, on its face, did establish) that the witness was with Ms Biles and the accused on the night before his arrest (that is, 15 January 2013). This was at Simmons’ uncle’s house in Penrith. The witness agreed that the accused was using methylamphetamine “pretty heavily” at that time and was using the night before his arrest. Further cross-examination by the Crown in re-examination appeared to challenge the evidence that the witness was with the accused that night.
	
	
	Towards the end of Mr Peters’ evidence I asked whether he remained friends with the accused until this day. He agreed that he was. This accorded with my observation that the accused and the witness smiled or smirked at each other on two occasions as the witness passed by the dock to enter the witness box. It is also consistent with the proposition that the witness was doing his best not to assist the prosecution in the case against his friend. The witness also agreed with the Crown that he had been in communication with the accused since his arrest.
	
	
	I propose to disregard any evidence given by the witness that tends to favour the accused unless that evidence is corroborated by evidence that I otherwise accept. I am comfortably satisfied that he was partisan and sought to give evidence that assisted the accused, irrespective of where the truth lay.
	
	
	Luke Davis was in custody at Bathurst Gaol in 2009. He thought his period in custody was between April and November of that year and identified the period by reference to the fact that he missed both of his sons’ birthdays. He met the accused while in custody. There was a conversation in which the accused said he knew Jamie Waring (a cousin of the witness) and that “the cops had his girlfriend’s mum’s car or something like that” and that this concerned a missing person. In cross-examination he agreed that the version he gave police was that the accused said “The cops took my misses and my mum’s car over the dog, they reckon we murdered Andrew [Russell]”. He agreed that the reference to “the dog” was a reference to Jamie Waring. He denied the proposition that he told the accused that he was present when Mr Russell was murdered (or assaulted) by Jamie Waring. When the details were put to him he said “First I’ve heard of that.”
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Edmund Belfanti gave evidence concerning the search of a property on the northern bank of the Tobins Oaky Creek”. He was shown this area by an undercover officer and told that this was the area identified by the accused as the place where he and Kieran Moore had disposed of the body in a mine shaft. This was the area at 1380 Red Hill Road, the last location visited on the view. The detective described the area and the extensive searching that was carried out. No relevant evidence was located. He said the area around the bank of the creek showed signs of water erosion. The fence appeared to have been washed away. He knew the area well and some relatives lived not far away on the northern side of the Turon River (that is the side opposite the area of the search). He said the causeway at the intersection of the creek and the river was subject to flooding and that the water flowed rapidly due to the steepness of the catchment area.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Belfanti agreed that he had never asked the owners of the property to describe what the relevant area looked like in 2009. They were not asked when the fence came down. He also agreed that he had never seen the relevant area of the creek in flood and that his relatives lived on the other side of the Turon River. He agreed that the blackberry bushes would have made accessing the area near the creek bank difficult had the infestation (that was evident and cleared in 2013 and grown back by the time of the view in 2015) existed in 2009.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Edward Grabham was the officer who acted as “shower” in the course of the view. His knowledge of the brief did not appear to be comprehensive. He gave evidence that the distance between Littlebourne Street and the Evans Bridge is 1.8 km. The distance from 3 Slim Street to the Dudley Hotel is 1.2 km. The distance by road from 3 Slim Street, Bathurst to Littlebourne Street, Kelso was 6.1 km but a walking route may have been a little shorter than that.
	
	
	Mr Grabham gave evidence of a variety of excavations and searches that were carried out in locations that the evidence suggested may have been a place where the accused disposed of Mr Russell’s corpse. This included a search in the area of Wallaby Rock. It also included the area near the creek on Red Hill Road. There were other areas excavated and searched as well. Mr Grabham spoke of signs of flooding in some of these areas and of some evidence of mine shafts and castings suggesting the existence of mine shafts. None of the searches produced any results.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he said that there was only one set of gates into the paddock off the Red Hill Road but retreated from that evidence when shown a photograph taken in the course of the view. He said that he was unaware when the land was cleared of blackberries for the purpose of the search. However, he agreed that he had never seen the area when it was infested with blackberry bushes. He could not assist as to the chain of ownership of the property around 2009. He agreed that a mine shaft on the property from which it appears that the paddock had been sub-divided was excavated and searched with no relevant findings. This area was “nowhere near” the paddock that the accused had identified. He spoke to a number of former owners (at least 3) and locals and none of them provided any information that there was ever a mine shaft or “ex mine shaft” in the area that had been attended on the view.
	


THE VIEW


	
	On 1 April 2015 a view was conducted of 14 sites in and near Bathurst, Kelso and Sofala.
	



	
	The Chips-N-Dales Newsagency is in the centre of Bathurst and is where the closed circuit television footage of Mr Russell was obtained on 2 June 2009. This footage and stills of the image of Mr Russell were released to media outlets after Mr Russell was reported missing.
	
	
	The second site was the Knickerbocker Hotel, slightly up the road from the Chips-N-Dales Newsagency. Mr Russell was at the Knickerbocker on 2 June before he visited his father.
	
	
	107 Seymour Street, Bathurst was where Andrew Russell’s father lived with his Ms Wallace.
	
	
	The court then travelled to the Dudley Hotel in the west of Bathurst. This is where Mr Russell told Jamie Waring he was going to get more alcohol when he left their premises on the night of 2 June 2009.
	
	
	3 Slim Street Bathurst was where Jamie Waring and Kelly Burns lived in June 2009 and where Andrew Russell was staying in the nights before his disappearance.
	
	
	The corner of Littlebourne St and the Great Western Highway (aka ‘Sydney Road’) at Kelso is where the witness Michael O’Neil believes that he sighted Mr Russell on the night of 2 June 2009.
	
	
	The roadside near the Evans Bridge was visited. The Evans Bridge leads into Bathurst on the Sydney Road. A cadaver dog was used to search the creek and bushland area on the Kelso side of the bridge. The pedestrian footpath is separated from the traffic lanes and is on the northern side of the bridge.
	
	
	The Lions Berry Park is a small park on the right side of the Evans Bridge when facing the bridge from the Kelso side. This part of the view encompassed the Old Denison Bridge, a small bridge adjacent to the Evans Bridge. It no longer carries vehicular traffic. The site was visited to obtain a different view of the Evans Bridge.
	
	
	9 Cripps Place, Kelso is where Mr Russell lived with the accused and Ms Biles. It was the site of the March assault.
	
	
	The Sofala tip is on the southern side of Sofala. It was searched as a result of information that Mr Russell’s body may have been dumped at this location. Nothing was found.
	
	
	Wallaby Rock is an area on the Turon River on the western side of Sofala. The accused told undercover police that he pushed Mr Russell from a cliff in this area. A cadaver dog search was conducted on a large portion of the mountain and the foot of the cliff. It took Sgt Grabham almost an hour to walk to the top after crossing the river in a four wheel drive.
	
	
	The river crossing at Wallaby Rocks was used during the search to access the mountain area of Wallaby Rocks.
	
	
	Jackie Kirin’s Waterhole was an area that the witness Luke Slater said that the accused referred to as ‘a good place to bury a body’, some 5 years prior to the disappearance of Andrew Russell.
	
	
	A paddock area adjacent to the Red Hill Road and beside the Tobins Oaky Creek was a drive of around 10-15 minutes on a rough road to the east of Sofala. This is where the accused claimed to have dumped the body in a mine shaft. The paddock area was cleared and subject to an intensive search over 2 days.
	


THE COURT’s RETURN TO SYDNEY


	
	The Bathurst sittings concluded on 8 April 2015 and the Court resumed taking evidence on 9 April 2015 in Darlinghurst.
	
	
	Karlene Flood gave evidence that “I don’t know nothing about what happened”. This reflected at least part of what she said to the police. She had no memory of Tony Simmons showing her a photograph of Andrew Russell on a mobile ‘phone. Her memory was affected by “mental health issues”. She remembered Jodi Biles saying that she woke up one night and Andrew was in her bedroom looking at her.
	
	
	Jodi Biles commenced giving evidence on the second day of the trial and was stood down until the Court returned from Bathurst. She was the girlfriend of the accused at relevant times. She lived with the accused and Mr Russell at Cripps Place, Kelso until the time of the March assault. She was in a relationship with him in 2013 when the police were intercepting their telephone calls and engaged in an intensive undercover campaign. Ms Biles drove the accused to various locations where the accused met with undercover police officers. The couple have four children together and had been together since they were teenagers. They are now estranged. She is in custody serving a sentence due to expire in June but she has “other matters” and expects to remain in gaol after her current sentence expires. Meanwhile the accused is in custody on remand for the murder of Mr Russell.
	
	
	She gave evidence of the March assault. She said that Andrew Russell had been abusive towards her and she called the accused and told him. “Tony came home … and they had a fight.” However, “Tony did most of the fighting”. He was “just hitting him”. She retreated with the children into a bedroom and did not see the whole incident. She said that Jakob Peters was also present. She noticed blood but did not see Mr Russell’s face. She said that this was the second of two incidents that occurred that night. The first was when “Andrew called the police on me”. Kiara White was also present and she was still there when Tony came home. She said that she took the blame for the assault. She said that Andrew was shouting at Tony when the police came. She has only seen Andrew Russell once since that night and that was at Court on 25 May 2009.
	
	
	She said that she and the accused moved out of the house at Cripps Place that night and went to stay with a cousin (Nikki Barker) in Blayney. She said that she had a fight with the accused that night and the police attended. She took out an apprehended violence order against him and they split up for a period of time. She lived in Blayney for a few weeks and then moved to Dubbo. At “some stage” when she was living in Blayney the accused sold her a White Hyndai Excel. He had swapped his old Ford for the Excel. She did not receive it for some time after paying for it. He had done some painting on the interior of the Excel before giving it to her. The police took possession of that car from her in the course of the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Russell.
	
	
	She said that she knew Kieran Moore and “didn’t really like him”. Mr Moore owned a green VT Commodore. She agreed that in 2011 she had agreed to assist the police by speaking to Kieran Moore while wearing a listening device on her body. She visited Mr Moore twice while he was in Bloomfield Hospital.
	
	
	Ms Biles was then asked a series of questions concerning conversations that she had with the accused concerning Andrew Russell. She denied that he had said anything to her about Mr Russell’s disappearance and whether he and Kieran Moore were involved. She denied both general and specific questions concerning this. She agreed that she had made a statement to police on 25 June 2013, but said that the statement was false. She denied that accused had “at any time” told her that he was involved in the killing of Andrew Russell. She agreed that a statement she made in March 2009 about the March assault was not correct. That earlier (false) statement was calculated to exculpate the accused from responsibility for the March assault.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor sought leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Ms Biles. Mr Young SC properly accepted that the material available entitled the Crown to make the application. I granted leave to the Crown to cross-examine Ms Biles on the basis that (i) she was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence about matters upon which she ought to have knowledge about and (ii) she had made a prior inconsistent statement. After that ruling, Ms Biles was excused with her evidence to resume when the Court returned from taking evidence in Bathurst.
	
	
	Ms Biles returned to the witness box on 9 April 2015. Her affect was flat. Of the first 20 questions she was asked, she responded with the answer “yes” on 19 occasions. The other question commenced with the words “And you never returned …” She answered “no”. She was first cross-examined by the learned Crown Prosecutor and then by Mr Young SC on behalf of the accused. Without actually counting, on reviewing the transcript, I estimate that over 90% of the questions evoked a monosyllabic, single word, response. Essentially, counsel used Ms Biles as a vehicle through which to place on the record things that she had said before. Eventually, late in the day and almost at the end of Mr Young’s cross-examination, the Prosecutor raised an objection under s 42 Evidence Act. That provision allowed me to disallow leading questions in cross-examination. The Crown relied on matters in sub-s (2), suggestion that the witness was biased towards the accused. I was not convinced of that because Ms Biles seemed to be agreeing largely with the propositions put to her by both counsel. However, I upheld the objection on the basis that the evidence “would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used” (s 42(3)).
	
	
	The cross-examination by the Crown established various things that Ms Biles told police that the accused said to her. For the most part, she agreed that these were things that the accused actually said. In other words, she adopted the statements that she had made to the police. The statements she attributed to the accused were wildly inconsistent.
	
	
	Evidence was led that Kieran Moore told her that he and the accused had “killed Andrew for [me]”. This evidence was led on a limited basis and it was not relied on to prove the fact that the accused killed Mr Russell. Ms Biles later spoke to the accused and he denied the allegation. He told her that Moore was drunk and crazy.
	
	
	Ms Biles also gave evidence of the statements made by the accused in the presence of Melissa O’Donoghue and Graeme Hinchcliffe. She said that she could not remember what the accused said but agreed that in August 2011 she told police that the conversation occurred in the middle of 2010. She was playing with the kids while Melissa and Graeme were sitting at the table. She told the police that the accused said that he had assaulted Andrew and that he had killed him. He only implicated himself and nobody else. (This can be contrasted with the version given by Ms O’Donoghue and Mr Hinchcliffe who said that Jamie Waring was involved.) Ms Biles agreed with the Prosecutor’s proposition “that is true, isn’t it, that is what you heard.”
	
	
	Ms Biles gave evidence of another conversation when Mr Simmons had told her that Mr Russell’s body had been put in a “garbage bin [or a wheelie bin] at Sofala”. In that conversation, Mr Simmons said that Jamie Waring had killed him and put him in a wheelie bin at Sofala tip. Ms Biles had told her grandmother about this and her grandmother rang Crime Stoppers.
	
	
	Ms Biles next gave evidence of a ‘phone call when the accused was in custody and a conversation during a gaol visit at around the same time. This evidence was confusing. She said:
	


“... and then when everyone went back inside we were standing on the veranda talking me an Tony and while we were standing there he told me that he had killed Andrew and you were asked this question well tell me how this came about and what he actually said and you answered because I cried. I was crying and I asked him why he would say that on the phone to me, why would he bring me into it, why couldn't he just you know keep it to himself do you remember saying that?

A. Yeah I remember saying that about a phone call.

Q. The phone call that you had, did you tell Detective Hadley that Andrew Russell had told sorry that Tony Simmons had told you something about Andrew Russell?

A. On the phone?

Q. On the phone?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is what prompted the argument, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was it that he told you on the phone?

A. That he couldn't tell me what he did because of how much he loved me.

Q. And then on the verandah during that visit you told Detective MacLean that he told you that he killed Andrew, that is correct, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. That is what you told Detective MacLean?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is what you told ‑ sorry ‑ and that is what Tony Simmons told you that day?

A. Yes.

…

Q. And when you were talking on the veranda you were – it started off because you were angry about being involved in tht ‘phone conversations?

A Yes.

Q. And you askd him why he brought you into it?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he say to you – in answer to that – I killed Andrew because I love you – or words to that effect?

A. Yes.”


	
	Ms Biles agreed that she visited the accused on the day of his arrest (16 January 2013) and he asked her “to ring Kieran and ask him to go visit him.”
	
	
	Ms Biles was asked about a conversation she had with the accused when she visited him at the gaol at Silverwater (MRRC) at some time around Australia Day 2013. She initially said that she could not remember this conversation because she was using drugs at the time. However, she agreed fairly quickly that she provided the police with a version of what the accused told her along the following lines. The accused said that he and Moore were driving in her white Hyundai Excel between Kelso and Bathurst and saw Andrew Russell. He asked Moore to stop and he (the accused) got out of the car and punched Andrew. Andrew didn’t get up and they wrapped the body in plastic. They moved the body to near the Good Guys. (From the view, I know that this is a large shop on the southern side of the Sydney Road not very far east of the bridge). Ms Biles told police that the accused told her that “a few hours later” they went back, confirmed that Mr Russell had no pulse and then moved the body to the Sofala area, still driving the witness’ Hyundai Excel. They threw the body off a cliff and then picked it up again. She said, “Tony told me that it took them two hours to walk down and get Andrew because they could still see him lying down at the bottom of the cliff from the roadway”. They then put the body down a mine shaft.
	
	
	Immediately after telling her this, the accused told her that he didn’t do it and that he was innocent.
	
	
	That last comment is an example of the stark inconsistencies within the evidence of the accused’s admissions and statements. However, in this particular instance, there may be a rational explanation. It may be that the narrative described is what the accused told the witness that he told the undercover officers. This possibility was explored in the cross-examination and re-examination.
	
	
	Mr Young SC cross-examined Ms Biles in the approximate chronological sequence in which the statements she attributed to the accused occurred. First she was asked to flesh out her evidence relating to the March assault. Ms Biles confirmed that the assault occurred following an incident between her and Mr Russell in which Mr Russell tried to kick her out of the house, was threatening her and looked as though he was going to punch her in the head. Mr Russell was drunk, violent and abusive. She punched him in the head. After some “toing and froing” at the front door, Mr Russell fell face first onto the concrete path. The police came and went and she told the accused about the incident which led to “fisticuffs” between the accused and Mr Russell.
	
	
	She was then asked about the conversation that took place in the presence of the witnesses O’Donoghue and Hinchcliffe. She agreed that the words “killed him” may not have been used and also that her account of the conversation (and the conversation itself) may have been muddled (my word) by talk of the March assault and rumours that were floating around Bathurst at the time. She also said that “Tony was using drugs” at the time.
	
	
	She was asked about her relationship with Kieran Moore and agreed that she told the police that she hated him. When he drank he was “an idiot. He was abusive and horrible”. The witness did not appear to take Moore’s comments in the garage seriously.
	
	
	She was referred to her statement and confirmed that the accused at one stage told her that Jamie Waring had killed Andrew Russell and that Waring and Jodie Wright dumped the body in a wheelie bin at the Sofala tip.
	
	
	She was taken to the evidence of the telephone conversation and gaol visit. She agreed that the statement she made to police on 25 June 2012 suggested that the accused had said in the telephone call that he “killed Andrew because he loved me”. She was then shown a transcript of a recorded telephone conversation that occurred on 23 August 2011. There was reference to the accused saying “I don’t know if I’m even going to get out” and she said “the past might come back and bite you on the arse” to which the accused replied “what?” and “yeah, maybe”. She agreed that nowhere in the conversation did the accused say that “he and Kieran killed Andrew Russell”:
	


“Q. It’s just not there, is it?

A. No.”


	
	When Mr Young turned to the conversation that Ms Biles said occurred when the accused was on remand, the Crown raised the objection under s 42 Evidence Act and asked me to disallow leading questions. The application was based on the assertion that Ms Biles had “an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner” and was “sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination” (s 42(2)(b) and (c)). I was unable to make a positive finding in that regard in view of the following question an answer:
	


“Q. I put it to you as a bald proposition: Mr Simmons never confessed to killing Andrew when you were alone together at the gaol that day: what do you say to that?

A. No, he did.”


	
	My impression was that Ms Biles was as compliant with the Crown’s cross-examination as she was with the cross-examination conducted on behalf of the accused. For the most part, she simply agreed with the things that were put to her in completely leading form. I disallowed further leading because I was “satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not asked”: s 42(3).
	
	
	In relation to the conversation in the gaol, Ms Biles said that the accused told her what he had told the undercover police officers and said, “he told me that it’s the same thing that he’d told them”. The cross-examination finished with the following:
	


“Q. You see at paragraph 45, the last part of it?

A. Yes.

Q. You described what Mr Simmons had told you was a story, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you mean by that?

A. Because he’d told me that he had lied to the undercover police officers, and that was the story he told them.”


	
	Ms Biles was then re-examined sharply as to the fact that paragraph 45 did not say that the accused told her that he lied to the undercover officers. She agreed that the statement only said that “he told the undercover policeman the same story that he told her” and that this was “a detailed account of how he and Kieran had killed Andrew”. With the exception of the first answer (“It doesn’t”) every answer she gave in re-examination was in response to a leading question that provoked the single word answer (“yes” or “no”) that was suggested by the question.
	
	
	Stefanie Langbien gave evidence from a remote location (a room in a court house in New South Wales). I was told that this was necessary because of the fact that she lived a long distance from both Bathurst and Sydney and was caring for young children. There was no objection to the evidence being given in this way and I made the necessary order under to s 5B(1) of the Evidence (Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW).
	
	
	Ms Langbien presented as a reasonably feisty witness. She had been in a relationship with the accused during 2009. The accused came and went as he pleased – “that was Tony”. He saw her three or more times per week, usually at her rental property in Durham Street, West Bathurst. The accused led her to believe that he was going to leave Jodi Biles and the children and pursue a full time relationship with her but this never happened. The relationship had its problems and there were arguments and fights. She described one occasion when she cut herself with a knife in order to gain the accused’s attention and stop him from leaving the house. She was using a lot of drugs at the time. These were supplied by the accused who was an “amphetamine dealer”.
	
	
	She heard about the disappearance of Mr Russell on the television news. Some short time after that (“roughly a month”) she was threatening to end the relationship with the accused when he said “You’ll never get away from me because I’m Tony Simmons” and “I would never get away from him because he’s gone for a long time now”. He said he was talking about:-
	


“The guy on the news. He’s gone for a long time now. I did it. It’s a secret you will carry with you forever.”


	
	After that argument the relationship “continued to an extent”. It finally came to an end later in the year when the accused and Jodi Biles broke into her rental property, took various items of property and “pretty much trashed” the place. Much later, she received a message that Tony Simmons wanted her to contact him and there was some telephone contact while he was in custody. A couple of weeks after that Ms Langbien contacted police and told them about the conversation regarding the guy on the news.
	
	
	Ms Langbien was steadfast under cross-examination. However, I found her responses to be defensive, argumentative and sometimes non-responsive. For example, she was asked a simple question about whether the statement she made to police on 7 September 2011 “sets out as best you can remember the conversation” and she replied. “It’s six years ago, and I was under the influence of illegal substances, yes”. My impression was that the witness remained angry and resentful about the accused’s treatment of her.
	
	
	She gave some evidence about various vehicles and agreed that the accused often got lifts from different people because he had “a bit of a problem with his licence”. She also agreed that there was a lot of talk around town about the disappearance of Mr Russell.
	
	
	She agreed that she had not spoken to the accused about his alleged confession (“I did it”) when she spoke to him in gaol and there was no recording of the conversation apart from what she said to police around two years later. She said that she had never spoken to anybody about the alleged confession until she spoke to the police in September 2011. Nor had she kept a diary note or similar. The following passage is extracted from the cross-examination:
	


“Q. Now in this statement that you gave to the police, at that point in your conversation to the police, you suggested, Mr Simmons said, ‘I did it’; you remember telling us that?

A. That's correct.

Q. You remember telling the Crown that?

A. That's correct.

Q. You see, I'm not suggesting to you that there was never a conversation along these lines at the time that you told Mr Simmons you wanted him to move out, but that during the course of that argument he never used the words, ‘I did it’, that he never said that in amongst all these other things you've told us; what do you say?

A. If he chooses to believe that, then what I've stated in my statement is the best of my knowledge to what I remember. Something like that.

Q. Something like that?

A. Something like that. How could someone forget something like that? It's not you don't just, you know, so I've indicated to the best of my knowledge how the conversation went, if Tony chooses to believe otherwise, that's not my issue.

Q. You see, I just want to put it to you squarely that he did say something along the lines, and repeatedly, that he would always try and find you?

A. That's correct.

Q. But that he never included the expression, ‘It's a secret that you'll carry with you forever, because I did it’; he never said that bit?

A. He did. I stated that in my statement, that was the argument we had.

Q. You see, Miss Langbien, isn't that a confession to murder? What did you do about it?

A. Under the influence of illegal substances, I was in shock. This was a man I was in an intimate relationship with, the man I had around my child, the man I believed was making me believe he was leaving his family to pursue a relationship with me, I didn't want to believe that what he was threatening me with was the truth.

Q. What, you didn't believe it was the truth?

A. At the time I didn't want to believe it. I was in shock. Why would he threaten me with something like that?

Q. Maybe because he wanted to continue your relationship. It didn't suit him to be kicked out. He was getting the best part of the deal. He didn't want it to come to an end, did he?

A. He confessed to somebody that you've taken—

Q. No, just listen to me. You understand what I'm saying to you. He didn't want it to end. It's you that wanted it to end; is that right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. And he told you he would find you because he wanted to continue his relationship with you?

A. That's what I got from that part of the conversation, yes.

Q. And notwithstanding what he was doing with Biles, you believed that, and he had given you reason to believe that he loved you as well, or at least loved you; that is right isn't it?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. And he's this man saying that he did it, confessing to murder, and you never told a soul until two years later?

A. That's correct.

Q. Miss Langbien, the reason you didn't tell anyone about it is because he didn't say it, that is the reason, isn't it?

A. No it's not.

Q. And you have simply, in an attempt to recall this conversation, added that into the equation; that is what you have done, isn't it?

A. No I haven't.

Q. You see, what you heard was there were people in Bathurst at that stage that, to use your expression, the disappearance of Andrew was the talk of the town; is that right?

A. It happens in every town, yes, that's correct.

Q. And you'd heard at the time that the police had started to investigate Tony. That is what you told the police?

A. I was fully aware of the fact that the police had started to investigate Tony, yes.

Q. Well how does that sit with the fact that you say that you didn't know what he was talking about and you had to ask him what he meant?

A. Please remember I was highly under the influence of drugs, under the influence of a man that was controlling, and abusive, and..”


	
	Given the abusive and dependant nature of the relationship as described by the witness, it may be understandable that she did not want to believe the confession or that she did not report it to the police immediately after it was made. However, there is no real explanation for the failure to do anything about the confession in the weeks and months that followed the termination of the relationship, particularly in view of the way in which the relationship ended (with Jodi Biles and the accused committing a break and enter of her home).
	
	
	A confession such as the one attested to by Ms Langbien is easy to fabricate and difficult to disprove. Ms Langbien had some motivation to fabricate it. The delay in reporting the conversation to police, and the failure to tell anybody about it, impacts upon the credibility of this evidence. Standing by itself, I would be inclined to reject the evidence of this alleged confession out of hand. However, I should consider it in the light of all of the evidence in the case.
	
	
	Christine Wright is the mother of Jodie Wright (one of Mr Waring’s girlfriends). She knew Andrew Russell and said that he had expressed a liking for Jodie who was 16 or 17 years of age at the time. This occurred early in 2009. In cross-examination she agreed that her statement said that Mr Russell had said “I love Jodie. I am going to marry Jodie.” Because of her daughter’s age, Mrs Wright told Mr Russell to “wake up and go home”.
	
	
	Kypros Kypri was in custody at Wellington Gaol in 2012. The accused was a fellow inmate. He said that he was waiting to use the ‘phone in the print shop and “overheard a conversation on the phone that he [the accused] was having with the other person”. He said the conversation was “heavy”. He then said:
	


“After he got off the phone we just had a bit of a discussion I said what was all that about and he just, apparently it was his missus at the time or ex missus, whatever she was, and, the conversation was you know - Don't talk like that because if it comes out I will be doing 20 years gaol.”


	
	He met Jamie Waring when Waring came to share a cell with the accused. The accused later expressed the belief that the police deliberately put Waring in his cell “because he is Andrew’s cousin or someone”. Mr Kypri denied speaking with Waring other than saying hello.
	
	
	There was a brief but torrid cross-examination in which inconsistencies with his police interview and his criminal history were raised with Mr Kypri. He denied that he was a “cheat” but agreed that he had an extensive record of obtaining benefits by deception. He effectively refused to discuss the facts of his criminal history (“I don’t need to tell you, read the charge”). He agreed that he was doing his best to assist the police but denied that he had anything to gain by doing so. He denied that he was “making it up” but agreed that he was generally a dishonest person.
	
	
	In re-examination Mr Kypri said that he had not told any lies in his evidence.
	
	
	Taken at its highest, the probative value of this evidence is marginal. Precisely what the conversation meant (assuming it occurred) is difficult to safely deduce. In any event, the quality of Mr Kypri’s evidence is extremely poor. He may be honest, accurate and reliable. It is impossible to tell. I very much doubt it. He is the kind of witness whose evidence is notoriously unreliable. Even though no precise motive for him to fabricate the conversation was established, he is a prison informer with an unfortunate history of committing crimes by deceiving people. His dishonesty and the inconsistency in his evidence were exposed in cross-examination. His evidence should be given very little weight.
	
	
	Casey Benger gave brief evidence of her knowledge of Mr Russell’s movements early on the 2 June 2009. She met him at Kelly Burn’s house on that day. She, Kelly, Andrew Russell and some of the children went into town by taxi. Andrew bought himself some new shoes (“a white skate jogger”) and then went with Jodie to buy his father a birthday present from Chip-N-Dales newsagency. The witness met with Andrew Russell again outside of the Knickerbocker Hotel. She went back to Kelly’s house at around 6pm. She remembers the day because it was her mate’s funeral. She never saw Andrew Russell after 2 June 2009. She did not see Paula Morrison that day and did not see Andrew Russell speaking with anybody during the day. In cross-examination she said that Jamie Waring had stayed at home with Kelly’s three children.
	
	
	Corri McGuire gave evidence that in June 2009 he was living with Trevor Peters at 272 Lambert Street in Bathurst. He “vaguely” remembered 2 June 2009 and said he caught a bus to Kelso. He saw Trevor Peters in Kelso and got a lift back home with him. He said he did not see the accused during the day and that the accused owned a white Hyundai Excel. In cross-examination he agreed that he had made a second statement in which he told police that he drove Tony Simmons to Kelso in the white Hyundai Excel on 2 June 2009 and then drove home. He and, relevantly, the accused’s motor car remained at the premises for the rest of the night. The witness did not really adopt what was said in this second statement but agreed that this is what it said. The relevance of that information is that it has a capacity to undermine evidence (for example, the admissions allegedly made to Jodi Biles) that suggests that the accused used the white Excel to perpetrate the crime or to cover it up.
	
	
	Kieran Moore is a friend of the accused. On 18 January 2013 (two days after Simmons’ arrest) he was arrested for and charged with murder. He was arraigned on a charge of accessory after the fact of murder and was discharged upon the Crown advising that the Director of Public Prosecutions had directed that there be no further proceedings against him. This direction followed my ruling that certain evidence proposed to be led against him was inadmissible: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189. When he was called to give evidence, he objected to giving evidence and invoked the privilege against self-incrimination (s 128 Evidence Act). Mr Stratton SC argued that he should not be required to give evidence in the proceedings at all. I upheld the objection but required Mr Moore to give evidence with the protection of a certificate: see R v Simmons (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 418.
	
	
	When he was charged with the murder on the only significant evidence that he was a principal (as opposed to an accessory) was in the versions given by the accused to the undercover police officers. He was arrested in a park near his home, apparently pursuant to some arrangement with the police. He was interviewed electronically and exercised his right to silence. After that interview his mother was allowed to visit him. He then had a conversation with his stepfather (John Fazio). After that there was a further conversation with the police that, at least from Mr Moore’s point of view, was said to be “off the record”.
	
	
	According to Mr Moore’s evidence in this Court, he told the police:
	


“I was driving along Durham Street, not sure what date what time, that we seen Andrew Russell. I didn't realise it was Andrew Russell. Tony told me, ""Pull over I want to get this cunt"". There was an argument and confrontation on the side of the road, but the person was knocked unconscious, dragged into the gutter, and we drove away.

Q. Did you tell them what car you were driving?

A. Yeah, my car.

Q. Did you say to the police that you saw him walking along the road near the bridge coming into Bathurst?

A. Possibly.

Q. And did you say that the person you saw was Andrew Russell?

A. I don't recall. Could have been Old Mate. Could have been anyone.

Q. I want to suggest to you that you said you saw Old Mate walking along the road near the bridge coming into Bathurst. You were asked by Detective Fawkner, ""Do you mean Andrew Russell?"", and you said, ""Yeah""?

A. I don't recall.

Q. That could have been said by you?

A. Could have been.

Q. Did you tell the police what you were driving?

A. The only car I ever drove was my car.

Q. What else in the lie did you say?

A. Nothing.

Q. Did you say that you did you say words to the effect that Tony Simmons had got out and bashed him?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you say that ‑ and I think you said it in different terms, you said that he was unconscious?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you say these words, ""He wasn't moving. He was dead""?

A. No.

Q. Did you say, He didn't wake up so we moved him over into the bushes opposite the Good Guys?

A. No.”


	
	The Crown led Mr Moore to the point where he agreed that he had said certain things to the police but said that what he said was untrue. By that stage he had given evidence that he knew nothing about the disappearance of Mr Russell, did not stop at the accused’s request, did not see the accused bash Mr Russell and did not assist in the disposal of the body. The Crown sought leave under s 38 Evidence Act to cross-examine Mr Moore as an adverse witness. Mr Young SC objected to leave being granted on the basis that the witness had not denied the conversation with the police and that the issue was not whether those things were said but whether they were true. I rejected those submissions and formed the view that the “off the record” statement was itself a prior inconsistent statement for the purpose of s 38(1)(c). I granted leave on that basis. The evidence that I have extracted above was given under cross-examination after leave was granted to the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown cross-examined Kieran Moore about the things he said to the police in his “off the record” conversation and the things he said to Jodi Biles while he was in the Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital. The Crown challenged Moore’s evidence that he had made up the story that he told police while he was at the police station. It was put that this was inconsistent with the fact that he had told Jodi Biles similar things at Bloomfield and (based on that conversation) in the garage at the accused’s parent home. It is necessary to set out the relevant portions of the conversations with Jodi Biles. What follows is taken from a transcript although I have added the words “[YOU SAID IT]” which I perceived to be clearly audible twice but recorded only once.
	


“BILES   Well, tell me what shit you were talkin’ so I know when they ask me I can say, Nah.

MOORE   It’s just Chinese whispers. I can’t tell you what we said because we said that many different stories they all coincide with each other you know. All I can say is - - -

BILES      Every - - -

MOORE   - - - ..... - - -

BILES      - - - remember, every time - - -

MOORE   - - - ..... - - -

BILES   - - - we were in the garage, every time we were in Tony’s mum garage he would say to me, We killed him, we killed Andrew - - -

MOORE   ..... just, just - - -

BILES      - - - he had me in - - -

MOORE   - - - to make himself - - -

BILES      - - - tears that many times - - -

MOORE   - - - look good.

BILES      [YOU SAID IT] You - - -

MOORE   Just to make - - -

BILES      - - - said it.

MOORE   Yeah ..... to make him look better because I knew he was up to no good and I was trying to reassure you that he would do anything for you, you know what I mean. There was times ..... how, when, he was gettin’ ..... some pretty bad mischief and he was ..... a few other people and to try cover his arse, to try and make you feel ..... that’s the kind of things that I’d say.

BILES      You only ever wanted us to fight so youse could go out - - -

MOORE   Yeah, but - - -

BILES      - - - so, don’t even ..... - - -

MOORE   Bullshit. I never wanted to see them kids get, family get torn apart, I never liked seeing youse fight - - -

BILES      Well, that’s what going - - -

MOORE   - - - so, that’s why - - -

BILES      - - - to happen man.

MOORE   - - - that’s why I used to say things like that, to reassure that he would do anything for you. That’s why. ‘Cause I could see an argument’s about to come out and I could see the dragon you know.

BILES      Are you calling me a dragon?

MOORE   No, I just said, The dragon. And man that’s, that’s what I’ll do. I, I’ll try and defend my mate and I’ve tried to help you out too you know.

BILES      Well, now you need to help us both.

MOORE   Yeah, and I am - - -

BILES      I’m trying my hardest for youse - - -

MOORE   - - - you’ve just gotta deny it.

BILES      - - - man - - -

MOORE   Yeah.

BILES      - - - I am.

MOORE   Well ..... prove it.

BILES      I did.

MOORE   Yeah. Well, that’s all you’ve gotta stick to. Prove it ‘cause it never happened. So, if they can come up with the evidence that this has gone on, let ‘em go ahead, but until - - -

BILES      I miss him - - -

MOORE   - - - then - - -

BILES      - - - heaps man.

MOORE   - - - let ‘em prove it.

BILES      I miss him - - -

MOORE   Let ‘em - - -

BILES      - - - so much, man.

MOORE   - - - prove it. It’s just stupid thoughts and stupid Chinese whispers. It’s now coming back to bite us in the arse.

BILES      What did you tell JR and Hailey and that?

MOORE   Nothin’.”

…

BILES      When was the last time you seen Andrew?

MOORE   Fuck ..... don’t know.

BILES   ‘Cause the last time I was there it was on the 25th of May at the court house.

MOORE   I don’t remember the last time I seen him. I remember you were driving back from Sydney one night with Jakey and it was raining and just, we’ll all be seeing him walking across Kelso Bridge in the rain and as from that there, the story where he ended up in the boot and in the mine shaft. That’s where that story come from and that was when, me and Tony weren’t drinking at the time.

BILES      A mine shaft in ..... or Sunny Corner?

MOORE   No, it was the one out ..... That’s what the original - - -

BILES      In .....

MOORE   - - - story started ..... That was, that was the original story and it was just at the time where that fella got - - -

BILES      Is that the one - - -

MOORE   - - - bashed.

BILES      - - - is that the one - - -

MOORE   When that fella got bashed, yep - - -

BILES      Listen for a sec’ - - -

MOORE   - - - the one at ..... Road.

BILES      Is that the one out on the ..... Road - - -

MOORE   I don’t know - - -

BILES      - - - near - - -

MOORE   - - - I’ve never seen any - - -

BILES      - - - ..... - - -

MOORE   - - - ..... us out ..... - - -

BILES      But you know near Friskies?

MOORE   I don’t know.

BILES      That road where old mate got stabbed.

MOORE   Yeah, somewhere out there and I’ve never, I didn’t even know there was mine shafts out there but I know there was a story that originated and we were coming back from Sydney and that at that time, me and Tony weren’t even drinking. We fried on the gas and we were drinkin’ fuckin’ 30 energy drinks ..... you know. You know, that was the original story and that was to put the wind in Jacob.”


	
	I accept the Crown’s contention that Kieran Moore did not make up the whole of the “off the record” story then and there at Bathurst Police Station. While Mr Moore did not say anything to Jodi Biles on 1 September 2011 about stopping the car, about Mr Russell being bashed or unconscious or about disposing of the body, he did say that he had seen Mr Russell walking along one night in the rain on the return from Sydney at a time when he and Simmons were not drinking. It is difficult to work out whether he was talking about one occasion (when Biles was driving and Jakey Peters was in the car) or two occasions, but on neither occasion was there any suggestion that the car stopped or that anything happened. However, it is clear, based on the conversation with Jodi Biles on 1 September 2011, that Moore had said certain things along similar lines to Biles herself and to at least one other person (Jakie Peters) at an earlier time. He claimed (even in 2011) that anything that he had said before was a “story” and that the actual sighting of Mr Russell was the seed out of which one of those stories grew. He told Ms Biles that the stories were told to prove the accused’s love for Biles (to paraphrase, “he did it for you”) or to “put the wind [up] Jacob [Peters]”. He told her that they were, or were based on, “chinese whispers … coming back to bite us in the arse”.
	
	
	Mr Moore said that he was under pressure from his parents to say something to the police and that he believed they would let him go to Bloomfield Hospital if he told them something. He said that police had told him that the accused “had been putting the blame on me and I was going to gaol for something I didn’t do”.
	
	
	Mr Moore agreed that in June 2009 he owned a green Holden Commodore VT and used to drive the accused around. He said that he had some “psychiatric issues” and spent time in Bloomfield Hospital in 2009 where Jodi Biles visited him. He was asked about an occasion when his stepfather John Fazio visited him in custody and he saw the accused outside the visits area. He gave evidence of a short conversation of no consequence.
	
	
	Kieran Moore is a witness whose evidence would be subject to a warning if the trial were being conducted before a jury. Based on his “off the record” statement to police and the conversations with Ms Biles, he was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charges. On that evidence, he was (at least) an accessory after the fact. On some of the other evidence in the case (for example, the version provided by the accused to undercover police) he was a principal in the second degree to the murder itself. Accordingly, I must treat his evidence and the things he said to police with considerable caution.
	
	
	The version he gave to police was provided at a time when he had been arrested for murder. It exculpated himself from that crime. At the same time, it implicated the accused and asserted that the accused was solely responsible for the killing of Mr Russell.
	
	
	Further, on my assessment of his evidence, Mr Moore remains loyal (or as he put it in the conversations with Jodi Biles “staunch”) to the accused.
	
	
	John Fazio was the stepfather of Kieran Moore. He gave evidence of the some of the circumstances that led to Moore’s off the record conversation. Some of this contradicted the evidence of Moore. However, he said that he was upset at the time of the conversation and that Kieran looked upset and worried. He also gave evidence of his recollection of what Moore had said “off the record”:
	


“Q. And you said that Kieran said this: ""All right, I will tell you what I know"". And then he started to say: We were driving along Durham Street, pissing down rain, about 11, 11.30 at night. We were driving along, and Tony Simmons must have been in the passenger seat, said to Kieran, they must have spotted this Old Mate, and Tony's gone, as they've approached him he must have seen him, and he's gone, 'Pull over I hate this cunt'""?

A. Correct.

Q. ""So Kieran's pulled over at a bridge, waited for this fellow to approach the car, then Tony Simmons has got out and bashed him. And then Kieran said he didn't wake up so moved him over into the bush opposite the Good Guys into the paddock area"". You were then asked this: ""Yeah, when he was telling that story, did you envisage they were coming into town or going out of town?"", and your answer was: ""Well I'm gathering they would have been going into town"". Question, ""Yes, so coming from Kelso""

YOUNG: I object to the next, that question and answer.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: All right, I won't press that.

Q. Was there a reference made to another person?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was that?

A. Jakob Peters.

Q. And do you recall what Keiran told the police about Jakob Peters?

A. That they might have dropped him off at Kelso.”


	
	Initially, no objection was taken to this evidence. Part of “off the record” conversation was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under s 106(2)(c). Otherwise, its only relevance seemed to relate to the credibility of Mr Moore and was not admissible (although it was relevant) for any other purpose: s 101A, 102 Evidence Act. I raised the question of the admissibility of the evidence and the use to which it was to be put. The Crown agreed (when asked by direct reference to the relevant sections of the Evidence Act) that the material was being adduced as an exception to the credibility rule (s 106) and that he then intended to use the things that Mr Fazio said that Moore said to prove that Simmons was guilty of murder (s 60). In other words, having got the evidence in as an exception to the credibility rule, he proposed to use that fact as an exception to the hearsay rule. After further discussion, Mr Young raised an objection. However, he was content for the evidence to be led but for the question whether its use should be limited to be determined later. The Crown subsequently indicated that he did not press the evidence to prove of the truth of the assertions contained in the “off the record” conversation.
	
	
	Apart from the details of the conversation I have set out above, Mr Fazio also described an occasion when he was visiting Kieran Moore in gaol. Tony Simmons arrived in or near the area but on the other side of a barrier of some kind. Mr Fazio overheard Simmons say to Moore “Don’t say a fucking word they got nothing.”
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Fazio denied that he told Mr Moore that he had to say something to the police and denied telling him that if Moore spoke to police they would send him to Bloomfield Hospital. He denied telling Mr Moore that if he helped the police that they would help him. He was “just trying to get him to tell them what he knew, if he knew anything.” He said that he told Mr Moore that he had to tell the police what he knew “for his own good” because “everyone is trying to crucify [him] and someone has got to try and help him. He wouldn’t want to help himself.”
	
	
	As to the conversation he overheard at the gaol, he said that he was two to three metres away and that there was a barrier or partition between he and Mr Moore and Mr Simmons. He said that the accused was with his parents. It was suggested that he “got this conversation wrong” to which he replied, “I don’t think so.”
	
	
	Steven Bell gave evidence of a conversation that he alleges occurred on Christmas day 2012. He says that he was in a motel room in Dubbo with his girlfriend (Barbara), the accused and Jodi Biles. In cross-examination, he acknowledged that a man called Daniel Crump was also present. He claimed that he had previously had discussions with the accused about the police suspicions surrounding the disappearance of Andrew Russell. He said that he “brung up the matter of the missing person we have talked about from time to time” and asked “jokingly did he knock him.” The accused replied “he’s gone” and Mr Bell thought that Jodi Biles said “he’s in the hills” or “he’s in the bush”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Bell admitted that he contacted police about this conversation in the hope “to help myself” in the context of being charged with serious drug offences for which he is yet to be sentenced. Mr Bell has discussed the matter with Detectives Fawkner and Hadley and hopes that they will bring his co-operation in giving this evidence to the attention of the sentencing Judge who deals with the drug matters. He is aware of the “discounts for assistance to authorities”. In other words, he knows that by giving evidence against the accused, his sentence for the drug offences may be reduced. For these reasons, Mr Bell is a witness whose evidence may be unreliable. He has a motive to lie or to distort the evidence.
	
	
	In addition to the fact that he is a witness who stands to gain from giving this evidence, and in relation to whom great caution must be exercised, it is also the case that none of the other people in the room have given evidence of this conversation. The Crown Prosecutor did not ask Jodi Biles about it and neither did senior counsel for the accused. Neither Daniel Crump nor Barbara was called to give evidence. As to Mr Crump, Mr Bell initially he said that he was in the room. He then said that he was “elsewhere”. He settled on the fact that he was in an “adjoining room”, namely the toilet. That is a remarkable detail to remember three years later. I do not believe it.
	
	
	Standing alone, Mr Bell’s evidence is close to worthless. However, I will take it into account along with all of the other evidence of things that the accused said or allegedly said about the disappearance of Mr Russell. The assertion that “he’s gone” is capable of demonstrating some awareness of the circumstances surrounding Mr Russell’s disappearance.
	
	
	Rachel Hadley was a friend of the accused and in a relationship with him briefly at some time before January 2013. Following an incident outside the court room in Bathurst was charged with an offence that she described as “intimidating a witness in the Supreme Court”. She objected to giving evidence on the ground that it may tend to prove that she had committed an offence. I upheld her objection but required her to give evidence and provided her with a certificate that the evidence could not be used against her (s 128 Evidence Act).  Ms Hadley gave evidence of two incidents. Both concerned the witness Melissa O’Donoghue.
	
	
	The first occurred in 2013 when the accused was on remand. Ms Hadley visited him at Bathurst Gaol and ran into Ms O’Donoghue who was there to visit her partner Graeme Hinchcliffe. When she told the accused that she had seen Ms O’Donoghue, he told her that both O’Donoghue and Hinchcliffe were witnesses for the prosecution. Ms Hadley said that he told her to contact Ms O’Donoghue and “tell her don’t do it, don’t go”. Ms Hadley saw Ms O’Donoghue out the front of the gaol and said to her “Tony said ‘don’t go’”.
	
	
	The second incident occurred while Ms O’Donoghue was giving evidence in the trial proceedings. Ms Hadley had been in Court and saw Ms O’Donoghue outside. Ms O’Donoghue was crying and saying that “they made me. I didn‘t want to”. I take this to be a reference to giving evidence. Ms Hadley told Ms O’Donoghue “you have to do what you have to do”. Ms O’Donoghue “went on about something about Tony should say that he was big-noting himself, and I turned around to her and said ‘you say that’”. At that point “Detective Justin [Hadley]” intervened and said “Stay away from my witnesses”. Ms Hadley was arrested later that day and held in custody for a period. She was then charged.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Hadley seemed to say that Ms O’Donoghue had suggested that she (O’Donoghue) would say that Tony was big-noting himself. One way or another, there is no evidence that the accused played any part in the approach to Ms O’Donoghue outside the courtroom. Further, the version provided by Ms Hadley as to the incident involved her comforting a distraught Ms O’Donoghue rather than attempting to intimidate or influence her. Where there is a conflict between her version and that of O’Donoghue I accept Ms Hadley’s account. As I have already indicated Ms O’Donoghue was not a convincing witness.
	
	
	As to incident at the gaol, Ms Hadley was cross-examined about the fact that she provided the version that the accused had asked her to approach Ms O’Donoghue at a time when she was under arrest and “very distraught being away from my [sick] child” and in circumstances where the investigating police agreed that this was “a way you could help yourself”. She agreed that the accused said that O’Donoghue and Hinchcliffe were “junkies and that’ll come out when they are in the stand”. She had not mentioned that part of the conversation in her evidence in chief. It is an important detail in light of the evidence that the accused gave on the subject.
	
	
	By consent, the statement of Joanne Leigh was read. She is Andrew Russell’s mother and said that she first became aware that he was missing toward the end of June 2009. She has not seen him since he was 21 years old (about 3 years before his disappearance) and had probably only spoken to him once in that time. She said that she had no ideas about where Andrew would be and “can only think that something bad has happened to him.”
	
	
	The statements of Kim Turner (concerning the tenancy at 9 Cripps Place, Kelso), Gregory Thomas (the step-father of Andrew Russell) and Judy Dearman (Mr Thomas’ partner) were also read.
	


TELEPHONE RECORDS


	
	A number of witnesses gave evidence relating to records concerning the accused’s mobile telephone and the cell towers through which calls to and from that telephone were transmitted. The accused’s mobile number at the relevant time was 0401 208 774 (also recorded as 61 401 208 774). His carrier was Optus.
	
	
	Lynn Truong is a senior technical specialist with Optus. She produced a statement annexing charts showing the probable or predicted coverage in 2009 for seven cell towers maintained by Optus. Five of these were in or around Bathurst, one was in Blayney and one was in Penrith. She explained how a mobile telephone may connect to the closest tower but may connect to a different tower depending on the traffic at the relevant time. She explained that the call was then directed to a “switch centre” and then was picked up by a cell tower closest to the receiver’s ‘phone. She had not been asked to determine the coverage Optus provided to the town of Sofala.
	
	
	Albert Issa is a statement officer with Optus. He produced and gave some evidence about a document called a “web trace record” relating to the accused’s telephone. These show calls dialled as well as calls received whether or not they were successful or were answered. Where the call connected, there is a record of the duration of the call. The web trace records include a record of the cell tower through which the call was first received. I was left a little confused about these records because in some instances two lines of the record relate to one call and more than one cell tower is recorded. There was some evidence attempting to explain this. Mr Issa also produced “call charge records” for the same mobile telephone service. These records are based on the charges levied against the customer. It only records outgoing calls but access to the internet and text message are also recorded.
	
	
	Vipul Beri is a senior technical specialist with Optus. He gave further evidence about cell towers serving relevant locations. He produced a statement and documents relating to some five cell towers, three in or near Bathurst and two in or near to Dubbo. These charted the predicted or probable cell coverage for those towers as at 3 June 2009.
	
	
	Senior Constable Kim Reily is an analyst within the police force. She used to be stationed in Bathurst and provided a series of documents showing the answers to enquiries she had made relating to a number of telephone numbers thought, at some stage, to be relevant to the investigation. She also produced a spread sheet in which she reproduced portions of the web trace records and call charge records of the accused’s mobile telephone, along with a number of other records for other mobile ‘phones (the relevance of which was never made clear). She then superimposed the subscriber details of telephone calls thus recorded. This evidence was meant to provide clarity but, in many respects, confused an already perplexing body of evidence. For example, many of the individual calls were recorded over many lines of the spread sheet. There appeared to be no simple way to determine when an individual call related to one or more rows of data in the spread sheet. The evidence Ms Reily gave as to the when an individual cell tower was recorded (and why) was a little opaque. At first blush, the document appeared to be colour coded. However, on interrogation, the use of different colours throughout the spread sheet was meaningless. While the inclusion of the subscriber details was interesting and, in some instances, useful, I found this evidence to be otherwise unhelpful.
	
	
	While there are limitations to the use that can be put to this telephone evidence, it is safe to conclude:
	



	
	Mr Simmons telephone was active late on the evening of 2 June 2009 and early on the morning of 3 June 2009. The ‘phone was used on many occasions from 10pm until a series of attempted calls at around 12:21am and a “download” at 12:23am. The ‘phone was then again active at 2:27am when there was a “download”.
	
	
	All of the activity took place in or near Bathurst. All of the records show that the telephone was connecting to cell towers in or around Bathurst.
	
	
	The telephone was not used between 12:23am and 2:27am on 3 June 2009. That gap of just over two hours is significant in the context of the possible last sighting of Andrew Russell (by Mr O’Neill) at around 11pm on 2 June 2009.
	
	
	The telephone records suggest that Mr Simmons did not leave the Bathurst area during the day or early evening of 2 June 2009. All of the connections from 1am on that morning until 9:30pm that day suggest used Bathurst cell towers. There is no evidence in the telephone records that suggest that he went to Sydney or Campbelltown to purchase drugs.
	
	
	While the evidence is unsatisfactory, there seems to be no dispute that Optus provided no coverage in or around Sofala. How far the coverage extends out of Bathurst, in the direction of Sofala, is not very clear but appears to be in the region of something like 20 km.
	
	
	There was no telephone contact between the accused and Kieran Moore during the evening of 2 June 2009 and the following morning.
	


THE COVERT POLICE INVESTIGATION


	
	On 16 April 2015 the Crown began to lead the evidence that was said, in opening, to be the critical evidence in the case. This concerned a covert investigation carried out between 18 September 2012 and 16 January 2013. The admissibility and detail of this evidence was considered in my pre-trial judgment known as R v Simmons (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143. However, the evidence adduced in the trial proper was far less extensive, the parties having reached agreement as to the parts that were necessary to understand the context in which the accused made a number of admissions on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013. I am required to disregard the evidence received on the voir dire and act only on the evidence adduced in the trial proper. It has been greatly reduced in volume by agreement between counsel.
	
	
	The undercover operation was based around a conceit that the various undercover officers (UCOs) who interacted with the accused were members of, or associated with, a criminal organisation [REDACTED]. The UCOs played out a number of “scenarios” in which the accused participated, generally for payments of small amounts of money. [REDACTED].
	
	
	The scenarios (all of which were faked) included [REDACTED]. There were more than 20 such scenarios enacted over a four month period. [REDACTED]. He then had a meeting with [REDACTED].
	
	
	Throughout this complex sting operation, there was a focus on [REDACTED] and the accused was led to believe that the group had [REDACTED]. There were social occasions, such as a “crabbing” trip on the Hawkesbury and lunches at eastern suburbs restaurants, [REDACTED]. As the meeting with [REDACTED] approached, the accused was encouraged to speak openly about his criminal past and, in particular, about his involvement in the disappearance of Andrew Russell. [REDACTED].
	
	
	On most occasions the conversations between the UCOs and the accused were covertly recorded by surveillance device. It was in this context that the accused made admissions to the murder of Mr Russell on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013. I will provide a brief chronology of the scenarios before turning to the detail of the evidence given by the officers, the conversations covertly recorded by listening device and the admissions and other statements made by the accused.
	


Chronology of covert operation


	
	By September 2012, Bathurst detectives had reached a dead end in their investigation into the disappearance of Andrew Russell. At a meeting between the officer in charge of the investigation (Detective Sgt Fawkner) and the co-ordinator of the covert operation (Detective Sgt Lukacs) it was decided to employ the “unsolved homicide technique”. The technique “gives the impression of an established criminal organisation, recruiting new members”.
	
	
	First contact was made on 18 September 2012. Kypros Kypri (the prison informer who gave evidence earlier in the trial) introduced UCO 1 to the accused at a pub in Bathurst. The accused confirmed that he was interested in doing some work for UCO 1 and provided his mobile telephone number.
	
	
	On 25 September 2012 UCO 1 met the accused in Bathurst and enlisted his assistance [REDACTED]. The conversation was recorded covertly. [REDACTED]. The accused was paid $100 [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 27 September 2012 [REDACTED]. The accused was paid $200.
	
	
	On 3 October 2012 the accused met UCO 1 and UCO 3 at Penrith. [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 15 October 2012 [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 17 October 2012 the accused was engaged in what was described as a [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 22 October 2012 the accused travelled to Orange with UCO 3. No detail was provided of the activity that took place on this occasion.
	
	
	On 1 November 2012 another scenario was played out part of which involved the accused [REDACTED]. The accused was also introduced to UCO 4 who was said to be the [REDACTED] of the organisation. [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 8 November 2012 UCO 3 and the accused travelled to Oberon and met with another UCO and provided him with some [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 15 November 2012 the scenario involving the [REDACTED]. A small portion of the conversation that occurred on that date was tendered although there is no evidence of what took place [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 20 November 2012 a series of scenarios was played out. [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 28 November 2012, the accused and UCO 3 [REDACTED]. He was paid $2,000 for his involvement.
	
	
	On 4 December 2012 the accused was involved in the [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 6 December 2012 UCO 1, UCO 3 and the accused travelled to Newcastle. They met with UCOs pretending to be [REDACTED]. In the course of the trip back to Sydney, one of the UCOs made a comment about road works being a good place to dispose of a body. This seemed to prompt the accused to speak about the number of mine shafts in the Sofala area. He said:
	


“Fuck drop it in, in them cunt, that’s where the coppers thought I’d dropped old Bud, reckon I dropped him down mine shaft, I said boys don’t you go down the mine shaft and have a look mate”


	
	He referred to “fuckin’ old bud that went missing” and told UCO 1 and UCO 3 about the police investigation. He was asserting his innocence. He said “why would I do that [i.e. drop the body in a mine shaft], wouldn’t it be easier if I dig a hole and bury him.” He spoke about stories going around town that suggested he had “hacked him in pieces and fed him to the pigs and fuckin’ gutted him and hung him, there is some hectic stories going around man. What the fuck.”
	
	
	On 12 December 2012 there was a meeting with a UCO (UCO 9) [REDACTED]. Neither party explored this scenario in any detail and neither the recording of the conversation nor a transcript was tendered. This is significant in light of evidence given by the accused that the prosecution says was a lie.
	
	
	On 13 December 2012 the accused and a large number of UCOs went out on a boat on the Hawkesbury River for a social occasion. This was described as the “crabbing trip”. On this occasion there was talk of another UCO (UCO 14) having a meeting [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 20 December 2012 and 3 January 2013 there were further scenarios played out designed to show the accused the “breadth of the organisation and that he was becoming more involved in the organisation”.
	
	
	On 8 January 2013 UCO 3 told UCO 1 and the accused that [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 9 January 2013 [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 9 January 2013, the accused spoke more openly about the investigation of the 2009 disappearance of Mr Russell and his involvement in the events. He raised the matter after being complimented for staying calm on hearing the news [REDACTED]. It was otherwise spontaneous. The conversation began with the accused referring to what the police believed or accused him of. However the accused quickly began to say that he was actually involved in the crime. UCO 9 interrupted the conversation but UCO 1 re-introduced the topic once UCO 9 had left the car. Mr Simmons claimed that he and an accomplice (“Kieran”) pushed the victim off a cliff and later put the body in a mine shaft near Sofala. He spoke of the car or cars that were used in the offence and steps that were taken to cover up the murder.
	
	
	On 15 January 2013 the accused was told “you’re up bro” and that he would be meeting with the [REDACTED] in the following day [REDACTED]. He travelled to Sofala with UCO 1 and had a lengthy conversation with him. UCO 4 travelled separately but was present during part of the conversation. The accused took the UCOs to the paddock where he said that he had disposed of the body of Mr Russell in a mine shaft. This was the area that the Court visited on the view at Red Hill Road, Upper Turon. The accused indicated a location under a willow tree on top of a steep and apparently eroded part of the creek bank.
	
	
	The accused also attempted to take UCO 1 to a cliff near Wallaby Rock from which he said that Mr Russell was pushed. However, the car in which they were travelling got stuck on rocks as they tried to cross the river.
	
	
	The accused made a number of admissions as to his involvement in the disappearance and death of Mr Russell in the course of the lengthy conversation with UCO 1. The undercover officers stressed the importance of being honest [REDACTED] when he met him at the following day.
	
	
	On 16 January 2013 the accused was introduced to UCO 10 who was playing the role of the head of the syndicate [REDACTED]. The meeting took place at a hotel room in Sydney [REDACTED]. In the course of the conversation, the accused made a number of assertions and admissions concerning his involvement in the disappearance and murder of Andrew Russell. The deceased was named in the course of that conversation as “Andrew” and reference was also made to an accomplice (Kieran Moore).
	
	
	The evidence showed that the accused was regularly paid relatively small sums of money for his services during the undercover operation. On one occasion [REDACTED] he was paid $2,000. Otherwise the payments were amounts of $100 to $200. A schedule of payments showed that he was paid around $6,700 between September 2012 and January 2013.
	


Evidence of undercover police officers


	
	Detective Sgt Lukacs was the co-ordinator of the covert operation and the first witness to give evidence of the covert investigation. He provided an overview of the investigative technique, its objectives and briefly outlined the chronology of the scenarios played out.
	
	
	On two occasions in his evidence, Sgt Lukacs said that a particular scenario was played out in a way that demonstrated that the group was not violent. For example, he said that the collection [REDACTED]:
	


“to show that the organisation doesn't use violence when we deal with people. Chris was spoken to by operative UCO 3 about [REDACTED], but I guess the word would have been in a professional manner as opposed to in a violent manner, to show that we don't need to use violence.”


	
	Again, when speaking of the [REDACTED], he said:
	


“Once again to show the capabilities of the organisation to be able to [REDACTED], without any violence, without resorting to having to use guns, or any other weapons, and again to show the wide‑ranging capabilities of the head of the organisation.”


	
	I am not convinced that the accused would have been left with the impression that the group’s activities might not encompass violence. In fact, the nature of their activities and the recorded conversations supported the opposite conclusion. They were involved in a large [REDACTED]. They were also involved in large [REDACTED]. The “core business” of [REDACTED] (as it was described by Sgt Lukacs) must necessarily involve some [REDACTED]. The accused was involved in [REDACTED]:
	


“Q. [REDACTED]

A. [REDACTED].

Q. [REDACTED]

A. [REDACTED]


	
	On 6 December 2012, while travelling with the accused from Newcastle to Sydney and passing some road works, UCO 1 said that it was a “good time to fucking throw people in there if you need to and cover them up. The best man when the highways are getting built or fuck …” This observation is inconsistent with the suggestion that the group enforced its position by non-violent means. It was in that context that the accused first mentioned the police investigation into the disappearance of Mr Russell.
	
	
	[REDACTED]. It was then that the accused began to make admissions to the killing of Mr Russell.
	
	
	Finally, in his meeting with [REDACTED] on 16 January 2013, he was told that the group need “someone that can get their hands dirty”. Of course, that observation is less relevant because the accused had already made the admissions. However, it reflected the attitude of the group as it had been presented to the accused.
	
	
	UCO 3 was involved in a number of scenarios and, along with UCO 1, was one of the two UCOs most closely involved with the accused. UCO 3 was involved in meeting and travelling with the accused and in playing out a number of the scenarios by which the accused was tricked into believing that he was dealing with a sophisticated criminal gang. Throughout his interaction, he was concerned to “build rapport” with the accused:
	


“Q. You spoke about developing further rapport each time you got in contact with Tony Simmons.

A. Yes.

Q. Why were you doing that?

A. Basically the scenario consists of making sure that he is aware of the three foundations of [REDACTED] and making sure that this is how the organisation works and to make sure that he trusts me as to how we portray ourselves.

Q. On each of the occasions that you met with him did you speak about that theme?

A. Yes, always.”


	
	Ultimately, UCO 3 played the critical role of convincing the accused that he [REDACTED]. This was designed to convince the accused that the gang was capable of [REDACTED] these types of situations. [REDACTED]:
	


“Q. And the next occasion was the day after, on 9 January, which was the day when arrangements were made for you [REDACTED], as it were?

A. Yes.

Q. [REDACTED]

A. [REDACTED].

Q. [REDACTED]

A. [REDACTED].

Q. [REDACTED]

A. Of some type, as well as emphasising that the organisation is capable of doing certain things in relation to assisting me and to make that follow through in assisting me [REDACTED].

Q. It was the capacity of the organisation to assist somebody who was in strife?

A. Yes, that's correct.”


	
	UCO 4 pretended to be the second in command of the organisation. He had direct contact with the head of the organisation and met the accused only after the latter had proved himself to UCO 1 and UCO 3. UCO 4’s primary importance was to create an impression of a hierarchy within the gang and to motivate the accused to conduct himself in such a way to ensure his progression in the gang. UCO 4 gave evidence:
	


“A. I recall I had a conversation, and the conversation was in relation to Tony

Simmons, and [REDACTED] and I had a meeting about him, and for him to keep going the way he is, and we'd heard good things about him, and yep.

Q. What was the purpose of that conversation?

A. The purpose of that conversation was just to build rapport with him, and to make him feel that he's part of the organisation, and that if he continues to do his good work that, you know, [REDACTED], all those things, part of the scenarios, I mean there's a possibility that he could be a part of this organisation.”


	
	UCO 4 gave evidence of the purpose of a scenario enacted on 3 January 2013 when the accused [REDACTED]:
	


“A. The purpose was a deployment prior to that where UCO 1 and Tony Simmons did obviously some tasks, and the purpose was actually to meet us there, and actually to [REDACTED]. Just to see the structure, how the structure works, and the purpose was again to build rapport; he had [REDACTED].

Q. Was it in part to demonstrate that there were, for example the meeting with you earlier, was to demonstrate that there was a second in charge if you like, and then this occasion on 3 January 20 to demonstrate there was a [REDACTED]?

A. [REDACTED].

Q. On that occasion there was no conversation between UCO 10 and Undercover Officer UCO 10 and Tony Simmons?

A. No sir.

Q. [REDACTED]

A. [REDACTED]”


	
	UCO 4’s last contact with the accused was on 15 January 2015 when the accused showed the UCOs the location on the Red Hill Road where he had disposed of the body. He had to return to assist the pair when they got stuck on the rocks while trying to cross the Turon River near Wallaby Rocks. His evidence concerning 15 January 2015 included:
	


“Q. What was your assumed role on that day?

A. My assumed role that day was as part of the scenario that I'm just below [REDACTED], and due to the fact that certain admissions were made by Tony

Simmons that [REDACTED] wanted me to go with UCO 1 and him out to the location to ensure that nothing will come back on the organisation, to ensure for example, [REDACTED] trusts me as his right hand man and that part of the scenario is, for him to see that [REDACTED]”


	
	UCO 4 threw down some markers (20 cent coins wrapped in foil) at the location where the accused said he had disposed of the body. This allowed him to lead other Detectives to the site later that day. In evidence at the trial UCO 4 had limited recollection of the topography and landscape features of this site at Red Hill Road.
	
	
	UCO 1 was the undercover operative most closely involved with the accused. He was involved in most, although not all, of the major scenarios enacted in the course of the investigation. UCO 1 recruited the accused through contact with the witness Kypros Kypri. UCO 1 introduced the accused to the other UCOs. The accused spent many hours with UCO 1 driving from location to location where the scenarios were played out. A lot of their dialogue was recorded by listening device. UCO 1 dominated most of the conversations and much of the material was only peripherally relevant. UCO 1 characterised much of this material as “rapport building”.
	
	
	A regular theme of the conversations with the accused was the high value that the criminal organisation placed on [REDACTED]. UCO 1 gave this evidence:
	


“Q. On the way to Orange, do you recall that there was some discussion about the need to ensure that people didn't talk about the organisation?

A. Yes.

Q. And on the way back was there talk about the need for, those expressions that had been used before, [REDACTED]?

A. Yes.

Q. Was that part of the use of that scenario of finding UCO 2?

A. Yes, those are principles that I constantly reinforced throughout most scenarios, the principles of [REDACTED].

Q. What was the purpose of that?

A. The purpose of that is to emphasise that that is, they are the principles that we like as being part of our organisation and that by maintaining that you are accepted as part of the group. So the purpose of that is to emphasise to Tony that if he does those things then he will do well in the organisation.”


	
	One of the scenarios involved a potential gang member (UCO 14) [REDACTED]:
	


“A. To emphasise to Tony that if you get caught [REDACTED], then your progression through the organisation would cease, and you would be ejected from the organisation.”


	
	In one of the car trips (on 9 January 2013) the accused showed UCO 1 a number of photographs on his phone. UCO 1 gave the following in evidence:
	


“Q. You then drove Tony Simmons back to Central Railway?

A. Yes.

Q. Whilst you were travelling along South Dowling Street did Tony Simmons show you something on his iPhone?

A. Yes he did.

Q. What did he show you?

A. He showed me a photograph of the victim that this trial relates to, Andrew Russell, off a Facebook page.

Q. It was a Facebook page from the police but it depicted Andrew Russell in the photograph?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did he also show you some photographs on his phone. Were the additional photographs on the Facebook page or something else?

A. I can't recall, off memory.

Q. Were they photographs of the police appearing to be digging?

A. Yes, yes.”


	
	On 15 January 2015 UCO 1 and the accused drove to Sofala where the accused showed him (and UCO 4, who was following in another car) the location on Red Hill Road where he said that he had disposed of Mr Russell’s body in a mine shaft. UCO 1 described an attempt to access the area behind Wallaby Rock, where the accused claimed to have pushed Mr Russell from a cliff:
	


“Q. And did you follow the dirt track to the point where it was crossing a river or creek?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there water in it at the time?

A. The was a thin layer of water - on the right, there was, a deeper area where people were swimming, but where we were attempting to cross was just a very thin layer of water going across it.

Q. You got stuck nevertheless?

A. Yes.

Q. And needed help to get out?

A. That is correct.

…

Q. And helped you get some help from the locals to get the car out?

A. Yes.

Q. So is it the fact that you never did cross the creek?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. Did Tony Simmons indicate to you during the conversation why he was taking you there?

A. Yes.

Q. What was that?

A. He said the location where they allegedly pushed Andrew Russell off a cliff was located on the other side. We had to get through that area to get to where he was talking about.

Q. You effectively gave up on that?

A. Yes there was no way we could get across in that vehicle.

Q. And you and he then drove back to Sydney?

A. Yes.”


	
	Under cross-examination, UCO 1 was asked about his understanding of the location of the murder site:
	


“Q. At the stage where that [the car getting bogged] occurred, is it your understanding that having successfully crossed the river at that stage, you were going to be given further directions?

A. Yes.

Q. About where this area was, where this man had allegedly gone off, is that your understanding?

A. Yes.

Q. When you told us yesterday that you didn't think it was that immediate rock face to the right of the crossing, it had not been made specifically clear to you, at that stage, or you had not got to the point where he could indicate where the man had just gone off, is that right?

A. From what I remember, he indicated to me that we had to cross that path and continue to actually get there.

Q. But that is as far as it got?

A. Yes.

Q. And we have seen, from the listening device, there does not appear to be anything more specific at that point that you got to there, do you agree with that?

A. Yes.”


	
	In cross-examination UCO 1 gave the following evidence as to the site on Red Hill Road:
	


“Q. I have not come across anything yet where he suggests there is any change in the river bank, which is what you are being asked about - that is what I am asking you about; the fence?

A. Yes.

Q. The bushes; but I have not found anything that says the river bank was different?

A. I remember he made the comment, ""It's changed,"" something along those lines.

Q. Have you seen that on any of the material we have been through so far? If he did say it has changed, is it possible that he is referring to the fences or the bushes?

A. No, that's while we are were walking along the base of the river.

HIS HONOUR

Q. So if it is there, it will be in that four pages of transcript; from the time you enter the vehicle, at 121, until--

A. Yes, or on the recording.”


	
	The transcript does not record any conversation between UCO 1 and the accused that the riverbank itself has changed although the recording shows that the accused commented on changes to the area and made a number of comments on the way to and from the site as to flooding in the area around Sofala. I could not hear the words that to which UCO 1 referred but it is not a matter of great moment.
	
	
	UCO 1 gave evidence that the accused was able to locate the mine shaft by drawing an imaginary line between two sheds on a nearby property and a willow tree on the top of the riverbank. He gave further evidence under cross-examination that the accused told him the mine shaft was in the blackberry bush under the willow tree as it stood then in 2013:
	


“Q. Just finally before I leave this; at 127.6 you said, ""And what, in that shrub is a hole?"" And he said, ""Yeah, around""?

A. Yes.

Q. Not; the hole used to be there before the bank got washed away, the hole is in the shrub? That is what, almost literally, he said?

A. Yes, that's what he said.”

…

Q. And you see there, at about .4, you are talking about the actual location of the shaft and he says, ""Probably about the middle there, bro, probably a bit further""?

A. Yes.

Q. ""By the trees in the middle of the shrub there,"" do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And then he says, ""It goes out fucking hole about fucking there; about that."" That is what he says there? Is that confirming what he told you earlier about somewhere under that bush?

A. Well, he is saying that it was thereabouts. That's what he's saying there.”


	
	The regular car trips gave UCO 1 the opportunity to observe the accused. Under cross-examination UCO 1 denied that he observed the accused under the influence of drugs:
	


“Q. I just want to take you to a couple of the aspects of your contact with him. I think I have asked you this previously and you have answered that you had no reason to suggest or to suspect that he was using narcotics during the course of these scenarios?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember telling us that, that you had no real reason to suggest that?

A. Yes.

Q. Now did you have any ongoing discussions with the Bathurst police that were in charge of this operation about any evidence they had of what Mr Simmons was up to during this period, so far as the consumption or the supply of illicit drugs is concerned?

A. No.

Q. None at all?

A. No, the only information I received from them was at the commencement of the investigation.

…

Q. Do you say that at no stage did they ever suggest to you that he was using heavily during this period?

A. Not when he was with me, no.

Q. Would that have been a matter of some relevance to the way you would have approached this operation if you thought you were dealing with a person who was abusing methylamphetamine in a big way?

A. Yes, it would have been something for us to take into consideration.

Q. And what would you have, how would you have approached the task differently if you were of that view?

A. We would have had to discuss that with our supervisors and determine whether it was suitable for us to, you know, be with him while he was under the influence, and the way we do things, we wouldn't probably do it at that time, we would wait to meet with him when he wasn't under the influence of anything. That is why I emphasised that throughout our ongoing contact that we don't condone drug use in our organisation.

Q. It could have impacted on his reliability or the reliability of his, any potential confessional material, would you agree with that?

A. I don't know.

Q. You don't know?

A. No.

Q. But that is fairly obvious, isn't it, don't you agree? If you are getting information, from someone who is a heavy drug user, could that not impact on the reliability of the information that you were receiving.

A. If they were heavily under the influence yes, that could.”


	
	UCO 1 maintained that he did not believe the accused was using or under the influence of drugs when they were together but conceded that on a number of occasions the accused was either very drowsy, falling asleep, “fucked” or “on the nod”. UCO 1 was also either told by the accused or overheard that the accused was involved in drug supply activities.
	
	
	UCO 10 played the role of the leader of the criminal organisation. The most extensive admissions were made in the course of his meeting with the accused on 16 January 2013. His evidence did not add very much and he was not cross-examined.
	


THE OFFICER IN CHARGE


	
	Detective Sergeant Fawkner was the police officer in charge of the investigation and the final witness called in the prosecution case. He provided an overview of the investigation and explained the matters that caused him to treat the investigation as a homicide and ultimately to charge the accused with murder. A number of exhibits, tying up loose ends and clarifying parts of the evidence, were tendered through Mr Fawkner.
	


Mr O’Neill’s identification


	
	Two of the exhibits were relevant to the important identification evidence of Mr O’Neill. The first (Ex Z) was a document from the police computer system. It clarified that the 000 call made by Mr O’Neill was recorded on the police system at 22:56pm on 2 June 2009. This means that the call itself must have been made a short time before that. The document recorded that Mr O’Neill described the man he saw as Caucasian, 20 years old and “very IP” (that is, intoxicated person). He was wearing track pants and track jumper. The document established that police attended the scene between 23:05pm and 23:08pm. Police patrolled the area but no person was located.
	
	
	The second document (Ex PP) was an investigator’s note dated 25 June 2009. It showed that Mr O’Neill attended Bathurst Police Station and viewed a photograph (Ex A in the trial) and said he was “fairly certain that this is the IP male he saw on 2/6/09”. There is a handwritten note on the second page of the document which described the person’s clothing as a “light blue ? tracksuit.”
	
	
	Detective Fawkner said that there was no evidence as to why Mr Russell would have travelled to Kelso that night apart from some rumours that he may have attended a party. He said the only other evidence of sightings of Mr Russell in Kelso were Ms Coloton’s sighting on 16 or 17 June and the evidence of Ian Wilson who said that he saw him walking near his house some (non-specified) time later.
	


Investigations relevant to whether Mr Russell is dead


	
	Detective Fawkner gave evidence that the last access to Mr Russell’s bank account was on 2 June 2009. Centrelink payments continued to accumulate in his bank account but there were no withdrawals of money after 2 June 2009. Enquiries with both Medicare and at hospitals proved negative. This fact must be considered in combination with the evidence concerning Mr Russell’s significant health problems. This came from his family and friends, Mrs Coloton and four medical reports.
	


The accused’s statement to police in 2009


	
	A statement signed by the accused on 24 July 2009 was tendered through Detective Fawkner. In that statement, the accused said that the last time that he saw Mr Russell was on around 25 May 2009. That was a date when both men were supposed to attend court. The accused told police that his brother William approached Mr Russell on his behalf to arrange to retrieve some property from the house at Cripps Place. He gave a version of the March assault which was, at least, a gross understatement of what had occurred. He told police that he did not know where he was on 2 June 2009 although he gave an account of his movements on his birthday (5 June). He said that he had not spoken to Jamie Waring, Kelly Burns or Jamie’s new girlfriend Jodie.
	
	
	He told the police that he and a mate (“Corey Johnson”) burned some clothes in the driveway at “Andrew’s house” which I take to be the premises at Cripps Place, Kelso. He also said he knew nothing about a blood stained blanket that had been found in a wheely bin. He said that it was probably from the night they had the fight. Neither of these details was otherwise referred to in the trial. The accused was not cross-examined about them and there was no evidence as to when the clothing was burned and in what circumstances. I assume that these matters are not considered to be relevant and that the Crown does not rely on them in advancing its case.
	


Forensic examinations


	
	Mr Fawkner confirmed that no relevant forensic evidence had been located. Examinations were conducted at the premises at Slim Street and Cripps Place and on two cars. The cars were the white Hyundai owned by Ms Biles and used by the accused and another car that used to be used by Tony Simmons. There was no evidence led in the trial as to any examination of Kieran Moore’s green VT Holden or as to how it was disposed of. There was some evidence concerning the disposal of Mr Moore’s car led on the voir dire (see Simmons (No 2) at [100](vi)) but I cannot use that evidence in considering my verdict.
	


Attendance at relevant sites


	
	Mr Fawkner attended the site on the Red Hill Road where Mr Simmons took the undercover police (and which was visited on the view). He said that there was no police presence immediately after the accused took UCO to that location because the accused’s brother had been seen in the area.
	
	
	Mr Fawkner did not attend Wallaby Rocks until after he was examined on the issue in the course of the voir dire. Ultimately, there is no clear evidence as to the precise location of the cliff from which the accused claimed to have pushed Mr Russell. The detective described crossing the Turon River at the spot where the UCOs had become bogged or stuck on the rocks. This is to the east, or Sofala side, of the Wallaby Rock cliff face and swimming hole. It was a site visited by the Court on the view. Having crossed the river the road veered around to the right and up the hill behind the Wallaby Rock. At a certain point the detective stopped the car and said that he could walk around 15-20 steps to the edge of the cliff. This location was “only a quarter of the way up”. He indicated the approximate location on a photograph that is in evidence. This was not the large cliff at Wallaby Rock. That cliff cannot be accessed by vehicle. It is a lower cliff above a swimming hole.
	


Medical records relating to Mr Russell


	
	Reports describing Mr Russell’s parlous medical condition were tendered. In light of these records, the absence of any record that he accessed Medicare or any hospital is surprising if he is still alive. The medical records supported the evidence of Mr Herbert, Ms Wallace and Mr Waring as to Mr Russell’s ill-health.
	
	
	The hospital records relating to the March assault were also tendered. These showed that Mr Russell discharged himself after one or two days. He sustained a number of soft tissue injuries – bruises and the like. He sustained no broken bones and no fractures. He was not admitted to intensive care. He was in hospital for 1 or 2 days; 3 days at the outside.
	


No stolen or burnt out cars


	
	The detective gave evidence that he could find no evidence of any report of a stolen Holden Commodore in the Bathurst area on 2-3 June 2009. As to whether there was a burnt out car reported or located in the area nominated by the accused he said “there was no indication that that incident occurred.”
	


Miscellany


	
	A number of transcripts of conversations recorded by surveillance devices and telephone intercepts were tendered through the officer in charge of police. Neither counsel made any submissions on these matters other than in a quite general way. Where relevant, I have incorporated these into the descriptions of the scenarios played out during the undercover investigation. There was also some still images taken from CCTV footage during the course of the undercover investigation.
	
	
	A number of maps, sketch plans and satellite photographs were tendered.
	
	
	Detective Fawkner explained the absence of a witness called Jodie Wright. From other evidence in the case, Ms Wright had been responsible for some of the rumours that spread around town. Also, she was in some form of relationship with the witness Waring and in one (hearsay) version of the events, Mr Russell’s interest in her had caused Waring to become jealous and to assault Mr Russell. There was evidence from Ms Wright’s mother earlier in the trial in which Mr Russell had expressed some romantic interest in Jodie. I need not, and must not, speculate as to what Jodie Wright might have said had she given evidence.
	
	
	Detective Fawkner was unable to obtain any further information about the date of Grace Ahearn’s 16th birthday party and there were no reports of police attending such a party between 1 and 20 June 2009.
	
	
	Records were tendered relating to the rainfall for Bathurst on 2 June 2009 and the flow of water in the Turon River at Sofala at relevant times.
	


Cross-examination of Mr Fawkner


	
	Mr Fawkner was cross-examined carefully as to his attendance at Wallaby Rock and his evidence that he was able to access a cliff by vehicle. A satellite derived sketch plan was tendered as well as a satellite photograph from Google maps. It was put to the detective that there was no place where the track or road provided access that close to the edge of the cliff. It was put that wherever one stopped the vehicle, it was necessary to scale a steep incline to access the ridge line and cliff face. The witness was examined closely on the photographic evidence in relation to the length and location of the ridge line. He maintained his evidence that the cliff could be accessed in the way he described.
	
	
	I was not taken across the Turon River in the course of the view and it is not possible from the maps, satellite images and photographs to come to any conclusion based on the objective evidence as to the accessibility of the cliff’s edge from the road or track. There was nothing in the detective’s evidence that caused me to doubt what he was saying. I accept therefore that the track behind Wallaby Rock does provide access to the lower-lying part of the cliff face above the water hole at Wallaby Rock. There is no evidence as to the height of this part of the cliff but it is lower than the high cliff to the right (facing the water hole).
	
	
	The detective agreed that the accused’s telephone calls were being intercepted during the course of the undercover operation. He agreed that there were “some conversations about drugs”.
	


THE RECORDED CONVERSATIONS AND ADMISSIONS MADE TO THE UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS


	
	Most of the meetings between the accused and the UCOs were subject to electronic surveillance. For the most part, the conversations are not directly relevant to the murder charge. Most were not led in evidence in the trial although they were led in full on the voir dire. I disregard the evidence tendered on the voir dire and note that small portions of some of the conversation were tendered by consent. The critical conversations occurred on 6 December 2012 and 9, 15 and 16 January 2013.
	


6 December 2012: First reference to the police investigation and rumours about the accused


	
	On 6 December 2012, after some months of [REDACTED] between the accused and the undercover operatives, the accused raised for the first time (on the evidence in the trial) the police investigation into the disappearance of Mr Russell. This was in response to the comment by UCO 1 on the trip back from Newcastle about covering up bodies under new road works (“good time to throw people in there if you need to and cover them up – the best (man) when the highways are getting built”). The accused responded “the mine shafts around my area but heaps of them blow up” and “Dead set yeah. Fuck. Around my area is where like all the gold rush and that was bro.” UCO 1 said “… so it’s good for that shit, yeah”. The accused replied:
	


“That’s where the coppers thought I fucking dropped the old bud … down the mine shaft and fucking well …”


	
	UCO 1 asked “which old bud?” and the accused referred to “old bud that went missing”. The terms of the conversation suggests that there had been some earlier discussion but there is no evidence of this. The accused went on to dispute the police theory, saying that it would be easier “to dig a hole and bury him”. He also spoke of the “stories going around” including a story that he had “hacked him up into pieces and fed him to the pigs”. UCO 1 said (in reference to the mine shafts) “it’s good to know they’re out there” and “I might get you to show me one day.”
	
	
	While the accused made no admissions, and indeed denied that he had done what the police suspected of him, the conversation of 6 December 2013 represented a breakthrough in that the accused began to speak of Mr Russell’s disappearance.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this evidence may be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. While the evidence is capable of being used in this way, there are two reasons why I must be cautious in doing so. First, the comment was responsive to the statement of the UCO. Secondly, the comment was similar to something that the accused allegedly made to Luke Salter many years earlier. Mr Salter said that while they were riding in the Sofala area the accused said that the “mine shafts [were] so secluded that it’s a good place to get rid of someone”. That comment was made some time before the disappearance from Mr Russell.
	


9 January 2013: First admissions made by the accused


	
	The topic did not arise again until 9 January 2013. By that date the group was playing out the scenario whereby the group was trying to [REDACTED].
	
	
	On 9 January 2013 UCO 1 and the accused were waiting in a car to meet with [REDACTED]. The scenario was introduced the previous day. While waiting for UCO 9, UCO 1 discussed the plan to assist UCO 3, [REDACTED]. UCO 1 praised the accused for staying calm, for being “fucking good with that” and for “not freaking out on being told that [REDACTED]. The accused said “I’m usually good with that shit, bro” and “fucking cunts always go missin’ around my area”. He went on:
	


“UCO 1   So man, from me, like, I fuckin' respect the fact that you fuckin' stayed calm and you're fuckin' all good with that, you know what I mean?

SIMMONS      Yeah. I'm usually good with that shit, bro.

UCO 1         Yeah.

SIMMONS      Fuckin' cunts always go missin' around my area.

UCO 1         Yeah.

SIMMONS   But ..... supposed to be um, about me missus and shit, too, so, gave him a touch up, put him in hospital for a couple of weeks - - -

UCO 1         Yeah.

SIMMONS   - - - and then a couple of weeks after ..... got out of hospital he sort of went missin'. I never ..... seen him ..... one day they'll find, one day they'll find him but I doubt it.

UCO 1         You doubt it.

SIMMONS      I doubt it. He went on holiday.

UCO 1         Gone on a holiday for good.

SIMMONS      Yeah. Vacation.

UCO 1         What happened then?

SIMMONS   No, he's just a fuckin' little gronk, bro, fuckin' tried to get me charge and shit, me missus took the wrap for me, bro, fuckin' that's when I bashed him and shit I fucked him up.

UCO 1         Yeah. Yeah.

SIMMONS   Broke both his eye sockets, his jaw, his nose, his arm, all his ribs, his ankle.

2766703,R v Pratten (No 17) [2015] NSWSC 642,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Before the Court is an application brought by the accused, Mr Pratten, for an indeterminate adjournment to the empanelment of a jury and the commencement of the trial. The application is based on a number of factors. The first is that there are outstanding issues that require resolution before the trial commences. The second is the inability of Mr Pratten to conduct the trial without legal representation; and the third is Mr Pratten’s desire for greater time to prepare his case. There are a number of matters with which I should deal and I will do so very briefly.
	
	
	The Court is aware that Mr Pratten was intimately involved in the preparation and presentation of his defence during the first trial. The Court is also aware that he was intimately involved in the appeal and in the civil proceedings agitating a collateral attack on the prosecution of the first trial (the collateral attack).
	
	
	Further, Mr Pratten submits from the dock that he has ""now had time to examine the evidence of an expert who testified in the first trial"". This submission confirms the degree of familiarity that Mr Pratten has with the evidence that was adduced in the first trial and generally with the nature of the case against him.
	
	
	Mr Pratten, during the course of his submissions from the dock, has also made clear that he wishes to challenge search warrants and affidavits on the basis of that he was not appraised of the existence of them at an earlier time. From this submission, the Court is aware that Mr Pratten has read those affidavits.
	
	
	Mr Pratten says he wishes to obtain further particulars but accepts that there are no outstanding particulars, that is, particulars that have been requested and not answered.
	
	
	Mr Pratten puts three particular issues that require resolution before the commencement of the trial. The first of them is the admissibility of the amended tax assessments. The admissibility of the amended assessments was a matter upon which the Court ruled in the first trial. I have heard nothing to suggest that that ruling is sought to be challenged. On the contrary, the Crown has stated it does not wish to tender the amended assessments or the default tax assessments.
	
	
	The fact that the amended assessments had been issued was adduced in the first trial for the sole purpose of establishing that they were issued and that the Commonwealth was a victim of the dishonest obtaining of a financial advantage by deception (i.e. that the Commonwealth alleged moneys were owing). The amended assessments were ruled inadmissible for the purpose of suggesting that the accused was required to pay amounts to the Commonwealth resulting from the allegedly false tax returns or to calculate the tax owing. The ruling resulted in the objection being withdrawn.
	
	
	However, the statement from the Crown that the amended assessments are not sought to be tendered resolves any issue that otherwise may be thought to arise.
	
	
	The second issue to be resolved before the trial commences relates to what I shall describe as the ""container issue"", being material that is said to have been obtained either by the Australian Federal Police or by law enforcement authorities in Vanuatu. That which is before the Court seems to suggest, although no final determination can be made, that this material is in the possession of the Vanuatu Government and not available either to the Crown or Mr Pratten.
	
	
	The third issue is the relevance of particular expert evidence that will be adduced by the Crown during the course of the trial.
	
	
	The retrial of this matter was originally set for 18 May 2015. It was adjourned for two weeks until 1 June 2015 in order to allow a greater time for preparation for the lawyers then representing Mr Pratten. The period between 18 May 2015 and 1 June 2015 was set aside for the determination of any preliminary issues before the commencement of the jury trial. Much of that time is still available if there is a question of the admissibility of amended tax assessments, which I hasten to add seems to have gone away, that needs to be determined.
	
	
	Likewise, if there are questions associated with the container issue upon which an application is sought to be made, then no doubt that is also a matter that can be determined between now and 1 June 2015.
	
	
	As to the relevance of expert evidence, the accused, whether represented or unrepresented, has the capacity to object to evidence either on the voir dire during the course of the trial itself or before the commencement of the jury trial. The fact that the expert evidence is said to be irrelevant is a matter that, if not dealt with before the commencement of the jury trial, can be dealt with during the course of the jury trial and before the adducing of that evidence.
	
	
	Lastly, Mr Pratten submits that he wishes to obtain the services of a tax expert and adduce evidence from that tax expert in his defence case. I note that this matter has been the subject of indictment since at least 2012. There can be no suggestion that, as earlier stated, Mr Pratten has not been involved in the preparation of the first trial, the appeal and the collateral attack. There also can be no suggestion that since the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the order for a retrial Mr Pratten has not had ample opportunity to obtain a tax expert.
	
	
	The question of fairness of the accused is one with which, it seems to me, I need to deal. I will deal with two aspects of fairness raised by Mr Pratten. First, Mr Pratten states that in the first trial a submission was put to the jury that they could draw inferences from the fact that certain documents were not produced by him, being documents relevant to the loans that his counsel argued existed and of which there was some mention in documents complied later in time. I do not recall that submission being made, but I am prepared to accept that it was. Such a submission is not available to the Crown on the authority of RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620. There is no Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference that can be drawn.
	
	
	Moreover, Mr Pratten states that he can obtain the references to the Crown submission regarding the non-production of loan documentation on his computer given a moment. That simply confirms the degree to which Mr Pratten is able to prepare his case adequately in the time available.
	
	
	The second aspect of fairness to the accused with which I shall deal is a more general one. His Honour Deane J, then a member of a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, in Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 342 held that:
	


“Where a Tribunal is under a duty to act judicially, the principle that a party must be given a reasonable inopportunity to present his case is at the heart of the requirements of natural justice which it is obliged to observe (see R v Moodie (1977) 17 ALR 219).”


	
	I add that an accused’s opportunity to present their case in a criminal trial includes presenting any case in answer to the Crown case either by way of cross-examination or an independent case.
	
	
	However, Deane J later remarked in the same judgment at 343:
	


“It is important to remember that the relevant duty of the Tribunal is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case. Neither the Act nor the common law imposes upon the Tribunal the impossible task of ensuring that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled.""


	
	There has been abundant opportunity to prepare this case. If that opportunity has not been utilized by Mr Pratten it cannot be the function of the Court to repair that failure.
	
	
	Lastly, Mr Pratten submits that he is effectively impecunious. The relevance of that submission is not immediately apparent, but as an assertion it cannot be accepted at face value. In paragraph 15 of the affidavit sworn by William Peter Lowe on 19 May 2015 and read in these proceedings Mr Lowe stated that he visited Mr Pratten at his business premises, being the premises of the insurance broking firm that is at the centre of some of the allegations concerning Mr Pratten’s failure to declare income. It is not apparent on the evidence that Mr Pratten earns nothing from that business operation.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it seems to me that in the peculiar circumstances of this case some allowance ought to be made for Mr Pratten to put himself in order. There is a week between now and the adjourned date on which the trial was scheduled to commence. I am not prepared to adjourn the trial without a date. I am prepared to grant a two week adjournment to the commencement of the empanelment of the jury and the commencement of the trial, which would result in those events occurring on 15 June 2015.
	
	
	The Crown suggests that on the basis of what has occurred the grant of Legal Aid will, “no doubt”, be withdrawn. I hope that that is not a necessary result of what has occurred in these proceedings. First, it seems to me that the grant of Legal Aid ought, assuming Mr Pratten's continued eligibility for Legal Aid otherwise, to extend to the payment of any expert considered necessary to be called in his defence.
	
	
	Secondly, in the event that a solicitor and counsel can be obtained, it would seem to me that the Legal Aid Commission ought to allow instructions to be given to another solicitor and counsel. There can be no doubt, whoever be at fault in the demise of the relationship between Mr Pratten and counsel and solicitor previously acting, that it is the duty of the Court to ensure that a fair trial is conducted and in doing so it is preferable that Mr Pratten be represented.

2766705,"Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v McDonald, Ian; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Maitland, John [2015] NSWLC 7","JUDGMENT


	
	This is an application by the Crown to withdraw proceedings against both defendants.  I am informed that the Crown has filed ex officio indictments in the District Court against both men.
	
	
	Mr Ian McDonald is before this Court on two counts of the common law offence of ‘misconduct in public office’.  Mr John Maitland is before this Court on one count of the common law offence of ‘being an accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office’.
	
	
	Both defendants consent to the withdrawal of the proceedings however seek an order for costs against the Crown. 
	
	
	Submissions have been made on behalf of the Crown and also on behalf of both defendants.
	
	
	While the matter was initially before this Court for the application by the Crown to withdraw the proceedings against both defendants, submissions were made on behalf of the defendants that the proceedings were improperly instituted and, therefore, are a nullity.  The Crown did not oppose the submissions and in fact provided a written submission, in response to the defence application for costs, covering the question of determining the validity of the prosecutions. 
	
	
	The defendants submit that the proceedings were improperly commenced by an officer of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (""ICAC"").  It has been submitted that ICAC does not have power under the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (""the ICAC Act""), Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (""the Act"") or any other legislation to commence proceedings and, therefore, the proceedings were improperly instituted and are a nullity.  The defendants seek costs pursuant to s 117 of the Act. 
	
	
	The Crown submits that the commencement of the proceedings by an officer of ICAC is valid and therefore no costs should be made in relation to these matters.  The Crown submits that the appropriate procedure for determining the validity of a prosecution is found in Duncan v Demir (2009) 219 A Crim R 1 at [42]:
	


“The informant’s authority to prosecute is not an element of the offence being prosecuted.  As long as a defendant does not object that an informant’s authority has not been proved, the authorisation will be presumed in accordance with the presumption of regularity.  If objection is taken, the informant must prove the authorisation on the balance of probabilities in order to establish the validity of the prosecution.”

THE COURT ATTENDANCE NOTICES


	
	The Court Attendance Notice (""CAN"") against Mr McDonald was issued on 19 November 2014 with a first return date of 18 December 2014.  The CAN outlines the details of two counts of the common law offence of misconduct in public office. 
	
	
	The CAN against Mr Maitland was issued on 19 November 2014 with a first return date of 18 December 2014.  The CAN outlines the details of the offence as being an accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office.
	
	
	The details on the CANs indicates that the prosecutor was Senior Investigator Paul Grainger with the organisation being ICAC, Level 7/255 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, Telephone (02) 82815999.
	
	
	I agree with the submissions on behalf of the defendants that on the face of the CAN, Mr Grainger from ICAC is prosecuting the defendants.
	


COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS


	
	​Committal proceedings can be commenced in the Local Court in a number of ways.
	
	
	Section 48 of the Act allows a police officer or a public officer authorised either by s 14 or under any other law to commence committal proceedings by issuing a CAN:
	


""48   Commencement of proceedings by police officer or public officer

If a police officer or public officer is authorised under section 14 of this Act or under any other law to commence committal proceedings, the officer may commence committal proceedings for an offence against a person by issuing a court attendance notice and filing the notice in accordance with this Division.""


	
	The words ‘""under [s] 14 of this Act or under any other law"" was inserted into the Act by the Crimes and Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006 (NSW).
	
	
	Section 49 of the Act also facilitates the commencement of proceedings by a private person:
	


""49   Commencement of private prosecutions

(1) If a person other than a police officer or public officer is authorised under section 14 of this Act or under any other law to commence committal proceedings against a person for an offence, the person may commence the proceedings by issuing a court attendance notice, signed by a registrar, and filing the notice in accordance with this Division. 

(2) A registrar must not sign a court attendance notice if: 

(a) the registrar is of the opinion that the notice does not disclose grounds for the proceedings, or 

(b) the registrar is of the opinion that the notice is not in the form required by or under this Act, or 

(c) the registrar is of the opinion that a ground for refusal set out in the rules applies to the notice. 

(3) If a registrar refuses to sign a court attendance notice proposed to be issued by any such person, the question of whether the court attendance notice is to be signed and issued is to be determined by a Magistrate on application by the person.""


	
	The procedure outlined in s 49 of the Act has not been implemented and a registrar of the Local Court has not signed any CAN in relation to these matters.  The proceedings have therefore not been commenced pursuant to s 49.
	
	
	Section 14 of the Act states:
	


""14   Common informer

A prosecution or proceeding in respect of any offence under an Act may be instituted by any person unless the right to institute the prosecution or proceeding is expressly conferred by that Act on a specified person or class of persons.""


	
	As these prosecutions are not in respect of ""any offence under an Act"", s 14 of the Act does not apply and the Crown has expressly submitted that it does not rely on this section.
	
	
	There is no dispute that Mr Gardiner is a public officer as defined in the Act and Criminal Procedure Regulation 2010 (NSW) (""the Regulation"").  Section 3 of the Act provides the following definition of public officer:
	


""3   Definitions

....

public officer means any of the following persons, if acting in an official capacity:

...

(f)  an officer or employee of a body declared by the regulations to be a public body for the purposes of this definition.""


	
	Section 3(3) of the Act states:
	


""(3) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a person specified in paragraphs (a)-(f) of the definition of ""public officer"" who purports to exercise a function as a public officer under this Act is presumed to be acting in an official capacity.""


	
	Section 101(1) of the Regulation states:
	


""101   Public officers

(1) For the purposes of paragraph (f) of the definition of public officer in section 3 (1) of the Act, the following bodies are declared to be public bodies:

(a)   the Independent Commission Against Corruption.""


	
	It would follow and I find that the proceedings against both defendants have purportedly been commenced by Mr Gardiner in his capacity as a public officer of a public body acting in an official capacity pursuant to s 48 of the Act.  
	
	
	The Crown submits that, ""the general rule is that any member of the public may commence a prosecution for an offence if the breach of the law charged is of a public nature except where a statutory provision limits the power of instituting a charge:  Armstrong v Hammond [1958] VR 479 at 480 – 481; Duncan v Demir (2009) A Crim R 1 at [21] – [26]; R v Thompson (1991) 58 A Crim R 81"".  
	
	
	In Armstrong v Hammond (supra), the Court stated:
	


“The general rule is that any member of the public may lay an information for an offence if the breach of law charged is of a public nature.  

The rule is stated thus by Halsbury (3rd ed.) vol 10, p 337:  “Generally speaking, any person may lay the information and make the charge before the justice, except where a statutory provision limits the power of making the charge to certain persons, or makes the consent or order of some person a condition precedent to the institution of the proceedings.”  The same rule applies to the commencement of preliminary proceedings for indictable offences.”  In the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary any person may of his own initiative, and without any preliminary consent, institute criminal proceedings with a view to an indictment.”


	
	The Crown directs the Court’s attention to R v Thompson (supra) where the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal stated:
	


""The right of any private person to prosecute a criminal charge is of very long standing in the legal systems of England and New South Wales…This right can only be displaced by clear words in a statute or statutory instrument.""


	
	The Crown submits that ""any person (including officers of ICAC) would have the power to commence committal proceedings for an offence of misconduct in public office or accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office.""  This right to prosecute is not questioned in this matter, however the procedure by which the prosecution ought to be commenced has not been complied with and I find therefore that any purported private prosecution is not valid as it fails to comply with the conditions required in s 49 of the Act.
	
	
	I find that these prosecutions can only be purportedly commenced pursuant to s 48 of the Act.
	


THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINST CORRUPTION ACT 1988 (NSW)


	
	The ICAC Act states the principle objects of it in section 2A:
	


""2A   Principal objects of Act

The principal objects of this Act are: 

(a)   to promote the integrity and accountability of public administration by constituting an Independent Commission Against Corruption as an independent and accountable body: 

(i)   to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials, and 

(ii)   to educate public authorities, public officials and members of the public about corruption and its detrimental effects on public administration and on the community, and 

(b)   to confer on the Commission special powers to inquire into allegations of corruption.""


	
	The principle functions of ICAC are contained in s 13 of the ICAC Act.
	


THE McCLINTOCK REVIEW


	
	Following a review of the ICAC conducted by Mr Bruce McClintock SC in 2005 (the McClintock Review""), a number of amendments were made to the ICAC Act.  In the NSW Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 9 March 2005 at 14133, Mr Frank Sartor stated:
	


“The main changes introduced by the bill are as follows:  The bill inserts a new section 2A into the Act to specify the objectives of the Act.  These objectives confirm the role of the ICAC as an independent and accountable body established to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public administration.”  


	
	The ICAC Act does not contain any provisions authorising any person or class of persons to prosecute for offences under that Act.  
	
	
	Section 48 of the Act requires that a person needs to be ""authorised"" under the Act or under any other law.  I find that the use of the word ""authorised"" denotes an actual positive requirement in order for the provisions of s 48 to be enlivened.  As the Crown has expressly indicated, and I find quite properly, that it does not rely on s 14, there must be some actual ""authorisation"" that the Crown can prove in order for the prosecutions to be valid.  I find that the Crown has not satisfied the Court of any such authorisation.
	
	
	The Crown submits that it was ""the intention of Parliament to permit public officers including officers of ICAC to be able to commence committal proceedings by issuing [CANs]"". 
	
	
	The intention of Parliament can be gleaned from the Honourable Nick Greiner, Premier, in the NSW Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 26 May 1988 at 677:
	


‘The proposed Independent Commission Against Corruption will not have power to conduct prosecutions for criminal offences or disciplinary offences, or to take action to dismiss public officials. Where the commission reaches the conclusion that corrupt conduct has occurred, it will forward its conclusion and evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, department head, a Minister or whoever is the appropriate person to consider action…..It is important to note that the independent commission will not be engaging in the prosecutorial role. The Director of Public Prosecutions will retain his independence in deciding whether a prosecution should be instituted.’


	
	This intention was confirmed by the Honourable John Dowd, Attorney General, in the NSW Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 21 November 1990 at 10201:
	


""It is not for the commission to determine criminality. Nor is it the commission’s role to conduct prosecutions for criminal or disciplinary offences. The Director of Public Prosecutions and other authorities are charged with that responsibility and the commission should not be able to pre-empt the decisions of those authorities to prosecute or not to prosecute.""


	
	I find that the intention of Parliament is quite clearly indicated in the above extract.  
	
	
	In the report, Bruce McClintock SC, Independent Review of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, Final Report, (January 2005) at 35 (""the report""), Mr McClintock SC noted, inter alia, the following:
	


""3.4 Criminal prosecutions

Introduction

3.4.1 The discharge of ICAC’s functions in relation to criminal proceedings has been the subject of criticism in recent years, particularly from the Parliamentary Committee. This criticism has focussed [sic] on the relatively low number of criminal convictions arising from findings of corrupt conduct and the long delay between publication of an ICAC investigation report and the initiation of criminal proceedings.

3.4.2 The Act confers limited powers on ICAC with respect to criminal proceedings, with the specific intention of separating the function of investigation from that of prosecution. ICAC has responsibility for assembling evidence admissible in the prosecution of corruption offences for provision to the Director of Public Prosecutions, although the Act makes it clear that this is not a principal function.

3.4.3 ICAC may make recommendations that consideration be given to the prosecution of particular persons. It is not, however, entitled to make a finding (or form an opinion) that a specified person is guilty of (or has committed) a criminal offence or disciplinary offence. Nor may ICAC recommend (or form an opinion) that a specified person should be prosecuted for a criminal offence. The Act does not confer any function or power on ICAC to initiate or conduct criminal prosecutions. 

3.4.4 The separation of the function of prosecution from that of investigation was an important consideration for the then Government in establishing ICAC: ‘The proposed Independent Commission Against Corruption will not have power to conduct prosecutions for criminal offences or disciplinary offences, or to take action to dismiss public officials. Where the commission reaches the conclusion that corrupt conduct has occurred, it will forward its conclusion and evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions, department head, a Minister or whoever is the appropriate person to consider action…..It is important to note that the independent commission will not be engaging in the prosecutorial role. The Director of Public Prosecutions will retain his independence in deciding whether a prosecution should be instituted.’

3.4.5 When amending the Act to clarify the power of ICAC to make findings of corrupt conduct following the High Court’s decision in Balog v ICAC (1990) 169 CLR 625 the then Government again emphasised ICAC’s limited role in relation to criminal proceedings:

‘It is not for the commission to determine criminality. Nor is it the commission’s role to conduct prosecutions for criminal or disciplinary offences. The Director of Public Prosecutions and other authorities are charged with that responsibility and the commission should not be able to pre-empt the decisions of those authorities to prosecute or not to prosecute.’"" [Emphasis added]. 


	
	As a result of the McClintock Review, a number of amendments to the ICAC Act were recommended in the report.  One important recommendation was that ""the [ICAC] Act should be amended to authorise ICAC, after considering the advice of the [Director of Public Prosecutions], to institute criminal proceedings arising from its investigations”: at 37 of the report.  This recommendation was not adopted and the ICAC Act was not amended accordingly. 
	
	
	There were amendments to the ICAC Act following the McClintock Review and in particular, ss 13(5) and 74A(2) were included.  Section 13(5) provides examples where ICAC is permitted to make findings and form opinions.  The examples are not exhaustive.  Section 13(5) states:
	


""13   Principal functions

...

(5)    The following are examples of the findings and opinions permissible under subsection (3) but do not limit the Commission’s power to make findings and form opinions: 

(a) findings that particular persons have engaged, are engaged or are about to engage in corrupt conduct, 

(b)  opinions as to: 

(i)  whether the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be sought in relation to the commencement of proceedings against particular persons for criminal offences against laws of the State, or 

(ii)  whether consideration should or should not be given to the taking of other action against particular persons, 

(c)   findings of fact.""


	
	Section 74A was amended to read:
	


""74A   Content of reports to Parliament

(1)    The Commission is authorised to include in a report under section 74: (a)   statements as to any of its findings, opinions and recommendations, and (b)   statements as to the Commission’s reasons for any of its findings, opinions and recommendations. 

(2)    The report must include, in respect of each “affected” person, a statement as to whether or not in all the circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that consideration should be given to the following: 

(a)   obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to the prosecution of the person for a specified criminal offence, 

(b)   the taking of action against the person for a specified disciplinary offence, 

(c)   the taking of action against the person as a public official on specified grounds, with a view to dismissing, dispensing with the services of or otherwise terminating the services of the public official.

...""


	
	The Crown submits that these amendments allow ICAC to express opinions in reports that advice should be sought from the Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"" or the ""Director"") in relation to the commencement of proceedings and therefore this empowers and authorises an ICAC officer to commence proceedings.
	
	
	I do not accept this submission.  I find that the amendments above merely expand upon and provide examples of matters that may be subject of reports.  The amendments are silent on authority or power to prosecute matters. 
	
	
	At the time of the McClintock Review, there appears to have been an obvious anomaly in the practice between ICAC and the DPP.  According to the McClintock Review, the then Director described his role in relation to ICAC in the following terms at 36 of the report:
	


""The Office of the DPP provides advice on the appropriate charges to lay and whether a prosecution has reasonable prospects. It conducts the prosecution. However, it does not lay charges. It is ICAC’s decision to lay charges or not. The Office of the DPP does not investigate any matters. Where the brief of evidence is considered deficient, requisitions are sent to ICAC for more information.""


	
	Whilst it may have been the practice at that time, it does not affect the legislation or the legislative intent concerning prosecutions.  
	


CONCLUSION


	
	I find that the purported prosecutions were invalid as there was no authority for the CANs to be issued.  There is therefore nothing before this Court to be withdrawn or dismissed.
	
	
	As there is no valid information or matter before the Court, there is no basis or jurisdiction for making a costs order pursuant to ss 117(1)(b) or (d) of the Act as submitted on behalf of the defendants. 
	
	
	The papers will be marked ‘No jurisdiction’.

		10 July 2015",2015-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2766716,R v Cullen [2015] NSWSC 672,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Crown tendered an affidavit sworn on 9 December 2013 by the deceased for use in proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The accused was the applicant in those proceedings and the deceased was the respondent. In that affidavit, the deceased deposed in detail and at length to the history and status of her marriage to the deceased in the context of an anticipated contest concerning access to and custody of the three infant children of the marriage. That affidavit would appear never to have been read in the family law proceedings before the death of the deceased and, by definition, had never been the subject of cross examination or other forensic challenge. As far as the evidence before me so far reveals, the accused had not responded to the affidavit before he was arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	In the nature of things, the deceased’s affidavit recalls and relates a long series of recollections about events touching and concerning her marriage to the accused and how they dealt with parenting issues following their separation. It is evident from the material to which the deceased has deposed that she and the accused were at odds in significant respects concerning these matters. That fact was neither surprising in the circumstances nor confined to them as litigants in that court.
	
	
	The Crown tendered the affidavit as relationship evidence. Other evidence about the relationship between the accused and the deceased had already been received in the trial from friends of the deceased to whom she had allegedly complained about the accused’s treatment of her and in particular his violent actions towards her. These consisted of threats to harm or kill her on the one hand and acts of physical violence on the other hand. Some of the witnesses who gave evidence of these complaints made to them by the deceased also referred to having seen and inspected bruises or marks carried by her that were apparently referable to these assaults. No objection to any of this evidence was raised by the accused. These witnesses were available for cross-examination.
	
	
	By definition, the deceased was unavailable for cross-examination upon her affidavit. Much of what she deposed to was mirrored in the evidence of the witnesses to whom I have just referred. A great deal of the affidavit also contains detail of conversations which are alleged to have taken place between her and several third parties.
	
	
	At one level of examination, the deceased’s affidavit contained material arguably favourable to the accused in these proceedings. For example, the deceased deposed to her perception that he “seem[ed] to be obsessed with [her] rather than the best interests of the children.” Other portions of the affidavit suggested that the accused was, and that the deceased recognised that he was, having considerable difficulty coping with the stresses and strains of caring for the children without the day to day assistance of the deceased in the home.
	
	
	The accused’s objection to the tender of the affidavit was based upon the proposition that it contained material that was otherwise critical of him and therefore prejudicial to him in these proceedings. He contended that the prejudice was unfair and could not be ameliorated by appropriate warnings or directions. The fact that the truth or otherwise of the affidavit could not be tested by cross-examination, and bearing in mind the absence of any obligation upon the accused to prove anything, meant that the deceased’s uncontradicted allegations would be in evidence for all purposes. The accused submitted that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of that unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In my view the probative value of the evidence was small. Much of what it dealt with had already been covered by material from other witnesses. Its quantitative contribution to the evidentiary mix was therefore also small. In particular, the affidavit did not contain any single piece of evidence important to the Crown case that was not otherwise directly of inferentially available from other material already tendered. On the other hand, the affidavit dealt with personal details of the marriage that were not specifically or even generally pertinent to the events that ultimately occurred. Some of this at face value painted the accused in a poor light and was definitively and unnecessarily prejudicial to him. It was unfair to him in a way that could not have been corrected by me.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered an Initiating Application and supporting affidavit sworn by the accused in the Family Court of Australia in support of a suite of parenting orders and an order to restrain or enjoin the deceased from leaving Australia with her children. This tender was also opposed by the accused and upon the same bases.
	
	
	However, the application and the affidavit are documents of which the accused was the author. The affidavit contained no material critical of, or prejudicial to, him. On the contrary, the affidavit contained material that was critical of the deceased. It was, on one view, material that the accused might have sought himself to tender or to have the Crown tender in its case.
	
	
	The material had probative value concerning the state of the relationship between the accused and the deceased that was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	I rejected the tender of MFI 21. I admitted the Initiating Application which was marked as exhibit “CCC”.

		03 June 2015",2015-05-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766718,RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Pursuant to a judgment delivered on 14 February 2014, the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and three months. The sentence related to seven offences, with five further offences being taken into account. The applicant accepted his guilt with respect to all offences, which involved sexual assaults.
	
	
	The detail of the offending is set out at [12] below in a table identifying the offences, the respective ages of the victims and the offender, the maximum penalties available at the time of the offences and the indicative sentences identified by the sentencing judge when imposing an aggregate sentence for the totality of the offending.
	
	
	The offending took place between early 1981 and 1986. All but two of the incidents involved one victim, who was a niece of the applicant, being a daughter of the applicant’s sister who was considerably older than he. One incident involved the sister of the primary victim (count 7) and another (on a Form 1), a male cousin of the primary victim. (The individuals are identified by their relationships to accord the anonymity required by statute in the case of offences committed by or involving children.)
	
	
	At the time when the offending commenced, in early 1981, the applicant was 14 years of age (having been born in August 1966). Three of the incidents took place in 1981, including the assault on the sister and the cousin (both being less serious offences of their kind).
	
	
	Given the lapse of time since the offending (the primary victim did not make a complaint until 2013) it was not possible to identify precise dates. Thus, the latest offence, said to have taken place “during 1986”, probably took place when the applicant was 19 years of age.
	
	
	Sentencing in a case of this kind is fraught with difficulties, both in terms of principle and technicality. So far as principle is concerned, there is an anxious tension between the need for public condemnation of the conduct involved and the vindication of the dignity of the victims, on the one hand, and on the other, the imposition some 30 years after the events, of penal consequences on an offender who has led a subsequently blameless life and has readily acknowledged his own wrongdoing, when confronted with the complaints.
	
	
	Further, principle requires that the Court take into account the law as it applied at the time of the offending. [1]  Not only is the offender to be charged with offences as they were identified in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) at the time of the offending, but he is subject only to the range of penalties available under the law at that time, and to general sentencing principles as then applied.
	
	
	The technical difficulties are also relevant. The last principle requires, in effect, that an offender not be sentenced more harshly than would have occurred had the sentencing and the offending been roughly contemporaneous. One result of that principle is that the court must have regard to the relationship accepted at that time between the minimum term (or non-parole period) and the full term of the sentence. On the other hand, the Court does not sentence in accordance with the law as then in place, but imposes a sentence under the current law, namely the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). [2] 
	
	
	There is a second technical issue: the sentencing judge purported to impose an aggregate sentence, a course available with respect to a number of offences, since the introduction of s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which commenced in March 2011 and which applies with respect to offences for which a court has accepted a plea of guilty after that date. The purpose of introducing that provision was to avoid the need for a somewhat artificial exercise involved, especially where there are numerous offences, of imposing separate sentences, but allowing almost arbitrary elements of accumulation in order to avoid a total period of imprisonment which would be excessive having regard to the offending, taken as an overall course of conduct. Nevertheless, to ensure that careful attention is paid to the nature and circumstances of each offence, a judge imposing an aggregate sentence is required to “indicate” to the offender, and record, the sentences that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed. [3] 
	
	
	In the present case, the sentencing judge did that, but set out in his reasons for judgment the non-parole period, balance of term and commencement date of each indicative sentence. Although those sentences were not imposed in that form, the exercise indicated with a degree of precision the reasoning adopted by the sentencing judge in reaching the aggregate sentence. While this course has the merit of transparency, it also reveals in what way an excessive indicative sentence may have been translated into the aggregate term.
	


Charges and convictions


	
	All of the offences were committed between 1981 and 1986 at a residence in Revesby, where the applicant (14 years of age in early 1981) lived with his mother and his sister. The sister was some years older than the applicant, and had three young children, including two daughters, who were the applicant’s nieces. These living arrangements had been brought about by the death of the applicant’s father in a motor vehicle accident in which the applicant (then eight years old) and his mother had been seriously injured. When the sister with her children moved into the Revesby residence the applicant and his mother moved out of the house and into the garage which had been converted into a granny flat. The applicant was often left in charge of the young children. A young boy, the victim of the fifth Form 1 offence, was the son of another sister of the applicant.
	
	
	The offences for which the applicant was sentenced and the indicative sentences are set out below. (“A” refers to the applicant; “PV” to the primary victim; “SV” her sister and “Male V” is her cousin.)

The facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the Agreed Facts.
	


Count 1


	
	This offence occurred in early 1981 when PV was 6 or 7 and the applicant between 14 and 15. After PV and her sister SV arrived home from school, the applicant ran a bath for PV and directed her to get in the bath. She did so and left the bathroom door open wide. Once she was in the bath the applicant came into the bathroom, closed the door, undressed and got into the bath with PV who observed that he had an erect penis. The applicant started to masturbate in front of PV and reached over and inserted his fingers into her vagina. He continued to masturbate and ejaculated into the bath water while his fingers were still inside the victim's vagina. He then said to her, to 'get the fuck out'.  PV got out of the bath, left the bathroom, got dressed and sat in the front of the house and broke into tears.
	


Form 1 offence (1): taken into account on indicative sentence for Count 5


	
	This incident occurred a few days after the previous incident. The applicant was at home when PV and SV arrived, having walked from school. The applicant told PV that she was 'filthy dirty' and directed her to get into the bath. She undressed in her mother's bedroom and entered the bath that had been run for her. The applicant again entered the bathroom, closed the door, undressed and got into the bath. His penis was erect and he started to masturbate. He reached out and touched PV’s vagina and inserted one or two fingers inside her. He moved his fingers around inside her vagina and continued to masturbate and ejaculated into the bath water. Again, he told PV to 'get the fuck out'. She left the bathroom and went to the shops with her sister, crying as she went.
	


Count 2


	
	In 1982, PV returned home from a play date shortly after her eighth birthday and began watching television. The applicant, who was then about 15, said to PV’s mother, 'I've told her to get in the bath but she won't'.  PV’s mother told her to get into the bath and she complied. When PV was in the bath the applicant came in and closed and locked the door. He removed his clothes and got into the bath with an erect penis. He said 'suck my dick!’ to PV and placed his hand behind her head and pushed it towards his erect penis forcing her to open her mouth and put it around it. She quickly pulled her head back at which point the applicant got up on his knees, placed the victim at the end of the bath pushing her legs apart and performed cunnilingus upon her. He inserted his tongue into her vagina and continued to masturbate, again ejaculating into the bath water. He then got out of the bath, opened the door and told the victim to 'get out'.  PV went to her bedroom, got dressed and said goodnight to her mother. She told her mother she was crying because she was tired.
	


Count 3


	
	In 1983, sometime after PV’s ninth birthday, she was playing in the granny flat with her brother. Later, while she was eating lunch in the house, the applicant, who was 16 years of age, complained that the granny flat was messy. PV returned to the granny flat and the applicant followed. There was no mess. He then picked PV up and put her on her grandmother's bed. She cried out 'stop it’ but the applicant ignored her plea and grabbed her leg and pulled her towards the end of the bed. He removed her pants and underclothes. She was crying. He forced her legs wide open, put his head between her legs and performed cunnilingus. At the same time he put his fingers inside her vagina. After this he told PV, 'get the fuck dressed and never come back down here again.' 
	


Form 1 (2): taken into account on indicative sentence for Count 5


	
	On a day in late 1983 the applicant suggested to PV and her younger brother that they play 'hide and seek'. They agreed and followed him to the applicant’s bedroom. Whilst the younger brother counted the applicant told the victim to get onto the top bunk which she did. The applicant followed her and joined her under the bed covers. The applicant then removed her pants and underwear, forced her legs apart and performed cunnilingus upon her and then digitally penetrated her. The brother then entered the room and the applicant jumped off the bunk. The victim pulled up her tracksuit pants and did not disclose what had happened.
	


Count 4


	
	Shortly before Christmas 1984, when PV was 10 and the applicant was 18, the applicant discovered PV playing with presents she had found in her mother's bedroom. He told her to get out of the bedroom and into the bath, which she did. The applicant then came into the bathroom and closed the door. PV got out of the bath and wrapped a towel around herself. The applicant grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards him. While he was sitting on the toilet he pulled the towel off the victim and tried to kiss her mouth and reached down and started rubbing her vagina. He then put his finger inside her vagina and told her to stand on his legs, which she did. He then performed cunnilingus on her before he laid her on the bathroom floor, forced her legs apart, continued to perform cunnilingus and then forced his penis partially inside her vagina, thrusting it back and forth. He was unable to fully penetrate the victim. He then got off her and said 'get up you dirty bitch and get the fuck out'.
	


Form 1 (3): taken into account on indicative sentence for Count 5


	
	In the second half of 1985 when PV was 11 and the applicant was 19, PV got out of a temporary swimming pool in the backyard of her house and laid on a towel to sunbake. The applicant, who had been swimming with her, also got out of the pool and went into the granny flat. He called PV in, saying that he wanted to show her something. As soon as she entered the flat he jumped from behind the wardrobe, grabbed her hand and led her to her grandmother's bed. He then removed her swimming costume and performed cunnilingus. He then digitally penetrated her vagina and took hold of her lifting her up over his shoulders in such a way that her vagina was in his face and he continued to perform cunnilingus. He then forced her against the wall of the flat before she complained that he was hurting her. He pulled her off the wall and told her to put her 'cozzies back on and shut your mouth'. She said nothing to anyone about this incident.
	


Count 5


	
	In 1985 when PV was 11 and the applicant was 19, PV, who had returned from a soccer match, was told by her mother to have a bath. She refused but eventually went to the bathroom, ran the bath, got her pyjamas from her bedroom, returned to the bathroom and closed the door. Once naked and in the bath the applicant walked into the bathroom and closed the door. PV cried and the applicant said, 'Hurry up and wash yourself and I'll help you get out'.  The offender handed her a towel which she wrapped around herself as she got out of the bath and the applicant hugged her. He then sat down on the toilet seat and pulled the towel away from PV. He kissed her on the lips and told her to stop crying and ran his hands down the front of her body, touching her breasts and vagina. He pulled PV onto his lap. She felt his penis against her vagina. The applicant then told PV to wrap her legs around his body, which she did. He then tilted her back and took hold of his penis and rubbed it against her vagina and partially entered her. PV complained that it was hurting her and he told her to lie on the floor. She did so and he forced her legs open and performed cunnilingus on her and then kissed her mouth. He then forced his penis inside her vagina and thrust inside her. She again complained he was hurting her, after which he stopped, stood up, got dressed and left the bathroom.
	


Count 6


	
	In 1986 PV came home and went to have a bath after her year 6 farewell. She was 12 and the applicant was probably still 19. The applicant came into the bathroom when PV was already in the bath, naked. She sat up and covered herself, at which point the applicant reached over and removed the plug from the bath. PV stood up and the applicant helped her out of the bath. She grabbed a towel, but the applicant threw it onto the floor and told her to lie on the floor. He threatened to tell PV’s father (who was then in the house) if she refused. He then forced her legs apart, rubbed her vagina with his fingers and lifted her up and placed her on the vanity unit. He told her to spread her legs and he then performed cunnilingus on her. He then had her turn around with her back to him and continued to perform cunnilingus.
	


Form 1 (4): taken into account on the indicative sentence for Count 5


	
	In 1987 PV, who was 12 or 13, got out of the temporary pool in the backyard of the Revesby residence to use the toilet. The applicant, who was 20 or 21, knocked on the toilet door. When she opened the door the applicant pushed her back inside and closed the door. When PV told him to leave her alone, the applicant replied, 'Shut up or I'll tell your mum'.  He instructed PV to stand up on the toilet seat, which she did. The applicant then pulled down her swimming costume, licked her breasts and stomach and then started to perform cunnilingus on her. He again told her to turn around and bend over, which she did and he continued to perform cunnilingus. The applicant then turned PV upside down, put her vagina into his face and continued to perform cunnilingus. PV was able to feel that the applicant had an erection. He then put PV down and left. PV started to cry and went inside the house. She said nothing to anyone about what happened.
	


Count 7


	
	In 1981, the applicant, who was 14 or 15, had not yet moved into the granny flat with his mother and still had a bedroom in the main house. That year, sometime between counts 2 and 3, SV who was then 10 or 11, walked past the applicant's room where he was masturbating. He called out to her to 'come in and touch it'.  She went into the room and sat next to the applicant on his bed. The applicant grabbed her right hand and again told her to 'touch it'.  He pulled the victim's hand towards and onto his penis.
	


Form 1 (5): taken into account on the indicative sentence for Count 7


	
	Sometime between 1981 and 1983 the applicant’s nephew Male V, who was either 8 or 9, was visiting the Revesby house. Male V went to the bathroom and found the applicant naked in the bath. The applicant told Male V to come in and close the door, which he did. Male V saw the applicant holding his penis with his right hand and masturbating. The applicant grabbed Male V’s left arm just above the wrist, pulled it down into the bath on top of the applicant's testicles. The applicant twisted Male V’s arm slightly so that his palm had touched the testicles. The applicant then said, 'squeeze them' and Male V said 'no'. The applicant then said, ‘give it a suck, just suck it', and Male V said, 'no, no, I'm going to get my dad', at which point the applicant immediately let go of Male V’s arm and Male V ran out of the bathroom. Male V did not report it to his father.
	


Applicant’s arrest


	
	At about 12.30 pm on Saturday 2 March 2013 the applicant was arrested. He was conveyed to Narellan Police Station where he was electronically interviewed. He denied the allegations except one incident involving PV which had occurred when they were young which he described as involving “curiosity”. He was charged.
	


Applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was born on 9 August 1966. As referred to above when he was 8 years old he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which he was injured and his father died. He has three sisters, each of whom is considerably older than him. One sister, the mother of the female victims, moved into his home with his mother in around 1981.
	
	
	Dr Zhu, a forensic psychologist, recorded that the applicant gave the following explanation of his offending conduct:
	


“[RL] agreed with the Police Facts and pleaded guilty to the offences. He stated he could not recall much detail due to the passage of time (over 20 years) but overall he accepted what is described in the Police Facts. [RL] said he is extremely ashamed of his behaviour. He said he understands the impact of his action on the victims. He expressed that he is willing to take responsibility and accept any punishment the Court may impose.

[RL] said he has been looking for an explanation for his own behaviour since the disclosure. He said his father died suddenly in a motor vehicle accident when he was young (8 years old). After his father’s death, he (and his mother) had to move into a garage to give up the house to his sister and her two daughters (both were victims). He recalled feelings of resentment and animosity towards his sister and nieces due to the deterioration of his living conditions. [RL] recalled a particularly difficult adolescence, manifested as anger, temper outbursts and rebellious behaviour. He believes that his offending behaviour might have been the result of acting out of his anger and resentment. [RL] stated he stopped his abusive behaviour when he was aged between 19 and 20, being the time he grew in maturity as well as gained meaningful contact outside of his family environment through engagement in employment and relationships with people outside of his immediate family.”


	
	The applicant reported to Dr Zhu that he had worked on a milk run from the age of 14 when he was still at school. He left school at 16 after Year 10, did a horticulture course at TAFE and has been working full-time since he was 16. When the applicant was 21 he purchased the Revesby residence. He also told Dr Lennings, a clinical psychologist, that this was his way of “getting his home back”.
	
	
	The applicant appears to have led an exemplary personal life since these offences. He has had four significant relationships and has two children. At the time of sentencing he was living with a woman and her 15-year-old daughter. All partners still support him and he has good relationships with his children. He is a social drinker, denies drug use or any gambling behaviour and has had steady employment since leaving school.
	
	
	Ms Thomson, a Community Corrections Officer, reported:
	


“The offender is unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections due to [RL]’s assessed low risk of reoffending there are no criminogenic factors that can be addressed by this Service.”


	
	The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing and verified the histories given to Dr Zhu and Dr Lennings. He expressed remorse for the crimes he had committed and the harm he had caused the victims.
	


Sentencing judgment


	
	The sentence imposed, together with the indicative sentences for the individual offences, has been set out above. The judge allowed the standard 25% discount for early pleas with respect to all the offences and made a finding of special circumstances to allow departure from the statutory relationship between non-parole period and balance of the aggregate sentence under s 44(2B) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. These findings were not in dispute. To the extent that the sentencing judge’s reasoning is otherwise relevant it will be referred to in considering the grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1: aggravation by planning


	
	The sentencing judge accepted that there was sufficient planning or organisation involved in the offending to constitute a circumstance of aggravation under the Sentencing Procedure Act, s 21A(2)(n). That provision refers to an offence which is “part of a planned or organised criminal activity”. Counsel for the applicant submitted that there was some “pattern of behaviour” with respect to at least some of the offences, but that they were better described as the spontaneous or opportunistic taking advantage of circumstances as they arose in shared domestic living. He submitted that the present offending did not fall within that aggravating factor, contending that the word “planned” in s 21A(2)(n) is, by reason of its context, to be read narrowly.
	
	
	This submission should be accepted. In Williams v R, [4]  McClellan CJ at CL said, in the context of an offence of break, enter and steal:
	


“[18]   The complement of s 21A(2)(n) is found in s 21A(3)(b). In as much as s 21A(2)(n) provides that it is an aggravating feature of an offence that it was ‘part of a planned or organised criminal activity’ s 21A(3)(b) provides that it is a mitigating factor if the offence was not part of such a planned or organised criminal activity. ...

[19]   Section 21A(2)(n) has been considered by this court on previous occasions. In Fahs v R [5]  Howie J said that the provision conveyed ‘more than simply that the offence was planned’. His Honour suggested that a street dealer who purchased drugs simply to obtain the cash to purchase drugs for his own use is unlikely to fall within the provision. However, those responsible for maintaining the drug distribution network are likely to be committing offences which form part of planned or organised criminal activity.

[20]   In my opinion the approach adopted to s 21A(2)(n) by Howie J is correct. It is only when the particular offence is part of a more extensive criminal undertaking that the subsection is engaged. The fact that an offence was planned does not of itself bring it within the subsection.”


	
	As in Williams, there was some “planning” of the various offences, but not such as to bring it within s 21A(2)(n). Contrary to the Director’s approach, this was not an immaterial error: nor was the level of “planning” an objective factor which significantly affected the relative seriousness of the offences for the purposes of s 21A(1)(c). The fact that there were several offences revealing some broad pattern of behaviour does not mean there was relevant “planning”. Rather, the fact that the offending, including the matters taken into account, was scattered over a five year period demonstrated that this was opportunistic behaviour. Thus, accepting that three offences occurred in 1981, there was a period of some 12 months between that offending and count 2, a further period of 12 months between counts 2 and 3 (and another offence taken into account); a period of some 18 months between counts 3 and 4; a further period of about 10 months between counts 4 and 5 (and another offence taken into account) and a further 12 months or so between counts 5 and 6. That all of the behaviour involved aberrant sexual activity of an adolescent boy (and, at the end, young adult), within the domestic environment, is inconsistent with anything in the nature of planned criminal activity. The misdirection was not immaterial.
	


Ground 2: applicant sentenced as an adult


	
	Four of the seven offences occurred when the applicant was between 14 and 16 years of age. (Count 3 was said to have occurred “after 3 April 1983”, but the applicant did not turn 17 until August 1983 and it should, therefore, be accepted that he was still 16 years of age at the time of the offending.)
	
	
	The Director accepted that none of the offences constituted a “serious children’s indictable offence” and, therefore, none required to be dealt with according to law. Nevertheless, the Director also submitted that such offending could be dealt with “according to law” and that, “[e]ven if he had been charged prior to his 21st birthday, the fact he faced similar but escalating charges committed when an adult (and for a period of three years into adulthood) and the seriousness of the indictable offences concerned made it more than likely that he would have been dealt with according to law.”
	
	
	This submission should be rejected for a number of reasons. First, it assumes a delay (with respect to offences committed before he turned 16) of a further three or four years before the charges were laid. Further, it assumes that offending which took place up after that age should be taken into account. On the other hand, treating the first four charges (and three additional offences to be taken into account) as having occurred whilst he was a young person, recognition should have been given to the probability that he would have been dealt with by a Children’s Court. The fact that the primary victim would not have been more than 10 years of age would probably have been a factor in favour of the matter being dealt with in the Children’s Court. In that event, the offender would have been committed to a juvenile institution for a period not exceeding two years. [6] 
	
	
	By contrast, and before taking into account a discount for an early plea, the sentencing judge indicated that the sentence on count 1 would have been four years (two-thirds of the maximum available), the sentence on count 2 five years, four months (maximum 10 years) and the sentence on the third count seven years four months (maximum 10 years).
	
	
	The indicative sentence in respect of count 7, prior to discount, was eight months. It involved the sister of the primary victim and the offence concerning her male cousin was taken into account.
	
	
	The sentencing judge said with respect to the earlier offences: [7] 
	


“The earlier offences were committed while the offender was still short of adult age. He was a teenager without any male parental model. So far as those earlier offences are concerned this has particular relevance because as counsel for the offender quite properly [indicated] it may well be that at that time for those offences, that is the offences up to the time he turned 18, the offender would not have been prosecuted before the ordinary courts at all. He would have been dealt with under the relevant legislation applying to juveniles which would most likely have led to a very different sort of outcome.”


	
	Despite these observations, the judge would have imposed (disregarding the discount and the effect of concurrency) a lengthy period for the offences committed by an adolescent boy between 14 and 17 years. On his own findings that demonstrates an erroneous approach. It is certainly not within the range of sentences which would have been given for such conduct in, say, 1985 or 1987. If there had been contemporaneous complaints, the applicant would have been dealt with before the commencement of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, as appears to have been submitted at the sentencing hearing. The sentencing judge was provided with the Child Welfare Act 1939 (NSW), s 83. [8] 
	
	
	None of that is to say that the sentencing court in 2014 was limited to the range of sentences available in the Children’s Court, nor that the court in 2014 could not properly take into account the overall trend of the offending, including later offences. Rather, the significance of the indicative sentences for these offences is that they demonstrate a false basis upon which the aggregate sentence was determined.
	


Ground 3: subjective circumstances of applicant


	
	As noted above, there is a high level of tension in relation to sentencing offenders years after the events which constitute the criminal conduct, in providing adequate punishment, giving some effect to general deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the offender and recognising the harm done to the victim, in circumstances where there is no palpable risk of reoffending, no need to deter the offender, no need to protect the community from the offender nor to promote the rehabilitation of the offender. The somewhat unusual circumstances, where the offending was undertaken during adolescence and very early adulthood, rather than the more common examples of an adult preying on young children, give confidence to a finding that the applicant is most unlikely to reoffend. However, the sentencing judge was well aware of these circumstances.
	
	
	So far as the purposes of sentencing were concerned, the sentencing judge expressly ruled out the need for specific deterrence, [9]  and held that he did not see “any real prospect of re-offence.” [10]  The judge continued:
	


“Under subsection (h), [11]  he has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of age or otherwise. His age is certainly relevant but there are also many other factors which combine to lead to the conclusion that the rehabilitation [on] his part is not a matter of good prospects, it has happened and is unlikely to change.”


	
	There is a question to be considered as to whether the overall sentence was excessive; that question aside, there is no basis for supposing that the trial judge did not give full effect to the entirely favourable findings he made in relation to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 4: reference to victim impact statement


	
	Counsel for the applicant referred to a passage in the judgment on sentence in which reference was made to a statement prepared by the primary victim’s sister, who was the subject of one assault. The judge had referred first to the victim impact statement of the primary victim: no complaint is made in that regard. Rather, the challenge relates to the use made of the sister’s statement, which was referred to in the following terms: [12] 
	


“Can I just add in this context the victim impact statement from the second victim. Now I do not minimise the offence to which she was subjected but it certainly does stand in contrast to what the principal victim was subjected to. What is striking about her victim impact statement is the extent to which she has assumed at least to some degree responsibility for what happened to her sister. What she has been through is what might be described as the vicarious consequences of the impact of these offences on the principal victim. She testifies to her on going loss of self-esteem which she associates with not so much what happened to her but her failure, knowing what was happening to her sister, to do nothing about it [sic]. She goes on also to refer to the pervasively disruptive impact on the broader family which these offences have had. I refer to that particular aspect of the statement because it does draw attention to the need to take account of what I will call the broader consequences of these offences which do not end as acute as they may be with the immediate victim, the principal victim in this case. All of that therefore combines to make these offences of a very serious kind although I have to say and I have already offered some explanation for this not the most serious.”


	
	The source of complaint is, first, that there appears to have been acceptance of the suggestion that the sister knew at the time “what was happening to her sister”, the primary victim, but did nothing about it. As counsel for the applicant correctly noted, this was entirely inconsistent with the statement of agreed facts which were, in respect of each incident, that the complainant did not disclose the incident to any person at the time of the offending. The discrepancy was not unimportant: the question is what can be made of it in the context of the present appeal.
	
	
	The second limb to the applicant’s complaint was that the statement by the sister went beyond particulars of any personal harm suffered by her as a direct result of the offence against her. To that extent, the statement did not fall within the defined term, “victim impact statement”, in s 26 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The receipt and consideration of a victim impact statement, pursuant to s 28, does not extend to such material. Even if not objected to, the applicant submitted, it should have been disregarded.
	
	
	In R v Tuala [13]  Simpson J noted [14]  a number of factors which must be addressed in taking a victim impact statement into consideration pursuant to s 28(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That analysis focused on the extent to which a victim impact statement could establish an aggravating factor for the purposes of s 21A(2). Generally speaking, such a statement is relied upon in support of s 21A(2)(g), namely that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. With respect to the primary victim, and without diminishing the seriousness of the harm, the judge clearly accepted that the very significant impact was of the kind to be expected in such a case. [15]  As Simpson J said in Tuala, issues as to the use to which a victim impact statement may be put will arise where “the harm which the statement asserts goes well beyond that which might ordinarily be expected of that particular offence”, or that “the content of the victim impact statement is the only evidence of harm.” [16] 
	
	
	The concern in the present case is that it was precisely the point at which the second victim statement moved beyond the proper content (namely, personal harm to herself) that it was taken to have assumed a significance described as “striking” by the trial judge and which drew attention to “the need to take account of what I will call the broader consequences of these offences which do not end … with the immediate victim”. The judge continued, “[a]ll of that therefore combines to make these offences of a very serious kind”. [17] 
	
	
	Again as Simpson J noted Tuala, there are questions as to the extent to which complaint can be made on appeal of the use to which the sentencing judge put a victim impact statement, where no objection was taken to its tender and no submissions were put as to its appropriate use. [18]  This was one of those cases (hopefully rare) where the prosecutor tendered a statement which went beyond the limits of legitimate content. Counsel for the applicant suggested that objection may not have been taken because that might have appeared inconsistent with the fully remorseful position of the applicant. There is no evidence that counsel below took such a position, nor, one would hope, would such an approach be thought necessary. Genuine remorse does not require submission to inadmissible material. However, and more importantly, the content of the statement was the subject of discussion at the hearing on sentence. The trial judge raised a question with respect to the offence the subject of count 7 (relating to the sister), asking whether that offence would, “looking at it in isolation, attract a custodial sentence”. The prosecutor accepted that it did not. [19] 
	
	
	The sentencing judge then noted with respect to the second victim’s statement that “her reference to loss of self-esteem was primarily her shame at doing nothing about what was happening to her sister, and not specifically to the impact of the offence itself.” [20]  While anxious not to suggest he was “minimising the offence” the judge concluded by saying that what the prosecutor had said “about the appropriate sentence largely relieves me of any particular concern in that regard anyway.” [21] 
	
	
	The prosecutor then sought to make the point that, with respect to substantial harm for the purpose of s 21A, “offences of this kind necessarily almost inevitably cause harm, but for that section to be invoked it needs to be over and above that which is normally found in such offences.” [22]  That statement was followed by counsel for the applicant making the submission that neither of the offences with respect to the other two victims would themselves have attracted a fulltime custodial penalty, “especially given the age of the offender at the time.” [23]  (Reference was then made to likely disposals under the Child Welfare Act, s 83(3).)
	
	
	This discussion carried with it an implication that the judge was only concerned with the statement of the second victim in so far as it affected the offending against her. However, in the passage in the reasons for judgment, it appears to have been relied upon as a basis for a finding that the impact of the offending extended to the family. There being no other evidence of such an impact, and certainly no evidence of the specificity found within the second victim’s impact statement, it appears that those broader effects were taken into account in sentencing for the offences against the primary victim. This course was impermissible. It follows that ground 4 has been made good.
	


Ground 5: manifest excess


	
	In determining whether, error having been identified, the court should intervene to resentence the applicant, it is necessary for the court to form an opinion as to what sentence is appropriate and thus “warranted in law.” [24]  It is not sufficient to consider whether the sentence imposed was within an available range and in that sense not manifestly excessive, nor is it necessary to assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. Accordingly, material error having been established, the court must consider what sentence should be imposed and, if less than the existing sentence, to quash the existing sentence and resentence the applicant. [25] 
	


Whether resentencing required


	
	One preliminary issue is the manner in which the offending on the Forms 1 should be addressed. The sentencing judge took four matters into account when sentencing on count 5, that being in substance the most serious of the counts, in circumstances where the objective offending was similar to that under count 4, but the applicant was one year older. However, two of the offences to be taken into account arose at the same time as counts 1 and 2, a third arose at the same time as count 3 and only one offence arose at the same time as count 5. The better course is to take each Form 1 offence into account in respect of largely contemporaneous and similar offending, where that is available. [26] 
	
	
	A second preliminary question is whether the applicant should be resentenced by way of an aggregate sentence, or by fixing sentences for the individual offences. Although it is possible (and perhaps desirable) to identify with precision the sentence which should be imposed for each offence, and the appropriate degree of accumulation, so as to reach a total sentence period for all the offending, the fixing of an appropriate non-parole period by reference to an individual offence or offences is artificial. The course adopted by the sentencing judge in imposing an aggregate sentence with a single non-parole period should be followed.
	
	
	As noted above, the precise manner in which the sentencing judge approached the determination of an aggregate sentence and non-parole period is to be found in the table of indicative sentences. It is appropriate to identify the points of departure noted above. First, the prosecutor did not contend that any custodial sentence should be imposed for the offence against the second victim.  [27]  The trial judge ultimately took a different view, imposing a penalty of eight months imprisonment, which was entirely concurrent with the sentences for counts 1 and 2. Nevertheless, in principle, and viewed in isolation, that sentence was excessive. The prosecutor was right to accept that no custodial sentence would have been imposed for that offence in 1981, if viewed in isolation.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 2 attracted indicative sentences (before discount) of four years and five years four months respectively. The sentencing judge appears to have accepted that these matters would have been dealt with under the child welfare legislation then in force, had charges then been laid. [28]  That does not necessarily mean that no custodial sentence should be imposed, charges being laid after the offender was no longer subject to that legislation. However, if the offences are not to be considered, so far as sentencing is concerned, on the basis of a contemporaneous complaint (as would have been appropriate), then there is no greater warrant for treating them as subject of a group of charges putatively dealt with when the offender was 21 years of age, rather than the same charges being dealt with when the offender was 47 years of age.
	
	
	A further difficulty arises in choosing some intermediate point in time, because the sentencing regime under which he would have been sentenced may have changed depending on the precise stage at which he is to be considered for sentence. The preferable approach is to consider the position of the applicant whilst still 14 or 15 years of age and without the benefit of hindsight resulting from the subsequent offending. To do otherwise is to risk double jeopardy, the later offences being approached on the basis that, because of the earlier offences, the offender will not be entitled to leniency. It would be wrong to approach the earlier offences on the basis that leniency should be denied because of the later offending. An indicative sentence which did not involve a fulltime custodial penalty should be adopted in respect of counts 1, 2 and 7.
	
	
	With respect to count 3, the applicant would have been either 16 or 17 years of age. He would still have been a young person and subject to the provisions of the Child Welfare Act. However, he would have lost the benefit of much of the leniency which would have been attracted with respect to the earlier offending when he was 14 or 15 years of age and otherwise with no criminal record. Even then, the offences were, in the words of the sentencing judge, “relatively free of any overt violence.” [29]  To impose a fulltime custodial penalty, to be served in an adult prison, would have been possible but unlikely. However, a period of committal would have been likely which, in present terms, must translate into a short period of imprisonment. A starting point of 12 months would be appropriate, not the seven years and four months adopted by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	As counsel for the applicant acknowledged, a different approach must be taken for counts 4, 5 and 6. Counts 4 and 5 involved both cunnilingus and penile vaginal penetration at a time when the victim was 10 and 11 years of age respectively and the applicant 18 and 19 years of age. The earlier offending would have precluded any significant degree of leniency. Nevertheless, despite the seriousness of the offending, and particularly the young age of the victim, the absence of overt violence would preclude a sentence approaching the maximum, as suggested by the sentencing judge. A starting point before discount should in each case have been six years.
	
	
	With respect to count 6, the victim was by then 12 years of age and the applicant, it may be assumed, was 19 years of age. Nevertheless, the offending was less serious, involving touching of the vagina and cunnilingus, but no penile or digital penetration. The trial judge fixed a starting point of two years, which may be accepted as appropriate.
	
	
	The next step in fixing indicative sentences is to reduce each by 25% for the plea of guilty. Thus, the 12 month sentence would become 9 months, each of the six year sentences would become 4.5 years, and the two year sentence would become 18 months.
	
	
	Given that the offending was largely limited to the primary victim and involved a course of conduct over a significant period of time, and taking into account the principle of totality, it is necessary to determine the degree of accumulation and concurrency appropriate in the circumstances. In that exercise, significant weight should be given to the subjective circumstances of the offender and the absence of any need for specific deterrence. Further, limited weight should be given to general deterrence in the circumstances of the case; whilst that factor is not to be entirely disregarded, the individual circumstances of the mature offender require that it should be given limited weight. As Howie J noted in Moon, [30]  a case involving offending by an adult against his step-daughter:
	


“In a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct. Although general deterrence is important it can never be allowed to dictate a sentence which is not proportionate to the offence committed or appropriate to punish the particular offender before the court.”


	
	The appropriate course is to accumulate count 4 on count 3 by three months, count 5 on count 4 by 9 months and count 6 on count 5 by six months. The resultant sentence, after discounts are included, is an overall period of six years.
	
	
	It is then necessary to fix a non-parole period. As noted by this Court in AJB v R [31]  the fixing of a non-parole period is governed by the terms of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Nevertheless, the sentencing judge found special circumstances and the statutory regime which would apply absent special circumstances need not be followed. The principal reason for finding special circumstances in the present case is the need to take account of the sentencing regime as it applied when all of the offences were committed. [32]  That regime, which operated up until the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) involved the fixing of a non-parole period at not more than 50% of the head sentence. The purpose of the discrepancy was to allow for the likely reduction of the head sentence on account of remissions, which then applied to the sentence fixed by the court and which would, in the case of a first custodial sentence, reduce the sentence by one-third. Other “earned” remissions would also be available to a prisoner, although remissions might be lost for misconduct. How these calculations were applied depended in part upon whether the non-parole period was itself subject to reduction for remissions, a course which did apply for a period. However, the proportion adopted by the trial judge of a non-parole period of about one-half of the head sentence was not challenged in the present case and should be applied. Adopting approximately the same ratio would give a non-parole period of 33 months in round terms.
	


Conclusion


	
	A sentence of six years imprisonment is significantly less than a sentence of seven years and three months and, accordingly, it is appropriate for the court to intervene and quash the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant the applicant leave to appeal.

(2)   Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge on 14 February 2014.

(3)   Resentence the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months to date from 14 February 2014 and a balance of term of 3 years 3 months.

(4)   The first date on which the applicant is eligible for parole is 13 November 2016.

2766728,Thammavongsa v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 107,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Bellew J. It is unnecessary to re-state the factual background.
	
	
	With one exception, I generally agree with the approach taken by Bellew J. There is nothing I wish to add to the outline of the facts, of the applicant’s personal circumstances, the account of the relevant competing sentencing considerations, or the submissions of counsel for the parties.
	
	
	The exception is what Bellew J has written concerning the role of this Court when re-sentencing after error has been found: see [44] and [45]. The view I take, with respect to the role of this Court when re-sentencing after error is found, is set out in Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90 at [75]-[84].
	
	
	Comparison of a proposed sentence with the sentence imposed at first instance deflects attention from the task, which is to exercise the sentencing discretion independently, uninfluenced by the sentence imposed at first instance (which is, ex hypothesi, flawed: see Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [42]).
	
	
	The sentence imposed at first instance is relevant for the two purposes identified in Davis - to avoid re-sentencing more severely than at first instance, without first warning the applicant of that possibility; and to determine the order to be made. Where, after the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court arrives at a sentence that is the same as that originally imposed, then, notwithstanding that error has been found, the appeal must be dismissed: see Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3).
	
	
	Since preparing these reasons I have been provided with the additional remarks of R A Hulme J. I merely add the following, as to the question of “comparison” of the proposed re-sentence with the sentence originally passed: if, by making such a “comparison”, all that is intended is that a check be made that the proposed re-sentence does not exceed that originally imposed (for reasons of fairness - see Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282), or for the formulation of the final order (see Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90), I have no issue. However, the passage in the judgment of Bellew J, drawn from Application by MLP pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 349 at [9] is susceptible of a different interpretation, with which I would take issue. That interpretation is that the original sentence has some bearing on the selection of the re-determined sentence. (I accept that both R A Hulme J, in MLP, and Bellew J in the present case, intended the former.)
	
	
	In the exercise that follows I have consciously put out of my mind the sentence imposed by Kirby J.
	
	
	I agree with Bellew J, for the reasons given by him, that the offence falls into the mid-range of objective seriousness. I also bear in mind that, in considering the appropriate sentence, two statutory guideposts are relevant: the maximum penalty applicable (imprisonment for life) and the standard non-parole period (imprisonment for 20 years).
	
	
	The factors adverse to the applicant, in terms of the length of sentence to be imposed, include his pre-offence drug use. This is exacerbated by the evidence of his continued (although, perhaps, sporadic) drug use after his incarceration. The most significant effect of this is the impact that it has on the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. Also of serious concern is the applicant’s conduct immediately after the shooting; he kicked the victim in the head, and a little later gloated about what he had done.
	
	
	Factors that favour the applicant are his youth, his difficult childhood, the efforts (although with limited success) that he has made to overcome his drug use, both before and after incarceration, and the circumstances of his custody. In respect of the last matter, it is not irrelevant that he is serving his sentence in protection (although the evidence as to how that could be expected to affect the hardship of his custody was limited at best), and his expressed fear of sexual assault (which I would not discard as irrational).
	
	
	The sentencing judge was urged to find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), so as to reduce the proportion of the sentence during which the applicant would not be eligible for release on parole. His Honour declined to do so, having regard to the length of the parole period, during which the applicant would have available to him the support of the Probation and Parole Service. No other reasons appear to have been advanced. No challenge was made on this application to the conclusion of the sentencing judge. For the same reasons, I would not find special circumstances so as to vary the statutory proportions between the non-parole period and the head sentence.
	
	
	Exercising my own independent judgment in the light of all these circumstances, I consider that an appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for 20 years, commencing on 14 July 2003, with a non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	The orders I propose are, therefore:
	



	
	Extend the time for filing an application for leave to appeal against sentence to 28 June 2013;
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence;
	
	
	Allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed on 13 September 2005;
	
	
	In lieu thereof, impose a sentence made up of a non-parole period of 15 years commencing on 14 July 2003 and expiring on 13 July 2018 with a balance of term of 5 years to expire on 13 July 2023.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the judgment of Bellew J and with the orders his Honour proposes.
	
	
	There are some further observations I wish to make concerning the judgment of Simpson J.
	
	
	First, her Honour said in Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90 at [84] that the practice of the Crown relying on the words in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) ought to cease. I respectfully agree but only insofar as the Crown submits no more than that ""no lesser sentence is warranted in law"". That is an approach which, in my experience, occurs quite frequently. There is a lack of clarity in such a submission. If it means no more than that the sentence passed at first instance is ""within range"" and for that reason the appeal should be dismissed, then it would be contrary to what was said by Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [19] which was endorsed by the majority in the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [42].
	
	
	If by submitting (only) that ""no lesser sentence is warranted in law"" the Crown is meaning to submit that if the Court finds error to have been established it would then engage in an independent re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, the result of which would be that the Court would find that the sentence should be at least that which was imposed at first instance it would not be in conflict with Baxter v R and Kentwell v The Queen.
	
	
	Without the Crown in many cases explaining the ""no lesser sentence is warranted"" submission, I would not hasten to a conclusion that it is legally flawed on the basis that it is merely referring to the first instance sentence as being ""within range"". But I acknowledge that a counter to this is the frequency with which the Crown makes the same submission in the same terms. If the meaning of the submission is as I have portrayed it in the preceding paragraph, it carries the implication as Simpson J observed in Davis v R at [80], that the Crown contends that the sentence was at the bottom of the range; no sentence below it was open to be imposed. The frequency with which the Crown makes the same ""no lesser sentence is warranted"" submission thereby conveys that sentencing judges are routinely sentencing at the bottom of the range. The Crown cannot, with credibility, be contending that.
	
	
	In the present case the Crown did go beyond the bare ""no lesser sentence"" submission. After conceding error, the updated written submissions engaged in a review of the objective and subjective facts and circumstances, including matters that had arisen since the original sentence was passed. The submissions concluded as follows (at [59]-[62]):
	


“The 17 year old deceased was unarmed and attending an 18th birthday party when he was shot dead by the applicant using a pen gun. His only blame was perhaps to attend a birthday party uninvited. His death was ‘senseless and brutal.’ The applicant degraded him further by kicking him in the head when he was felled to the ground, mortally wounded. The applicant then boasted of what he had done.

Even though the applicant had strong subjective factors including his age and background, the sentence must denounce and punish the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct in committing such a violent offence. Notions of punishment, deterrence, denunciation and protection of community are important factors in the sentence exercise presented by the applicant and his crime.

It is submitted that in carrying out the re-sentencing exercise afresh the Court would not, when having due regard to all these factors, arrive at a lesser sentence.

The appeal should be dismissed.”


	
	In my respectful view, these submissions are a model of a correct approach for the Crown to take. They endeavour to engage with all of the matters the Crown submits the Court should consider in the independent exercise of the sentencing discretion. They conclude with a submission to the effect that at the end of that exercise the Court would arrive at a sentence that is, when compared with the original sentence, not less than it. I do not know what else the Crown can do short of nominating an actual sentence the Court should arrive at (which would be contrary to Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323).
	
	
	The second observation concerns her Honour's disagreement with what Bellew J has written at [44]-[45] of his judgment. I see nothing wrong with his Honour's analysis. It involves the following components:
	


1.   Once error has been established, the Court is required to engage in its own discretionary assessment of the appropriate sentence.

2.   This has to be done in the context of the submissions made to the Court.

3.   It also requires comparison with the original sentence.


	
	The first point is uncontroversial. It accords with Kentwell v The Queen at [42].
	
	
	The second point is practical. Many issues in the court below may no longer be issues in this Court. Findings of fact made by the sentencing judge may not be challenged and for that reason may be accepted by this Court without the need for any further assessment.
	
	
	The third point appears to have been misconstrued (with respect). It is not a matter of carrying out a comparison through the course of this Court independently determining what the appropriate sentence should be. Bellew J has correctly drawn from what I wrote in Application by MLP pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 349 at [9]:
	


""Two things emerge from the above that are pertinent to the present application. The first (and this is emphasised in the applicant's submissions) is that in considering the issue in s 6(3) the Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. It is a matter of moving directly from the identification of error to an independent determination of what sentence was warranted in all the circumstances (including matters that have arisen since the original sentencing exercise). The second is that it is a matter of comparison of what that determination yields with what the original sentence was."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The point of comparison is at the end of the process. The Court determines what it considers the sentence should be. It then has to, as Simpson J acknowledges above at [5] (and in Davis v R at [82]-[83]), make a comparison of that determination with the original sentence.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 13 September 2005, having been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Khang Vinh Tien (“the deceased”) on 12 July 2003, Meng Thammavongsa (“the applicant”) was sentenced by Kirby J to imprisonment for 21 years to date from 14 July 2003. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 16 years ending on 13 July 2019, at which time the applicant will be eligible for parole: R v Thammavongsa [2005] NSWSC 915.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.
	


The application for an extension of time


	
	Two affidavits of Madeleine Schneider, affirmed on 3 February 2014 and 24 February 2015 respectively, set out the relevant chronology. In summary, the applicant filed a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal against his sentence on 20 September 2005. His application for legal aid was refused following advice from counsel. Accordingly, no appeal proceeded at that time.
	
	
	On 5 October 2011 the High Court delivered its decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. In December 2011 Legal Aid NSW received advice from senior counsel regarding the implications of that decision upon persons who were serving sentences for offences for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed. A review team was then established within Legal Aid NSW to consider the impact of the decision in Muldrock. Advice was received from counsel on 11 October 2012 in respect of the applicant’s case. Legal aid was then granted to the applicant and on 28 June 2013 an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal was filed.
	
	
	In late 2013 this Court heard a number of applications to extend time in cases which were said to be affected by the decision in Muldrock. Two of those decisions, Kentwell v R [2013] NSWCCA 266 and O’Grady v R [2013] NSWCCA 281, were the subject of a grant of special leave to appeal to the High Court. On 9 October 2014 the High Court delivered its decision in each matter: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947; O’Grady v R [2014] HCA 38. The High Court concluded that the test which had been applied by this Court to determine whether an extension of time should be granted (such test having been laid down in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247) was incorrect. The progress of the present application was delayed as a consequence of awaiting the decisions in O’Grady and Kentwell.
	
	
	The approach which is to be taken by this Court in determining whether or not an extension of time should be granted is set out in Kentwell (supra) where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell, and Keane JJ) said (commencing at [32]):
	


“[32] The Act confers a right to appeal against conviction in stated circumstances and provides for an appeal against conviction and/or sentence with the leave of the court. These provisions (among others) are exceptions to finality in the trial and sentencing of offenders. The principle of finality finds expression in the prescription of the time limit within which an appeal or an application for leave to appeal may be brought. The discretionary power to extend the time limit is a legislative recognition that the interests of justice in a particular case may favour permitting an appeal or an application for leave to appeal to be heard, notwithstanding that it was not brought within time. The interests of justice will often pull in different directions. As earlier noted, they may include consideration of the adverse effect on the victim, or on the community generally, occasioned by re-opening a concluded criminal proceeding. However, at least in the case of an out-of-time challenge to a sentence that is being served, the principle of finality does not provide a discrete reason for refusing to exercise the power.

[33] Relevant to the determination of the interests of justice on an application to extend time is the prospect of success should the extension be granted. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the Court of Criminal Appeal’s acceptance that his grounds of appeal were established did not conclude its consideration of the merits of the appeal. As the appellant acknowledged on the hearing of the appeal, notwithstanding conceded “Muldrock error“, a sentence may be so demonstrably lenient that the Court of Criminal Appeal concludes that there is no prospect that a lesser sentence would be imposed were the appeal to be entertained.”

THE GROUND OF APPEAL

His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120

THE APPROACH OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE


	
	Having set out the circumstances of the offending and the applicant’s subjective case, the sentencing judge said (at [27]):
	


“[27] The Court is required ""to set the standard non parole period"" unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter period (s 54B(2)). The Court may depart from the standard, but only for reasons which are identified in s 21A of the Act (s 54B(3)). Section 21A obliges the Court, when fixing a sentence, to have regard to aggravating and mitigating factors (which the section identifies), as well as other objective and subjective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence. The Court, by s 54B(4), is enjoined to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non parole period, identifying each factor taken into account.

[28] The approach that should be taken in respect of a standard non parole period was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. The Court identified the issue which must be addressed, namely: Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period? That question will be answered by considering the following matters: (R v Way (above) para 118)

(i) the objective seriousness of the offence considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind;

(ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1)”.


	
	His Honour then turned (commencing at [30]) to consider whether the offending should be regarded as falling in the mid-range of objective seriousness:
	


“[30] The Crown pointed to certain aggravating features, identified in s 21A(2) of the Act, although care must obviously be taken to ensure that the aggravating factor is not an element of the offence, nor some other feature inherent in the charge itself. Here, for instance, the offence of murder obviously involves violence (s 21A(2)(b)) so that cannot be regarded as an aggravating feature. Nor, for the same reasons, can the fact that the offence was committed without regard for public safety (s 21A(2)(i)). On the other hand, the offence involved the actual use of a weapon and that was a circumstance of aggravation (s 21A(2)(c)). The episode of kicking the victim after he had been shot may amount to gratuitous cruelty, although it really was a continuation or manifestation of the anger which was inherent in the offence.

[31] In terms of mitigating factors, the offence was not, I believe, planned. Mr Thammavongsa's decision to take the gun to the party was foolhardy and reckless, especially since he knew he would be drinking and taking drugs. It made possible, and indeed invited, the sort of senseless violence that then occurred. It was obviously unwise and reckless to remove the gun from the boot of the car and place it in his pocket as he contemplated confronting the group. At that stage, Mr Thammavongsa intended to keep the gun in reserve or brandish it to impress the group. There is no evidence that he intended, at that point, to fire it. The intention to discharge the weapon arose during the course of the confrontation.

[32] It may be said that, to the mildest degree, some member of the group provoked Mr Thammavongsa during the angry exchange of words (s 21A(3)(c)). Unquestionably, Mr Thammavongsa's perception was impaired by reason of drugs and alcohol. That is not a matter in mitigation but part of the explanation for his conduct. He did not, as I have said, intend to kill the victim. He was standing some distance from him. He had a small gun with one bullet and the gun was inherently inaccurate. Plainly, however, as the jury found, he intended, in his anger, to inflict very serious injuries, and did so by firing the gun, ultimately causing the victim's death.

[33] The Crown urged that, because Mr Thammavongsa showed immediately after the shooting, a degree of callousness by kicking the victim, the offence is slightly worse than an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Whilst it is true that there was a degree of callousness, it is also significant, in my view, that the offence was to some degree, spontaneous, without an intention to kill. On balance, I believe the offence should be regarded as one in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The standard non parole period should therefore apply unless there are reasons, specific to Mr Thammavongsa, which suggest that it should be moderated.

[34] Here, I believe there are such reasons. Looking at the subjective case, the applicant has an unfortunate background. He has, to a degree, shown some remorse. He has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The fact that he is likely to serve his sentence on protection, and especially his youth, suggest that some moderation of the standard non parole period is appropriate.”

THE DECISION IN MULDROCK v R 


	
	In Muldrock the High Court concluded (at [25]) that the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 was incorrect. The High Court found that it was an error to characterise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”) as being framed in terms which required a sentencing judge to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for an offence which was assessed as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The High Court further concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the applicable standard non-parole period. The Court concluded that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors, including any prescribed standard non-parole period, and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence, given all such factors.
	
	
	Significantly, in light of the error asserted in the present case, the High Court specifically rejected (at [28]) the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In the present case the Crown conceded that the reasons of the sentencing judge reflected Muldrock error. That concession was an appropriate one for two principal reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, his Honour’s reference (at [28]) to the decision in Way, and the question that his Honour then posed, make it clear that he regarded the primary issue as being whether or not there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. In doing so, his Honour gave the standard non-parole period primary, or perhaps even determinative, significance. In light of the decision in Muldrock, that approach reflected error.
	
	
	Secondly, it is evident from his Honour’s reasons at [30]-[34] that he effectively used the standard non-parole period as the starting point in determining an appropriate sentence. Having done so, he proceeded to consider whether there were factors which justified the imposition of a longer or shorter non-parole period. In doing so, and leaving aside the significance which his Honour attached to the standard non-parole period, his Honour adopted a two stage approach to sentence. The High Court determined in Muldrock that such an approach was erroneous.
	
	
	It will be evident from the passages in Kentwell set out in [8] above that the question of whether or not a proposed appeal has prospects of success is one of the factors which is relevant to the determination of whether or not an extension of time ought be granted. In the present case, where the affidavit material adequately explains the delay in bringing the application to extend time and where error is established, it is appropriate to make orders extending time and granting leave to appeal.
	


THE APPROACH TO DETERMINING SENTENCE


	
	Error having been established, the provisions of s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are enlivened. In Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 Spigelman CJ said (at [19]):
	


“[19] Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal … re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.”


	
	In Kentwell, the plurality affirmed the correctness of that observation (commencing at [42]):
	


“[42] Spigelman CJ’s analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be “warranted in law“. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not “warranted in law“ unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion.

[43] After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the court required to re-sentence. Nor is the court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender’s appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.”


	
	The fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion by this Court involves moving directly from the identification of error to an independent determination of what sentence is warranted in all of the circumstances. It is a matter of comparison of what that determination yields with what the original sentence was: Application by MLP pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 349 at [9] per R A Hulme J.
	
	
	What is required is for the Court to make an independent assessment of the appropriate sentence and compare it with that originally imposed in order to determine whether there should be a lesser sentence. That has to be done in the context of the submissions made before this Court: MLP at [25].
	
	
	The circumstances which this Court must consider include matters which have arisen since the original sentence was passed. In that regard, the following affidavits were read in the applicant’s case on the question of re-sentence:
	



	
	Lauren Hrouda dated 30 January 2014;
	
	
	the applicant dated 4 February 2014;
	
	
	the applicant dated 26 March 2015; and
	
	
	Stephen Eccleshall dated 27 March 2015.
	



	
	The Crown read the following affidavits on the same basis:
	



	
	Steven Thompson dated 9 December 2013; and
	
	
	Meaghan Fleeton dated 20 April 2015.
	



	
	With these principles in mind I turn to consider the question of sentence.
	


THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING


	
	The circumstances of the offending were set out by the sentencing judge commencing at [3]:
	


[3] In July 2003, three school friends turned 18 within a few days of each other. They decided to have a joint party. They hired the community hall at Cecil Hills. They made arrangements with the police to enable liquor to be brought to the premises. They each invited guests. One of the young men was the cousin of Meng Thammavongsa. And so it was that Mr Thammavongsa was invited to the party.

[4] On the night of the party, Mr Thammavongsa went with his cousin to the community hall quite early. He helped set up the hall. He took with him both alcohol and drugs. He had a bottle of whisky, some beer and several ecstasy tablets. Mr Thammavongsa also had with him, a firearm and a number of bullets. The firearm was an unusual weapon, known as a ""pen gun"". It is called a pen gun because it physically resembles a fountain pen and is not much bigger. It consisted of a cylinder which is the barrel, which does not have a butt or handle. It resembles a short length of pipe. There is a firing mechanism on the top of the barrel, which is pulled back and then released. To load the weapon, the barrel is unscrewed. A bullet is then inserted and the two sections then screwed back together again. It is only capable of firing one shot at a time. It must be supported by one hand and the other hand is then used to release the trigger.

[5] Mr Thammavongsa took the weapon to the party. He said that he wanted to show his friends. There were a hundred or more invited guests who came at different stages during the evening. There was a disc jockey playing dance music. People moved in and out of the hall, gathering in small groups, talking in the car park and the parklands adjacent to the hall.

[6] At 10.00 pm or thereabouts, a number of uninvited guests arrived. They were described as a group of Asians. Amongst them was Khang Vinh Tien. An incident occurred in which a bottle or a beer can was thrown or kicked at a window of the hall. The window was not broken. A person inside the hall, Michael, a friend of Mr Thammavongsa, remonstrated with the person responsible, being one of the so-called group of Asians. There was an exchange of words. Ultimately an invited guest, a big man, came into the kitchen where Michael had been standing. The abuse between Michael and the person outside the hall stopped. Those involved drifted away. The incident itself was short lived. There was no physical contact between anyone involved.

[7] The party continued for a number of hours. Much of it was recorded on video. It appeared to be a normal party. People seemed happy. Mr Thammavongsa spent much of the night in the barbeque area just outside the hall. He consumed both whisky and beer. He was described by some of his friends as ""tipsy"". He also took an ecstasy tablet earlier in the evening. He took another some hours later. He had, in the past, consumed both alcohol and ecstasy on a number of occasions. Expert evidence was given that ecstasy, in combination with alcohol, has a sobering effect, without affecting the level of alcohol in the blood. The account Mr Thammavongsa gave of how much alcohol he consumed was, on the medical evidence, unreliable. Nonetheless, it can be accepted that he was affected both by alcohol and drugs. He said that he had an odd reaction to the second ecstasy tablet. It made him feel paranoid. However, he had a fair recollection of the events that were about to unfold. When asked by his counsel whether he was affected by drugs and alcohol, he said that he was, adding that he was not very affected.

[8] Shortly after midnight there was a further incident outside the hall. It involved another group of uninvited guests. They were described as Lebanese. The incident began at 12.06 am and was recorded on a video camera. The video formed part of the evidence. The incident did not develop beyond an exchange of words. There was, nonetheless, a degree of tension. One of the hosts then determined that the party should be shut down. They were, in any event, approaching the time when they were obliged to leave the hall. He therefore gave instructions to stop the music. Those within the hall began moving outside, gathering in small groups in the car park and on a grassed area adjacent to the hall.

[9] The shooting occurred at about 12.30 am. About 15 minutes beforehand, Mr Thammavongsa walked with his friend Michael to his car. Mr Thammavongsa retrieved the pen gun from the boot of the car. He also had a bullet in his pocket.

[10] Mr Thammavongsa walked back towards the car park. He separated from his friend Michael, who then approached another guest. Michael expressed fear of the Asians involved in the incident earlier in the evening. He asked his friend to drive his car to the road. One gathers that he was fearful that the car, which belonged to his parents, may be damaged. Michael had been drinking. He described himself as moderately affected by alcohol. Michael decided that he would leave the area by walking through some vacant land nearby, meeting his friend further down the road.

[11] Khang Vinh Tien and his friends were standing on the grassed area not far from the hall. It was, of course, dark. Some light fell upon the grassed area from the adjacent car park and the overhead lights of the road which was nearby. The lights in the hall were also on and shed some light on the area where Khang Vinh Tien and his friends were standing.

[12] As Mr Thammavongsa walked back towards the car park, he loaded the pen gun and placed it in his pocket. He then approached the group. He was by himself and about eight to ten metres from them. At the time, he was aged 21 years. The victim was aged 17 years and so were most of his friends. Mr Thammavongsa called out to them. Amongst other things he said:

‘Do you want to play?’

[13] A confrontation developed involving an exchange of words between Mr Thammavongsa and members of the group. Mr Thammavongsa said that his purpose in approaching the group was to protect his friend Michael. He thought the group were about to enter the hall and harm Michael. That was the background to his claim of self defence which the jury rejected. Whilst it may be accepted that Michael had expressed fear of the group of Asians, the suggestion that Mr Thammavongsa was concerned to protect Michael was odd. He had been to the car 15 minutes before with Michael when he retrieved the gun, which he had then loaded. Michael, meanwhile, had left the area in accordance with the arrangements which I have described. I do not accept, even as a probability, that the group or any member of it was advancing towards Mr Thammavongsa or the hall.

[14] The group which Mr Thammavongsa confronted comprised about half a dozen young men, including Khang Vinh Tien. When some members of the group answered back, Mr Thammavongsa took the pen gun from his pocket. He pointed it at the group. He agreed in cross examination that he was angry. He claimed, and the jury clearly rejected, that the victim or one of his companions made a gesture as though reaching for a weapon. None of the group was armed. Mr Thammavongsa fired the gun, aiming at the front of the victim. The weapon was inherently inaccurate. Although the bullet hit the victim on his face near the eye, ultimately causing brain damage which led to his death, it cannot be inferred that Mr Thammavongsa was aiming for his head. I make no finding that he intended to kill the victim, although plainly he intended to inflict very serious injury, as the jury found.

[15] Immediately after the incident, Mr Thammavongsa approached Khang Vinh Tien. He was on the ground and trying to get up. Mr Thammavongsa kicked him in the side of the head. I infer he did so because he was still angry. Although several witnesses suggested that he kicked the victim a number of times, I believe that he only kicked him once. It was enough to cause the victim to fall back down and to leave a deep-seated, though small, bruise on his scalp above the ear. Mr Thammavongsa then walked away. He made his way to a friend's car. After getting into the car, he said to his friend words to the effect:

‘I got him. I shot him in the face. I fucken kicked him in the face. They want to play games, little kids.’”

THE APPLICANT’S SUBJECTIVE CASE

The applicant’s background


	
	The applicant gave evidence on sentence, the essence of which was to confirm the contents of the report of Ms Anna Robilliard, Psychologist, dated 2 August 2005. His background may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The applicant was born in Laos. He was 21 years of age at the time of the offending. He had a difficult childhood. After his father died during the war in Laos the applicant (who was then aged 5) came to Australia. After arriving, his mother formed a relationship with a new partner, whom she subsequently married. There were tensions between the applicant and his stepfather.
	
	
	The applicant commenced using illicit drugs at an early age. He began using cannabis shortly after entering high school. He then began using heroin. He was expelled from one school. He had difficulty adjusting to the school to which he transferred following that expulsion. With the support of his family he underwent treatment for drug addiction, unfortunately without any real success.
	
	
	Against this background, the applicant found himself committing criminal offences as a juvenile. He was convicted of robbery in company before a Children’s Court in 1999 and was ordered to perform 150 hours community service. He was subsequently convicted of various offences involving the possession or supply of prohibited drugs. He was initially given the benefit of a fine but was later sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months.
	
	
	In 2001 the applicant returned to Laos where he spent time with his grandmother. He also underwent some form of treatment for heroin addiction, and later spent time living in a temple with a group of monks. He then returned to Australia. Although he managed to cease his use of heroin, he developed an addiction to alcohol and ecstasy. He was affected by both substances at the time of the offending. Ms Robilliard found, following formal testing, that the applicant was functioning in the average to below average range of intelligence.
	


The applicant’s remorse


	
	Ms Robilliard, whose report was before the sentencing judge, said (at page 6):
	


“On talking of his feelings about the offence Meng said he is very sorry for the victim and his family and hopes they would forgive him. He said he wished he had gone home from the party or run away from the confrontation. He insists that at the time he felt threatened and intimidated and “thought it was going to be a brawl.

Meng said he realised he had hit the victim and he promptly left the gathering. He remembered feeling “really shocked, scared, what’s going to happen”? At this point in our meeting he became frustrated and said it was hard to explain how he felt. His expression suggested distress and anguish. Meng went on to say that he still has nightmares about the event. He described how he feels the victim “comes and haunts me in my dreams”. He said sometimes in his dreams he feels like “something is pushing me and crushing me – I don’t like to sleep because of that feeling.” Meng said the offence also often comes into his mind during the day”.


	
	Ms Robilliard also said (at p. 9):
	


“Meng is now well and healthy. His recollections of the offence are ongoing and deeply distressing to him. He has an appropriate awareness of the pain and loss to the victim’s family must feel and he is also aware of the effect on his own family. He expressed remorse and contrition stating that he wished he could turn back time and resolve the events of the evening in a different way”.


	
	In his affidavit of 4 February 2015 the applicant said (at para. 22):
	


“When I think about the offence, I feel really terrible. I never meant to kill the bloke. I was a stupid idiot and I always wanted to impress my friends. I was drinking, had taken ecstasy and got myself into a bad situation. If I knew then what I know now I would have just walked away, but when you’re young you don’t think like that – you’re just hot tempered. I regret it every day. I feel really bad for the bloke’s family most of all.”

The applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation


	
	In his affidavit of 4 February 2014 the applicant stated that he started to use drugs shortly after being taken into custody in order to “numb the pain”. He went on to state that he stopped using drugs at the end of 2012. Clearly, that was not the truth. Annexure A to the affidavit of Ms Fleeton establishes that between October 2013 and July 2014 the applicant had six separate instances of misconduct recorded, all of which were related directly or indirectly to his possession of drugs or his possession of implements used for taking them. In his subsequent affidavit of 26 March 2015 the applicant expressly conceded that there were instances in 2014 when he was found to be in possession of methadone and when he failed urine testing.
	
	
	That said, the applicant has attended literacy and numeracy classes on a regular basis since January 2014. He has been employed in custody and has completed a number of courses directed towards his rehabilitation. Partly as a consequence of the completion of these courses the applicant’s classification was reduced in September 2013. He has expressed a willingness to enrol in other courses. He continues to maintain regular contact with his family and has the support of his mother with whom he proposes to live upon his release.
	


Other factors arising from the affidavit evidence


	
	The applicant stated that his period in custody “has not been easy”. He asked, at an early stage, to be placed on protection out of fear of threats and violence by friends of the deceased who were also in custody. The applicant remains on protection, although at a level which appears to be the lowest in the custodial system. The applicant also stated that he had received “attention” from other inmates, as a consequence of which he was (and remains) in fear of being sexually assaulted.
	
	
	Although the applicant conceded that he had experienced difficulties with anxiety and depression prior to his offending he said that these problems had increased since being taken into custody. As I have previously noted, he admitted to having taken drugs in custody and stated that he had attempted suicide at one point by attempting to inject bleach. The fact that he suffers from anxiety is confirmed by the contents of a clinical note dated 2 September 2013 (part of Annexure A to the affidavit of Mr Eccleshall). That note records the applicant being described as a “highly anxious man, mildly tremulous, stuttering, distraught”.
	
	
	As a result of all of these matters, the applicant has come under psychiatric care since being taken into custody. He was prescribed anti-depressant medication in 2009 but ceased taking it in 2011, apparently having formed the view that it was not assisting him. In the period immediately following his cessation of medication the applicant failed a number of urine tests which revealed the presence of illicit drugs in his blood stream.
	
	
	The applicant then resumed psychiatric care in 2013 and was again prescribed anti-depressant medication. However once again he ceased taking that medication after a short period.
	
	
	The applicant continues to suffer from anxiety and depression. He has recently come under the care of Dr McClure, psychiatrist, who has prescribed anti-depressant medication which the applicant is again taking. The applicant also stated that he suffered back injuries as a consequence of a motorcycle accident which occurred prior to being taken into custody and was diagnosed as having hepatitis C in about 2001.
	
	
	Despite his protected status the applicant commenced to start sharing a cell in 2014. He has said that he feels claustrophobic as a consequence and that he worries about being attacked whilst sleeping.
	
	
	He continues to maintain regular contact with his family, including his sister and mother.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT


	
	In submitting that the applicant’s subjective case was compelling, senior counsel emphasised the applicant’s youth, and what was said to be his immaturity, at the time of the offending. It was submitted that both factors reduced the applicant’s moral culpability.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that the applicant had originally taken the weapon to the function intending to show it to his friends because it was “novelty”. It was submitted that the unusual nature of the weapon was such that a person of the applicant’s then age may well have wanted to show it to his friends. It was submitted that against this background, the applicant’s subsequent actions should not be regarded as being “adult-type” offending and that in terms of objective gravity, the weapon used by the applicant to kill the deceased fell at the lower end of the range compared with (for example) a pistol or a shotgun.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that properly viewed, the applicant’s offending was the act of an immature young man. It was submitted that such immaturity was confirmed by the following passage from the report of Ms Robilliard (at p. 5):
	


“Meng was living with his cousin Gary and family in the months leading up to the offence. Gary had become one of his closest friends and Meng was also friendly with most of Gary’s mates. They were all about 2 years younger than the client”.


	
	Senior counsel accepted that taking the weapon to the function for the purpose of showing it to friends was clearly reckless, particularly in circumstances where ammunition was also taken. It was also accepted that the applicant chose to retrieve, and load, the weapon when there was an indication that hostilities may be forming. However senior counsel emphasised that the applicant’s decision to fire the weapon was not made until the time of the actual confrontation, and that there was therefore no planning or premeditation. He submitted that in these circumstances the applicant’s offending should be regarded as essentially spontaneous. For these reasons, senior counsel took issue with the finding of the sentencing judge that the offending fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. He submitted that all of the factors to which he had referred supported a conclusion that the offending fell below that level.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that the applicant’s criminal history was largely insignificant. He also drew attention to the applicant’s expressions of remorse in his recent affidavit which, it was submitted, were consistent with the findings of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In terms of the evidence of the applicant’s conditions of custody, senior counsel emphasised that the applicant:
	



	
	had been placed, and remained, in protective custody;
	
	
	remained fearful of being assaulted, and fearful of reprisals from friends of the deceased; and
	
	
	was suffering from anxiety and depression.
	



	
	All of these matters were relied upon in support of the submission that the applicant’s conditions of custody were difficult.
	
	
	Senior counsel accepted that the applicant’s drug use whilst in custody had adversely affected his prospects of rehabilitation. However it was submitted that this had occurred against a background of being in protective custody and suffering anxiety and depression. It was further submitted that those matters which had adversely affected the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were to be balanced against the evidence of the applicant having undertaken various courses whilst in custody. It was submitted that his efforts in that regard, and his expressed willingness to attend further courses, demonstrated a preparedness on the part of the applicant to make further attempts at rehabilitation.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	The Crown submitted that the approach to the sentencing of young offenders, which generally ascribed greater emphasis to rehabilitation and less to deterrence and retribution, was not a blanket approach and that the extent of its application was to be determined on a case by case basis. In particular, the Crown submitted that the youth of an offender did not automatically lead to a reduced sentence.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that if it could be established that the applicant’s immaturity was a significant contributing factor to the offending then this would support a conclusion that his criminality was reduced. However it was submitted that there was no relevant nexus established between the applicant’s youth and his offending.
	
	
	The Crown also accepted that the mere presence of violence did not, of itself, indicate that a young person had been acting as an adult. However, it was submitted that in offending as he did, the applicant had effectively conducted himself as an adult. In support of its position the Crown relied upon a number of factors.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown relied upon the fact that having taken the weapon to the function, the applicant retrieved it from the motor vehicle, loaded it and then returned to the group. It was submitted that whilst the applicant may not have intended to kill the deceased, the retrieval and loading of the weapon were necessarily deliberate decisions.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown relied upon that part of the report of Ms Robilliard which was in the following terms (at page 8):
	


“When he returned to Australia in early 2002 he found employment and was still employed when he was arrested. While he was not using heroin, he was abusing alcohol and ecstasy tablets together on what he described as special occasions, such as the night of the offence.

Being a few years older than his cousin and the group he had been associating with since his return to Australia, Meng seems to have assumed a more prominent role and a sense of responsibility. On the night of the offence he was instrumental in setting up and running the party for his cousin Gary and two friends and he had organised to cook. He was upset when an uninvited group proceeded to eat food prepared for the invited guests. He was also concerned when he though (sic) Michael Nguyen, one of his group of friends had been involved in a confrontation with the gatecrashers and was likely to be harmed. The shooting occurred when Meng confronted the uninvited group of youths”.


	
	The Crown submitted that this history provided by the applicant ran contrary to the suggestion that his offending was a reflection, or a result, of his immaturity. The Crown emphasised, in particular, Ms Robilliard’s reference to the applicant having assumed “a sense of responsibility” within the family with whom he was living at the time. It was submitted that the only aspect of the offending which reflected immaturity was the applicant’s action in taking the weapon to show it off to his friends, and that this was of limited weight in all of the circumstances.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown pointed to the fact that applicant was 21 years of age at the time of the offending. It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, and having attained his majority, he should not be regarded as an immature young man.
	
	
	Fourthly, and quite apart from the fact that the offending involved the use of a weapon, the Crown emphasised that the applicant had chosen to retrieve, and then load, the weapon when signs of conflict were emerging. The Crown also emphasised that having loaded the weapon, the applicant walked some distance to confront the group (the members of which were all unarmed). It was submitted that the statement then made by the applicant, namely “Do you want to play?”, was inherently provocative and reflected the fact that the applicant was the aggressor.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown relied upon the fact that having shot the deceased, the applicant kicked him in the head before leaving the area. It was submitted that this circumstance increased the objective gravity of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that all of these factors supported the conclusion that the offending was properly viewed as falling at the mid-range of objective seriousness. The Crown further submitted that the contents of the affidavit of Ms Fleeton (to which I referred at [57] above) reflected adversely upon the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	


CONSIDERATION

The applicant’s youth and the circumstances of his offending


	
	One of the principal submissions advanced by senior counsel for the applicant was that the applicant’s age, and what was said to be his immaturity, reduced his level of moral culpability. This Court has considered the principles relevant to the sentencing of young persons on a number of occasions.
	
	
	In KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 McClellan CJ at CL said (at [22]-[26]):
	


[22] The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. These principles were considered in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA), R v E (a child) (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511; [2002] NSWCCA 349 at [30].

[23] The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age. (R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25]). The weight to be given to the fact of the offender’s youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence (Hearne at [24]). Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult. (Hearne at [25]; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397 at [61]).

[24] Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135):

“It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of Williscroft (1975) VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment ie coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.”

[25] The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity (R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995, Hunt CJ at CL; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10]; R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in “adult behaviour” (Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence (Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society.

[26] The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity (R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A ‘child-offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age (R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth (Hearne at [27]).”


	
	Senior counsel placed considerable emphasis on the judgment of Hodgson JA in BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; (2010) 201 A Crim R 379 in support of the applicant’s position. In that case Hodgson JA (at [3]) expressly accepted the principles set out by McClellan CJ in KT (at [22]-[26]) before proceeding to say the following:
	


“[3] … I wish to make three points concerning these principles.

[4] First, statements that, in relation to young offenders, principles of retribution may be of less significance and considerations of rehabilitation may be of more significance, may tend to obscure the point that even in relation to retribution the youth of an offender may be a mitigating circumstance. In my understanding, considerations of retribution direct attention to what the offender deserves; and in my opinion, where emotional immaturity or a young person’s less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour contributes to the offending, this may be seen as mitigating culpability and thus as reducing what is suggested by considerations of retribution: see TM v R [2008] NSWCCA 158 at [33] – [36].

[5] Second, while I agree with the statements in KT at [26] that the weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity, and that a “child offender” of almost 18 years cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over 18 years of age, it does not follow that the age of maturity is 18 (albeit that for certain purposes the law does draw a line there: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. In my understanding, emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively during adolescence and early adulthood, and may not be fully developed until the early to mid twenties: see R v Slade [2005] 2 NZLR 526 at [43], quoted by Kirby J in R v Elliott [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1 at 27 [127]. As shown by R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, youth may be a material factor in sentencing even a 19 year old for a most serious crime.

[6] Third, I do not think courts should be over-ready to discount the relevance of an offender’s youth on the basis that the offender has engaged in adult behaviour or acted as an adult. In the present case, the offence is a very serious one; but it did not involve significant planning or reflection, or any other indicia of mature decision-making. The applicant was 16 years old, and in my opinion the circumstances of the offence suggest rather that emotional immaturity and less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulses were likely to be contributing factors.”


	
	In the same case Johnson J having set out (at [74]) the principles in KT said (at [75]):
	


“[75] It is, of course, necessary to apply these statutory provisions and statements of principle to the particular circumstances of the case. As McClellan CJ at CL observed in KT v R at 578; [23], the law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. The law considers youth and not just biological age. Where immaturity of an offender is a significant contributing factor to the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult.”


	
	In JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83; (2012) 223 A Crim R 55 Simpson J, having reviewed the authorities, said (at [108]):
	


“[108] It seems to me that the weight of authority is that the seriousness of an offence is relevant to the emphasis that can be given to the youth of an offender. That does not mean that youth is not an important consideration; but retribution and deterrence cannot, in a case as serious as the present, give way entirely or even substantially to the interests of rehabilitation. It cannot be overlooked that MF-D will for the rest of his life suffer the consequences of the applicant's action.”


	
	More recently in HJ v R [2014] NSWCCA 21 Garling J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and RS Hulme AJ agreed) observed (at [56]):
	


“It is undoubted that the youth of an offender is a relevant factor to be considered in assessing what sentence ought be imposed. The Court makes an allowance for the youth of the offender because immaturity is usually involved. Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25].”


	
	There is no doubt that the applicant’s youth at the time of the offending is a relevant factor to be taken into account in considering sentence. However, I am not satisfied that the applicant’s offending displayed the level of immaturity for which senior counsel contended, nor am I satisfied that there was any nexus between any such immaturity and the offending.
	
	
	The unusual nature of the weapon was such that the applicant may well have regarded it as something of a novelty which he wished to show his friends. However in my view, any immaturity on the part of the applicant was confined to that circumstance and played no part in what occurred thereafter. I have come to this view for a number of reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, the applicant did not only take the weapon to the function. He also took ammunition. Showing the weapon to his friends because its appearance was novel did not necessitate taking ammunition.
	
	
	Secondly, I am unable to accept the submission that the weapon in the present case was of less significance when compared to other weapons or firearms. The fact that it could be fired unobtrusively rendered it particularly dangerous. The consequences of its use were no less serious than those which can result from the use of a more “conventional” firearm.
	
	
	Thirdly, whilst I accept (as the sentencing judge did) that the offending was not planned or pre-meditated, it nevertheless involved the applicant:
	



	
	retrieving the weapon from the boot of the vehicle at a time when conflict was intimated;
	
	
	deliberately loading it;
	
	
	walking back to the group of persons who had gathered outside the hall;
	
	
	making a provocative statement towards the opposing group;
	
	
	pointing the gun, in a state of admitted anger, towards the deceased and killing him;
	
	
	thereafter kicking the deceased whilst he was attempting to get up from the ground after he had been shot;
	
	
	later dismissing the members of the opposing group as “little kids” who “want to play games”.
	



	
	The applicant was not a teenager: KT at [26]. When viewed as a whole his conduct was not impulsive. His behaviour did not reflect emotional immaturity, nor did it reflect a less than fully developed capacity to control impulses: BP at [5] and [6]. On the contrary, the applicant’s offending was the culmination of a series of considered and deliberate decisions. It was accompanied by a statement which was inherently provocative. That statement, the applicant’s admitted anger at the time of firing the weapon, his assault of the deceased by kicking him (at a time when he was trying to regain his feet after being shot), and the statement which was made immediately following that assault, reflected an apparent desire on the part of the applicant to demonstrate his “superiority” over those in the opposing group. None of that was immature. It was adult like offending.
	
	
	It follows that whilst the applicant’s youth remains a relevant factor to take into account in determining sentence, it is not such as to warrant the application of the principles set out in KT and the other authorities to which I have referred. There is nothing to suggest that immaturity played any part in the applicant’s offending. This was a crime of considerable gravity which involved the use of a weapon.
	
	
	It is also significant that the applicant was affected by both alcohol and drugs at the time of the offending. He initiated a violent and unprovoked attack upon the deceased. In all of these circumstances, general deterrence remains significant: R v Carroll; Carroll v R [2010] NSWCCA 55; (2010) 77 NSWLR 45 at [60]-[61] per Allsop P and Johnson J (Spigelman CJ, Kirby and Howie JJ agreeing).
	
	
	Giving full weight to the fact the offending was not premeditated or accompanied by an intention to kill, all of the matters to which I have referred support the conclusion that the offending falls at the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	There is no doubt that the applicant’s formative years were difficult. Having arrived from a foreign country, his teenage years were affected by his drug taking. This, in turn, affected his family life. These are all matters relevant to a determination of sentence and I have taken them into account.
	


The applicant’s criminal history


	
	Apart from an offence of robbery in company as a juvenile, the remainder of the applicant’s criminal history is limited to offences of drug possession and drug supply towards the lower end of the scale. There is no substantial history of violent offending, and no history at all involving the use of prohibited weapons. The absence of any significant record of previous convictions is a mitigating factor.
	


The applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant candidly accepted that the evidence of the applicant’s drug taking in custody, and the disciplinary breaches associated with it, ran generally contrary to any favourable conclusion being reached as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. I have taken into account the fact that the applicant has demonstrated a willingness to engage in rehabilitation by undertaking employment and enrolling in various educational courses. However it must be said that in light of his custodial history, his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded at best.
	


The applicant’s conditions of custody


	
	The applicant has experienced some difficulties in custody which have seen him placed on some form of protection. The applicant’s placement appears to have been brought about by his perceived need for protection, rather than as the result of a specific violent incident or incidents.
	
	
	The applicant also been diagnosed as suffering from anxiety and depression. I accept that this has the capacity to render his time in custody more onerous. However two matters must be noted. Firstly, the applicant concedes that he suffered from anxiety prior to being taken into custody. Secondly, specialist medical treatment has been consistently made available to the applicant, including the prescription of anti-depressant medication. The applicant has chosen not to take that medication from time to time because of a self-assessment that it was not beneficial. That is obviously the applicant’s right. However, if that is a course that he wishes to take he faces an obvious difficulty in asserting that his anxiety and depression render his conditions of custody more onerous.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	For the reasons stated, this was serious offending which fell at the mid-range of objective seriousness. I have taken into account the applicant’s youth. That said, he was 21 years of age and his offending was not reflective of immaturity.
	
	
	The applicant’s subjective circumstances, particularly those surrounding his upbringing, are relevant. The circumstances which saw him migrate to Australia at a young age were obviously unfortunate. It is apparent that the applicant developed a drug habit in his early teens from which he never fully recovered. However whilst these matters are obviously relevant I would not categorise them, or the applicant’s subjective case generally, as compelling. In particular, and despite his strained relationship with his step father, the applicant had the support of his family throughout his formative years. That support extended to funding external treatment to assist the applicant in relinquishing his heroin habit.
	
	
	I acknowledge that the applicant’s conditions of custody are difficult. However, to the extent that those difficulties emanate from mental illness, appropriate treatment is (and has always been) available to him in custody. The applicant has made some attempt towards his rehabilitation by enrolling to undertake appropriate courses of study, although his progress has been interrupted by his relapse into drug use. For all of those reasons, his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded.
	
	
	Having taken all of these matters into account I have come to the view, in the fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion, that no other sentence is warranted.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The time for filing an application for leave to appeal against sentence is extended.
	
	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

2766729,EL-AFCHAL v R [2015] NSWCCA 112,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: The applicant, Housam El-Afchal, seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge Colefax SC in the District Court, on 21 November 2013 in respect of three offences, namely:
	



	
	Receiving, contrary to s 188(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 12 years imprisonment. There is no prescribed standard non-parole for such an offence.
	
	
	Knowingly facilitating an organised car rebirthing activity contrary to s 154G of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is no prescribed standard non-parole period for such an offence.
	
	
	Possession of a prohibited weapon contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is no prescribed non-parole period for such an offence.
	



	
	The receiving offence and the possess prohibited weapon offence were committed on 7 March 2007. The car rebirthing offence was committed between 1 October 2006 and 7 March 2007. The applicant was charged on 9 August 2007 and released to bail that day.
	
	
	The offences were aggravated by reason of the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant entered pleas of guilty to the subject offences in the Local Court on 21 March 2013 and was committed for sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge in accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 stated that the indicative sentences that he would have imposed in respect of the individual offences were as follows:
	



	
	The Receiving offence: a sentence of 3 years imprisonment which after a discount of 20% for the applicant’s guilty plea would result in a sentence of 2 years 5 months;
	
	
	The Rebirthing offence: a sentence of 4 years and 6 months. Application of the 20% discount for the applicant’s guilty plea produced an indicative sentence of 3 years and 7 months. His Honour indicated that there would have been a partial accumulation of sentences in respect of these first two offences.
	
	
	The Prohibited Weapons offence: a sentence of 6 months imprisonment. After the application of the discount for the applicant’s guilty plea the sentence would have been a period of 4 months. This sentence, his Honour stated, would have been wholly concurrent with the other offences.
	


Ground of Appeal


	
	The single ground of appeal relied upon was in the following terms:
	


“His Honour erred in his consideration of the evidence regarding the applicant’s rehabilitation and the relevance of the delay.”

The Order on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge, as indicated above, allowed a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s guilty pleas. The commencement of the sentences was backdated to take account of custody solely referable to the offences for which he was to be sentenced.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate period of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 18 August 2013 and to expire on 17 August 2015. Under the aggregate sentence the applicant would be eligible for release to parole on 18 August 2015. The total term of the sentence will expire on 17 August 2017.
	


The Issue of Delay


	
	It is necessary to clarify the “delay” referred to in the ground of appeal. The applicant relied upon a period of delay from February 2009 (at which time he was released to bail in respect of offences committed in Queensland as discussed below) until the imposition of the aggregate sentence by the District Court being a period of approximately 4 years and 9 months.
	
	
	In the submissions before the sentencing judge “delay” was referred to by the applicant in a more expansive sense than the delay associated with the issue of the applicant’s rehabilitation. At [25] of the Applicant’s Submissions on the present application, reference was made to a period of at least 6.5 years of delay before the date of sentencing.
	
	
	As discussed below, in his submissions to this court Mr Barrow, for the applicant, focused upon that period during which the applicant was on bail pending the disposition of offences he had committed in Queensland as well as the period of twelve months during which the applicant was serving the non-parole period of his sentence for the Queensland offences being a period of approximately 4 years and 9 months (February 2009 – May 2012).
	
	
	The applicant’s case is that the sentencing judge failed to appreciate or take into account that period as a basis for determining the extent of the applicant’s rehabilitation. It was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that the sentencing judge should have found on the evidence that during the relevant period of delay identified by the applicant the offender’s progress on rehabilitation had been “substantial”.
	
	
	In the event that this Court finds there had been error as propounded in the Ground of Appeal then it was contended that a lesser sentence in law is warranted.
	


Factual Circumstances Relevant to Delay


	
	In order to understand the background and the events relating to the issue of delay it is noted that at the time of the subject offences (7 March 2007) the applicant was on bail in respect of two charges. One was a charge of conspiracy to steal a large sum of money. The relevant date for that charge was 5 September 2005. The other was a charge of stealing a motor vehicle also alleged to have occurred on 5 September 2005. In respect of those two charges, his Honour Colefax DCJ observed that the Agreed Facts tendered on sentence included references to the use of stolen cars, as well as stolen Fire Brigade and Police radios – facts that his Honour observed were similar to the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced by him: ROS at p 10. In respect of the 2005 offences His Honour, Cogswell DCJ, sentenced the applicant on 23 May 2008 imposing a term of imprisonment of 22 months for the first offence which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act. In relation to the second offence, of steal motor vehicle, the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 6 months which was also suspended.
	
	
	On 6 December 2008, the applicant committed further offences in Queensland for which he was bail refused until release on bail on 9 February 2009. He was sentenced by the Queensland District Court to imprisonment for the Queensland offences on 6 May 2011 on the basis of a total term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 1 year.
	
	
	On 6 May 2012 the applicant was released on parole in Queensland and extradited to New South Wales with regard to the outstanding charges, the subject of this appeal. Accordingly, a substantial period (approximately 2 years 6 months) in respect of the “delay” related to the Queensland proceedings. He remained in custody, bail refused on the New South Wales charges until obtaining bail on 14 August 2012.
	
	
	In considering the issue of delay his Honour Colefax DCJ took into account that shortly after the applicant commenced his sentence in Queensland, New South Wales Police had made requests for his transfer to New South Wales so that the present matters could proceed. However, as his Honour observed, no response to the request was forthcoming.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that a substantial, if not the predominant, factor in the delay was “the Government of Queensland” having ignored the extradition requests made by New South Wales Police. His Honour described this as a “highly unsatisfactory attitude for a responsible government department to adopt”: ROS at p 12. However, as noted above, a period of approximately 2 years and 6 months delay was not due to governmental delay, but occurred as a result of the delay between arrest, plea and sentencing in the Queensland Court. To that extent the applicant had the benefit of a favourable finding which did not completely reflect all the actual reasons for the delay period to which I have referred above.
	
	
	The period of delay with which his Honour was concerned was the period following the applicant’s sentencing for the Queensland offences on 6 May 2011 until imposition of the aggregate sentence on 21 November 2013, the subject of the present application. To that extent there is a discrepancy between the period of delay considered by his Honour and the relevant period identified by the applicant as discussed above at [12].
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	At the sentence hearing a Statement of Crown Facts was tendered (part of Exhibit 1 at those proceedings). An additional statement was tendered (Exhibit A-1 at those proceedings) setting out Supplementary Agreed Facts. These documents, as well as the submissions of each party in relation to this appeal, set out the relevant events resulting in the applicant’s 2007 charges.
	
	
	In respect of the receiving charge, items of property were located in the course of execution of a search warrant on 7 March 2007. The items seized had previously been stolen and were in the possession of the accused, he knowing that they had been stolen or believing that they may have been stolen. The property consisted of five groups of items conveniently summarised in the applicant’s Written Submissions at [27] as follows:
	


●   125 vials of human growth hormone that were part of a larger quantity of the drug stolen from the premises of Serona Limited on 5 February 2007;

●   22 DVD players and a number of CD players and associated items that were stolen from Strathfield Car Radios in December 2006;

●   Three 2 way radios belonging to the police and fire brigade;

●   A VHF radio;

●   Two carpet cleaners, each the property of Coles Supermarkets and each worth $3,000.


	
	In respect of the car rebirthing offence, the sentencing judge identified seven matters concerning the offence. These were also conveniently summarised in the applicant’s Written Submissions at [28] as follows:
	


●   At the time of the search four new and unused Mazda compliance build plates were located in the offender’s home. Compliance plates indicate whether a vehicle complies with Australian Standards.

●   A large number of parts were located that came from a Subaru Impreza that had been stolen in December 2004.

●   Five Subaru engines were located. Two engines had their engine numbers removed. A third was from a Subaru stolen in January 2007.

●   A Subaru motor vehicle that had originally been purchased by the applicant’s wife in January 2003 and then stolen on 31 December 2004 (in circumstances where the offender’s wife was reimbursed $52,000.00) was located in an altered condition at the applicant’s home. It had a different engine that originated from a Subaru stolen in June 2005.

●   A red Subaru WRX was also located that had been substantially modified. The original VIN had been destroyed. Parts of the vehicle were identified as having been stolen.

●   A green Toyota Landcruiser that had been stolen in November 2006. The engine number, the build plate and compliance plate had all been altered.

●   The applicant and others had stolen a 1971 Mazda Capella worth $4000 and a 1976 Mazda 929.


	
	The possess prohibited weapon offence related to the finding of a black steel extendable baton in a tool kit during execution of the search warrant on 7 March 2007. The sentencing judge rejected the applicant’s explanation as to how he came to be in possession of that item.
	
	
	His Honour noted that as at 7 March 2007 the applicant had been on conditional bail with regard to other offences involving similar conduct to the subject offences, in particular, the use of stolen cars, and stolen Fire Brigade and Police radios (as discussed in para [15] above).
	
	
	His Honour also noted that the applicant had been arrested in Queensland on 9 December 2008, five months into the suspended sentence imposed by Cogswell DCJ for the 2005 offences and whilst still on bail for the subject offences. He was never called up with regard to the breach of the suspended sentences. As earlier noted, the applicant remained in custody in respect of the Queensland offences until 9 February 2009 when he was released to bail.
	
	
	The sentencing judge observed that upon completion of the non-parole period in Queensland the applicant was extradited to New South Wales with regard to the subject offences and that he remained in custody until 14 August 2012 when he was granted bail. His Honour noted that he had remained on bail in Queensland until the date of the sentence.
	
	
	As at the date of sentence the applicant was 35 years of age. He did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. The sentencing judge considered that the evidence as to his subjective case was very limited. His Honour noted that he had sought to minimise his culpability in respect of the subject offences on the occasion when he was interviewed for the purposes of the pre-sentence report prepared by the Queensland Department of Corrective Services dated 28 June 2013, written by Ms Lisa Freshney. That report was tendered in evidence and became Exhibit B in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	His Honour stated that “in the absence of sworn evidence from the applicant and noting amongst other things his swift re-offending after receiving the two s 12 bonds, I do not accept on the balance of probabilities those reported expressions of remorse”: ROS at p 12.
	
	
	His Honour also noted the reference in the pre-sentence report to the fact that the applicant had developed a heroin habit for a period in 2008 but that he had refrained from that habit after his arrest in Queensland in December 2008.
	
	
	His Honour took into account that the applicant had commenced working for a Queensland property development company after his release from custody in May 2012. However, as discussed below, there was a factual error made by his Honour in this respect as the evidence indicated that in or about February 2009 the applicant obtained employment with a Queensland development company and remained in its employment for over two years – that is, from approximately February 2009 until approximately May 2011 when he commenced his sentence in respect of the Queensland offences.
	
	
	In respect of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour observed:
	


“Assessing the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation is not a straightforward matter. One factor of course often relevant to assessing rehabilitation is an offender’s expression of genuine remorse. For reasons I have already indicated, I am unable on the evidence before me to find that in the present case there is such a genuine expressions. (sic) Moreover, in assessing the prospects of rehabilitation it is appropriate for me to have regard to the attempt by the offender to minimise his moral culpability in relation to these offences whilst on conditional liberty, and the fact of the convictions and sentence by Cogswell DCJ and the Queensland District Court for other serious criminal activity. As against this, there is the not lengthy history of employment following his parole in Queensland, together with the support he has from his wife and family.

On balance, I am unable to accept the submission by Mr Boulten that his prospects of re-offending are low and that he has turned a corner. I do however think that his prospects for rehabilitation are reasonable.” (ROS 15)


	
	His Honour also observed that the offences were “extremely serious”: ROS 15. His Honour stated that receivers of stolen property should receive “condign punishment” and that in relation to car rebirthing offences, general deterrence was an important matter. His Honour referred to relevant decisions of this Court in relation to the lastmentioned offences.
	
	
	In respect of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing judge that this was a case where delay justified a degree of leniency that might otherwise be unwarranted, his Honour stated:
	


“In the present case the offender has only been on conditional liberty since May 2012 and in circumstances where he was aware of this sentencing process. Whilst he has not offended in that period I am not satisfied in all the circumstances that there is proved substantial progress towards rehabilitation, although there clearly is some.” (ROS 16-17)


	
	His Honour stated that he would give the applicant “a degree of lenience he would otherwise not be entitled to because of the conduct of the Queensland authorities”: ROS at [17].
	
	
	His Honour then determined to aggregate the sentence and reduce each individual sentence in the way specified above because of the delay. His Honour also found that there were special circumstances by reason of the delay.
	


Submissions for the Applicant


	
	In his written submissions, Mr Barrow observed that the applicant came before the sentencing judge with a criminal record that disclosed that he had not offended since the commission of the Queensland offences on 6 December 2008, a period of almost five years. The offences, he noted, for which he stood for sentence had been committed more than six and a half years earlier.
	
	
	The ground of appeal in support of the application for leave to appeal was argued upon the basis of an asserted House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 error. The error was, in effect, argued as one involving the interrelationship between an extensive period of delay and the facts concerning the applicant’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	As to the mitigatory significance of rehabilitation in circumstances of delay, it was contended for the applicant on the present application, that his Honour proceeded, erroneously, upon the basis that the applicant had only been on conditional liberty from May 2012 whereas in fact he had been on parole for a period in excess of 2 years and 3 months during which it was submitted he had pursued a productive life without any further offending.
	
	
	The submission was that his Honour failed to take into account the period between 9 February 2009 and 6 May 2011, during which the applicant had been on bail in Queensland for two years and three months and had been in productive employment. Further, it was submitted that there had been a failure to take into account the 12 months non-parole period of the Queensland sentence which was completed without incident and that the applicant had been paroled immediately when he became eligible for release. It was also noted that during the non-parole period he had also been approved for various forms of day release: Applicant’s Written Submissions at [48].
	
	
	His Honour’s rejection of the proposition that the application had made substantial progress towards rehabilitation, it was argued, was flawed by reason of that error. In his oral submissions, Mr Barrow stated;
	


“… he rejected the submission that there has been substantial progress towards rehabilitation. It is that conclusion that’s the subject of complaint in this appeal because what it failed to take into account was the long period of time that this man had been on bail in Queensland, two years and three months. He had been on bail in Queensland from February of 2009 until May of 2011.” (T 3-4)


	
	Mr Barrow relied upon the evidence at the sentence hearing which was favourable to the applicant on the issue of his rehabilitation both during the non-parole period served in respect of the Queensland offence and subsequently when released to parole. The evidence included:
	



	
	Six character references, including that given by Mr Con Bassilli. These were supportive of the applicant’s diligent attention to his employment duties as well as his personal qualities based on their knowledge of him from 2009. Mr Bassilli also gave favourable oral evidence at the sentencing hearing before Colefax DCJ.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant had married, purchased a home in Queensland, and had abstained from drugs and alcohol.
	
	
	During his 12 months in custody in respect of the sentence imposed for the Queensland offences, the evidence indicated that he had been granted day leave, confirming that he had satisfied the requirements of the Queensland Correctional authorities.
	



	
	Mr Bassilli’s evidence was relevant to the applicant’s progress towards rehabilitation from early 2009. Other testimonials, it was contended, supported the applicant on the issue of rehabilitation.
	
	
	In paragraph [56] of the Applicant’s Written Submissions Mr Barrow submitted:
	


“The totality of the evidence on sentence should have led his Honour to conclude that the applicant’s progress on rehabilitation had been substantial. The reasons for this included:

●   The period of two years three months on bail in Queensland from early 2009 and the evidence that the applicant had not committed further offences in this period or subsequently.

●   The applicant was in employment since early 2009, apart from the fifteen months he had spent in custody.

●   The incident free period of imprisonment in Queensland that followed in 2011, for offences committed in late 2008.

●   His co-operation in being extradited to New South Wales in May 2012.

●   Despite the effective period of 15 months imprisonment in 2011-12, the further period of parole supervision in Queensland from August 2012 until November 2013 pending sentence in the subject proceedings.

●   The positive contents of the Queensland Probation and Parole Service report regarding his conduct whilst on parole.

●   The applicant’s stable family situation, together with the evidence that he was a committed parent to his two young children.

●   That he had purchased a home in Queensland.

●   The absence of any evidence that the applicant continued to have a drug or alcohol problem.

●   The fact that he was sufficiently well regarded for a number of people to write references on his behalf for use in the sentence proceedings.”


	
	Mr Barrow submitted that, in the event that error was established, a lesser sentence is warranted in law. In that respect it was submitted that greater emphasis should have been given to the impact of the delay and the finalisation of the subject charges and to “the long-standing and impressive rehabilitation achieved by the applicant”: Written Submissions at [57].
	
	
	It was noted that this Court in exercising the discretion to resentence the applicant, would take into account that the sentence served in Queensland was the applicant’s first sentence of full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	Whilst Mr Barrow acknowledged that the applicant had minimised his offending behavior in giving a history to the author of the pre-sentence report, and that he did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing, as against that, he emphasised that the pre-sentence report expressed a positive picture in that the history established that during the lengthy period he was on conditional liberty, including the period of February 2009 to May 2011, the applicant had returned to having a lawful life in the community: T 6.
	
	
	In the event that this Court accepted that sentencing error had been established the applicant relied upon the affidavit of his solicitor, Mr William Paul O’Brien affirmed 15 April 2015 including, in particular, the documents annexed to it. That evidence, it was contended, supported the proposition that a lesser sentence was warranted. The evidence, it was contended in the applicant’s submissions, established that the process of rehabilitation had been very impressively pursued by the applicant. He had been granted a C3 classification after about 12 months of the non-parole period served in Queensland and he had pursued education at TAFE. Surveillance performed on him confirmed that he had been compliant whilst at liberty. The material referred to in the affidavit, it was contended, established that the applicant had done well since being sentenced: T 8.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown in its written and oral submissions referred to the history of delay and submitted that his Honour had taken it into account and determined that the applicant had made progress towards rehabilitation although not to the extent that had been contended for on his behalf: Crown’s Written Submissions at [14]-[22]; at T 10:4-15.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the fact that the sentencing judge took that matter into account in reducing the head sentence for each offence and also took into account delay as the basis for the finding of special circumstances: Crown’s Written Submissions at [20].
	
	
	Accordingly, it was submitted that the way in which the issue of delay was applied to the sentence could be considered generous: Crown’s Written Submissions at [21]. No further reduction in sentence, the Crown contended, would be appropriate even if there was evidence of substantial rehabilitation: Crown’s Written Submissions at [21]. In oral submissions it was stated:
	


“… his Honour dealt with those aspects of progress towards rehabilitation. He did not find there was none. He took into account various parts of the evidence including that he had not only committed the offences whilst on bail but had committed further offences shortly after being granted bail for these matters and whilst he was on suspended sentences.

So his Honour had material which that series of offending would leave him somewhat guarded together with responses that he took from the reports from the applicant. So his Honour had a number of sources of material which his Honour relied on and then came to a determination and it’s really what is being asked is for [sic] the court, it’s not being suggested that he did not give attention to aspects of rehabilitation, rather he did not find as substantial progress towards rehabilitation.” (T 10:5-16)


	
	In summary, the Crown submitted that even if it could be said that there had been a higher level of rehabilitation than that assessed by the sentencing judge, he having reduced the sentence by reason of delay, both in terms of the head sentence and in the finding of special circumstances, no lesser sentence would be warranted than the aggregate sentence that was imposed upon the basis that there had, in fact, been some progress in the applicant’s rehabilitation: T 11:5-15.
	


Decision


	
	The central issue in the context of the history of delay, was whether the evidence, taken as a whole, necessarily established as has been argued, that the applicant had achieved “substantial” rehabilitation and, if so, whether, on the basis of sentencing error being established, that would warrant the intervention of this Court. If error is established, the critical issue then becomes whether some lesser sentence ought to be imposed taking into account all relevant circumstances including the evidence as to delay and rehabilitation.
	
	
	The sentencing judge clearly considered the issue of delay and the applicant’s rehabilitation as interrelated matters which were central to his subjective case on sentence. His Honour reviewed the evidence bearing upon that issue and made findings:
	



	
	Firstly, that whilst his Honour was not satisfied that there had been substantial progress towards rehabilitation “there clearly is some”: ROS at p 17.
	
	
	Secondly, that, as to the future, the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “reasonable”: ROS at p 15.
	



	
	In reaching his ultimate conclusion on the issues of delay and rehabilitation, his Honour observed, as noted above, that assessing the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation was “not a straightforward matter”. In that respect, his Honour noted that the genuineness or otherwise of an offender’s expressions of remorse is a relevant matter in making that assessment. In this case, his Honour rejected the applicant’s expressions of remorse as genuine (ROS at p 15). He also considered that the applicant’s attempt to minimise his moral culpability in relation to the subject offences was an additional matter that affected the assessment to be made as to the level of rehabilitation that had been achieved.
	
	
	In a case such as the present, where there has been a past history of offending of some significance and factors exist which are considered as reducing an offender’s reliability, the cogency or the strength of the evidence put forward to support a submission of substantial rehabilitation may also be reduced. A sentencing judge is in the best position to make a judgment of whether such a finding can be reached in the absence of evidence from the offender himself or herself.
	
	
	The applicant’s account to Ms Freshney, the author of the pre-sentence report, concerning the car rebirthing offences, it is to be noted, was one that not only minimised his responsibility, but was misleading. The pre-sentence report records the applicant’s account that the offence involved “one car” and that this was purchased by his cousin.
	
	
	As the written submissions of each party accurately state, the car rebirthing activities of the applicant involved a number of vehicles as well as parts (including engines) of cars. The evidence indicated that over the relevant six‑month period of offending, the applicant had played a significant role in an organised car rebirthing activity or enterprise.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the maximum penalty for that particular offence with which the applicant was charged (knowingly facilitating an organised car rebirthing activity contrary to s 154G of the Crimes Act), is, and was at the time of the applicant’s offence, 14 years imprisonment. The seriousness of an offence under s 154G including the risks of “rebirthed” vehicles and the potential dangers of the same, were the subject of close consideration in R v Tannous; R v Fahda; R v Dib [2012] NSWCCA 243, in particular by Basten JA (Hall and Beech‑Jones JJ agreeing) at [39]-[40] and [42]. In that case, Basten JA observed at [34]:
	


“The gravity of the activities constituting car rebirthing are reflected in the available penalties, being a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of four years. Nevertheless, because the section encompasses a wide range of criminal activity, it is necessary to focus on the particular offending conduct in identifying an appropriate punishment: Ibbs v R [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451–452; Hamieh at [50]. On the other hand, the section envisages that rebirthing activities may be carried out on an organised basis by a network of individuals carrying out specific functions for profit or gain, without there being a hierarchical organisation: s 154G(5)(b).”


	
	As noted above, application of the discount of 20% resulted in an indicative sentence of 3 years and 7 months for the car rebirthing offence alone. The aggregate sentence in respect of the three charges together of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years I consider reflects a degree of leniency, over and above the discount allowed for the applicant’s guilty plea and the finding of special circumstances. I accept, as the Crown submitted, that the finding of special circumstances must have been based upon the fact of delay, there being no other basis in the evidence upon which such a finding is likely to have been made. Finally, it is clear that the sentencing judge in sentencing the applicant did build in an allowance for the progress achieved in his rehabilitation.
	
	
	In my opinion, the sentencing judge’s refusal to find a “substantial” level of rehabilitation did not involve appellable error. An assessment of the progress or level of rehabilitation achieved by an offender over a period of time involves consideration of a number of matters many of which are not always susceptible to anything approaching fine measurement or estimation. In this case, the sentencing judge identified the bases upon which he considered a finding of “substantial” rehabilitation could not be made. There has been no demonstrated error in the matters that were taken into account in reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	Whilst it may be accepted that his Honour proceeded wrongly upon the basis that the applicant’s progress towards rehabilitation commenced upon his release to parole in May 2012, and that, in particular, it appears that his Honour did not have regard to the period of February 2009 – May 2011 which the applicant submits is a relevant period, the significance of that period to determining the applicant’s rehabilitation is the issue of importance. The fact that the applicant did not offend between February 2009 and May 2012 may be consistent with the applicant’s progress towards rehabilitation but it does not mandate a finding that the progress that had been made to that date was ‘substantial rehabilitation.’ Rehabilitation is not a finite concept that is susceptible to measurement. It involves an evaluative judgment. His Honour was required to consider a range of positive and negative factors. The latter in the applicant’s case included his history of criminal offending including the Queensland offences committed whilst on conditional liberty.
	
	
	Even if sentencing error had been established, it would be necessary for this Court in exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, to take into account the evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing, the evidence in the affidavit of William Paul O’Brien, solicitor, affirmed 15 April 2015, that would be relied upon for the purpose of resentencing as to events that have occurred since the applicant was sentenced on 21 November 2013, the purposes of sentencing and the relevant factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	As the High Court observed in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 313 ALR 451 at [43], in cases involving error of the kind described in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, this Court may conclude, as an independent exercise of discretion, taking into account all relevant matters, including events since the sentence hearing, that the same sentence is the appropriate sentence in which case the Court is not required to resentence.
	
	
	The evidence, as noted above, established the fact, as the sentencing judge accepted, that the applicant had achieved a level of rehabilitation. The affidavit evidence of Mr O’Brien and the annexures to it, establish the applicant’s ongoing progress and achievement in constructive activities for which he is to be commended. There would, however, in a resentencing exercise, need to be brought into the balance all relevant matters, in particular those to which reference has been made in the discussion above. Certain of those matters contain conflicting or contradictory elements which would potentially bear upon sentence in the event of this Court intervening.
	
	
	I consider that, taking into account all such matters, the aggregate sentence imposed, comprising a non-parole period of two years with a balance of two years, to be an appropriate aggregate sentence. In my opinion, any lesser sentence would not result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness, in particular, of the offence under s 154G of the Crimes Act and the purposes of punishment.
	


The Issue of Allowance for Pre-Sentence Custody


	
	At the commencement of the hearing before this Court, Mr Barrow stated his belief that the sentencing judge may have been incorrectly informed that the applicant had served 3 months and 3 days of pre-sentence custody and the sentence imposed was backdated to that extent: T at p 1. In that respect it was observed during the hearing in this Court, that the proper amount of pre-sentence custody was 3 months and 14 days. The difference was said to have been attributable to a period following arrest, of between 16 and 21 March 2007 which the applicant spent in custody (5 days where bail had been refused) and a period following his release to parole in Queensland (in respect of a sentence for the Queensland offences), on 6 May 2012 following which he was held in custody until 14 August 2012. On this basis Mr Barrow observed that eleven days of pre-sentence custody had not been taken into account.
	
	
	Following the hearing the Court was provided with the following information:
	


The Crown accepts that the applicant was in custody in relation to this matter for a total of 3 months and 16 days, between the following dates, before he was sentenced:

16.03.07 – 22.03.07 (7 days)

6.05.12 – 14.08.12 (3 months, 9 days)

The applicant was sentenced on 21.11.13. His sentence should have been backdated by 3 months and 16 days. However the Sentencing Judge only backdated his sentence by 3 months and 3 days, to commence on 18.08.13.

The correct starting date for the applicant’s sentence is 5.08.13 with the non-parole period expiring on 4.08.15. His additional term should expire on 4.08.17.


	
	On 11 May 2015, the Registrar, at the direction of the Court, wrote to the applicant’s solicitors and to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to the procedure to be followed in order for the Court to be in a position to make any necessary order relating to established error in the backdating of the aggregate sentence. To that end, the Registrar raised with the parties the need for an amendment to the application for leave to appeal as a separate ground of appeal.
	
	
	The Registrar subsequently received Amended Grounds of Appeal which included a second ground in the following terms:
	


“As a consequence of inaccurate information, his Honour erred in failing to take into account all of the pre-sentence custody served by the applicant.”


	
	Consent Orders dated 18 May 2015 signed by the solicitor for the applicant and the solicitor for the respondent were also received by the Registrar. The Consent Orders were in the following terms:
	


“1.   It is agreed that Ground 2 of the Amended Grounds of Appeal should be upheld.

2.   It is agreed that the applicant actually served 3 months and 17 days pre-sentence custody.

3.   Subject to any change to the total sentence being served by the Applicant should Ground 1 of the Applicant’s appeal be upheld, it is accepted for the purposes of re-sentence that the aggregate sentence to be served by the Applicant should commence on 4 August 2013 and not from 18 August 2013.”


	
	Accordingly, the orders I propose are as follows:
	



	
	The applicant be granted leave to amend the Notice of Appeal in accordance with the amended Notice of Appeal dated 18 May 2015 to include Ground 2.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court on 21 November 2013 be amended so that the non-parole period of the sentence is taken to have commenced on 4 August 2013 and is to expire on 3 August 2015. The balance of term of 2 years is to commence on 4 August 2015 and is to expire on 3 August 2017.
	
	
	The appeal be otherwise dismissed.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hall J.

2766735,R v Cullen [2015] NSWSC 636,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused is on trial for the murder of his wife, Victoria Comrie Cullen, at Taren Point on 22 January 2014. To an indictment charging that offence the accused has pleaded not guilty. He has pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The Crown has not accepted that plea in discharge of the single count on the indictment.
	
	
	In the events that have occurred, and as a result of the way that this case has unfolded, it has become clear, and it is also uncontroversial, that the accused's plea of guilty to manslaughter is based upon ultimate conclusions favourable to him upon either or both of the following matters. First, that in killing the deceased he acted in self-defence. Inherent in his plea is that the accused accepts that his response to whatever threat he perceived in the circumstances was not a reasonable response. Secondly, that in killing the deceased he did so whilst acting under provocation.
	
	
	At the close of the Crown case the accused applied for a direction that the question of his guilt on the charge of murder should not be left to the jury but that they should be directed to return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. That application is opposed. It arises and is based upon the following matters.
	
	
	In general terms, the accused contends that the Crown has failed to negative both self-defence and provocation. More particularly, the accused submits that there is no evidence in the Crown case upon the basis of which the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting in self- defence when he killed the deceased, or, that when he did so, he was acting under provocation. It is necessary to consider each of these in turn.
	


Self defence


	
	The evidence reveals that when the accused was apprehended at the scene in effect immediately or shortly following the death of the deceased, he had sustained and was clearly suffering from the effects of what have been described as ""sharp force injuries"" as well as blunt force injuries. The former appear to be stab wounds or penetrative knife injuries located on various parts of his body. At least five of these are located upon the upper left chest of the accused above his left nipple as clearly depicted in exhibits “T” and “XX”. A further similar but not identical wound appears below the accused's left nipple and two other similar wounds also appear on his torso, one on or close to the midline above the navel, and one to the left of that wound on the accused's flank slightly above his belt line.
	
	
	In an interview with the police the accused said that he had sustained one of these wounds at the hands of the deceased, or may have done, and that the others were self-inflicted. His precise words are to be found in the following question and answer sequence forming part of exhibit “S”.
	


“Q16. The wounds you've got in your chest and your stomach, where did they come from?

A. I think one might have been from her and the ones around my heart were from me.""


	
	Other evidence in this trial so far reveals that the accused sustained a punctured left lung presumably, or arguably, as the result of one of the sharp force injuries sustained by him. The evidence does not enable a conclusion to be drawn either that his lung was punctured by a wound inflicted by him or by the deceased.
	
	
	On this application the accused contends that the Crown has failed, relevantly, to negative self-defence because it has led no evidence to establish, or from which the jury might properly conclude, that the deceased did not inflict at least one of his wounds in response to which he was entitled to defend himself. He argues that because there is positive and uncontradicted evidence from him in exhibit “S” that at least one of his wounds was inflicted by the deceased, the Crown must for that reason accept that it was so inflicted and that self-defence cannot therefore be ruled out.
	
	
	In my opinion, there are two fundamental difficulties with that argument. First, it is a matter for the jury, having regard to the whole of the evidence in the Crown case, whether or not they accept that the deceased wounded the accused as he maintains, or that she did anything else at all in response to which he was required to, or perceived that he needed to, defend himself. The evidence does not, in my opinion, permit of only one finding or conclusion in this respect. The jury is perfectly entitled to conclude, despite the accused's evidence to the contrary, that all of his wounds were self-inflicted and that the deceased offered him no threat of any kind from which he needed to defend himself. The jury would be similarly entitled to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's injuries were all self-inflicted and that in the events that occurred the only person needing to act in self-defence was the deceased. The evidence shows that she was left handed and her left hand and arm carried evidence of what at least one expert witness has described as ""defensive wounds"".
	
	
	Secondly, and in a related sense, even if the jury accepted the accused's evidence that the deceased did wound him, howsoever that might be thought to have occurred, it is clearly also open on the evidence for the jury to conclude that the accused was the aggressor and that the deceased was defending herself. In other words, self-defence will have been negatived by the very ferocity with the attack upon the deceased and the unlikely prospect that anything the accused did was in response to a threat posed by her.
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case is therefore such that the jury could form a view either that the deceased wounded the accused as he maintains or that she did not. Neither finding is necessarily coextensive with a conclusion that the Crown has failed to lead evidence sufficient to satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt that self-defence has been negatived.
	
	
	In short, the whole of the circumstances of the case, including the violence that occurred at the scene and the anterior violence that apparently occurred in the garage area where the deceased lived, are such as to be capable of supporting a conclusion that no single piece of that evidence had anything at all to do with the accused's defending himself from anything at any time in any way at all. In that sense, self-defence will arguably have been negatived by the whole of the evidence in the Crown case. The jury would be entitled to conclude that the accused's actions were not in any respect committed in self-defence from an attack, or a threatened attack, by the deceased.
	
	
	This is not a case of there being no case fit to go to the jury. Even taking a view of the evidence most favourable to the accused that the deceased wounded him, it does not necessarily follow that what he agrees he did to the deceased at or around the time when that occurred was actually in response to a threat, or that such a conclusion is the only available conclusion.
	
	
	In short, in my opinion, there is evidence upon, or from which, the jury might properly conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not personally believe that his conduct, or any of it, was necessary for his defence. If the jury formed that view, the Crown will have succeeded in negativing self-defence.
	


Provocation


	
	In a cognate fashion the accused contends that the Crown has not tendered evidence sufficient to permit the jury properly to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting under provocation. Perhaps understandably, the accused places considerable emphasis upon evidence capable of satisfying the jury that he was provoked. That evidence consists in his statement to the police, also forming part of exhibit “S” and is to be found in his answer to question 18 as follows:
	


“We went to Court today regarding a civil matter and she was taunting me with her sex life and I lost control and we had a fight, that's it, and I just didn't want to live no more after that.""


	
	The accused submits that that is evidence of provocation sufficient to establish that his acts in killing the deceased were the result of a loss of self-control on his part that induced him to do what he did and, importantly, that there is no evidence to the contrary. He submits that the Crown has accordingly failed to negative provocation.
	
	
	In my opinion, there are two fundamental difficulties with this argument as well. First, the jury may or may not believe the accused's version that he was taunted as he says he was. Acceptance of his version is not a foregone conclusion, even in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Secondly however, even accepting that the jury believes the accused, and even accepting that his submission about there being no evidence to the contrary is also correct, it fails in my opinion to accommodate the second limb of the provocation equation.
	
	
	A conclusion by the jury that the accused was induced to lose his self-control by words or conduct of the deceased does not foreclose the jury's consideration of whether or not what the deceased did was such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill her or inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. Consideration by the jury of that second limb is not determined by their answer to the first limb.
	
	
	There is in this case an unfortunate abundance of evidence of what happened to the deceased. In non-technical or non-medical terms it is clear that she suffered a significantly violent death and that she sustained several very serious wounds and injuries before that finally occurred. The objective test of whether the words or conduct of the deceased could have induced an ordinary person in the accused's position to have in effect done what he did has to be determined by or against the background of all of that evidence. There is in my opinion more than sufficient evidence upon the basis of which the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the words and conduct of the deceased could not have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused so far to have lost self-control as to have formed any relevant intention.
	
	
	In my opinion, the application should be refused.

2766752,R v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1474,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: Christopher Anderson is being tried by jury for the murder of Allira Green. During the course of the trial, I have given a number of rulings, reserving my reasons so as not to detain the jury. This judgment states my reasons for giving those rulings.
	


Tendency evidence


	
	The Crown case is that the accused and the deceased were in a relationship and that the deceased was some 20 weeks pregnant as at the date of her death. Their relationship was volatile. There had been two previous occasions when the police had been called following verbal altercations. On the night of her death, the deceased was at the home of a friend, Louise Bodeker. A third woman, Allira Holt, had arrived to collect the deceased. The accused arrived after Allira Holt. The deceased and Allira Holt yelled at him to go away. According to the Crown case, the accused pushed his way into the unit and pushed all three girls over. Louise Bodeker says at that point the deceased went to the kitchen, took a large kitchen knife and ran at the accused, holding the knife above her head. Ms Bodeker saw the accused grab the deceased’s hand that was holding the knife. Neither Ms Bodeker nor Ms Holt saw what happened with the knife after that point. The deceased fell to the floor, having suffered a single fatal stab wound which had penetrated her lungs and heart. DNA of the accused was found on the handle of the knife.
	
	
	The trial was originally listed for hearing commencing on 18 May 2015. By notice dated 10 May 2015, the Crown gave notice of its intention to adduce evidence that the accused has a tendency to use serious physical violence towards his female partners. The notice attached a statement taken from a previous girlfriend of the accused. The statement was dated 7 July 2014 but had not previously been served on the accused. Since the date on which the tendency notice was served was a Sunday, it should (for practical purposes) be taken to have been served the following Monday, one week before the trial was due to commence. Owing to the need to address a number of pre-trial issues (including the late service of the tendency notice but also including several matters raised on behalf of the accused), the Crown and the accused joined in seeking an adjournment of the trial until 25 May 2015. The trial in fact commenced that day.
	
	
	The proposed tendency evidence was, in short, evidence of violence and serious assaults committed by the accused against his previous girlfriend. In an unusual and probably irrelevant coincidence, she also was pregnant at the relevant time. The evidence was governed by the tendency rule contained in s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), which provides:
	


97 The tendency rule

Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:

the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.


	
	The notice was served under cover of a letter foreshadowing an application under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act. That section confers power to make a direction that the tendency rule not apply to the evidence, despite the failure to give notice under s 97. The Crown’s letter proceeded on the misapprehension that there is a specific requirement to give 21 days’ notice of an intention to adduce tendency evidence. That is not the case. The content of the requirement is to give “reasonable notice”. Section 100(1) thus confers express power to direct that the tendency rule is not to apply despite a party’s failure to give reasonable notice. The breadth of such a power is to be understood in the context that it applies to civil proceedings as well as criminal proceedings.
	
	
	It should be noted that on a literal reading of s 100(1), the section appears to confer power to direct that the tendency rule is not to apply at all to particular evidence. The tendency rule has two limbs. In order to be admissible, tendency evidence must satisfy the “reasonable notice” requirement in s 97(1)(a) and the “significant probative value” requirement in s 97(1)(b). Section 100(1) is directed, in terms, at the tendency rule as a whole. It confers power to “direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 97”. The section thus purports to confer power to admit the evidence regardless of the requirement that it have significant probative value. However, I would regard that to be an unintended infelicity in the drafting of the statute. A direction under s 100(1) should, in my view, be made only to cure a failure to give notice and not to cure a failure of the evidence to meet the requirement of s 97(1)(b). That is consistent with the way in which the rule has been understood by the Court of Criminal Appeal: see R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [35] per Howie J; Santow JA and Bell J agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively.
	
	
	In criminal proceedings, apart from the tendency rule, there is an additional requirement which is that the Crown cannot use tendency evidence against a defendant “unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”: s 101 of the Act. However, the Court held in Harker that, although it might appear to be a “highly legalistic” exercise, the trial judge should not determine an application for a direction under s 100(1) by going directly to the issue whether the evidence would be inadmissible under that stricter requirement: at [36].
	
	
	The evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence in the present case is contained in paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the statement of the former girlfriend, as follows:
	


A few months after Chris and I had been in a relationship, Chris became verbally and physically abusive towards me. I remember the first occasion, Chris asked me to pick him up from Yarra Bay Sailing Club. When I arrived at Yarra Bay Sailing Club, Chris called me and told me he was at the Tattersalls Club in the city. I remember driving back into the city to pick Chris up. When I picked Chris up, he was verbally abusive towards me. I remember him spitting at me and going mental in the car. I was driving back through Redfern when Chris grabbed the steering wheel and tried to swerve the car into a building. This was the first occasion that I saw the violent side of Chris. On this occasion Chris jammed my hand in a door and pushed me again [sic] the kitchen bench and cupboard that was in our house at the time. I lost the baby at that stage due to him pushing me onto a sharp cupboard. The bay [sic] had been fine on the Monday as I had just had tests and the heart beat was missing after the incident. I was approx. 3-4 months pregnant at that stage, it was my 3rd scan and I had told all my friends and family. Also my hand was swollen (picture attached) and my back bruised all the way down. He punched holes in our bedroom cupboards again which had to be replaced a second time.

From this point on, Chris was aggressive and violent at least once every two (2) weeks. The first time Chris physically assaulted me was sometime around June 2010. I can’t recall what the argument was over but I recall Chris punched holes in the walls of our cupboards and doors having to be replaced by myself. Chris pushed me over and fell backwards over the lounge and onto the floor. Initially Chris was apologetic until about five minutes later when he pushed me over again and I felt [sic] backwards onto the ground. I did not report this incident to the police as Chris apologised and told me that he would never do it again.

On one occasion a month after the baby was killed Chris assaulted me to the point where I was unconscious and was taken to hospital where my brain swelled and my face was disfigured. I remember we were at home at the time, I was sitting at the dinner table and he became verbally abusive. Within minutes, Chris grabbed me by the pony tail and pulled me [sic] head down slamming it against the floor before continuing to assault me. As a result of this incident I was hospitalised overnight and then checkups on my brain and eye each few months for progress as my eye was damaged and unable to work for about three (3) months. I still have terrible headaches and loss of memory due to that incident and I am unable to maintain a [sic] intimate relationship due to the terror he has inflicted on me I get very nervous and cannot maintain the relationship due to fear.

On a separate occasion after I had kicked Chris out of my home as he had never paid rent, before he left he stole my credit card and took all my savings from my account and spent the money on drugs and drink. He then returned to my place of residence where he kicked my door in and yet against assaulted me. I called my father for help and he came and got me. All this time Chris was suppose [sic] to go to the rehab I would drop him off and he would, since I have now learnt, as soon as I drive off, leave and not attend.


	
	The Crown indicated that she did not propose to lead evidence as to the loss of the pregnancy, nor the fact that one of the assaults described by the witness resulted in a criminal charge.
	
	
	It was indicated on behalf of the accused that the principal issues in the trial would be whether the fatal stab wound was inflicted by a deliberate act of the accused (rather than accident) and whether the Crown can establish that any deliberate of stabbing the deceased was not done in self-defence.
	
	
	Taking the approach specified in Harker, I first considered whether I should make a direction under s 100(1) that the tendency rule not apply despite the failure to give notice under s 97. A direction under s 100(1) is one to which s 192 of the Evidence Act applies. That section provides:
	
	
	If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.
	
	
	Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:
	
	
	the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and
	
	
	the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and
	
	
	the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and
	
	
	the nature of the proceeding, and
	
	
	the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.
	
	
	In Harker, Howie J said that the two most important considerations in that case were the probative value of the evidence and any prejudice caused to the accused by the failure to give reasonable notice. In considering those issues in the present case, I had regard to the overriding duty of a trial judge to ensure that a person accused of a serious criminal offence has a fair trial. Without determining the issue raised by s 97(1)(b), I proceeded on the basis that the evidence would have some probative value.
	
	
	As already noted, the Crown was initially under the misapprehension that the requirement was to give 21 days’ notice. A shorter period could have been regarded as reasonable but the Crown acknowledged that the notice given on 10 May 2015 was not reasonable notice in the case of a trial then due to commence on 18 May 2015. However, the Crown submitted that the deferral of the trial by one week had adequately addressed any prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	I was not satisfied that it had. The postponement of the trial by one week was due to a combination of the late service of the tendency notice and other issues raised at the 11th hour on behalf of the accused. That meant that the accused had two weeks (rather than only one) to react to the notice. However, even leaving aside the need to prepare to deal with the tendency evidence at trial, there was a great deal for the accused’s legal team to be doing during that time. The matters to which the accused’s solicitor was attending included chasing up production of police notebooks and other documents that came into existence during the investigation through the issue of a number of subpoenas; negotiating with police (separately represented) in respect of the production of that material; investigating with a psychiatrist the possibility of a defence of substantial mental impairment; obtaining an expert report from a forensic pathologist and investigating the mental state of one of the two key eyewitnesses who had, until recently before the trial, been said to be “unavailable” but had become available and had provided a further statement.
	
	
	Some of those matters (particularly the position of the eyewitness) were not due to any delay on the part of the accused. Others were matters which could have been addressed more promptly by the accused but the simple fact is that, as events transpired, they were all tasks which had to be completed within the short time frame before the commencement of the trial so as to ensure a fair trial for the accused. The accused was (and remains) in custody, with all the practical impediments posed by that circumstance for the orderly taking of instructions.
	
	
	In those circumstances, even leaving aside my assessment as to the probative value of the evidence, I did not think it would be appropriate to relieve the Crown of the requirement to give reasonable notice of the tendency evidence. The admission of the evidence would have required the accused to answer for a range of incidents alleged to have occurred over a period of some months at least a year earlier. The investigation of those allegations and the process of taking instructions from the accused about them would have been a significant distraction to the accused and his legal team in the short period leading up to the trial, after the tendency notice was served. The inevitable prejudice was compounded by the fact that the accused’s legal team had never previously seen the statement of the tendency witness.
	
	
	In considering an application under s 100(1), the Court should give consideration to whether there is any way in which the evidence can be accommodated notwithstanding a lack of reasonable notice. The Crown did not submit that the trial date should be vacated to accommodate the evidence. I would not have acceded to any such application. The accused has been in custody since his arrest on 3 August 2013. Had the trial been postponed, he would have, in all likelihood, been in custody for a period approaching two years by the time of any further trial date.
	
	
	The Crown did submit that the evidence could be called later in the Crown case so as to give the accused’s legal team more time to prepare for it. In the circumstances of a criminal trial, I did not think it would be reasonable to regard the days of the trial as preparation time to accommodate a want of reasonable notice. For those reasons, I determined that the direction sought under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act should not be made.
	
	
	Even if reasonable notice had been given of the Crown’s intention to adduce the evidence or if the difficulty could have been accommodated in some other way, I would not have admitted the evidence. The critical question is whether the relevant tendency is “a link in the process of proving that the person did in fact behave in the particular way on the occasion in question”: Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; 106 FCR 51 at [61] per Sackville J; Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreeing. The factual issue in the present case is whether, when the deceased went at the accused holding a knife above her shoulder, the accused grabbed the knife and, in a deliberate act, stabbed her with the intention of killing her or causing grievous bodily harm. It may be accepted that the proposed tendency evidence, if accepted, would establish a tendency on the part of the accused to use serious physical violence towards a particular previous female partner. Whether that would establish a tendency to use serious physical violence towards “his female partners” would require an assessment and comparison of the circumstances of the accused during each relationship and the circumstances of each relationship. It appeared likely that would ultimately invite comparison of the former girlfriend’s references to the accused’s failure to attend drug rehabilitation during that time with the evidence in the present trial as to any drug use by the accused.
	
	
	The events described by the former girlfriend are very different from the events described by the two eyewitnesses on the evening Allira Green died. The evidence would not have been admissible unless its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had on the accused: s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. Whilst I accept that the evidence would have had some probative value in assessing the likely conduct of the accused, I was not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence outlined in the Crown’s tendency notice substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.
	
	
	The content of the statement served in support of the tendency notice reveals an understandable degree of bitterness and acrimony on the part of the former girlfriend towards the accused. As already noted, it included the unusual and probably irrelevant coincidence that each woman was pregnant at the relevant time; a factor which could have incited strong feeling in some members of the jury. Although the Crown indicated that she would not lead all of the evidence set out in the tendency statement, I nonetheless concluded that the evidence was likely to portray the accused in a very negative light at an earlier period and so distract the jury from focused attention on the real issues in this trial; that is, the accused’s deliberation and state of mind in the very short period of time between when the deceased came at him holding a knife and when she suffered the fatal stab wound. Accordingly, even if reasonably notice had been given, I would have excluded the evidence on the grounds that it did not satisfy the test in s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	


Evidence of Nardia Simms-Green


	
	Nardia Simms-Green is the mother of the deceased. Mr Waterstreet objected to paragraphs 33 and 35 of her statement, as follows:
	


On the 26th June 2013, on my daughter Allira’s birthday, we had arranged to have dinner with all the family. Chris was not invited to this dinner as Allira had separated from him a few days prior. We all attended the Chinese restaurant in Matraville for dinner. After dinner Ty left with his girlfriend to go home. I took my mother and Aunt home. I then dropped my son Lochlan and Allira to the Hoyts cinema at Eastgardens as Allira and her brother wanted to see a movie. I then went home after dropping them off. I gave them some money to get a taxi home as I would not be able to pick them up as I needed to take my medication once I was home for my kidney.

…

It was Chris. Allira had just opened her door of the car and Chris, with a look on his face that I can’t even explain asked how our evening went, he then laughed. Allira exited the car and straight away went off at Chris telling him to leave her alone and to go away. Crhis then became abusive towards us all saying things like, see, see how she goes on. I then got out of the car and went off at him also to leave my daigher alone and that she doesn’t need him in her life. Chris became this person who became more and more aggressive to the point he was rambling on and on. He started to froth at the mouth and his face was distorted. I became scared for Allira, Lochlan and myself. I told him to leave as I was ringing the Police. He moved about 120 metres up the road but still continued to yell abuse even while I was on the phone to 000. I was screaming over the phone for the police to please hurry up as he was out of control and I didn’t know what he would do next. He had no fear of the Police and said to me, “Ring your mates in blue, they have to catch me first”


	
	The Crown indicated that she did not wish to adduce all of the detail of that night but did wish to adduce evidence of the conflict and the description of the behaviour of the accused which prompted Ms Simms Green to call police.
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet’s objection raised two issues: first, he stated that the accused was in possession of a COPS computer entry which did not record any of the description now given by the mother and which stated “the victim did not disclose any offence and did not express fears for her safety”. On that basis, he submitted that the mother’s evidence was out of context and therefore prejudicial. I did not think the fact that there was additional evidence that could be lead from police in respect of the incident informed the admissibility of the mother’s evidence as to that incident.
	
	
	Separately, Mr Waterstreet objected that it would be unfair to admit the evidence since the incident the occurred some time before the stabbing (about five weeks). Mr Waterstreet accepted that “proper background relationship evidence” of the volatile relationship between the accused and the deceased would be admissible.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Waterstreet objected to the description of the accused “frothing” at the mouth. He submitted that the description portrayed mental illness or intoxication and was more prejudicial than probative.
	
	
	The description of the accused “frothing” at the mouth was no more than the mother’s description of what she saw. I determined to allow the Crown to adduce evidence as to what the mother saw and heard on that occasion. I do not think the description was prejudicial in the proper understanding of that term. On the premise (accepted by Mr Waterstreet) that evidence of the volatility of the relationship is relevant to the assessment of the events of 3 August 2013, I was satisfied that the evidence was relevant and admissible. I was not persuaded that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	


Evidence of Aaron Timbery


	
	The Crown tried to lead evidence from Aaron Timbery. Mr Timbery made a statement to police on 11 August 2013 which included an account of a conversation he had with the accused shortly after Allira Green was stabbed and observations he made of the accused’s clothing. Of particular importance to the Crown was the information he provided to police as to the conversation, as follows:
	


I stood up and Nudgie [the accused] came up to me. Nudgie said “I got set up. I went to see Allira and Allira came running around the corner with a knife. I grabbed her arm and twisted it and I don't know if the knife stabbed her but it could've.”

I said, “What are you talking about? I thought you were coming just to meet me.” Nudgie said, ""I had a fight with a bloke before that and I rang Allira and met her and that happened.”

I could see Nudgie was off his head on something. It looked like he was on drugs or something. Nudgie looked kind of drunk or something. Nudgie was acting different to usual. It looked like his adrenalin was pumping because he was very alert and aggressive. I said. “Are you drunk or something?” Nudgie said, “No I don't drink. I've had some Xanax and some ice.”


	
	When Mr Timbery was called in the trial (T100), he claimed to have no recollection of seeing the accused on 2 or 3 August 2013. He also claimed to have no recollection of making a statement to police on 11 August 2013. He said he had no independent recollection as to what happened on 3 August 2013, the day on which he heard about the death of Allira Green. His explanation was that he was heavily affected by drugs at that time.
	
	
	In the absence of the jury, I granted leave under s 32 of the Evidence Act for the witness to revive his memory in court by reference to his statement. The witness read the whole of the statement (T108.9). He said that, when he made the statement, he was telling the truth. However, he said that reading the statement had not refreshed his memory of the events to which it referred (T109.10).
	
	
	Before that point was reached, Mr Waterstreet had foreshadowed an objection to the alleged admission by the accused to taking Xanax and ice on the night of the stabbing. He submitted that admission of that evidence would be unfair, relying on s 90 of the Evidence Act. In the absence of the jury, I allowed Mr Waterstreet to cross-examine Mr Timbery on the voir dire on that issue. The effect of the evidence on the voir dire was that Mr Timbery was taking a great deal of ice during that period of his life and that he presently had no independent recollection whatsoever of that period. He was asked whether he felt he was compelled to go to the police station to make his statement. He said that he did not; his aunt had asked him to go to the police.
	
	
	During the cross-examination, I indicated that I had reached the point of wanting to hear from the Crown as to the admissibility of the alleged admission under s 90 (T114.18). The Crown then called (on the voir dire) the police officer who took the statement from Mr Timbery, Senior Constable Lucinda Vasey. She said that Mr Timbery attended Maroubra Police Station and told her that he wanted to give a statement about the murder of Allira Green; that he told her clearly what had happened so far as he knew; that he was awake the whole time and understandable and that his voice was clear; and that he was confident (T118).
	
	
	Upon reflection, I determined that there was nothing in the content of Mr Timbery’s statement (and nothing in the evidence of Senior Constable Vasey) to support the contention that the admission made by the accused to Mr Timbery was unfairly obtained so as to render the admission inadmissible under s 90. That section is concerned with the fairness to the accused of using evidence of an admission having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made. Nothing in the evidence on the voir dire suggested any unfairness on that account. The admission was, in effect, volunteered by the accused. The real issue raised by Mr Timbery’s evidence in the trial and on the voir dire was Mr Timbery’s reliability as a witness. That was an issue which would not need to be addressed unless and until he came up to proof as to the content of his statement.
	
	
	The following morning, I reminded Mr Waterstreet that I had stopped his cross-examination on the question of unfairness and s 90. No application was made at that point to cross-examine the witness further on that issue. I determined that the evidence was not inadmissible under s 90.
	
	
	However, at that point it appeared likely that if the Crown were allowed under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the witness, he would maintain that, as at the time of giving evidence in the trial, he had no recollection of the events of 3 August 2013 or of giving his statement to police on 11 August 2013. In that circumstance, I considered it would be prudent to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness in the absence of the jury so as to ascertain what he would say. I had in mind that if the witness gave no evidence confirming the events described in the statement, his previous representations to police would not be admissible as to the truth of their contents and accordingly that the jury should not hear the evidence at all. The out of court statement made by Mr Timbery to police could only be admissible as to the truth of its contents under s 66 of the Evidence Act but fell within the exclusion under s 66(3) and so was not admissible under that section.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by the Crown, Mr Timbery accepted that he had said the words recorded in the critical parts of his statement to police and said what he told police was the truth (T177 to 180). Under cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet, Mr Timbery was asked whether he now has any memory of what is contained in each paragraph. He said “no I didn’t remember until I read this” (T182).
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet asked “so when you told the Crown today that you intended to tell the truth in relation to what is contained in the document do you have any idea today whether it is the truth?”. Mr Timbery responded “no I don’t” (T183.14). Pressed as to whether, on the day on which he gave his statement, he recalled the events set out in the statement he said, “yes, well I wouldn’t have just said that”. He confirmed that what was recorded in paragraph 16 was from his memory on the day on which his statement was made (T184.40).
	
	
	Having heard the cross-examination on the voir dire, I did not accept Mr Timbery’s claim that he could not recall the events in question. I was satisfied he was not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence about those matters. On that basis, I granted leave to the Crown under s 38(1)(b) of the Evidence Act to question the witness in the trial as though she were cross-examining him.
	
	
	Mr Timbery repeated in the presence of the jury that he had said to police the things recorded in his statement and that he was telling the truth when he told the police those matters. As to the conversation recorded in paragraph 17 (the admission as to the use of Xanax and ice), however, he added “I don’t remember now but” (T191.33). In cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet in the trial, Mr Timbery repeated that he was taking ice at the time of the events dealt with in his statement to police and also at the time he made that statement. He said that he was taking quite a deal of ice at that time and that it had affected his memory.
	
	
	Since Mr Timbery accepted that the statements put to him in questions by the Crown were true, the net result was that there was oral evidence in the trial of those matters. However, I formed the view that (subject to any submission to the contrary on behalf of the accused) it would be appropriate to warn the jury as to the potential unreliability of that evidence having regard to the witness’s further evidence that he does not presently have any recollection of the events addressed in his statement owing to his use of drugs.

2766765,Bruce Donald Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J for the reasons which his Honour has set out in par [18] thereof. As indicated by R A Hulme J, the resolution of this matter depended very much upon its unusual facts.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	The applicant, a 47 year old aboriginal man, was arrested and charged in January 2014 with two counts alleging that, between 31 December 2003 and 25 December 2004 at Tilpa in the State of New South Wales, he had sexual intercourse with a young girl who was six or seven years of age at the time, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. When the matter came on for trial on 13 October 2014 the applicant applied for the trial to proceed by judge alone pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Crown opposed the application, which was refused. The applicant appeals from this decision under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	


The Criminal Procedure Act 1986


	
	So far as is relevant this provides –
	


132 Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2) …

(3) …

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6) …

(7) …

Background


	
	The Crown case against the applicant included the following matters –
	



	
	The complainant and her family moved to Tilpa in January 2004 and returned to Brisbane shortly before Christmas 2004.
	
	
	Sometime during 2004 the complainant and her father attended a birthday party for one of the locals during the evening. The complainant could not remember specific dates or the location of the party. (The defence points to other matters recalled by the complainant, her mother and father which, it is submitted, suggest the party could have taken place during November 2004.)
	
	
	The complainant says the applicant drove a white or grey “truck” or “ute”.
	
	
	The alleged sexual assaults occurred while the complainant was playing a game of “spotlight” with the applicant, which involved hiding in the dark in scrubland behind the shed on a property where the complainant (possibly) resided.
	
	
	The complainant first mentioned the assaults to her mother in May 2012 when they resided in Queensland.
	
	
	The complainant’s evidence about the presence of the applicant at the party and the assaults allegedly committed is not otherwise supported.
	



	
	It is proposed that the applicant will give evidence. Amongst other things, he says that he attended only one evening party in Tilpa during 2004, which was to farewell the mother of one of his then employers at the Tilpa Hall, opposite the hotel. He remembers this well, amongst other reasons, because on one occasion he left the hotel and returned with a rifle, which he waived about before being persuaded to leave. The date can be fixed because he was arrested and charged the following day, 28 November. Although his vehicle was unregistered, it was identified by witnesses (who took the rifle from him) as a white Ford Falcon utility. He remained in custody into January 2005. Independent evidence of these facts is available and is intended to be adduced. (Although nothing was sought to be made of this, the Notice of Prosecution Case states that the applicant left Tilpa “sometime in mid to late 2004”.)
	
	
	The applicant says that he did not see the complainant on 27 November 2004 and could not have been the offender if the alleged offences occurred on or after 28 November 2004 because he was then incarcerated. The Crown submitted, in effect, that it was unnecessary for the applicant to disclose the prejudicial matter, since it would consent to an agreed fact to be placed before the jury to the effect that the applicant was not in the area after 28 November 2004 and, so far as the previous day was concerned would not dispute the applicant’s account of his movements around the Tilpa Hotel or, as I understand it, that he was then driving the Ford vehicle described above.
	


The trial judge’s decision


	
	The learned trial judge referred to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 at [96] where his Honour said, in effect, that there was no presumption in favour of trial by jury rather than by judge alone, whilst the accused bore an evidentiary onus to show that it is in the interests of justice for the trial to proceed by judge alone, the legislation giving “no particular weight” to the fact that, absent an application, the trial would be heard by a jury. The question was how the interests of justice are best served. His Honour then briefly described the circumstances giving rise to the application and observed, having presided in the District Court at Dubbo on a permanent basis since November 2011, it seemed to him –
	


That the local jurors attended their duties diligently and I have yet to see anything to suggest other than that they have followed explicitly and implicitly directions that are given to them.


	
	His Honour then referred to s 132(5) and commented –
	


It is clear by the very words of that section that the Parliament was not limiting the issues to reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. It seems to me that whether or not a complainant in a sexual assault trial is accepted beyond reasonable doubt is a quintessential jury issue. Further, the Crown submits that any issue so far as the accused’s whereabouts after 28 November 2004 [is concerned] can be dealt with by way of an agreed fact … [although the defence] argues in response that that is simply the accused having to fight the case with one hand tied behind his back, in effect, in that he is not able to fully indicate to the jury where he was at the time.


	
	His Honour then returned to his earlier theme that he had “yet to see anything to suggest juries here do not follow any instructions … [and] would be told and directed in the clearest terms not to speculate”. Further, his Honour considered that the accepted fact that the applicant was not in the area and could not have committed the offence after 28 November, “would have been the end of that” and added that it was “simply not necessary for the accused to recount the criminal activities leading to his arrest in respect of matters on 27 November.”
	


Submissions


	
	Mr O’Neil, counsel for the applicant, pointed to the fact that neither the “application of objective community standards” nor the applicant’s intention are relevant in this case. He submitted that, by characterising the question whether a complainant in a sexual assault should be accepted beyond reasonable doubt as “a quintessential jury issue”, his Honour was in effect acting on the basis that a jury was a more appropriate decider of such a crucial fact than a judge. The problem of prejudice was not sufficiently overcome by adopting the suggestion of the Crown that the applicant’s evidence be censored. He contended that the applicant’s absence from 28 November was inextricably interwoven with the events of the previous day, which were crucial to the persuasiveness of the applicant’s evidence that he could actually recall the events of that day and the jury should accept the truth and reliability of his evidence that he had not seen the complainant at the party. The forensic desirability of this line of evidence was very much a matter for the applicant and his advisers and the applicant should not have to place on the scales the possible prejudice which might adversely affect the jury’s consideration of his defence. Moreover, the events occurred many years before and the jury might well be sceptical about any account given by the applicant of his activities at what was said to be the only party attended in the year were it not for the corroborative detail which marked that and the subsequent day as memorable.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that a jury was better able than a single judge to assess the relative credibility of the complainant and the applicant. At all events, since the application depended upon establishing that the applicant would be prejudiced by disclosure of the truth, it was open to his Honour to find that means were available to avoid the prejudice to which the applicant pointed.
	


Consideration 


	
	In R v Simmons; R v Moore (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 259 Hamill J (if I may say so with respect) comprehensively summarised the cases dealing with the application of s 132 of the Act, starting with the principle (to which reference has already been made) in Belghar that, although there was an evidentiary onus on the applicant, there was no presumption in favour of a jury trial and no legal onus on the accused who seeks an order for trial by judge-alone: the question is what is in the interests of justice. The next material point is that, although the accused has no right to trial by judge alone, his or her election for such a trial is to be taken into account as a matter to be weighed in determining where the interests of justice lie: Simmons at [60].
	
	
	The supposition that a jury is a better arbiter of relative credibility than a judge is reflective of assumptions rather than experience and lacks sufficient substance to be placed in the scales. As Hamill J noted, there are a number of judicial statements commending the ability of juries to assess credibility and reliability of witnesses but “…it is difficult to discern a clear consensus in the Australian authorities in support of a proposition that where credibility issues are essential to a trial, that is a factor that militates strongly in favour of a jury trial” (Ibid at 75). His Honour concluded –
	


[82] …[For] the most part, the fact that a trial involves issues of credibility is a neutral matter when it comes to determining whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for trial by judge alone … [Each] mode of trial has its advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. While a jury has the advantage of being able to discuss the issues and the requirement for unanimity provides strength to its decision, a judge has the training and experience of making difficult decisions on question[s] of credibility, putting aside matters of emotion, on an almost daily basis.


	
	(I would add the additional consideration that, here, the effect of delay on the ability of the applicant to defend himself is a complicating feature.)
	
	
	The significance of prejudice must necessarily vary from case to case, depending on the nature of the allegations, the nature of the defence and, of course, the character of the potential prejudice. Although I would not wish to suggest that this is a rule of universal application, there is to my mind an important distinction between prejudicial material proposed to be relied on by the Crown on the one hand and prejudicial material proposed to be introduced by an accused. It is an important principle of justice that an accused person be able to defend himself or herself by all forensically available means and should not, without good reason, be forced to make a choice between the risk that a jury will be unfairly prejudiced against him or her on the one hand and censoring his defence on the other. Of course, if one could be comfortably satisfied that the jury would follow directions to evaluate the evidence without allowing it to prejudice their view of the applicant this issue might be less significant. I would respectfully agree with the observation of Hamill J that “…many trials have been conducted in circumstances involving significant prejudice and juries have been capable of discernment and discretion in putting aside their emotional responses and prejudices” (Simmons at [53]). Furthermore, it is to be assumed that a jury will generally act on the instructions that it is given: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 425 (McHugh J). Nevertheless, the law itself acknowledges there are cases where, for example, evidence must be excluded because of its propensity to give rise to unfair prejudice (see s 135(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)); Hamill J cited other examples (Simmons at [88]).
	


Conclusion


	
	On a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons, it seems to me (with respect) that, as distinct from merely emphasising the jury’s suitability for judging credibility in a word against word case, his Honour acted on the basis that a jury is a superior tribunal of fact for this purpose. This was a significant error: the interests of justice are not determined by suppositions about the relative abilities of judge or jury to determine facts, though in some cases – such as those enumerated in s132(5) – a jury may be the more appropriate tribunal, other things being equal.
	
	
	Evidence that the applicant could not have been at a birthday party on or, for that matter, after 27 November is obviously relevant and could not be excluded. Nor can the applicant be prevented from being entirely candid about the matter, not because the fact might be disputed, but because his credibility will be judged against that of the complainant and a suspicion in the jury’s mind about a lack of candour could be unjustly engendered were he to appear to be concealing matters from them; the jury will assess his truthfulness on their overall view about him as a witness. For obvious reasons, the proposal of the Crown did not ameliorate this problem. A direction that the jury must not speculate about the circumstances does not answer this problem, even supposing it were effective to prevent the implication that something adverse to the applicant was being kept from them. The question then arises whether directions by the trial judge not to use the evidence of wrongdoing adversely to the applicant would suffice. Likely it would, but a real risk would remain that it would not. These cases are emotionally fraught and the offences naturally instigate powerful feelings of disgust. The applicant cannot rely on evidence of good character. In short, the applicant must make a choice between full disclosure on the one hand and the real risk of adverse prejudice on the other.
	
	
	In my respectful view, the trial judge erred in concluding, in effect, that the applicant’s fair trial would not be compromised by requiring him to agree to limit the evidence as proposed by the Crown or otherwise take the risk of being adversely prejudiced by giving a candid account. The risk of unfair prejudice would be entirely removed were the applicant to be tried by judge alone. Accordingly, it is in the interests of justice that the trial proceed in that way.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders –
	


(i)   leave to appeal be granted;

(ii)   the decision below be quashed; and

(iii)   the trial proceed by judge alone.


	
	R A HULME J: This case turns on its own facts and may be resolved simply for the reason given by Adams J in the paragraph of his judgment immediately preceding his proposed orders. I agree that those orders should be made.
	
	
	There is an observation I wish to add concerning the fact that the application came before his Honour Judge Lerve on the very day the matter was fixed for trial (although he had been alerted to it the previous business day). The applicant required leave, his application not having been made ""not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial"": s 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act. An explanation for the lateness of the application was provided in the affidavit of the applicant's solicitor which was read in the District Court.
	
	
	The late notice to the trial judge was regrettable (at least) and meant that he was required to determine the application expeditiously, given that he had a jury panel in waiting. His Honour's reasons clearly demonstrate that he had a thorough appreciation of the legal principles to be applied but he was denied the opportunity that this Court has had for more timely consideration of their application. Another aspect of this is that I would hesitate before engaging in precise analysis of terminology used by his Honour in his ex tempore judgment (particularly as to his use of the term ""quintessential jury issue"").

		28 May 2015",2015-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766770,Donaghey v R [2015] NSWCCA 119,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: Andrew Michael Donaghey (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty to a charge that on 14 August 2013 he supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the DMT Act”). The maximum penalty for that offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units. No standard non-parole period is prescribed.
	
	
	On sentence the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account two additional matters contained in a Form 1, namely:
	



	
	dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime; and
	
	
	supplying a prohibited drug, namely 4.46 grams of heroin.
	



	
	Each of the matters in the Form 1 arose at the time of the offending in [3] above.
	
	
	On 29 September 2014 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 4 months commencing on 28 January 2014 and expiring on 27 May 2016. A non-parole period of 21 months, expiring on 27 October 2015, was imposed.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks to leave to appeal on the grounds more fully set out below.
	


THE FACTS


	
	At about 11:00pm on 14 August 2013 police were patrolling the Newcastle suburb of Belmont. In the course of doing so they observed a Mitsubishi Magna vehicle stopped on the side of the road, with another vehicle stopped immediately behind it. The passenger side door of the Magna was open and police observed two persons, Justin Bestwick and Linden Scott, standing near the door. The applicant was seated in the driver’s seat.
	
	
	Police approached and spoke to the three persons present. All appeared to be nervous. The applicant and Bestwick appeared to be under the influence of prohibited drugs. Specifically, both had bloodshot eyes, were unsteady on their feet and had the appearance of being tired. Bestwick told the police that he had stopped to ask the applicant if he could use his mobile telephone charger.
	
	
	Police conducted checks in relation to all three persons which revealed that the applicant had a history of involvement in drug supply. Bestwick and Scott were known for drug use and possession.
	
	
	Police then searched the vehicle and located a small amount of white crystal substance under the front passenger seat, along with a quantity of resealable bags, two sets of digital scales and two mobile telephones.
	
	
	The applicant was searched by police. A large resealable bag containing a white crystal substance, and two smaller resealable bags which also contained a similar crystal substance, were found in his underpants. The substance in one of the bags was found to be 13.46 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79 percent. Another of the resealable bags contained 4.46 grams of heroin with a purity of 26 percent. Police also found the sum of $1,096.55 in cash in the applicant’s pocket, and a further $269.00 in cash in his wallet. The applicant was arrested and taken to the police station where he declined to be interviewed.
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – Her Honour erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis the maximum penalty for the subject offence was 20 years imprisonment.

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge stated the following (at ROS 1):
	


“The offender stands to be sentenced for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s. 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

The maximum penalty specified for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and a fine currently set at $222,000.00. There is no standard non-parole period. A further supply offence and an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime are before the court on a Form 1 document to be taken into account when sentence is imposed for the principle offence” (emphasis added).

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant correctly submitted that the maximum penalty for the offence was 15 years imprisonment, not 20 years. It was submitted that in stating the maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment, the sentencing judge had erred.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown accepted that the sentencing judge had incorrectly stated the maximum penalty but did not concede that this amounted to error. The Crown submitted that this Court would be satisfied that the sentencing judge “merely misspoke the number 20 rather than 15” and that she did not sentence the applicant on the basis that the penalty was in fact 20 years. The Crown relied on three particular factors in support of those submissions.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown relied upon the fact that the Crown sentence summary which formed part of exhibit A on sentence correctly identified the maximum penalty as 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Secondly, it was pointed out that although the sentence summary correctly identified the maximum fine as 2000 penalty units, the applicable monetary amount had been erroneously stated as $22,000.00. It was pointed out that notwithstanding that error, the sentencing judge had correctly identified the maximum fine. It was submitted that this indicated that despite what the sentencing judge had said, she was obviously aware of the correct maximum penalty.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had correctly observed that an offence contrary to s. 25(1) of the DMT Act is concerned with amounts of prohibited drugs which are less than 250 grams. This, it was submitted, was a further indication that the sentencing judge was aware of the correct maximum penalty.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, the position taken by the Crown invites impermissible speculation. The simple fact is that the maximum penalty stated by the sentencing judge was incorrect. Further, it is significant that the sentence proceedings concluded on a Friday, at which time the sentencing judge reserved her decision until the following Monday. The terms of the judgment reflect careful preparation, a circumstance which tends completely against the position taken by the Crown.
	
	
	In my view, the error was a material one. It had the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 per Latham J at [83].
	
	
	It follows that ground 1 is made out. In these circumstances, the provisions of s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are enlivened and it is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account the purposes of sentencing and any statutory factors that are required or permitted: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947 at [42]-[43] per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ. I have considered these matters further below.
	


Ground 2 – In rejecting a basis for a finding of special circumstances, her Honour erred in failing to take into account that the further sentence of imprisonment was imposed cumulatively on a sentence already being served by the applicant

The relevant history


	
	On 5 November 2009 the applicant was convicted of supplying a prohibited drug and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment which was fully suspended upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour. He breached that bond and was called up for that breach. On 1 March 2012 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years commencing 1 March 2012 and expiring on 28 February 2014. A non-parole period of 12 months was imposed.
	
	
	The applicant was subsequently released to parole, and was on parole at the time of the present offending on 14 August 2013. His parole was revoked on 29 August 2013 solely as a result of such offending. The applicant then served the balance of that parole, a period of 6 months and 14 days, with the sentence expiring on 28 February 2014.
	
	
	As previously outlined, the sentencing judge backdated the sentence for the present offending to commence on 28 January 2014.
	


The sentence proceedings


	
	The applicant’s solicitor submitted to the sentencing judge (commencing at T6 L25) that the sentence for the present offending should be backdated to commence prior to 28 February 2014. Specifically, it was submitted (commencing at T7 L3) that the sentence should be backdated to 14 August 2013, being the date of the present offending. A further submission was made that special circumstances should be found.
	
	
	The Crown submitted (commencing at T8 L15) that the applicant must have known that if he was involved in any offending again he would be expected to serve the balance of his parole. The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the evidence which otherwise justified a finding of special circumstances.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	Against the background outlined above her Honour said (commencing at ROS [44]):
	


“[44] There is a question of when the sentence to be imposed upon the offender should commence. The offender was apprehended on 14 August 2013, and his parole for the earlier supply offence (itself imposed on call-up) was revoked on 29 August 2013, dating from the date of his arrest. It is reasonable to conclude that parole was revoked because of the commission of the present offence.

[45] The offender submits that the court should back-date his sentence at least to some extent so that this sentence and the balance of parole of 6 months and 14 days run concurrently.

[46] There will be some concurrence, but only to a very modest extent. Those who breach conditional liberty by the commission of further serious crime must expect to pay the price for the disregard of the court’s order to them to be of good behaviour. I do not think concurrence of sentence to any extent is indicated by anything other than the principle of totality.”


	
	Her Honour then proceeded (at ROS [49]) to impose the sentence previously outlined. No reference was made to special circumstances.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	In circumstances where the applicant was taken into custody at the time of the present offending on 14 August 2013, and where his parole was revoked, it was submitted that the sentence imposed meant, in effect, that the applicant would serve a non-parole period of 2 years, 2 months, and 13 days (i.e. from 14 August 2013 until 27 October 2015) following which he would (subject to release) be on parole for 7 months (i.e. until 27 May 2015). It was pointed out that this yielded a ratio well in excess of 75 per cent.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the sentencing judge, when structuring the sentence, had failed to make any reference to special circumstances, despite that issue having been raised. It was submitted that the absence of such reference, along with the end result, supported a conclusion that the issue had been overlooked and that in these circumstances, error was established.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the remarks on sentence at [44]-[46] amounted to a clear rejection of the submission that a finding of special circumstances was warranted. It was submitted, in particular, that the observations of the sentencing judge at ROS [46] indicated a specific intention to impose the sentence she did.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge was obviously aware of the applicant’s custodial history. Equally however, a submission was made to her Honour that special circumstances should be found. The absence, in the remarks on sentence, of any reference to the issue of special circumstances, along with the end result, supports a conclusion that the matter was overlooked: Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212 per Davies J at [32], Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing. 
	
	
	In these circumstances I am satisfied that ground 2 has been made out.
	


Re-sentence


	
	In the event that this Court came to consider the question of re-sentence, the following affidavits were read without objection in the applicant’s case:
	



	
	an affidavit of the applicant of 22 April 2015;
	
	
	an affidavit of Rebecca McMahon, solicitor of 26 April 2015.
	



	
	In addition the Crown read, without objection, an affidavit of Catherine Anne Williams solicitor of 28 April 2015.
	
	
	I have referred to aspects of this affidavit material in more detail below.
	
	
	The present offending was described by counsel for the applicant before the Court as “a fairly typical example of fairly low level street dealing by a drug addict”. Given the circumstances of the offending outlined in the facts before the sentencing judge, I am prepared to accept that counsel’s description was, generally speaking, apt. At the same time, such description must not be allowed to detract from the objective seriousness of offences involving the supply of illicit drugs.
	
	
	A report of Laura Durkin, psychologist records that the applicant, who has a criminal history for offences involving drug supply and drug possession, was born in the United Kingdom and was the only child of his parents. As the applicant’s mother was only 14 when he was born, his maternal aunt and her husband adopted him. The applicant moved to Australia at the age of 6 months with his adoptive parents who, it seems, were supportive of him. In his late teenage years, the applicant learned that his biological mother was the sister of his adoptive mother. This caused difficulties in the relationship between the applicant and his adoptive parents although it seems that those matters resolved over time.
	
	
	The applicant told Ms Durkin that during the course of his life he had abused cannabis, MDMA and cocaine for varying periods of time. However, he advised her that he was now abstinent of all substances. Ms Durkin recommended that the applicant engage in intensive drug and alcohol treatment designed to address substance abuse issues. She concluded:
	


“Through drug and alcohol rehabilitation, (the applicant) can obtain case management, which will support his return to the community post admission. Ongoing case management is recommended given (the applicant’s) peer supports in the community and it is suggested he disconnect from his drug using peers.”


	
	The affidavit of Ms McMahon establishes (inter alia) that the applicant has been employed since being taken into custody. That is confirmed by the applicant’s own affidavit of 22 April 2015 in which he stated that since being taken into custody, he has worked in an upholstery factory, as well as in a facility making demountable buildings for schools. As a result, he has acquired painting, decorating and associated manual skills. The applicant supervised ten co-workers in his most recent position.
	
	
	The applicant has been prescribed anti-depressant medication since being taken into custody with which he has been compliant. He has stated that he proposes to continue to take that medication when released. He has also participated in narcotics anonymous groups whilst in custody.
	
	
	On 8 April 2015 the applicant was transferred to Long Bay Hospital due to passing blood. A letter from the Executive Director of Clinical Operations at Justice Health (which forms annexure A to the affidavit of Ms Williams) confirms that a renal ultrasound undertaken in April 2014 demonstrated moderate right hydronephrosis, with the most likely cause being ureteric calculus or in other words, kidney stones. No surgery has been carried out, nor is any anticipated in the immediate future.
	
	
	For the reasons I have already outlined, there is an issue in the present case as to the commencement date of any sentence in light of the applicant’s custodial history. In Callaghan v R [2006] 160 A Crim R 145 Simpson J (at [20] and [21]) observed that where pre-sentence custody is referable partly to the crime for which an offender is being sentenced and partly to some other circumstance, there is no absolute rule that the pre-sentence custody can never be taken into account in determining when any sentence should commence. Her Honour observed that the matter is discretionary, and further observed (at [23]) that it would, in some cases, be unfair not to backdate a sentence to some point before the expiration of the earlier parole period. In doing so, her Honour pointed out that it is always open to an offender to seek, and be granted parole, even after an initial revocation.
	
	
	In my view, it is appropriate to backdate any sentence to commence on 28 January 2014. The applicant was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offending. Such offending amounted to the applicant disregarding the previous order that he be of good behaviour. Backdating the sentence to 28 January 2014 incorporates the appropriate degree of accumulation.
	
	
	There is a separate issue in respect of whether a finding of special circumstances should be made. The entirety of the evidence, and in particular the evidence of the progress that the applicant has made since being taken into custody, supports the conclusion that he has favourable prospects of rehabilitation despite his criminal history. The evidence also supports a finding of special circumstances. I am satisfied that there exist positive signs which show that if he is allowed a longer period on parole his rehabilitation is likely to be successful: R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [87]. That finding will result in a ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period of slightly less than 75 percent.
	
	
	In the exercise of the sentencing discretion afresh, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 28 January 2014 and expiring on 27 January 2016.
	
	
	A non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months is imposed, commencing on 28 January 2014 and concluding on 27 May 2015.
	
	
	The applicant will be eligible for parole on 28 May 2015 and his sentence will expire on 27 January 2016.

		27 May 2015",2015-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766771,R v Abdulrahman [2015] NSWSC 2094,"Judgment


	
	The Respondent has been charged with 27 firearm offences. A number of these offences are in contravention of s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW); a number are in contravention of s 7A(1) of the Act and there is an offence under s 51D(2) of the Act of possessing more than three firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm. He was arrested on 15 January 2015 and was refused bail until bail was granted on 1 May.
	
	
	The present is a detention application under s 50 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) by the Crown. None of the offences charged is a show cause offence. The Crown bases its application on the basis that the Respondent is an unacceptable risk in terms of non-appearance at court, of the commission of further serious offences and being a risk of danger to the community.
	
	
	The firearms were located in a large PVC pipe behind some lounges in the garage of his house, which has been converted into a barber’s shop where the Respondent conducts his hairdressing business. Three other firearms were found in two cupboards in the laundry of the house. The Respondent, his wife and three children are the occupants of the property.
	
	
	Section 4A of the Firearms Act imposes an onus on a person charged with possession of firearms and that relevantly applies to the charges under ss 7(1), 7A(1) and 51B. Section 4A(1) of the Act provides:
	


   4A Meaning of “possession” of a firearm - proof of possession

(1) Without restricting the meaning of the word possession, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the    person, unless the court is satisfied that:

   (a) the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to,    the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully    authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or

   (b) the person did not know and could not reasonably be    expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the    premises, or

   (c) on the evidence before it, the person was not in    possession of the firearm.


	
	The Crown puts its case on the basis that the large number and types of firearms concerned leads to an inference that the Respondent must have some association with a criminal milieu, whether it is the organisation that is referred to in the Crown material or otherwise. The pipe was located in a position behind the lounges that is said to have been reasonably obvious to anyone who cared to look and certainly, to someone who conducted a hairdressing business in the room where regular cleaning would be both required and necessary.
	
	
	The Respondent points to what is contained in s 4A(1)(c), in particular, to suggest that the premises where the weapons were found was a place of access by various other persons, partly at least because a hairdressing business was being conducted there and points further to the final paragraph of the letter from the Police Officer involved in the investigation of 20 April 2015, referring to the Respondent’s brother who is said to have links to the Comancheros outlaw motorcycle gang. That letter refers to that brother being present at the time the Police executed the search warrant that led to the location of the firearms.
	
	
	The suggestion is that possession of the premises was not such by the Respondent alone, that he would not be able to discharge the onus contained in s 4A because he may well be able to raise, by a circumstantial case, a sufficient doubt that he was not the person in possession of the firearms.
	
	
	Both by reason of s 4A and the circumstances of the location of these firearms, together with a reading of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in May v R [2012] NSWCCA 250, it seems to me that the Crown has a strong case for demonstrating that the Respondent was in possession of these weapons.
	
	
	Mr James QC for the Respondent said it was necessary to look to the type of weapons that were found and the condition that they were in. He said, with the exception of one of the weapons, they were the sort of weapons one might expect for a person who might possess weapons legitimately, for hunting or for some other legal reason. That was in particular response to the suggestion by the police and the Crown that the weapons might have been gathered and possessed for the purpose of bringing about some catastrophic event that would jeopardise the lives of innocent members of the community.
	
	
	The Respondent wishes his bail to continue for two particular reasons. The first is the length of time he is likely to remain in custody before the trial comes on. It may be accepted that it is unlikely that that trial will take place before the first half of next year and that is certainly a consideration.
	
	
	The second matter is the state of health of his wife. I have been provided with an affidavit of his wife, together with medical reports. That demonstrates that the Respondent and his wife have by miscarriage well into the pregnancies lost two children and were forced to terminate another pregnancy because of health difficulties of the Respondent’s wife. She is in her last trimester of pregnancy at the moment and needs the Respondent’s presence and care. She does not speak English and whilst he was not in custody he attended all hospital visits with her. She also needs his assistance for the care of her three children. As a result of his arrest and going into custody, she has suffered a great deal of emotional and financial stress, the financial stress deriving from the fact that he was sole breadwinner in the family, presumably through the hairdressing business.
	
	
	The proposal is that the Respondent would return to live at his property and Mr James offers that he could be placed under virtual house arrest. The bail conditions imposed by the Magistrate on 1 May included the forfeiture of $10,000 by the Respondent if bail was breached and the forfeiture of $50,000 from an acceptable person.
	
	
	In addition, there would be the usual conditions that are currently in place of surrendering passports and not approaching points of departure, non-association with the brother already referred to and any other person who might be thought undesirable.
	
	
	Any application, whether for bail or for detention is a balancing act. The matters to be considered are set out in s 18. If the court, after consideration, does find that there is an unacceptable risk in respect of any of the matters in s 19(2), then either bail should be refused or a detention order made, depending on the application.
	
	
	The Respondent has only one offence on his criminal record; an offence of common assault for which he was given a 12 month s 10 bond some seven years ago. I do not have any regard to that matter.
	
	
	The concern I have, as the Crown has submitted, is that by the serious nature of the offences, the Respondent will fail to appear at any proceedings and will endanger or may endanger the safety of the community and commit further serious offences. It is a reasonable inference and it is an inference that I draw, that the amount and type of weapons that were found in the Respondent’s premises mean that he has criminal associations, with the result that he poses an unacceptable risk of continuing to commit serious offences and thereby, endanger the community.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the s 51D offences is twenty years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of ten years. The maximum penalty for the s 7(1) offences is fourteen years with a standard non-parole period of three years.
	
	
	If the Respondent is convicted of these offences, and the likelihood is that it will be a conviction on a large group of them or none at all, he will be sentenced to a long period of imprisonment. That is a strong motivation, in the circumstances, for him not to appear in court.
	
	
	I cannot be satisfied that the bail concerns I have are met by the conditions proposed and those that are currently in place. I find, therefore, that the Respondent is an unacceptable risk of failing to appear, continuing to commit serious offences and endangering the safety of the community, and I order his detention.

		09 September 2016",2015-05-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766773,R v CLD [2015] NSWCCA 114,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On the evening of 13 October 2010, CLD (the respondent) and M (the deceased) were present in a shed used for the manufacture of pseudoephedrine when a large explosion occurred. Both were badly burned. M later died as a result of his injuries. The respondent was charged with and pleaded not guilty to a count of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.

The Crown argued that the respondent was party to a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture pseudoephedrine in a small, poorly ventilated shed. The unlawful process of extracting pseudoephedrine involved a dangerous act, being the evaporation of toluene, a highly flammable and potentially explosive solvent, in the poorly ventilated space. The evidence at trial established that the explosion could have been ignited by a spark from an electrical appliance or device inside the shed. Other possibilities included a lit cigarette, an ignited blowtorch or a naked flame. The Crown could not and did not seek to identify the ignition source that, in fact, caused the explosion.

At the close of the Crown case, the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the respondent, ruling that the evidence could not establish the essential elements of the offence. The Crown appealed against the directed verdict of acquittal under s 107(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).

The issues to be determined by the Court were:

Whether the Crown had to prove the actual source of ignition to make out the elements of the offence; and

Whether the Crown had to negate all the possible sources of ignition consistent with innocence because they broke the chain of causation.

The court held, allowing the appeal, quashing the verdict of acquittal and ordering a new trial:

In relation to (i): 

It was not necessary that the Crown identify the source of ignition that caused the explosion to establish that the undertaking of the extraction activity in the poorly ventilated shed was dangerous. Whether the activity carried an appreciable risk of injury required a prospective evaluation which took account of all of the possible sources of ignition. It was necessary for the Crown to establish that a reasonable person in the position of the respondent would have realised that multiple potential sources of ignition existed and meant, because of the flammable air mixture and probability of ignition, that the act carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury: [33], [34], [35].

Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 considered.

It was not necessary that the Crown identify the source of ignition that caused the explosion to establish that the respondent’s act significantly or substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. It was for the jury to be satisfied that one of the possible sources of ignition raised on the evidence was the actual source of ignition and that the respondent was causally responsible for M’s death, irrespective of which of those possible sources operated: [40], [41].

Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 considered.

In relation to (ii):

Taking the Crown case at its highest, as the trial judge was required to, there was evidence as to there being several possible sources of ignition and it was open to the jury to conclude that one of those possibilities occurred and that the respondent was causally responsible for M’s death irrespective of which of those possibilities eventuated: [47].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 107(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against a directed verdict of acquittal of the respondent on a count of manslaughter. That direction was given by Maiden DCJ at the conclusion of the Crown case. The right of appeal under that subsection is limited to grounds that involve “a question of law alone”.
	
	
	Section 111(1)(b) of that Act prohibits the publication of any matter having the effect of identifying an acquitted person who is the subject of an appeal under s 107(2) unless the publication is authorised by an order of this Court or of the Court before which the acquitted person is being re-tried. No application was made to authorise any such publication in this case. That being the position, this judgment does not name the respondent, the deceased and two other persons to whom it is necessary to make reference.
	


Overview


	
	On 21 August 2014 the respondent was arraigned on one count of being knowingly concerned with the manufacture of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (pseudoephedrine) contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and one count of manslaughter punishable under s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He pleaded guilty to the first count and not guilty to the second. A jury was empanelled and a trial began. Evidence was taken from a number of witnesses (including expert witnesses). At the conclusion of the Crown case, senior counsel for the respondent successfully applied for a directed verdict of acquittal. The judge told the jury that he had concluded that “the evidence could not establish the essential elements or ingredients of the offence”. The foreman returned a verdict in accordance with the direction. His Honour then gave reasons for his decision. Those reasons are considered in more detail below.
	
	
	The “punishable homicide” (s 18(2) of the Crimes Act) charged was manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. The elements of that category of involuntary manslaughter are supplied by the common law. They are (i) that the accused intentionally committed an act that caused death; (ii) that the act was an unlawful (that is, criminal) one; (iii) that the act was dangerous, (that is, it carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury to another or others); and (iv) that it was one that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised carried such a risk: Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 at [75] per Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ; Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [57] per Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the respondent and the deceased (who we will refer to as M) were parties to a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture pseudoephedrine in a small, poorly ventilated shed on a property which was occupied by the respondent. That manufacture involved the extraction of pseudoephedrine from pharmaceutical preparations. The method of extraction used was to grind the preparations into a powder which was then added to a strong caustic solution and solvent. The solvent used was toluene, a highly flammable chemical that releases vapours into the air producing a mixture which at certain concentrations is explosive in the presence of an ignition source. The liquid mixture was allowed to stand. The solvent containing the pseudoephedrine separated and was drawn off. It was then evaporated, leaving solid pseudoephedrine suitable for the synthesis of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On the evening of 13 October 2010 the respondent and M were in the shed. An explosion occurred at about midnight, followed by a significant fire. The respondent and M were badly burned. Both were conveyed to Liverpool Hospital. M was then transferred to Concord Hospital where he later died as a result of his injuries.
	
	
	Addressing the elements of the manslaughter charge, the Crown case was that on the night in question the respondent was engaged in an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the manufacture of pseudoephedrine involving the evaporation of toluene in a small unventilated shed containing multiple potential ignition sources. The act of evaporating toluene was an unlawful (criminal) act when it was done for the purpose of manufacturing pseudoephedrine. When undertaken in an inadequately ventilated space that act carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury which was foreseeable by a reasonable person in the position of the respondent. The undertaking of that activity caused M’s death when vaporised toluene exploded.
	
	
	It was not part of the Crown case that the actual source of ignition was, or necessarily resulted from, an act undertaken as part of the manufacture of pseudoephedrine. The Crown maintained that it was not necessary for it to identify the precise source of ignition in order to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the undertaking of that activity caused M’s death.
	
	
	The essential reasons for the judge’s decision to direct a verdict of acquittal were that it was “critical” to the Crown case that it establish how ignition occurred and that the Crown had failed to do so; and that the Crown had failed to “negate” possible alternatives to “the case theory of the Crown”. The Crown challenges the correctness of that determination.
	
	
	Before returning to the trial judge’s reasons and the arguments on appeal, it is necessary to refer briefly to the evidence in the Crown case as to the source of ignition and to the arguments made in support of and against the application for a directed verdict.
	


The evidence as to the source of ignition


	
	The evidence of two of the Crown’s witnesses, Mr Hugel, a forensic chemist, and Mr Compton, a fire investigator, was that the explosion occurred as a result of the build-up of toluene vapours in the shed when they were ignited by an unknown event. Mr Hugel agreed that the possible ignition sources included a cigarette, an ignited blowtorch, a naked flame or a spark produced by an electrical device (tcpt 27/08/14, p 313). Mr Compton’s evidence (taken from paragraphs 19 and 21 of his written report (Ex CC)) was:
	


19.   … I was unable to determine the cause of the fire. There were a large number of potential initial and subsequent fuels and a number of potential ignition sources, including the deflagration and a number of heating, ventilating and other electrical appliances. There was also evidence of cigarette smoking. I was able to eliminate natural causes of fire (like lightning) and could find no evidence to support an incendiary act, a juvenile act or an electrical wiring cause for the fire.

   …

21.   Possible ignition sources included a gas heating mantel under a cooking pot, an air conditioning unit, a fridge, a freezer, a spot light, smoking, static electricity, electric heating units, a drier, and fan units. The air compressor near the car and the welder on the tool chest were eliminated as possible ignition sources as they were not plugged in.

His evidence in cross-examination was to the same effect. He accepted as “possible” ignition sources the use of a lighter or match to ignite a gas torch or light a cigarette. In the case of the former, he accepted that could have been done “deliberately or negligently” causing the shed to explode (tcpt 01/09/14, p 420-421).


	
	There are three further aspects of the evidence to which reference should be made to assist an understanding of the arguments made in support of the direction for acquittal and the trial judge’s reasons for concluding that such a direction should be given.
	
	
	There was evidence that M was a cigarette smoker and that the respondent did not permit smoking in the shed. There was also evidence in the records of Concord Hospital, albeit at least second-hand hearsay and unattributed as to its source, concerning the circumstances in which M was injured. Those records included the following (Ex PP):
	


… [M] was transferred from Liverpool Hospital for management of 95% TBS burn from a lab exploration [sic]. The history and mechanism of burn. According to the notes, there were 2 versions of the history:

1.   Lit cigarette while carrying methyl outside of the workplace (lab)

2.   Working in automatic shed (home garage) and had explosion of the gas bottle


	
	Finally, the evidence of the respondent’s girlfriend, who was living with him at the time of the explosion, was that for a continuous period, commencing a month or so before the accident, another man, D, had visited and spent time in the shed on at least three or four occasions in each of the weeks in that period. Her evidence also was that the respondent went to and remained in the shed for extensive periods whilst D was there. Almost immediately after the explosion, D’s car was seen leaving the shed at speed by the respondent’s girlfriend and other witnesses who lived in the area.
	


The defence submissions in support of a directed verdict of acquittal


	
	The arguments put in support of the application are outlined in the following extracts from defence counsel’s written submissions to the trial judge:
	


5.   The central Crown contention is that it was the actual act of manufacturing the pseudoephedrine, and not some intervening and/or unexpected event, that caused the death of the deceased. The Crown's argument in this regard is that the manufacturing process took place in such a poorly ventilated area that the vapours produced under the heating process built up to such a critical degree that it was bound to explode in the presence of the available ignition sources present for the heating process. Accordingly, the explosion was inevitable as part of that manufacturing process. Yet ultimately the Crown's argument in this regard is not supported by the evidence.

6.   The applicant's position is that upon the evidence the Crown cannot exclude that the explosion was in fact caused by an intervening event, which was not foreseeable by a reasonable person in the position of the applicant.

7   Importantly in this regard it should be noted that the applicant was no doubt concerned for his own safety and that of his best friend in the safe operation of the manufacturing process as was [M] concerned for the welfare of the accused. Even more importantly [in] this regard is that upon the evidence the laboratory had been operating for a lengthy period of time apparently safely and without incident (see the evidence of Mr Hugel Tpp 312-313).

8.   For example the Crown can not exclude that the explosion was caused by a third party who unexpectedly ignited a gas torch either deliberately and/or negligently causing the vapours, usually safely controlled in the ongoing laboratory, to explode; and/or contrary to usual procedures [the deceased] lit a cigarette while carrying methylated spirits while walking in the shed towards the laboratory.

…

10.   Both Mr Hugel and Mr Compton gave evidence that they could not determine the cause of ignition. Further that they could not exclude the lighting of the gas blow torch and/or smoking as the cause of the ignition. Mr Compton said in cross-examination he could not exclude the lighting of the gas blow torch as an incendiary act causing the explosion; and/or that smoking but in particular lighting a cigarette could have caused same.

11.   In any event, it is not to the point that the defence has to demonstrate what was the act which in fact caused the explosion, the onus is upon the Crown in this regard. It is submitted herein that the Crown can not prove that it was in fact a part of the manufacturing process that caused the available fumes to ignite. It is also noted that this is not an offence of strict liability, nor some derivative of felony murder (although even with respect to felony murder as part of a joint criminal enterprise the manner in which death is caused has to be foreseeable as an incident of the joint enterprise).

...

14.   Critically in the context of this case the Crown can not demonstrate that it was in fact a part of the actual manufacturing process itself, which had apparently operated without incident for a lengthy period of time, that caused the vapours to ignite thereby causing the explosion.

15.   Indeed, albeit the accused has no onus in this regard, it is more likely that it was the unexpected intervening act of a third party igniting a gas torch in the laboratory; and/or the deceased negligently entering the laboratory smoking a cigarette while carrying methylated spirits which caused the shed to explode.

16.   This is not only relevant to the proof of the actual act which caused the explosion and thereafter the burns to the deceased as a result of which a decision was made to turn off his life support, it is also relevant to the question of dangerousness.

17.   It is submitted a reasonable person in the position of the accused who was simply operating the manufacturing system, which had been conducted without incident for an extended period of time, can not be found to have appreciated the risk of serious injury by reason of an ignition source which the Crown can not identify.

18.   Accordingly, given the Crown can not demonstrate the cause of the ignition, further that the Crown can not demonstrate that such an unidentified cause was in fact part of the extraction or manufacturing process, and/or that the Crown can not demonstrate there was therefor a foreseeable risk of serious injury with respect to such an unidentified cause, it is submitted there is no case to answer upon the manslaughter charge and a verdict of not guilty should be directed accordingly.

The Crown submissions in response


	
	The Crown responded that it was not necessary that it identify the source of ignition to make out each of the elements of the offence charged. The unlawful and dangerous act that caused M’s death was that of extracting pseudoephedrine by the heating and evaporation of toluene in a poorly ventilated shed exposed to multiple potential ignition sources. It was not necessary that the Crown establish the precise source of ignition to establish that the act so described was dangerous and that it caused M’s death.
	


The trial judge’s reasons for the directed verdict of acquittal


	
	Having referred to the evidence of Mr Hugel as to the manufacturing process, and the evidence of Mr Compton as to the cause of the explosion and fire, the trial judge continued (Judgment 04/09/14, p 4):
	


… The very nature of this production process in this situation was obviously dangerous and the production of the chemical was illegal and that the danger was evident and covered by the tests that have been well established.

Mr Dalton, senior counsel, who with Mr Siafakos submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that the Crown case theory was the only basis for the explosion and/or fire. Here lays the difference between both cases in respect of the authority and I have been asked to decide. Effectively Mr Dalton, senior counsel, submitted that there was an intervening act and or possible intervening acts established on the evidence. That was countered by the Crown's submitting [sic] that there was no need whether there be intervening acts or not, the activity from when the illegal operation commenced created danger [p 5] and it was not incumbent upon the Crown to say what spark or fire or flame caused the ignition.

The critical case in my mind is the decision of the High Court of Australia in Burns v The Queen where the Chief Justice considered at para 9 the assessment of 'dangerous' and in one way sought to deal with the problem that confronts any prosecuting authority in situations where the common law charge of manslaughter is laid. In that case his Honour held that,

""[The question whether] An act is dangerous involves an assessment of risk in the sense of ex-ante probability that the act will cause serious injury to a person. If no casual pathway with the requisite level of probability can be identified the act is not able to be characterised as dangerous. The assessment of risk as ""appreciable"" is qualitative. The judgment it requires is linked to the judgment of causation and like judgment of causation in such cases""

and it follows on.

The Court also considered the well-known cases of Wilson [[1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313] and Lavender [[2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67] and critically, and there was no argument between counsel as to the principles involved with those cases, That [sic] there is evidence which is capable of finding that the act is dangerous in the relevant sense is a matter for the judge. Here, on the facts, the Crown submits that it is not the ignition that made the situation dangerous but the manufacture and the use of the substances Toluene, perhaps Acetone, giving rise to vapours which could detonate or explode at a low temperature was the act that was dangerous and it did not matter where the spark, flame or fire came from that caused the fire/explosion.

Having considered the Chief Justice's decision I am of the view that there is a requirement upon the prosecuting authority to identify with certainty the links in the chain particularly in a circumstantial case such as this one, that give rise to the ignition of the vapour.

[p 6] In this case there were. Besides [sic] the Crown theory that is, that it was most likely that the flame or spark came from a number of the electrical items being used in the process of manufacturing, most likely a heating element that was on in an ""on"" position with an open flame from a gas ring at the time of the explosion.


	
	The trial judge then referred to the Concord Hospital note which suggested as a possible cause of ignition that someone, presumably M, had “lit [a] cigarette while carrying methyl”. He also described another of the “matters that perhaps are of concern” as being that somehow D was involved in the operation taking place in the shed before he left the scene “in an urgent way” after the explosion and fire.
	
	
	Having observed that this evidence gave rise to questions, in the case of the former as to how the ignition occurred and, in the case of the latter as to D’s possible involvement in that event, the trial judge concluded (Judgment 04/09/14, p 7):
	


This Court takes the view that in terms of the facts of the matter here, that it was critical to the prosecution case as to how ignition was caused and if there were other possible alternatives to the case theory of the Crown, then those matters should have been negated.

The Crown’s grounds of appeal


	
	The Crown relies on two grounds of appeal. They are:
	


1.   Whether his Honour erred in finding that it was critical to the prosecution case as to how the ignition was caused.

2.   Whether his Honour erred in holding that if there were other possible alternatives to the case theory of the Crown, then those matters should have been negated.


	
	It is not submitted on behalf of the respondent that either of these grounds is not directed to a question of law alone.
	
	
	The first challenges the trial judge’s determination as to what the Crown was required to prove in order to make out each of the elements of its case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. In R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199, this Court (Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) held that a ground of appeal which challenges a determination of the trial judge as to the legal elements of the Crown case is one which involves “a question of law alone”: at [27], [52].
	
	
	The second ground is directed to the trial judge’s conclusion extracted in [19] above. On one view that conclusion proceeds from the trial judge’s determination of the legal requirements of the Crown case. On another it proceeds on the basis that a verdict of acquittal must be directed unless the Crown has excluded all of the possibilities that arise on the evidence which are consistent with the accused’s innocence. Relevantly here, the possibilities referred to appear to include that an intentional or negligent act of the deceased or of a third person may have caused the explosion and fire. This ground addresses this alternative view. The Crown contends that in requiring that it exclude other possible sources of ignition the trial judge applied the wrong legal test for determining whether the evidence required that there be a directed verdict of acquittal. It submits the trial judge should have considered whether the evidence taken at its highest was capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. If it was capable of doing so, the matter should have been left to the jury. As this ground challenges the correctness of the legal test applied by the trial judge, it also involves a question of law alone.
	


Ground 1 (error as to legal requirements necessary to make out elements of offence)


	
	The respondent’s written argument (extracted above) and the trial judge’s reasons identify three bases on which it was contended that the Crown had to prove the source of ignition to make out the elements of the offence.
	
	
	First, it was submitted that in order to characterise the relevant act of the respondent as “dangerous” it was necessary to inquire whether a reasonable person in his position would have appreciated that there was a risk of serious injury resulting from the actual source of ignition of the explosion and fire. See pars 16, 17 and 18 of the respondent’s written submissions extracted in [15] above.
	
	
	Secondly, it was argued that in order to make out its case on causation the Crown had to prove that the act or event of ignition was a part or consequence of the activity of manufacturing pseudoephedrine. See pars 5, 11 and 14 of the written submissions extracted in [15] above.
	
	
	Finally, it was said that the Crown’s evidence did not exclude the possibility that the source of ignition was or involved an act or event which would break the chain of causation and relieve the respondent of criminal responsibility for M’s death. It was suggested that such an event might include one that was not reasonably foreseeable to a person in the position of the respondent or one that involved a deliberate (in the sense of intending the outcome) or negligent act by a third party (such as igniting a gas torch) or M (such as lighting a cigarette). See pars 5, 6, 8, 10 and 15 extracted in [15] above.
	
	
	The trial judge appears to have been satisfied that there was evidence capable of justifying findings that the “very nature of this production process in this situation was obviously dangerous” and that the danger was “evident” (Judgment 04/09/14, p 4). His Honour’s reference to the passage at [9] in the judgment of French CJ in Burns v The Queen, which was directed to that assessment, was incomplete. That passage continued with an observation, citing Burt CJ (Jones and Smith JJ agreeing), in Campbell v The Queen [1981] WAR 286 at 290, that the judgment of causation in such cases is:
	


[N]ot a philosophical or a scientific question, but a question to be determined by [the jury] applying their common sense to the facts as they find them they appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter.

As French CJ also noted, that statement was approved in Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 at 357, 411 – 412, 423 and 441.


	
	His Honour then recorded the Crown submission that it was the act of manufacture (in particular “the use of the substances Toluene, perhaps Acetone, giving rise to vapours that could detonate or explode at a low temperature”) that was the act that was dangerous and that “it did not matter where the spark, flame or fire came from that caused the fire/explosion”. Having done so, and without explaining why, he concluded that there was “a requirement upon the prosecuting authority to identify with certainty the links in the chain particularly in a circumstantial case such as this one, that give rise to the ignition of the vapour” (Judgment 04/09/14, p 5).
	
	
	His Honour then referred to the evidence suggesting the possibility of conduct that might be said to have broken the causal connection between the act of manufacture and M’s death. That discussion preceded his final conclusions that how the ignition occurred was “critical to the prosecution case” and that “if there were other possible alternatives to the case theory of the Crown, then those matters should have been negated” (Judgment 04/09/14, p 7).
	
	
	Although his Honour gave reasons for his decision to direct a verdict of acquittal in accordance with his fundamental duty to do so (as to which see the discussion of French CJ and Kiefel J in Wainohu v New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 at [54] – [58]) he did not explain why it was “critical” for the Crown to prove how the ignition was caused. Nor does that explanation emerge elsewhere in his Honour’s reasons. That being the position, it is necessary to address whether any of the arguments made by the respondent at the trial and in this Court provides a sound basis for the conclusion that it was critical to the Crown case that it prove how the ignition occurred.
	
	
	In this Court the principal basis upon which the respondent sought to uphold the trial judge was that the Crown case was deficient because it was “necessary to show the act of ignition to be able to assess foreseeability in the context of dangerousness” (tcpt 11/03/15, p 39). We take this to be a formulation of the first of the three arguments outlined above at [24] – [27].
	
	
	Addressing that argument, the requirement that the respondent’s act be “dangerous” called for an objective assessment of whether the act of manufacture carried an appreciable risk of serious injury: Burns v The Queen at [9] per French CJ and [75] per Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. That involved a prospective evaluation of the likelihood that in the circumstances in which the extraction activity was being undertaken there could be a build-up of flammable toluene vapours that could be exposed to an ignition source resulting in an explosion and fire.
	
	
	The flaw in the respondent’s argument is that it focussed too narrowly on the source of ignition, as distinct from the fact of ignition however caused. The assessment of an appreciable risk of serious injury was not confined to the ex-ante probability, that is the probability before the event, of the actual source of ignition emerging and causing such an explosion and fire. All of the possible sources of ignition that might have made that activity “dangerous” had to be considered. It was then necessary to address whether a reasonable person in the position of the respondent would have realised that those sources existed and meant, because of the flammable air mixture and the probability of ignition, that the extraction activity (involving the evaporation of toluene in an inadequately ventilated space) carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. It was not necessary that the precise cause of ignition be foreseeable, it was sufficient that ignition, whatever the precipitating cause, be foreseeable.
	
	
	We conclude that, for the Crown to establish that the undertaking of the extraction activity in the shed was dangerous, carrying with it an appreciable risk of injury to others, it was not necessary that it identify the source of ignition that in fact caused the explosion and fire resulting in M’s death.
	
	
	As to the respondent’s second argument, it was the Crown case that the act of extracting pseudoephedrine by evaporation of toluene in an inadequately ventilated space was the act that caused M’s death. It was not the Crown case that the act that caused M’s death was or included the ignition of the explosive air mixture inside the shed, or that that ignition was an inevitable consequence of that act . That being so, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that the source of ignition was a part of, or an inevitable consequence of, the extraction process in order to make out its case on causation.
	
	
	In support of his argument that the Crown must prove the source or act of ignition, the respondent referred to the reasoning of Hamill J in R v Lin (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1710. That case also concerned a fire in premises allegedly used to manufacture methylamphetamine and the charges against the accused included a count of involuntary manslaughter. However, the Crown case differed from the Crown case here in a critical respect. In R v Lin (No. 2) the unlawful and dangerous act relied upon as having caused the death of another person involved with the accused in that manufacture was or included the lighting of a ring burner that ignited flammable vapours, causing the fire which resulted in death. His Honour directed a verdict of acquittal in relation to the manslaughter charge on the basis that there was no evidence capable of establishing that the accused either lit the ring burner or was criminally responsible for that act because it was committed in furtherance of a joint criminal enterprise: [76], [97], [99]. The Crown case here did not rely upon the act of ignition as the relevant unlawful and dangerous act of the respondent or for which he was criminally responsible.
	
	
	The respondent’s third argument addresses the issue of causation. To establish that the act of evaporating toluene to extract the pseudoephedrine caused M’s death, that act must be shown to have contributed significantly or substantially to his death. For that to be established, it is not necessary that the act of manufacture be the sole, direct or immediate cause of death. The question of causation which arises for the purpose of attributing legal responsibility is ultimately one of fact and for the jury to decide by applying common sense to the underlying facts as found. If such a jury would not hold the accused’s act or omission to be a cause for that purpose, it is not to the point that it was a causa sine qua non (or a necessary precondition) of the relevant event or occurrence: see Royall v The Queen at 387 – 389 per Mason CJ; 398 per Brennan J; 411 – 412 per Deane and Dawson JJ; 423 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ; and 441 – 442 per McHugh J; McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 118 – 119 per Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ; and Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316 at [15] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ.
	
	
	Here the explosive air mixture resulting from the undertaking of the extraction process was a necessary condition for the occurrence of the explosion and fire in the sense that “but for” this air mixture neither would have occurred as they did. It was not, however, the direct or immediate cause of those events which could not have happened without an operative source of ignition. If that operative source was a spark from an electrical appliance or device inside the shed and ignition occurred without any human intervention beyond the ordinary use or operation of that device, it is unlikely that the issue of causation would be controversial. No specific question could arise for the jury as to whether there had occurred, between the respondent’s “but for” act of manufacture and the explosion, an act or omission which broke the chain of causation so as to relieve the respondent of any criminal responsibility for the resulting fire and death. In such a case the application of the common sense test of causation would suggest that ignition from such a source would have been foreseen as a consequence of the respondent’s activity so as to leave him causally responsible for the explosion that resulted in M’s death and notwithstanding that consequence was not a necessary or inevitable one.
	
	
	However, if the source of the ignition was or involved an act of M or a third person a question might arise as to whether the chain of causation had been broken, depending on whether the act or omission was deliberate, in the sense that it was committed with the intention of causing the explosion, or reckless not caring whether that was the outcome, or merely inadvertent or negligent. In such circumstances more specific directions would provide guidance to the jury in their task of determining whether the accused’s “but for” act or omission was the substantial cause of M’s death. The relevant principles are discussed in Royall v The Queen and, in particular, in the judgment of McHugh J at 441 – 451. It will be appropriate in such a case for the judge to direct the jury in accordance with those principles as they apply to any possibilities that arise on the evidence: see the discussion in R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279 at 288 – 290.
	
	
	The Crown sought to prove causation by establishing that there were several possible sources of ignition, any one of which could have operated. (The existence of those sources of ignition was also relevant to the Crown’s case that the act of extracting pseudoephedrine using toluene was a dangerous one). It was then for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or other of those possibilities was the source of ignition and that the respondent was causally responsible for M’s death irrespective of which of those possible sources operated.
	
	
	In Royall v The Queen three alternative possibilities as to how the victim fell to her death were left to the jury and there was a need for the jury to be directed on specific issues of causation and intent which arose with respect to those different possibilities. If in this case the evidence identified as possibilities sources of ignition that involved the intervention of M or of a third person, it would be for the jury to determine, after being directed as to the relevant principles, whether in the face of that evidence they could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the source of ignition was one of the possibilities contended for by the Crown. If the jury could not be satisfied in that respect, they would then have to consider whether the respondent was causally responsible for M’s death if any one or more of those further possibilities were accepted as the source of ignition. If so, the jury would then have to consider whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the operative source of ignition was either one of the possibilities contended for by the Crown or one of the further possibilities raised by the evidence that did not break the chain of causation.
	
	
	These matters were questions for the jury, properly directed, to consider. They did not make it necessary, as a matter of law, that the Crown prove the source of ignition as an element of its case on causation. It follows that this first ground of appeal is made out.
	


Ground 2 (error as to determination that the Crown had to negate possible causes of ignition consistent with innocence)


	
	In R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177 at [26], French CJ observed that the directed verdict of acquittal is a mechanism for taking a case away from the jury because, as a matter of law, a conviction is not open on the evidence. In other words, as the Court (Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) explained in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 214 – 215:
	


It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.


	
	This Court (Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ agreeing) noted in R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31 at [32], that these authorities and May v O’Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; 92 CLR 654 at 658 make clear that “the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a conviction is to be resolved without regard to evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by qualifying, contradicting or explaining the evidence in support of a conviction.” The Chief Justice added, citing R v J M R (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 at 44, that where a case depends in the main on circumstantial evidence, “a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case on which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated”.
	
	
	In R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 81 Gleeson CJ (Maxwell and Wood JJ agreeing) cited the following statement of Young CJ and Anderson and Gobbo JJ in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1983] 2 VR 410 at 415 – 416 as correctly stating the appropriate test in relation to a Crown case based on circumstantial evidence:
	


The question whether the Crown has ultimately excluded every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence is a question of fact for the jury and therefore, if the Crown has led evidence upon which the accused could be convicted, a trial judge should not rule that there is no case to answer or direct the jury to acquit simply because he thinks that there could be formulated a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused which the Crown has failed to exclude. Similarly a trial judge should not rule that there is no case for the accused to answer because he has formed the view that, if the decision on the facts were his and not the jury’s, he would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. It is always a question for the jury whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of the accused and as Menzies J explained in Plomp’s Case, in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the necessity to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence is no more than an application to that class of case of the requirement that the case be proved beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	Here instead of ignoring the alternative hypotheses as to the possible sources of ignition suggested by the respondent, the trial judge actively considered those hypotheses (and did so without addressing whether they were consistent with the respondent’s innocence because they broke the chain of causation) and concluded that the Crown must fail because they had not been negated. In doing so his Honour took the approach expressly disapproved by this Court in R v R, R v J M R and R v PL. Taking the Crown case at its highest there was evidence as to there being several possible sources of ignition and it was open to the jury to conclude on the basis of that evidence that one or other of those possibilities was the source of ignition and that the respondent was causally responsible for M’s death irrespective of which of those possibilities operated. Those questions and the question of whether a reasonable doubt existed as to the respondent’s innocence should have been left to the jury. This ground of appeal also has been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	Section 107(5) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that on an appeal under s 107(2) the Court “may affirm or quash the acquittal appealed against”. Section 107(6) provides that if the acquittal is quashed the Court may order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit.
	
	
	The respondent did not contend that if the grounds of appeal are made out, a new trial should not be ordered.
	
	
	The charge brought is a serious one and there is no apparent reason why the Court should decline to order a re-trial. In particular this is not a case where this Court could be satisfied that any conviction would be overturned as unreasonable or on any other basis which would not result in a new trial in the event of a successful conviction appeal: see R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199 at [88] – [93] per Spigelman CJ.
	
	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	


1.   Appeal allowed.

2.   Verdict of acquittal on charge of manslaughter quashed.

3.   Order a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.

Introduction 


	
	An application was made by the Crown on the morning of Thursday 28 May 2015 for the discharge of the jury in this murder trial. The basis of the application was adverse publicity about the Crown Prosecutor who appeared for the Crown for three days of the trial, the latter two of them before the jury. At the conclusion of the submissions, I rejected the application for a discharge and stood the trial over until 10 AM on Tuesday 2 June 2015. These are my reasons for those orders.
	
	
	By way of background, the accused was arraigned on a count of murder before a jury panel and me on the morning of Tuesday 26 May 2015. He pleaded not guilty and a jury was empanelled. In my opening remarks, I directed the jury to disregard any publicity to do with the trial, and amongst other things explained that it was of no value to them. I also provided each of them with a “dot point summary” of those opening remarks, which was to identical effect about publicity. Thereafter the openings of counsel were given, and the first prosecution witness was called by the Crown that afternoon.
	
	
	On the following day, Wednesday 27 May 2015, the trial unfolded unremarkably before lunch. At 2 PM defence counsel raised a matter; namely, that there was publicity about the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) having very recently referred documents to the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) relating to whether the Crown Prosecutor then appearing in the trial had possibly committed offences against public justice some time before. The Crown Prosecutor did not seek an adjournment on the basis of any personal distraction as a result of that having occurred. A newspaper article that was on the internet was tendered and became voir dire exhibit A.
	
	
	Eventually, both counsel provided me with a joint written submission about the directions I should give the jury, and which remains on court file. The transcript will show that I gave the jury a far more fulsome and firm direction than the one that was agreed in by both counsel. Thereafter the trial continued as normal until 4 PM that day.
	
	
	On the morning of Thursday 28 May 2015, the Crown Prosecutor informed me that her instructions had been withdrawn by the DPP. Accordingly, she concluded her appearance in the matter and left the Bar table. A second Crown Prosecutor appeared for the Crown. The jury re-joined us briefly. I told them that no doubt they had noted the change in counsel; that a change in representation is not uncommon in litigation; and directed them that they should not draw the slightest adverse inference against either party as a result. The jury then left us for a time so that I could hear further applications.
	


Submissions


	
	Thereafter, the second Crown Prosecutor submitted that the jury must be discharged on two bases: first, the jury had been irremediably prejudiced by the publicity about the former advocate for the Crown; secondly, it would be impractical for another barrister to be briefed without delaying the trial very markedly.
	
	
	In support of the first proposition, a number of extracts from recent media reports pertaining to the first Crown Prosecutor were tendered on the voir dire. It was not disputed by the Crown that many of them, far from criticising the first Crown Prosecutor, criticised ICAC and supported the first Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the publicity has the potential to deflect the jury from a focus on the evidence; to cause the jury inevitably to speculate on a connection between the publicity and the withdrawal of the first Crown Prosecutor; and to undermine the credibility of any Crown Prosecutor appearing in the trial. That was said to be especially damaging in light of the special position of a Crown Prosecutor as a Minister of Justice.
	
	
	Defence counsel opposed the application. He submitted that two timely and powerful directions had been given; and that the test for discharge of a jury (which was not in dispute, and which I shall recount in a moment) had not been made out.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to legal principle, there was no dispute between the parties that the test I should apply is whether the party seeking discharge of a jury based upon prejudicial material has demonstrated a high degree of necessity for that course: see Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427. Determination of whether that test has been made out requires an evaluation by a trial judge of a multitude of factors, including the nature of the allegedly prejudicial material, the stage of the trial that has been reached, and whether any prejudice can be cured by direction or other steps. In my judgment in R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703 at [11] - [18], I reviewed a number of examples of decisions about discharge of a juror or jury that have either been made at first instance or considered on appeal; I shall not repeat that review here.
	
	
	Turning to logistical considerations first, it is true that the trial had only proceeded for two days before the jury. It is also true that I was informed by the sheriffs that, in all likelihood, another panel would be available for a fresh trial next Tuesday. Those facts weighed in favour of the application being granted.
	
	
	To be weighed against the application was the fact that two adult children of the deceased (an elderly lady who was, on the Crown case, strangled to death), had given evidence already in the trial. The daughter of the deceased travelled from Melbourne to do so. The son of the deceased recounted how he had found the body of his mother. He also sat in the witness box and endured the gruelling process of the 000 call that he made as a result of his discovery being played in open court. I noted that he was visibly upset at that time. Avoiding those two witnesses going through that process again clearly counted against the application.
	
	
	Speaking more generally, I accepted that the position that has developed is a regrettable one, and it would have been preferable for it not to have occurred. I also accepted the proposition that the combined effect of the publicity about, and the sudden departure of, the first Crown Prosecutor has a potential to distract or deflect the jury to some degree.
	
	
	But it is to be recalled that, on the first day of the trial before the jury, I directed them to disregard all publicity. On the second day of the trial, I directed them to disregard any publicity with regard to the Crown Prosecutor. On the third day of the trial, I directed them that they must not draw the slightest inference against either party as a result of the departure of the first Crown Prosecutor. All of those directions were given very soon after each issue arose. And, of course, I would be open to any reasonable further direction sought by a Crown Prosecutor in order to minimise any possible adverse consequences arising from what has occurred.
	
	
	Quite apart from that, it is not uncommon in criminal trials for some inadmissible prejudicial material about an accused person to be placed before a jury by way of a slip, or by way of a portion of an exhibit that should have been edited but was missed, or by way of a witness not answering a direct question directly. Merely because such a thing happens by no means results in the automatic discharge of the jury; rather, it is a matter of considering whether the test promulgated by the High Court of Australia has been made out.
	
	
	Separately, it is not uncommon for trial by jury to proceed in New South Wales when there is recent or extant condemnatory publicity about an accused person on the internet. Nor is it uncommon for there to be material on the internet about the criminal record of the accused, arising from reporting of his or her initial bail application upon arrest. Indeed, it is not unheard of for trials by jury to be conducted with regard to a count of murder when there has been ample publicity about the conviction of an accused person for an entirely separate murder, and that material remains on the internet: see, for example, Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 and Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20. Such trials proceed to verdict on the understanding that juries obey the directions of trial judges to disregard that material.
	
	
	Of course, each application for a discharge of a jury must turn on its own facts, and the particular circumstances that arise. I only refer to those other cases in order to demonstrate that the test that must be made out by the moving party, whether it be the Crown or the accused, is a stringent one.
	
	
	To my mind, at its absolute highest the publicity that founds the application could cause the jury to have some disquiet about the conduct or character of the first Crown Prosecutor. And it was clear that the trial, if a discharge had not been granted, would need to be delayed for some days. I considered that, a few days after that time, the first Crown Prosecutor will, to a substantial degree, have faded from the consciousness of the jury.
	
	
	As well as that, the stage of the trial at which the first Crown Prosecutor withdrew means that she had engaged in no exercises in advocacy (such as making a closing address intended to persuade, or cross-examining the accused) that could perhaps have been undermined by a loss of personal credibility on her part.
	
	
	In short, I did not consider that the test of a high degree of necessity had been made out in the circumstances that I have summarised. In particular, in light of the three separate and firm directions that I had given to the jury already, I was confident that the jury will regard the question of the alleged conduct of the Crown Prosecutor who appeared for the first two days of the trial as little more than a fleeting distraction.
	
	
	It was for the foregoing reasons that I rejected the application for a discharge of the jury.
	


Length of adjournment


	
	There was no question of the Crown being forced on without an adjournment sufficient for new counsel to familiarise himself or herself fully with the trial. The only issue for determination was how long any such adjournment should be. And I have borne firmly in mind that the allegation is of the most serious offence known to law.
	
	
	It can be seen that, when I made my orders at about midday on Thursday and stood the matter over for further hearing at 10 AM the following Tuesday (with the jury to return at 11 AM), I was granting an adjournment of the trial of four and a half days (two of which are weekend days). I considered that that was sufficient time for a suitably experienced and senior advocate, whether a member of the public or private Bar, to master the brief. I came to that view because the material already placed before me by way of openings and evidence shows that the Crown case is a relatively straightforward circumstantial one. As I understand it, it is founded, in a nutshell, on the following alleged factors: motive (namely an intense hatred on the part of the accused for the deceased); relationship evidence; lies told by the accused to the Police; scientific evidence including DNA; and the finding of certain incriminating items at the premises where the accused was staying.
	
	
	I was told that there would be no more than 26 witnesses called in the Crown case. Seven of those witnesses have been called, examined, and excused. Defence counsel also made it clear that the evidence of no more than three Crown witnesses would be in substantial dispute. It seems that two of those witnesses have already been called and excused; a remaining witness whose evidence will be the subject of substantial cross-examination is a DNA expert. Defence counsel has made it clear that the main thrust of that cross-examination will be about secondary transfer, a phenomenon with which every Crown Prosecutor in New South Wales would be well familiar.
	
	
	Undoubtedly, acceptance of a brief to appear four days or so thereafter in a part-heard murder trial will place substantial pressure not only on the advocate in question but also on the office of the DPP generally. But in all the circumstances, I was not prepared to delay the trial further. That is because I was confident that the solicitor for the DPP (who remains in the matter) will be able to find counsel of sufficient expertise and diligence to have the matter prepared and ready to be further presented by next Tuesday morning.
	
	
	In particular, in the circumstances that have arisen, I did not consider that logistical problems experienced by the Crown could or should play a determinative role, in the question of whether the jury should be discharged, by delaying the recommencement of the trial for an impractically long period.
	
	
	Finally, I indicate to the parties that, of course, my Associate stands ready to assist the new counsel briefed for the Crown by way of such things as provision of transcripts, access to the exhibits already tendered, and any other reasonably practical and appropriate step.
	


Orders


	
	It is for those reasons that yesterday I made the following orders:
	



	
	The application for the discharge of the jury is rejected.
	
	
	The trial is adjourned until 10 AM on Tuesday 2 June 2015.

2766776,New South Wales Crime Commission v George Barikhan [2015] NSWSC 673,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The New South Wales Crime Commission, that is the plaintiff, seeks restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“CARA”) against the defendant George Barikhan. It brings its application by summons filed in court this morning supported by a statement of facts and circumstances and an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark who is an employee of the plaintiff.
	
	
	The facts and circumstances are under the hand of Ms Miranda, a solicitor with the plaintiff. The affidavit of Mr Spark complies with the provision of s 10A in that it states a belief on his part or a suspicion that the defendant engaged in serious crime related activity. That term is defined in CARA.
	
	
	In particular he suspects that the defendant engaged in a relatively large number of offences of dishonestly obtaining benefit by deception, contrary to s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The affidavit attaches a number of relevant documents and critical in terms of the formulation of the belief asserted, is a statement of facts prepared by the New South Wales Police. That is a relatively lengthy document and I have perused it carefully. It outlines around 70 offences in the nature of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception and an offence of no particular relevance of perverting the course of justice.
	
	
	That latter offence appears to have arisen when false documents were tendered in some traffic proceedings against the defendant, the false documents being a reference that had been forged.
	
	
	The remaining offences detailed disclosed similar modus operandi, at least if the facts as set out are accepted.
	
	
	In a nutshell the defendant was operating as a finance broker in relation to the borrowing of money on motor vehicles. It is alleged, and that allegation is supported by the product of various searches that have been undertaken, that he obtained the finance by means of the use of false documentation, including false tax returns and other financial documents, thus overstating the capacity of the borrower, to repay.
	
	
	Based on the material in that facts sheet and the other material, I am satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion deposed to by Mr Spark and accordingly I must make a restraining order: s 10A(5) CARA.
	
	
	Accordingly I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order provided by the plaintiff and those orders are to take effect forthwith.
