The plaintiffs, who are the first respondents in this appeal, are the person,al representatives of the estate of Razack Abdul Kader (the deceased) who died from injuries suffered in an accident during the loading of sawn timber on to a pontoon from a lorry at a jetty in Jurong. The first defendants, Indufela Co, the appellants in this appeal, are a firm of general contractors and suppliers of labour which employed the deceased at the time of the accident. The second defendants, Han Chuan Crane Co, the second respondents in this appeal, had hired out a mobile truck crane, operated by a crane driver in their employ, to the first defendants for loading the sawn timber on to the pontoon.
The plaintiffs, in an action heard before Choor Singh J, claimed damages from both defendants alleging negligence on the part of both defendants, or one or other of them, their servants or agents in the course of the loading of the sawn timber from a lorry on to a pontoon. The allegation was that `in the course of the loading some pieces of timber which were being lifted by the crane slipped and fell on the deceased pinning him down.` The particulars of negligence set out in the statement of claim were as follows:
 Particulars of Negligence 
 
1. Rushing the loading.
 
 
 
 
(2) . Not ensuring that the timber was properly secured to prevent it slipping. 
 
(3) . Not providing a look-out to warn persons whilst the timber was in motion in the air. 
 
(4) . In the respects aforesaid failed to provide a reasonably safe method of working and/or effective supervision, thereby exposing the deceased to unnecessary risk. 
 
(5) . The plaintiffs will further rely on the falling of the said pieces of timber as evidence of negligence.
  
 
 
The first defendants in their defence denied negligence and alleged that the accident was `solely caused or contributed to by the negligence of the second defendant its servants or agents`. The second defendants in their defence claimed that the accident was `caused solely or partly by the negligence of the first defendant by its servants or agents and by the negligence of the deceased or alternatively by the negligence of one or other of them`.
The facts elicited from the evidence were these. The deceased was a general labourer who normally worked on ships as a stevedore. On the day of the accident, the deceased and a fellow labourer named Ali Mohamed Ghani (Ali) had no stevedoring work to do and on hearing that work was available at a jetty in Jurong they went there and were employed by the first defendants, together with other labourers, to load loose sawn timber on to a pontoon. The timber was lying near the office of the first defendants near the jetty. This timber had to be first loaded on to lorries for transportation to the jetty. At the jetty the timber had to be transferred from the lorries on to a pontoon which was alongside the jetty. This transfer was effected by a mobile crane belonging to and operated by a crane driver employed by the second defendants. The first defendants had hired the mobile crane from the second defendants. The accident happened in the course of the transfer of one bundle or stack of the timber from a lorry at the jetty on to the pontoon. A bundle or stack fell or slipped off the lorry on to the deceased who was standing at the jetty near the lorry.
The method used to transfer the timber from a lorry to the pontoon was as follows. A lorry loaded with timber on arrival at the jetty would park with the rear end facing the pontoon which was alongside the jetty. The mobile truck crane would then be parked alongside the lorry with its rear end also facing the pontoon. Three of the first defendants` labourers were assigned the task of having the timber removed from the lorry by the crane. On the pontoon four of the first defendants` labourers attended to the unloading and stacking of the timber on the pontoon. The deceased, Ali and another were working on the shore end. The deceased was on the jetty beside the lorry whilst Ali and the other labourer were on the lorry. First, a long single strand wire sling was passed and fastened round one end of a bundle of the timber and then attached to the hook of the crane. The crane would then lift the slung end six to eight inches high to enable a so called `wedge`, described as a large square piece of wood, to be inserted beneath the middle portion of the bundle. After the wedge had been inserted in place the raised end of the bundle was lowered until it rested on the wedge. Next, another sling was similarly passed and fastened round the other end of the bundle of timber and after this had been done the crane would raise the bundle and swing it to the pontoon where it was unloaded. At times, however, two wedges were inserted under a bundle of timber, one on each end of it. The decision whether to insert one or two wedges rested with the labourers working on the lorry.
During the trial the judge heard three conflicting versions as to the method actually used to transfer the bundle of timber which fell on the deceased. Ali, the servant of the first defendants, gave this version. He had fastened a sling round one end of that bundle, a wedge had been placed under the bundle, the second sling had been fastened round the other end by him and he was about to attach the second sling to the hook of the crane. Then, as the hook was being lowered to enable him to reach it to attach the second sling to it, the bundle slipped. He was then standing on the bundle of timber. On this occasion he had decided to use one wedge instead of two.
The crane driver, the servant of the second defendants, gave a different version. He said that a sling having been fastened round one end of the bundle and a wedge inserted he lowered the bundle for it to rest on the wedge. Then, the same sling was shifted inwards and he was asked to and he raised the bundle and a second wedge was inserted. He was then asked to lower the bundle which he did and the bundle rested on the second wedge but before it could rest on the first wedge the bundle `at the second wedge end slipped from their resting place and fell off` the lorry. This version was not challenged by counsel for the first defendants or by counsel for the plaintiffs.
A third version was given by Loh Niap Kek, who was employed by the first defendants and who said he supervised the loading of all the timber from the lorry to the pontoon. The trial judge rejected this version as he considered Loh Niap Kek an untruthful witness.
The trial judge accepted Ali`s version because he was of the opinion that Ali was speaking the truth and because, furthermore, Ali`s version was substantially supported by the crane driver. The trial judge also found that `no one could explain how or why the timber slipped out of the loop and fell on the deceased` and that the timber could not have slipped out of the sling in the absence of negligence on the part of one or other of the two persons directly concerned with the transfer of the timber from the lorry to the pontoon. He held that either Ali did not place the sling round the timber securely and was negligent or the crane driver mishandled the load in question and it could also be that both of them were negligent.
The trial judge held that as the plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of negligence `both defendants were under a duty to give a satisfactory or at least a reasonable explanation` and as they had failed to do so and had no explanation at all they `were in law equally responsible for the accident`. He gave judgment for the plaintiffs against both defendants for $15,302 and costs.
The first defendants now appeal naming the plaintiffs and the second defendants as respondents. They contend that the trial judge erred in law in holding that in the absence of a reasonable explanation as to the cause of the accident both defendants were equally responsible for the accident. They contend that the true principle is that all they were required to do was to satisfy the court that there was no negligence on the part of their own servant, Ali, or give an explanation negating negligence on the part of Ali.
In our opinion Ali`s evidence fell far short of establishing that the timber slipped from the lorry through no negligent act or omission on his part. He did not give evidence that the two slings which he said he had `looped` around the two ends of the bundle of timber had been so `looped` that they had securely fastened the bundle of timber so as to ensure that the bundle would not slip when it was in a raised position and not resting on the wedge placed underneath it. All Ali said was that he had `fastened the first sling at one end` and `was about to fasten the other sling when the timber in the sling began to slide down. I do not know why.` In our opinion it is clear also that Ali`s evidence did not amount to any explanation as `to how or why the timber slipped out of the loop` and furthermore his evidence did not amount to negating negligence on his part.
The second defendants in their respondents` notice contend that the decision of the trial judge should be varied or reversed in so far as they are held to have been equally to blame with the first defendants for the death of the deceased. They contend that the blame and liability for the accident ought to be ascribed wholly to the negligence of the first defendants and their servants and that the crane driver had given an explanation which negates negligence on his part. With regard to the contention that Ali was solely to blame for the accident it is submitted that Ali`s evidence established that Ali was negligent in that he had failed to secure the timber with the sling and that this was the cause of the timber slipping out of the sling. It is also contended that the evidence of the crane driver is sufficient to establish either that he was in no way negligent or that he had given an explanation which negates negligence on his part.
However, although Ali`s evidence failed to establish that he was not negligent, it contained no admission, nor did it establish, that he had failed to properly secure the timber with the sling. In so far as the crane driver`s own evidence is concerned, he said that he lowered the timber which rested on the second wedge but before it could rest on the first wedge `the planks at the second wedge end slipped from their resting point and fell off the lorry. I do not know why the planks slipped when the stack was lowered.` In our judgment that evidence clearly did not explain the cause of the timber slipping and, considered with the rest of his evidence, was insufficient to negate negligence on his part.
In our judgment the evidence at the trial plainly disclosed that the deceased was killed in the course of an operation jointly carried on by the servants of both defendants. Ali and the crane driver both said they did not know why the timber slipped from the sling or slings. It follows that neither of them gave an explanation as to the cause of the accident. We agree with the trial judge`s finding that the accident was undoubtedly due to negligence on the part of Ali and the crane driver or of either of them. On the findings of the trial judge the plaintiffs would have been entitled to succeed against Ali and the crane driver as joint tortfeasors and to have judgment against both defendants who are vicariously liable for the negligence of their servants. As neither Ali nor the crane driver has given a reasonable explanation as to the cause of the accident which negates negligence on his part or has shown that there was no negligence on his part we are of the opinion that the trial judge was entitled to hold both defendants equally responsible in law for the accident.
In the result the appeal of the first defendants is dismissed and the cross-appeal by way of notice of the second defendants to reverse the judgment against them is also dismissed.

On the morning of 1 July 1974 the dead body of a 13-year-old girl, naked below the waist, was found lying face up on the pavement of a Housing and Development Board 12-storey block of flats known as Block 14, Geylang Bahru, Singapore. The autopsy revealed that she had multiple abrasions on the right side of the body, fractures at the angles of the sixth, seventh and eighth right ribs with no extravasation at these fractures, comminuted fractures on the posterior halves of both parietal bones and the superior portion of the occipital bone. The parieto-temporal sutures, the sagittal sutures and the occipito-temporal sutures were widely separated. The fractured lines continued into the base of the skull. The autopsy also showed that she had petechiae or haemorrhagic spots on the face, inside the mouth at the throat and on the upper part of the neck with frothy mucous at the nostrils and the respiratory tract. At the middle portion of the neck there was a very pale area in contrast to the haemorrhagic areas on the upper part of the neck.
The pathologist who performed the autopsy certified strangulation as the cause of her death. He gave evidence at the trial of the appellant who was charged with her murder. He said he went to the scene and examined the body of the deceased. He found all the joints were stiff, the face and upper part of the neck showed haemorrhagic spots, heavily blood-stained frothy fluid in the nostrils and at the mouth. He checked her external genitalia and found no injuries but nevertheless he took smears from the area between the vagina and the anus and from the vagina behind the hymen. The next day he performed an autopsy on her. In his evidence he expressed the opinion that she had been manually strangulated and that the fractures of the skull and the ribs were postmortem fractures and were consistent with injuries sustained as a result of a fall from some height. He said he examined the smears taken from the vagina and found several sperms which indicated that a male organ had come into contact with the vagina and had emitted seminal fluid.
No one saw how the deceased came to be in the position she was when she was seen on the pavement of Block 14 and no one saw what caused the injuries as earlier described. Nonetheless the uncontradicted medical evidence established beyond doubt that she had been sexually assaulted by a male person and manually strangulated before she was thrown from `some height` by the same male person and that she was thrown from one of the Block 14 flats which overlooked the pavement where she lay dead. The multiple abrasions on the right side of the body and the fractures of three right ribs were strong evidence that she landed on the right side of her body.
Apart from the medical evidence, the prosecution led evidence, substantially undisputed, which proved the following facts namely:
Block 14, Geylang Bahru is a block of flats built by the Housing and Development Board comprising a ground floor and eleven other floors. On each of the 11 floors there are 28 flats with a common corridor running between two rows of flat, there being 14 flats on each side of this corridor. These flats have a number suffixed with a letter of the alphabet. The flats on the first floor carry the suffix `A`, those on the second floor the suffix `B` and so on until the 12th and top floor where the flats have the suffix `L`.
The deceased girl lived with her mother in Flat 1039-C on the third floor of the block. The appellant lived with his wife on the third floor in Flat 1031-C which is on the same side of the corridor. These two flats are separated from each other by another flat numbered 1035-C and a staircase. Directly opposite the appellant`s flat on the other side of the common corridor is Flat 1029-C in which lived a married woman, Saleha bte Shaik Omar. On the day of the alleged offence, the appellant`s wife was at work in a factory but the appellant, who was unemployed, was at home.
On each floor, two adjoining flats share a common rubbish chute which also serves two corresponding adjoining flats on each of the other floors of the block. Each chute thus serves 11 floors and 22 flats. Rubbish thrown from any of the 22 flats into the common chute which serves them empties into a large rubbish bin situated in a small locked cubicle on the ground floor. Every morning the loaded rubbish bins are removed and replaced by empty ones. Flats bearing the common serial number 1031 share a common rubbish chute with flats bearing the common serial number 1035.
A police photographer who was the first police officer to arrive at the scene saw the body of the girl lying on the pavement in line with the 11 flats bearing the common serial number 1031. He examined the large rubbish bin which served these 11 flats together with the adjoining 11 flats which bear the common serial number 1035, and found inside it a pair of slacks and panties and other articles which the girl was wearing on the morning of her death.
The girl`s body was lying on the pavement almost directly below and with her legs towards the bedroom windows of the 11 flats which had the common serial number 1031. The photographic exhibits, particularly `P1`, also showed that these bedroom windows were adjoining to the 11 bedroom windows of the 11 flats which had the common serial number 1027 with about two feet separating each set of adjoining windows.
Of the 11 flats with the common serial number 1031, four were untenanted on the day the girl died and they were locked and the keys kept by the Housing and Development Board, the owners of Block 14. These four flats are on the first, fourth, sixth and eighth floors. Another flat, No 1031-E on the fifth floor, although let had not yet been occupied by the tenant who was in the process of moving into it. Of the remaining six flats, three of them had permanent grills fixed to their bedroom windows and these three flats were Flats Nos 1031-B, 1031-J and 1031-L on the second, ninth and eleventh floors respectively. The remaining three flats were the appellant`s Flat 1031-C on the third floor, Flat 1031-G on the seventh floor and Flat 1031-K on the tenth floor and the bedroom windows of these three flats had no grills. Flat 1031-G was tenanted by a Mdm Aw Boon Ching. That morning she heard from her seventh floor flat a loud thud and looking out of her bedroom window, she saw on the pavement below, the body of a person lying face up. Flat 1031-K was occupied by a Mohamed Rashid. It was his off-day that morning and he was at home with his wife and sometime past 10.30am on hearing a commotion coming from the ground floor, he looked out of his window and saw a large crowd gathered round the body of a person.
There was no evidence in respect of the occupation on the material day of the 11 flats with the common serial number 1027, the bedroom windows of which adjoined the bedroom windows of the 11 flats with the common serial number 1031 nor was there any evidence that all these bedroom windows had grills to them. However, it is clear from the evidence that the 11 flats with the common serial number 1027 did not share a common rubbish chute with the 11 flats with the common serial number 1031.
At some time past 9am that morning Saleha bte Shaik Omar spoke to the girl who was playing on the landing of the staircase on the third floor. As she was about to enter her flat she also spoke to the appellant, who was at the door of his flat. The appellant at that time was wearing a short sleeved shirt, blue shorts and slippers. Later that morning when she was informed by someone that a person had committed suicide she came out of her flat and again saw the appellant outside his flat dressed in a long sleeved shirt and long trousers. Then she saw some police officers who entered with the appellant into his flat. She followed and looking out of the kitchen window of the appellant`s flat she saw part of a covered body lying on the pavement below. She asked the appellant what had happened and he told her that a girl had been murdered and thrown down. Later after the police had left she again spoke to the appellant in the corridor and was told by him that he knew nothing about the matter as he was having a bath at the time and had gone down to the ground floor when he heard a commotion.
The prosecution attempted to put in evidence a cautioned statement made by the appellant to a police officer at the CID. As the defence objected to its admissibility the trial judges, who were throughout sitting without a jury, proceeded to hear evidence to decide on the question of admissibility. The sole issue as to the admissibility of the cautioned statement was whether or not it was made because of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from the police.
Where evidence is led before a court for it to decide whether or not a cautioned statement or a confession should be admitted as evidence against an accused person, the proceedings during which such evidence is led and heard by the court has invariably been termed `a trial within a trial` by our courts. Furthermore, it has always been the invariable practice during a trial within a trial to lead only such evidence as is material to the issue of admissibility. In the present case the invariable practice was not followed in the case of a witness, Tan Huan Piaw, whom the prosecution called during the trial within a trial. We set out the following extract from the verbatim shorthand notes: 
 
Choor Singh J : ... On the issue of admissibility do you require [Tan Huan Piaw]?
 
 
 
 
DPP : Yes, because of the allegations that have been made. My Learned Friend in the Lower Court has made an allegation of interference by prosecution so I don`t want it to be said that there was a witness whom an allegation had been made against, whom we do not want to call as such. On the admissibility of the cautioned statement, I think even on the evidence as it stands, I am prepared to leave it at that. 
 
Choor Singh J : You must make up your mind whether you want to call him and then complete your case on the issue of admissibility, or you are going to do without him. The decision must be yours. 
 
DPP : My Lord, but I would like to call him so that I can complete my case and there will be no bits and pieces left out. 
 
Choor Singh J : If you would like to call him, the solution would be to adjourn and try and find him. 
 
DPP : My Lord, the witness has just arrived. 
 
Choor Singh J : Very good, let us carry on with him.
  
 
 
In his evidence during the trial within a trial Tan Huan Piaw related a conversation he had with the appellant at the CID on the day when the cautioned statement was made. It is clear beyond doubt that what the appellant said to Tan Huan Piaw was not material on the issue of admissibility of the cautioned statement but it was relevant evidence and prima facie admissible evidence as to the guilt or otherwise of the appellant on the murder charge because during that conversation the appellant is alleged to have admitted to Tan Huan Piaw that he was involved in the death of the girl by throwing her unconscious body, in desperation, through the window.
After hearing Tan Huan Piaw`s evidence and the submissions of counsel on the admissibility issue, the trial judges ruled the cautioned statement to be inadmissible. After the ruling, the DPP, when asked whether he had any other witnesses for the prosecution on the murder charge, indicated that he had none and closed the prosecution`s case against the appellant.
The appellant elected to give evidence in the witness box where he gave a short account of his movements on the morning of the girl`s death. He denied in cross-examination that he had told Saleha he was having a bath when he heard a commotion on the ground floor. He denied he had told Tan Huan Piaw he had thrown the unconscious girl out of the window, claiming that Tan Huan Piaw was his enemy. The trial judges found the appellant guilty of murder. In their grounds of judgment they said Tan Huan Piaw impressed them as a truthful witness and was speaking the truth when he stated that the appellant told him that the appellant had flung the girl through the window. The trial judges described this admission as `the very damaging evidence given by Tan Huan Piaw against the [appellant]`. The trial judges also said they were convinced that the appellant was not speaking the truth and they rejected his claim that he had nothing to do with the death of the girl. However, the trial judges also said that in their judgment, even without the evidence of Tan Huan Piaw, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence which convinced them beyond any reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had strangulated the girl to death and had thrown her out of his bedroom window.
Having regard to the evidence and the defence raised the only disputed issue was whether the appellant was the male person who had murdered this defenceless young girl. It seems to us, if Tan Huan Piaw had testified during the trial proper, and not during the trial within a trial, and if the trial judges did not err in their acceptance of him as a credible witness and of his evidence then the present appeal must fail.
The question is whether the trial judges were correct in taking into account the evidence given by Tan Huan Piaw during the trial within a trial when considering whether or not the appellant was guilty of murder as charged. Our attention has not been drawn and we are not aware of any binding authority on this question. There is no specific provision in the Criminal Procedure Code with regard to the practice and procedure to be adopted when a cautioned statement or a confession is challenged on the ground of inducement, threat or promise made by a person in authority. There are no local or English decisions directly in point but we have been referred to a decision of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, 
 R v Amo & Amuna 
[1963] Papua and New Guinea Law Reports 22 which is relevant.
In 
 R v Amo & Amuna 
 the accused were tried for murder before Mann CJ sitting without a jury. The prosecution sought to put in evidence statements made by them to a police officer and in the course of his written ruling after hearing evidence as to their admissibility he dealt with the question whether in principle such evidence is before the court for all purposes or merely for the purpose of deciding the admissibility or otherwise of the statement or statements. After referring to the judgment of Goddard CJ in 
 R v Reynolds 
[1950] 1 KB 606
 and to 
 R v Smith 
 CLR 629 Mann CJ said at p 27: 
 
Translating these principles to the situation in the Territory where there is no jury. I think that it is not possible to say that certain evidence is before a judge for one purpose and not another. I think that therefore evidence called on a voire direis before the court for all purposes. I had previously thought that the situation could be met in such a case, to this extent, that if a judge came to the conclusion that a confession was not admissible, he could strike out from the record any evidence relating to the confession, including any evidence given as on a voire dire, but it now seems to me that this is not possible, and that it must appear on the record that certain evidence was tendered and rejected, and that the evidence upon which that decision is based must be on the court record and before the court.
 
 
 
It appears to me, therefore, that the expression voire dire has no effect such as has been suggested. The words voire dire appear to have been adopted in practice from the early form of oath administered on these occasions in a wide variety of cases, and the only reason for giving the procedure a name appears to be to signify that the court is embarking on an inquiry, which is not necessarily based on any issue between the parties, and may be of the court`s own motion.
It seems to me that I am not at liberty to depart from the proper course of a trial simply on the ground that the accused may be in a less favourable position if I do not do so.
With respect, we are unable to accept the views expressed by Mann CJ. It seems to us that fairness to the accused, which is a fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice, requires that a trial within a trial ought to be considered a separate or collateral proceeding. In the course of a trial within a trial evidence may be given which would be inadmissible evidence on the charge against the accused but may be relevant on the issue to be decided at the trial within a trial. In such a situation it would be grossly unfair to the accused if the true principle is that evidence called at a trial within a trial is before the court for all purposes.
Conversely, in the course of a trial within a trial evidence may be given which may be relevant and admissible evidence on the charge against the accused but would not be relevant on the issue to be decided at the trial within a trial. In such a situation the accused or his counsel might well decline to challenge such evidence in the justifiable belief that it could not adversely affect the accused on the issue to be decided at the trial within a trial.
We are fortified in the opinion we have just expressed having regard to the evidence given by Tan Huan Piaw at the trial within a trial in the present case, his perfunctory cross-examination by the appellant`s counsel and the reliance by the trial judges of the admission by the appellant to Tan Huan Piaw that he had in a moment of desperation flung the girl out of the window. If Tan Huan Piaw had related this admission as a prosecution witness at the trial proper it would have been highly improbable, having regard to the appellant`s defence, that he would not have been severely cross-examined as to his credibility. The admission was totally irrelevant to the issue which the trial judges had to decide at the trial within a trial.
For all these reasons we were of the opinion at the conclusion of the appeal that the trial was unsatisfactory and that the conviction ought not to be allowed to stand. We ordered a re-trial as we considered that was the proper course to adopt.

The plaintiff and the defendant are companies incorporated in Singapore, the former carrying on business as licenced moneylenders whereas the latter carries on business in banking in Singapore.
On 17 January, 1969 the plaintiff through its managing director, PW1 Ng Chwee Cheng, issued cheque No GLA 109485 chopped `A/c payee only` for $10,000 in favour of Lee Lam as a loan on the security of seven share certificates of the face value of $1,000 each. These, he had ascertained, were really worth around $15,000. There is no dispute that these certificates were subsequently discovered to be forgeries.
Immediately after receiving the cheque, Lee Lam proceeded to the defendant bank accompanied by Aw Yong San (also known as Au Eng San) where the cheque was presented to the bank`s sub-accountant, DW1, Ang Kah Soon, who was in charge of the clearing department. Both Lee Lam and Aw Yong San were total strangers to this officer of the bank. Between them they prevailed on him to have that cheque marked for payment by the paying bank and the sum of $10,000 was credited to the account of Aw Yong San with the defendant bank.
Shortly afterwards $9,800 was cashed by Lee Lam on a cheque issued to him by Aw Yong San on Aw Yong San`s account. Both these gentlemen have disappeared and it is understood that the police are still looking for them. It is noteworthy that Lee Lam had no account with the defendant bank.
The plaintiff accordingly asked for a declaration that there was negligence on the part of the defendant bank in collecting the cheque for its customer, Aw Yong San, and damages for conversion of the cheque or alternatively $10,000 for money had and received.
The sole question for determination is whether the action taken by DW1, Ang Kah Soon, the sub-accountant of the defendant bank, showed negligence on the part of the collecting bank.
The fact are not in dispute and I do not have the slightest doubt that a fraud was committed on the drawer, the plaintiff, by Lee Lam and Aw Yong San. In the first place the fact that nearly the whole of the $10,000 was cashed shortly afterwards and the fact that both these gentlemen have disappeared speak for themselves. It is perhaps unfortunate that DW1, Ang Kah Soon, allowed himself to become involved in cashing the said cheque in this extraordinary manner. As he himself admitted, this was the first time in his career of ten years with the defendant bank that he had ever done this kind of thing, ienegotiating an `A/c payee only` cheque for a payee who had no account with his bank.
Counsel for the defendant submitted that the defendant bank owed no duty of care to the plaintiff at all, the only duty of care owed being to Lee Lam and nobody else as he was the true owner. I am unable to accept this proposition. Lee Lam did not have an account with the defendant bank. He was not their customer, he was a complete stranger. Their customer was Aw Yong San, who was neither the payee nor the true owner.
I accepted the submissions on the law by counsel for the plaintiff and rejected those by counsel for the defendant. The authorities cited by counsel for the defendant appeared to me to be irrelevant and I considered that s 4 of the Cheques Act had no relevance at all. Quite apart from any consideration of the fraud allegedly committed by Lee Lam and Aw Yong San on the plaintiff and the extent to which the collecting bank should have been on guard against any such fraud, it seems quite clear from the following passage in 
 Paget`s Law of Banking 
 (7th Ed) at pp 395-396 that the law is against the defendant. According to the passage under reference under the head `Account Payee` 
 Paget 
 says: 
 
Conclusive evidence of negligence in the collecting banker is to take a cheque crossed with the words `account payee`, or `account so and so`, for an account other than that indicated. This has even been held to apply where the cheque was payable to a specified payee or bearer. The only exception hitherto recognized is where the customer was a foreign bank, and `account payee` or even, as in the 
 Importers Co
case, `account payee only`, referred to the foreign bank`s customer, as to whom it was obviously impossible for the English bank to know or find out anything. It is difficult to write with reticence about this unauthorised addition to cheques. As shown before, these words have no effect in limiting the transferability or full negotiability of an order or bearer cheque. It has hardly even been suggested that they have. If put on by anyone except the drawer they cannot be treated as any part of his mandate, because there is no statutory enactment enabling the holder to exercise deputed power in this respect, as there is in the case of a regular crossing or the words `not negotiable` added to one. Besides, the mandate, direct or imputed, is only efficacious as between the drawer and his own, that is, the paying banker. The effect accorded them as against the collecting banker cannot be ascribed to the non-contractual care for the true owner`s interests, because they have no statutory sanction and connote no commensurate protection. Were the matter one of first impression, it might well be argued that any banker, being confronted with an absolutely contradictory and ambiguous document, one which on the face of it purports to be payable to order or bearer and at the same time indicates that it and its proceeds are to be devoted to a specified individual, was entitled to regard it in its true legal aspect, namely, as a negotiable instrument available in anyone`s hands, on which the super-added words were purely nu gatory; and that, acting on this legitimate construction, he could not be taxed with negligence. Reasonable as this view is, it cannot be accepted. The practice has been tolerated so long and recognised to such an extent both by judges and bankers, that it would be absolutely hopeless for any collecting banker to set up that these words conveyed no meaning to him or that he was justified in ignoring their existence on a crossed cheque ...
 
 
 
I accept the proposition set out in the cases cited by 
 Paget 
on pp 395/396 et seq.In particular, counsel for the plaintiff cited the case of 
 House Property Co of London Ltd v London County and Westminster Bank 
(1915) 84 LJKB 1846. Although counsel for the defendant submitted that a crossed cheque of this kind was nevertheless negotiable that does not conclude the matter even if she was right. In the light of the passage to which I have already referred and the cases cited by 
 Paget, 
including the 
 House Property Co of London Ltd 
case, I also considered the Malayan cases dealing with `Account payee only` cheques and I found nothing in them which supported the defendant. I also considered the cases which deal with the standard of experience and care which can be expected of employees of a bank such as DW1 Ang Kah Soon. This officer has been with the defendant bank for ten years. He is a sub-accountant in charge of the clearing department. There was no question of his not being possessed of that degree of intelligence and knowledge required of a person in his position to fit him for the discharge of his duties nor can it be said that the pressure of business was such that what he did in relation to this cheque was an oversight or a slight slip. He acted with deliberation and went out of his way to oblige two total strangers in circumstances when it must have been quite clear to him that he and the bank were on peril when asked to act as collectors of the cheque.
I also considered whether there is any substance in the arguments put forward by counsel for the defendant to the effect that s 4 of Cheques Act or its equivalent is of assistance to the defendant bank. I was completely satisfied that any argument based on such a proposition was irrelevant if not absurd. In my view the true owner of the cheque all along was the plaintiff. Lee Lam never became the true owner by virtue of the fact that he was responsible for the fraud on the plaintiff. He was not the guileless holder in due course nor for that matter was Aw Yong San. In my judgment the defendant bank had not discharged its onus of showing lack of negligence.
In conclusion this was a clear case for the plaintiff and I delivered judgment accordingly with costs.
 From the above judgment the defendant bank appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
 Wee Chong Jin CJ: 
If necessary we will give our full reasons for allowing the appeal but as I said on the authority cited to us at page 334 of 
 Paget 
 the respondent had no title to sue under the common law in conversion. On his alternative cause of action that the bank, although it acted in good faith, had acted not without negligence and therefore was liable to the respondent who claimed as true owner, on the facts it is clear beyond doubt and unfortunately the trial judge did not consider that aspect of the case at all, that the bank had not acted in any way which could be said to be not without negligence that is to say the bank made all the enquiries which any bank could be reasonably expected to make and that being so the alternative cause of action must also fail. We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial judge and dismiss the plaintiff`s claim with costs here and in the court below.

The first appellant, Kee Ah Tee alias Tan Chooi Watt, and the second appellant, Liew Kim Siong, were tried before the High Court on the following two charges: 
 
That you, 1. Kee Ah Tee @ Tan Chooi Watt 2. Liew Kim Siong on or about 15 June 1969 at about 3.15pm at No 20, Upper Bukit Timah Road, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed murder by causing the death of one Kan Sze-hing (f), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code read with s 34 of the said Code (Cap 119).
 
 
 
2. You, 1. Kee Ah Tee @ Tan Chooi Watt
2. Liew Kim Siong
are charged that you, on or about 15 June 1969 at about 3.15pm at No 20, Upper Bukit Timah Road, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed murder by causing the death of one Leung Fung (m), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code read with s 34 of the said Code (Cap 119).
As the offence of murder is punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code with death, the appellants were tried by a court consisting of two judges of the High Court in accordance with the provisions of s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code. At the conclusion of the trial the court found both appellants guilty on both charges and imposed the mandatory death sentence on them. They now appeal against their convictions and sentences.
The facts of the case are these. At about 3.15pm on 15 June 1969 a female student Goh Bee Wang, who lived next door to the Singapore Feather Works Factory heard voices of a man and a woman. She recognised the voice of the woman as someone she knew and addressed as Ah Soh. Ah Soh is Kan Sze-Hing (f) the woman whose death is the subject matter of the first charge. Ah Soh was shouting for help and then she heard Ah Soh knocking at her door. She was frightened and peeped through a window of her house and saw Ah Soh outside by the door bleeding from her chest and hands. She saw Ah Soh (hereinafter referred to as `the female deceased`) collapse and she thereupon ran out from her house by another door and telephoned the police.
The Singapore Feather Works Factory makes ducks feathers into garments and blankets and appears to have been operated by Leung Fung (hereinafter referred to as `the male deceased`), the person whose death is the subject matter of the second charge, with the help of three employees, one of whom was the female deceased and another of whom was one Kan Shing, the brother of the female deceased. Kan Shing arrived at the feathers factory on the day in question at about 3.45pm and saw blood in front of the door of the factory, went inside and then went to the next door house where he saw the female deceased, his sister, lying on the ground face upwards, bleeding and motionless outside the front door of that house. He then carried her to an ambulance which had arrived at the factory at the same time as him. The female deceased, the male deceased and Kan Shing all lived at the factory premises.
Kan Shing had since 1963 been working in this factory which gets its supplies of feathers from four or five persons who went there regularly to sell feathers. When purchases were made the male deceased, if he was at the factory, would pay for them and, if he was not in, Kan Shing would make payment with cash which the male deceased would leave with him. One such regular supplier of feathers was a person whom Kan Shing first came to know in April 1969 as Ah Choon, who used to come to the factory about once in eight to ten days.
The police also arrived at the scene at the same time as the ambulance and Kan Shing. Abdul Aziz bin Baba, a police sergeant, saw the male deceased lying motionless on his back a short distance from the feathers factory. This police officer saw a blood stained shirt at a spot a short distance from where the body of the male deceased was. A short while later a police inspector, Mr Pereira, arrived and his attention was drawn to this shirt by the police sergeant. He then saw the body of the male deceased and proceeded from there to the feathers factory, entered it and saw a blood stained knife by the door. He then went to the next door premises and noticed some blood stains at the door in front of which the female student had seen the female deceased. He then went back to the feathers factory and outside the cement compound of the factory he followed a blood trail which led him back to the body of the male deceased. He examined the body and found it had four stab wounds on the chest and one on the back of the left shoulder. After this he went to the spot where the blood stained shirt was and took possession of it. It was a cream coloured shirt with long sleeves and with blood stains on it and its sleeves were turned inside out. A few of the buttons were missing and there were slight tears where the buttons were missing. From the breast pocket of the shirt, he recovered a laundry receipt from Southern Launderers, Dry Cleaners and Dyers.
This laundry receipt was issued by the owner of Southern Launderers, Dry Cleaners and Dyers in respect of a Dacron silver coloured shirt and a handkerchief handed in by a customer for cleaning. These two articles were still in his shop when the first appellant came on the morning of 16 June 1969 into the shop and told the owner he had lost his laundry chit. On being asked by the owner to identify from a showcase the articles he had handed in for cleaning, he pointed to the Dacron silver coloured shirt and just as he was writing his name and address to acknowledge receiving back the shirt he was arrested by the police who also impounded the shirt and handkerchief.
On the same afternoon the first appellant led the police to the general scene of the crime and pointed to a spot near where the police after a search found a knife. The blade of this knife had been filed on both the sharp cutting side as well as the blunt side so that it had jagged edges.
At or about the time when the murders were committed a labourer, Kathamuthu, was engaged in taking out mud from and cleaning a drain near the scene of the crime. When he was resting momentarily while doing this work he saw two male Chinese walking very fast one behind the other. He noticed the person at the rear was wearing a yellow long sleeved shirt and a pair of black shorts and saw him taking off his shirt and throwing it to his right. After they had gone he walked to the place where the shirt was lying, lifted it up with a stick, and noticed it had blood on it. He then placed the shirt back and walked in the general direction of the feather works factory and while walking he saw the male deceased whom he recognised as a man working in this factory. The male deceased was lying on the ground on his back and trembling. He then walked towards the house adjacent to this factory, the house of the female student and on the way he picked up a note book and a ball point pen which were lying on the grass. He placed them at the altar of a shrine nearby and proceeded towards the house he was going to. At the door of this house, which was the home of a clerk who had instructed him to clean the drain he was cleaning, he saw the female deceased whom he knew as a person working in the same factory as the male deceased. On seeing her he felt frightened and nervous and retraced his steps and came across many people who were workers of a rubber factory near the scene of the crime. Soon after that the police arrived at the scene. Two days later he asked someone to telephone the police and as a result a police inspector came and he handed the note book he had placed on the shrine to this police inspector. This note book was a 1967 pocket diary and in it appeared the name `Kee Ah Tee` written in English and in two pages of it a number `S71-07598`.
The first appellant was issued with an identity card on 2 November 1961 bearing the number S7l-07598. This identity card was subsequently replaced by another one issued to the first appellant on 28 February 1969.
The blood stains on the yellow coloured long sleeved shirt seen by the labourer, Kathamuthu and taken possession of by Inspector Pereira were, on examination by a chemist, found to be stained with human blood of the `A` group. The two knives, one found in the feathers factory and the other found by the police were on examination by the same chemist found to be stained with human blood but the stains were insufficient to enable a conclusive determination of the blood group to which they belonged. The blood of both deceased was found to belong to the `A` group.
Three days after the commission of the crime the second appellant was examined by a Dr Kuldip Singh Wasan and found to have three minor injuries on his right hand. The first was a superficial incised wound one inch long just over the distal crease of the right index finger. The second was a linear abrasion three-quarter inch long over the right middle finger and the third was a linear abrasion one-quarter inch long over the right ring finger. These injuries could have been caused by any sharp edged object and appeared to have been caused recently but were not less than 24 hours old.
Autopsies were performed on the bodies of both deceased persons. The male deceased had four stab wounds on the front of the chest and two on the back of the chest. The fatal wound was an `L` shaped gaping wound about three cm long which had penetrated to a depth of over nine cm and had gone through the apex of the heart. All the wounds could have been caused by a single bladed weapon with a single cutting edge. The fatal `L` shaped wound had been caused by a twisting action of the blade, with the sharp edge of the blade as the pivoting axis, after the blade had penetrated into the body. This wound was consistent with it having been caused by the knife which the police recovered as a result of being led to the place of its recovery by the first appellant.
The female deceased had three stab wounds on the front of the chest and two other stab wounds on the left side. The fatal wound was the lowest of the three chest wounds and was 1.5 cm long and had penetrated to a depth of 10cm entering the heart and also cutting into the liver. All these wounds could have been caused by a single blade weapon with one sharp edge and the other a blunt edge such as a knife similar to the one found by the door of the factory.
The first appellant was arrested on the morning following the commission of the crimes in circumstances we have earlier set out. The second appellant was arrested three days after the commission of the crimes in the early hours of 18 June 1969. He had on the evening of the crimes told one Goh Kee Sun with whom he shared a flat in Tiong Bahru, that he had stabbed a woman and that he had sustained a cut.
All these facts were led in evidence by the prosecution at the trial. The prosecution also called as a witness one Chan Ah Lay also known as Ah Choon who was identified by Kan Shing as the person he knew as Ah Choon, a supplier of feathers to the factory. Ah Choon gave evidence that for about three months prior to 15 June 1969 he had regularly visited the factory and sold ducks` feathers to the male deceased who paid him in cash from a wallet he carried on his person. He noticed this wallet invariably contained `several hundreds of dollars`. He came to know the first appellant about ten days before 15 June 1969.
Ah Choon`s house was near a construction site where the first appellant worked and on his way to and from his house he had to pass this construction site and so came to know the first appellant and to meet him casually and over coffee at a work site coffee stall which they both frequented. In the course of one of these conversations the first appellant asked Ah Choon whether there was any opportunity to commit robbery at the feathers factory to which Ah Choon replied affirmatively. Two days before 15 June 1969 the first appellant again raised the subject of robbing the factory and suggested getting a third person to join in the venture. That evening at another coffee stall at Bukit Ho Swee, which is near Tiong Bahru, which he also frequented he met the second appellant whom he knew by the name, Ah Seow. While they were conversing, the first appellant joined them and he introduced the appellants to each other, introducing the first appellant as `Botak` and the second appellant as `Ah Seow`. During the conversation the first appellant asked the second appellant if he would like to join in robbing the feathers factory and the second appellant agreed.
Two days later, at about noon on 15 June 1969 Ah Choon met the first appellant at the work site coffee stall and the latter suggested committing the robbery that same afternoon. At 1pm they met the second appellant at the Bukit Ho Swee coffee stall and all agreed to carry out the robbery that afternoon. The first appellant then left saying he had to get some knives and subsequently rejoined them and all three proceeded to the 7 ms Bukit Timah Road - off which is the feathers factory. Ah Choon remained by the side of the road near a bus stop and the other two crossed the road and entered a side road which led to the feathers factory. About half an hour later Ah Choon saw the other two running out to the main road. The first appellant was then clad only in a singlet. They turned left on reaching the main road and waved to Ah Choon to follow which he did and eventually caught up with them.
When they reached a road circus they obtained a lift from a passing lorry and while they were seated at the rear of this lorry the first appellant told Ah Choon that he had stabbed a male person and the second appellant said he had stabbed a female and had received a cut. At Havelock Road they dispersed. Of this witness Ah Choon the trial judges` assessment can best be described in their own words which read: 
 
We formed the opinion that he was clearly playing down the role he took in the planning and preparation for this robbery in question.
 
 
 
This witness is clearly an accomplice and we were not prepared to act on any portion of his evidence unless amply corroborated.
The prosecution also tendered in evidence four statements made by the appellants after their arrest. Two of them were statements made, one by each appellant, and recorded by magistrates under the provisions of s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The other two statements were made by the appellants during the course of police investigation and were made to a police inspector and which statements are prima facieadmissible in evidence under the provisions of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
At the trial both appellants raised strenuous objections to the admission of all the four statements in evidence relying principally on the proviso to s 121(5) and Sch E of the Criminal Procedure Code. Accordingly the trial court conducted a `trial within a trial` to determine their admissibility and after a hearing which lasted several days the court decided to admit in evidence all the four statements. At this juncture we do not propose to consider the contents of these four statements for reasons which will become apparent hereinafter.
The first appellant gave evidence at the trial. He admitted being a labourer working and living at the site of his work at Silat Road and that he came to know Ah Choon a few weeks before 15 June 1969 in the circumstances as stated by Ah Choon. While denying that he initiated the idea of committing robbery, he admitted agreeing to accompany Ah Choon to rob the feathers factory but only on the condition that he would stand guard outside. He also admitted that at a coffee stall along Jalan Bukit Ho Swee Ah Choon introduced the second appellant to him as `Ah Seow` and that he was introduced to the second appellant as `Botak`. He also agreed that the second appellant be asked to join in the proposed robbery, but his version was that the second appellant was told by Ah Choon to play the part of guard only. Again he admitted meeting Ah Choon at noon on 15 June 1969 at the work site coffee stall, but said that at the meeting Ah Choon had a parcel, cylindrical in shape with him and told him they could rob the factory that afternoon. He asked Ah Choon if only the two of them were going to which Ah Choon replied that they would go and look for the second appellant as well. He admitted they then went to the Bukit Ho Swee coffee stall and there met the second appellant who was asked by Ah Choon to join them in robbing the factory that afternoon to which the second appellant agreed. He said that the second appellant asked Ah Choon what the cylindrical parcel contained and was told it contained knives as it was necessary to be armed with knives to achieve their object.
According to the first appellant when they arrived at 7 ms Bukit Timah Road, all three of them crossed the main road with Ah Choon leading the way into the side road past a rubber factory until at a quiet spot near the feathers factory Ah Choon unwrapped the paper parcel and took from it two knives, one of which he first offered to the second appellant and on the second appellant refusing to take it, then to him which he also refused to accept telling Ah Choon he had come only to stand guard. When both appellants refused the knives, Ah Choon tucked both underneath his shirt and then took out a handkerchief and tied it over his face below his eyes as a sort of mask. Then Ah Choon led them to a place near the door of the feathers factory and told them to stand guard there and he saw Ah Choon enter the factory. After some time, as Ah Choon had not come back he went towards the door of the factory to find out why Ah Choon had taken so long to come out. It was quiet and as he came near the door he looked into the factory and just then a male Chinese rushed out and placed his hands on his (first appellant`s) shoulders. As this person was about to fall he stretched out his hands to support him but on seeing blood on this person he pushed him away. He noticed blood on his own hands and on his own shirt and turned and ran, rubbing his stained hands on his shirt, towards where the second appellant was still waiting. While doing so he heard a female voice shouting in Cantonese `save life, save life`. Then both he and the second appellant ran away. As they were running they saw Ah Choon holding a knife running towards and past them and he and the second appellant followed behind Ah Choon. He saw Ah Choon throwing away the knife and on seeing this he also threw away his shirt because it was stained with blood.
They ran on to the main road and eventually Ah Choon stopped a lorry and the three of them sat in the rear of the lorry. Nothing was said in the lorry except by Ah Choon who asked him why he was without his shirt and he told Ah Choon why. When they changed from the lorry into a taxi Ah Choon told him not to talk about the robbery as his shirt would incriminate him. He admitted the cream coloured shirt found near the scene was his and that the 1967 pocket diary and ball point pen were also his and also that he was arrested at the laundry shop.
The second appellant also gave evidence at the trial. He admitted living in the same flat as Goh Kee Sun and said that a week before 15 June 1969 he had refused Goh Kee Sun a loan. He also admitted knowing Ah Choon who was a friend of Goh Kee Sun. He said he had a few chance meetings with Ah Choon at the Bukit Ho Swee coffee stall and that on 13 June 1969 at that coffee stall Ah Choon introduced the first appellant to him as `Botak` and him to the first appellant as `Ah Seow`. It was at that meeting that Ah Choon asked if he wanted to join in the robbery. Two days later, on 15 June 1969, at some time past 1pm he next met Ah Choon and the first appellant at the same coffee stall and agreed to join them in a robbery. They went in a taxi and got off at Bukit Timah Road near a petrol station, where Ah Choon led them across the road into a place where there was a big factory. They walked past it and at a spot near the feathers factory Ah Choon unwrapped a parcel and he saw two knives. He and the first appellant refused Ah Choon`s offer of one of the knives and then Ah Choon masked his face with a handkerchief, tucked the knives at his waist and they walked to a place near the feathers factory where Ah Choon told them to keep a look out for anyone coming there. He saw Ah Choon entering the factory and a short while later the first appellant walked towards the door of the factory. A male Chinese rushed out of the door and as this man was about to fall the first appellant stretched out his hands to support him and then pushed him away and then ran back to where he, the second appellant, was. At that moment he also heard a woman`s voice calling `save life, save life`. Both appellants then ran away and as they were running he noticed the front of the first appellant`s shirt was stained with blood. He also saw Ah Choon running out of the factory holding a knife in his hand and they ran behind Ah Choon. As they were running he saw the first appellant throwing away h is shirt. They eventually obtained a lift from a lorry and while in the lorry Ah Choon asked the first appellant what had happened to his shirt and the first appellant explained how a person had rushed out of the factory and while about to fall had been assisted by the first appellant who got his shirt stained with blood in so doing. Because of the blood stains the first appellant told Ah Choon that he threw his shirt away.
The second appellant denied he had told Goh Kee Sun on the evening of 15 June 1969 that he had stabbed a female and had sustained a cut. He said that he had received the cut on his fingers accidentally on 14 June 1969 when he put his hand into his tool bag to take out a tool while working.
The trial judges rejected the evidence of both appellants that they were merely standing guard while Ah Choon entered the factory building as untruthful. They also rejected as untruthful the account of the first appellant as to how his shirt had blood stains on it and his reason for throwing his shirt away and they also rejected as untruthful the account of the second appellant as to how the first appellant`s shirt came to be stained with blood. They found as a fact that the knife with the jagged sides which was discovered by the police caused the fatal `L` shaped wound on the male deceased. They also found as a fact that the appellants entered the factory building, each armed with a knife and that each of them also knew the other was so armed. They were further satisfied that the appellants entered the building with the common intention to commit robbery and in case of resistance, to use the knife each carried to inflict such bodily injury on any person offering resistance as would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death having regard to the character of the assault on both the deceased victims as revealed by the stab wounds inflicted on them.
These findings and conclusions of the trial judges were arrived at by them without, as they stated in their grounds of decision, taking into consideration the four statements made by the appellants which we have earlier alluded to and the evidence of Goh Kee Sun.
Before we deal with the grounds of appeal argued before us on behalf of the appellants, we would make some observations on the evidence. It was never in dispute that the appellants and Ah Choon had gone to the general area where the feathers factory was situate with the intention of robbing the inmates of the factory and that they collectively had two knives in their possession and that each of them knew they had two knives with them. It was also never in dispute that all of them knew it was necessary to be armed with the knives in order to achieve their planned object. Both appellants admitted in evidence that they were no more than a few steps away from the door of the factory. The yellow or cream coloured long sleeved shirt found near the scene and covered with blood stains of the same blood group as the deceased victims was conclusively proved to have been worn that afternoon by the first appellant, and indeed he himself said so in evidence. The second appellant when examined by a doctor three days later was found to have a superficial one inch long incised wound, recently caused but not earlier than 24 hours before examination, just over the distal crease of the right index finger. The crux of the case was whether the appellants` evidence that they waited near the door of the factory building whilst Ah Choon alone entered the factory building armed with two knives tucked under his shirt was true.
The trial judges disbelieved both of them. They disbelieved the first appellant because he had blood stains on his shirt and because they rejected his explanation as to how the blood stains got on to his shirt. They disbelieved the second appellant because of the recently caused cuts on his right fingers and because they rejected his explanation as to how they were caused. They rejected the identical versions given by the appellants that neither of them entered the building. They also found that the injuries on the deceased victims could not have been caused by only one assailant armed with two knives.
In our judgment there was ample and cogent evidence to support the conviction of both appellants of the two charges of murder. It was argued on behalf of the second appellant that the trial judges failed to clearly warn themselves of the danger of acting on the evidence of the accomplice, Ah Choon, without corroboration and that they did not have in their minds the risk of acting on the accomplice`s evidence without corroboration unless convinced of the truth of the accomplice`s evidence. In our opinion this argument is without any substance. Without the accomplice`s evidence there was sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence for the trial judges to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the two deceased victims was caused by the acts of the appellants in circumstances which amount to murder read with s 34 of the Penal Code. By their own admissions they were at the scene of the killings; they had gone there to commit robbery together with Ah Choon; they knew two knives were carried; they knew that these knives were necessary to carry out their planned object. Two persons were seen running from the scene of the killings and one of whom, having regard to the evidence of the discarding of the blood stained shirt was the first appellant and these facts were also admitted by them. The second appellant had a recently caused incised cut on his right index finger. The injuries on the victims were caused by two knives and could not all have been inflicted by one assailant only. The first appellant led the police to the place where the knife with the jagged sides was found and the fatal wound on the body of the male deceased was consistent with it having been caused by this knife.
We have already set out the passage in the trial judges` grounds of decision where they clearly indicated that they would not act on any portion of Ah Choon`s testimony unless amply corroborated. The law as regards corroboration is well settled since 
 R v Baskerville 
[1916] 2 KB 658h. At p 667 Lord Reading CJ who delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
 
We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. ... corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the accused.
 
 
 
The corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
There was clearly more than sufficient independent evidence connecting each of the appellants with the two killings and implicating each of them and which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crimes have been committed but also that the appellants committed them.
It was also argued on behalf of the second appellant that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal acts which resulted in the deaths of the two deceased persons were committed by him and the first appellant in furtherance of a pre-arranged plan to carry out those criminal acts. In our opinion this ground is also without substance. There were two of three persons who set out that afternoon to commit robbery at the feathers factory armed with two knives knowing it was necessary to be so armed to carry out their planned object. The trial judges found on the evidence that they entered the factory building each armed with a knife. These facts coupled with the number and extent of the injuries which were inflicted on the two victims by two knives constituted in our view sufficient evidence on which the trial judges could properly find, as they did, that the appellants entered the factory building with the common intention to rob and with the common intention to use the knife each of them carried, if necessary, to inflict such bodily injury on any person offering resistance as would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
Having regard to the views we have expressed, we propose to deal very briefly with the submissions on behalf of both appellants that the statements made by them to the police and before two magistrates should not have been admitted in evidence by the trial judges. The substance of the arguments on behalf of both appellants was that having regard to the evidence before the trial judges at the trial within a trial they ought to have refused to admit these statements in evidence on the grounds set out in the proviso to s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads thus: 
 
Provided that the court may in its discretion refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid -
 
 
 
(a) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him; or
(b) in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the rules set out in Sch E to this Code.
 
 
 
We are not persuaded that the trial judges on the evidence before them exercised their discretion wrongfully or in any manner which was contrary to law. The issue as to admissibility was fully canvassed before them at the trial within a trial which lasted several days. In those circumstances, this court as an appellate tribunal, not having the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses called to testify on this issue, is precluded from interfering with the trial court`s exercise of its discretionary powers, unless convinced that there was no proper or sufficient evidence to support the trial court`s decision or unless it is satisfied that the trial court acted on wrong principles.
Accordingly, the appeals of both appellants are dismissed.

s 10 Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed)
 
It seems to us absolutely clear that s 10 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act has not been complied with at the trial of this appellant because s 10 requires every proceeding in the High Court to be heard and disposed of by a single judge save as otherwise provided by any written law. Now in the case of a charge under s 324 or s 326 of the Penal Code the requirements of s 10 must be followed unless, of course, there is a written provision in the Criminal Procedure Code providing that the offence can be tried and disposed of before the High Court comprising of two judges. There is no such written provision in the Criminal Procedure Code.
The effect, therefore, of this appellant being tried at one trial in respect of the two charges, one of murder and the other under s 324 before a court of two judges is that the whole trial, the whole proceeding, is a nullity and as such then we must set aside the convictions and sentences in respect of both charges and order a re-trial. The appellant is to be tried at separate trials in respect of the two charges which were before the court below and we think it would be desirable that the trial in respect of the capital charge should be dealt with first. The appellant is remanded in custody until he is brought before the High Court.

This is an appeal against the decision of the learned Chief Justice dismissing a claim brought by the plaintiffs against the defendants in respect of injuries sustained on 17 October 1967 by the first plaintiff who was then a sweeper aged 171/2 employed by the defendants at the rate of $2 per day. In addition to his duties as sweeper he also assisted in the operation of a machine in the factory of the defendants which caused him the injuries to his right hand resulting in the amputation of part of his right forearm which is the subject matter of his claim.
The first plaintiff based his claim in the first instance on negligence at common law. Secondly, he based his claim on breach of statutory duty under s 28 of the Factories Ordinance 1958 (the Ordinance). Thirdly, he claimed that the defendants were in breach of s 21 of the Ordinance which requires every part of the transmission machinery to be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced. Finally, an attempt was made, in the closing stages of the trial, by counsel for the first plaintiff to amend the plaintiffs` pleadings to bring in a claim under s 22 of the Ordinance. This provision is in substantially similar terms to s 21 of the Ordinance except that it deals with dangerous parts of any machinery other than prime movers and transmission machinery.
It may be convenient at this stage to describe the machine and how it operates. We cannot do better than to quote the description of the machine and its operation as contained in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice as follows: 
 
The machine is shown on the photographs which also show the `wood pulp` which is in fact shredded paper or paper sweepings which is fed into the machine to be compressed into a bale of compressed paper. An expert, Mr Loo Ming, who holds the degree of Master of Science in mechanical engineering, a member of the Institute of Engineers, Singapore and an associate member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and is presently a lecturer in the engineering faculty, University of Singapore, prepared a schematic or a diagrammatic representation of the working of this machine. He also gave evidence that essentially the machine consists of three sections, the prime mover, the transmission machinery with its control, and the end device or appliance. The prime mover is the electric motor that supplies the energy. The transmission machinery is the portion that is interphased between the prime mover and the end device and its purpose is to convert energy from one form to a form that is suitable for use at the end device. The end device in the case of this machine is the ram that bales the shredded or loose paper. Pressure is supplied by an electric motor to the hydraulic cylinder which moves the ram backwards or forwards. The hydraulic cylinder is controlled by the direction control valve which controls it forward, backward or stops it. The direction control valve is in turn controlled by a lever. A wall mainline switch controls the electric power to the whole unit and there is a push button switch in the machine which also controls the electric power to the electric motor.
 
 
 
The loose paper is fed into an opening or well in the machine, which opening or well is, according to the expert, part of the end device of this machine. Then the main switch and the motor switch are switched on. The lever which controls the direction control valve is then pulled down and this moves the ram into the well of the machine thereby compressing the loose paper in the well. As a result bits of the loose paper rises and a metal rod is used to press this rising paper down into the well. When the ram has passed a certain part of the whole machine the lever is used to bring the ram backwards to its original position and the whole process, including filling the well with paper, is repeated six or seven times before a bale of compressed paper is produced. The movement of this ram backwards or forwards is comparatively very slow. The evidence is that when there is paper in the well of the machine it moves forward about 11/3 inch per second, taking 15 seconds for it to move across the opening of the well and 13 seconds to come back to its original position.
We agree that the claim based on negligence at common law must fail for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice as follows: 
 
The only possible danger to anyone operating it would be if he places his hand in the well of the machine while the ram is moving forward and leaves the hand in the well when the ram has travelled across the whole length of the well in which event the hand would be jammed between the ram and far wall of the well. This was what happened to the first plaintiff and accepting as I do the foreman`s evidence that he instructed the first plaintiff, first by demonstration and then by supervision, as to how to operate the machine and of the possible danger of using the hand, instead of the metal rod which was provided and used by him during the demonstration, to press down the rising paper into the well when the ram was moving forwards, I find the first plaintiff`s claim at common law must fail.
 
 
 
We also agree that the claim for breach of statutory duty under s 28 must fail for similar reasons as already indicated in the portion cited.
With regard to the claim that the defendants were in breach of s 21 of the Factories Ordinance relating to the safety of transmission machinery, the only acceptable evidence in the whole case was that of one Mr Loo Ming, the expert called by the defendants, who made it quite clear that, essentially, the machine consists of three sections, the prime mover, the transmission machinery with its control and the end device or appliance. In view of his evidence that the part of the machinery involved in this accident was the end device, namely, the ram that bales the shredded or loose paper, it is quite clear that the claim under this head must fail for the simple reason that s 21 relates to transmission machinery and not to the end device or to dangerous parts of any machinery other than prime movers and transmission machinery.
This brings us accordingly to the crucial part of this case. It is true that there was a last minute attempt to amend the plaintiffs` pleadings so as to bring in a claim under s 22. It was after the evidence of Mr Loo Ming, the expert called by the defence, that counsel for the plaintiffs realised, for the first time, that the ram was part of the end device and that it was a part of the machinery in question which was neither a prime mover nor part of the transmission machinery and that s 21 had no application. He accordingly applied to amend the pleadings at that late stage by adding the words `or alternatively of s 22(1)` at the end of para (d) of the particulars. The plaintiffs did not seek to rely on any further evidence and closed their case on the evidence already before the court. The application to amend the statement of claim by adding the reference to s 22 of the Ordinance was resisted by the defendants and the learned Chief Justice was not inclined to accede to it: 
 
first, because it was made at a very late stage of the proceedings and secondly and more importantly because it would deprive the defendants of the opportunity of calling evidence to meet this particular allegation.
 
 
 
However, his Lordship proceeded to state his views on the merits thereof as follows: 
 
In any event as the plaintiffs are relying on the evidence before the court and are not calling further evidence in support of this allegation I would hold that they cannot succeed under s 22(1) on the evidence before me. The submission put forward on behalf of the plaintiffs is, as I understand, that the mouth of the well should have been fitted with a device or guard, namely, a removable lid so that when the ram is in motion, the lid would automatically prevent the operator of the machine from coming into contact with the ram. In my opinion this submission can only succeed if the ram is a dangerous part of the machine within the meaning of s 22(1). It seems to me obvious that the actual well or opening into which the loose paper is fed could in no circumstances be said to be a dangerous part of the machine. It also seems to me obvious that the ram by itself is not a dangerous part of the machine. The question is whether or not the ram becomes a dangerous part of the machine when the machine is in normal operation. I think not because in my opinion the ram does not undoubtedly become dangerous when the machine is in normal operation performing the mechanical work which the machine is specifically designed to achieve. I come to this conclusion adopting the words of Lord Evershed (dealing with a different problem from the present case) in 
 Midland and Low Moor Iron and Steel Co Ltd v Cross
 where he said: `As it seems to me, the question whether it can properly be said that some part of a piece of machinery is dangerous must depend on a consideration whether such danger exists and arises from the normal operation of the machine, that is, from the purposes of the mechanical work which the machine is specifically designed to achieve; and if such a part becomes undoubtedly dangerous from such normal and projected operation, then it follows that such part of the machine is a dangerous part within the meaning of s 14(1).`
 
 
 
At the hearing of the appeal, we decided after hearing both counsel, to allow the amendment by adding, as an alternative, the reference to s 22(1) to the particulars at the end of para (d) thereof.
It will be seen that the learned Chief Justice found in any event, that the first plaintiff could establish no breach of s 22.
Having considered the authorities, we have reached a different conclusion from that of the learned Chief Justice in this respect and we would now set out our reasons for differing from him.
His Lordship decided that the ram does not undoubtedly become dangerous when the machine is in normal operation performing the mechanical work which this machine is specifically designed to achieve. He then went on to adopt the portion of Lord Evershed`s judgment in 
 Midland and Low Moor Iron and Steel Co Ltd v Cross 
 [1964] 3 All ER 752, 756 which we have already quoted.
It seems quite clear to us that the nigger in the woodpile is the word `undoubtedly` in juxtaposition to the word `dangerous` used by Lord Evershed in that part of his judgment cited and, in our opinion, the learned Chief Justice appears to have been misled into considering that part of a piece of machinery must be said to be undoubtedly dangerous before there can be a breach of the statutory duty imposed by s 22(1).
It should be noted that Lord Evershed in the later stages of the same judgment, after stating when machinery can be said to become `undoubtedly dangerous` concludes as follows:
I conclude my judgment by respectfully reciting and adopting the passage from the judgment of the Lord Justice-Clerk (Lord Cooper) in the Scottish case of 
 Mitchell v North British Rubber Co Ltd 
 which my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, cited in his speech in 
 John Summers & Sons Ltd v Frost 
 where your lordships found that there was a duty to fence a grinding wheel in the machine there under consideration. The language of Lord Cooper was as follows: `The test is objective and impersonal. Is the part such in its character, and so circumstanced in its position, exposure, method of operation and the like, that in the ordinary course of human affairs danger may reasonably be anticipated from its use unfenced, not only to the prudent, alert and skilled operative intent upon his task, but also to the careless or inattentive worker whose inadvertent or indolent conduct may expose him to risk of injury or death from the unguarded part?`
The test laid down by Lord Cooper in terms of the language used by him in 
 Mitchell v North British Rubber Co Ltd 
 1945 SC (J) 69 at p 73 is a far cry from the test propounded by Lord Evershed earlier in which he appears to suggest that part of a machine must be said to be undoubtedly dangerous before there can be a breach of s 22(1). The emphasis in 
 Mitchell 
 `s case is on the words: 
 
is the part such in its character, and so circumstanced in its position, exposure, method of operation and the like, that in the ordinary course of human affairs danger may reasonably be anticipated from its use unfenced.
 
 
 
We would emphasize the expression `may reasonably be anticipated from its use unfenced`. Lord Cooper said nothing about the parts having to be undoubtedly dangerous.
In 
 John Summers & Sons Ltd v Frost 
 [1955] 1 All ER 870, Viscount Simonds, in the House of Lords, said the following in relation to secure fencing: 
 
The next question is what is the test or standard of secure fencing. I agree with my learned and noble friend, Lord Reid, that, since the danger to be guarded against is contact with the exposed part of the grindstone while it is in motion, fencing is secure which effectively protects the workman from that danger. By workman in this context I mean not only the actual operator but also any other person employed on the premises. Your Lordships have been referred to a number of formulae and I do not wish to add to their number. It is elementary that it is necessary to consider not only the risk run by a skilled and careful man who never relaxes his vigilance. An observation of Du Parcq J, in 
 Walker v Bletchley Flettons Ltd
 to the effect that a machine is dangerous:
 
 
 
if it is a possible cause of injury to anybody acting in a way in which a human being may be reasonably expected to act in circumstances which may be reasonably expected to occur
has been sometimes mentioned with approval, and I think that it gives as precise a direction as can be hoped for if it is read in conjunction with what the Lord Justice-Clerk (Lord Cooper) said in 
 Mitchell v North British Rubber Co Ltd, 
viz that a machine is dangerous if ...(The portion quoted by Lord Evershed then follows.)
In the same case, ie 
 John Summers and Sons Ltd v Frost, 
Lord Reid had the following observations to make in relation to the same question as to when machinery or parts of machinery can be said to be dangerous. With regard to Du Parcq J`s test he considered that it might be better to say `a reasonably foreseeable cause of injury` in substitution for the expression `a possible cause of injury`. Otherwise his Lordship also approved of the direction given by Du Parcq J as Viscount Simonds himself did.
Lord Reid also cited Lord Cooper`s test with approval.
Whether one adopts the test laid down by Du Parcq J in 
 Walker v Bletchley Flettons Ltd 
 [1937] 1 All ER 175 with the suggested alteration indicated by Lord Reid in the House of Lords or the test laid down by the Lord Justice-Clerk (Lord Cooper) in 
 Mitchell v North British Rubber Co Ltd 
 cited in the same case which was before the House of Lords, it seems to us that there can be little doubt that the part of the machinery in which the first plaintiff`s hand was crushed by the ram in the end device thereof was dangerous without secure fencing. The first plaintiff was not, in our opinion, wilful or deliberately foolhardy in the face of the situation in which he found himself. He acted very much in the manner in which Du Parcq J said: 
 
a human being may be reasonably expected to act in circumstances which may be reasonably expected to occur.
 
 
 
One has to consider not only a prudent, alert and skilled operator intent upon his task, but also the careless or inattentive worker whose inadvertent or indolent conduct may expose him to risk of injury or death from the unguarded part. Finally, in relation to this particular aspect of the matter, we would say that all that Lord Evershed really meant by the use of the word `undoubtedly` immediately preceding the word `dangerous` was to emphasize that the part of the machinery in question should be dangerous within the test which he approved and adopted from Lord Cooper in the case cited.
We now turn to the question of contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff. His counsel conceded that he could not deny contributory negligence on his part and that he was undoubtedly stupid. Mr Saurajen sought to make him the sole and only operative cause of his own misfortune.
It is clear on the authority of 
 Caswell 
 
 v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd 
 [1940] AC 146 at p 166 that it is open to the court to find an element of contributory negligence in the conduct of the plaintiff in an action based upon a breach of statutory duty as in an action based on negligence.
Mr Hilborne submitted that the first plaintiff was about 25 to 331/3% to blame himself for not taking sufficient care for his own safety. We do not agree with Mr Saurajen that he was solely responsible for the accident which occurred. In our opinion his share of the blame in all the circumstances of this case taking into account the latitude ordinarily accorded to workmen in a factory or mine as opposed to an ordinary man not exposed to the noise, strain, and manifold risks of factory or mine (see Lord Atkin at p 166 of the 
 Caswell 
 case) may fairly be assessed at one-third of the total responsibility for the accident.
It now remains for us to assess the quantum of damages. The claims under the various heads brought by the first plaintiff having been dismissed, we do not have the benefit of any assessment of the damages which would have been awarded had the decision been in favour of the first plaintiff.
As we have said earlier the first plaintiff was a young lad of about 171/2 years of age at the time of the accident. He sustained injuries as follows
 
:
- Trans-scaphoid perilunar dislocation of right wrist joint; 
- 5` transverse deep laceration on the ventral surface of the right wrist running from the lateral to medial side; 
- Both radial and ulnar arteries were crushed at the site of the laceration; 
- A forearm amputation at the level of the lower third of the shafts of right radius and ulna.
 
 
 
He was hospitalised and subsequently an operation was performed on him as a result of which his right forearm was amputated at the level of the lower third of the shafts of right radius and ulna. Dr William Fung gave evidence to the effect that with the aid of an artificial arm an intelligent person with drive can do almost anything and can minimize functional loss at the age of the first plaintiff.
All things considered, we are of the opinion that to a certain extent, the first plaintiff has not done all that he could have done towards mitigation of damages in the sense that he has refused employment which was kindly offered to him by his employers at the same rate of pay. He said that this was because of his embarrassment and fear of being teased. Moreover, he has not made any effort in the direction of getting an artificial arm for that portion of the right forearm which he lost. However, the facts remain that he must have undergone considerable pain and suffering and that he will continue to suffer some disablement in the matter of the performance of his normal duties, his general enjoyment of life and the loss of amenities to which he was accustomed and suffer consequential embarrassments and drawbacks to which a person of his age will undoubtedly be exposed.
We have considered the awards in cases like 
 Ng Kay Thong v Chee Shan Shong 
 
 
 
[1966] 1 MLJ 235
 , 
 Lew Fa v Seng Chong Metal Works Ltd 
 
 
 
[1966] 1 MLJ 231
  and 
 Saw Tong Seng v Ong Kim Hoon 
 
 
 [1965-1968] SLR 714 
. Those were also cases of amputation of the right arm in one case and the left arm in the other two. In particular, in the case of 
 Saw Tong Seng v Ong Kim Hoon, 
 the injuries were much more serious in that the whole of the right arm had been amputated and the plaintiff therein lost the use of the right arm completely as it had been disarticulated from the shoulder joint. We assess general damages in respect of pain and suffering, loss of amenities and enjoyment of life, embarrassments, etc at $20,000. As for loss of future earnings we assess damages at $10,000, making a grand total in respect of general damages of $30,000. Special damages have been agreed in the sum of $750 for the first plaintiff and $56 for the second plaintiff, his mother, in respect of transport expenses.
There will be judgment for the first plaintiff for the sum of $20,000 as general damages and $500 as special damages. There will be judgment for $37 for the second plaintiff.
The defendants will pay half the costs in the court below and the entire costs of appeal to the plaintiffs.

All of them now appeal against their convictions. The three charges read as follows: 
 
First Charge That you, 1. Andrew Chou Hock Guan, 2. David Chou Hock Heng, 3. Peter Lim Swee Guan, 4. Alex Yau Hean Thye, 5. Ringo Lee Chiew Chwee, 6. Richard James, 7. Stephen Francis, 8. Konesekaram s/o Nagalingam, 9. Stephen Lee Hock Khoon on or about 29 December 1971 at about 12 midnight at no 19 Chepstow Close, Singapore, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause the death of one Ngo Cheng Poh and others, and that while you were members of the assembly one or more members thereof in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly committed murder by causing the death of the said Ngo Cheng Poh, and you have thereby by virtue of s 149 of the Penal Code (ch 103) committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the aforesaid Code.

Konesekaram s/o Nagalingam, 9. Stephen Lee Hock Khoon on or about 29 December 1971 at about 12 midnight at no 19 Chepstow Close, Singapore, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause the death of one Ngo Cheng Poh and others, and that while you were members of the assembly one or more members thereof in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly committed murder by causing the death of one Leong Chin Woo, and you have thereby by virtue of s 149 of the Penal Code (ch 103) committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the aforesaid Code.
 
 
 
Third Charge That you, 1. Andrew Chou Hock Guan, 2. David Chou Hock Heng, 3. Peter Lim Swee Guan, 4. Alex Yau Hean Thye, 5. Ringo Lee Chiew Chwee, 6. Richard James, 7. Stephen Francis, 8. Konesekaram s/o Nagalingam, 9. Stephen Lee Hock Khoon on or about 29 December 1971 at about 12 midnight at no 19 Chepstow Close, Singapore, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause the death of one Ngo Cheng Poh and others, and that while you were members of the assembly one or more members thereof in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly committed murder by causing the death of one Ang Boon Chai, and you have thereby by virtue of s 149 of the Penal Code (ch 103) committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the aforesaid Code.
 
 
 
The deceased, Ngo Cheng Poh, whose death is the subject matter of the first charge, was the mandatory of a non-resident buyer of gold from a bank and as such mandatory he had on many occasions prior to 29 December 1971 purchased gold bars, each weighing one kilo or 2.2 lb, for export from Singapore. The gold bars were collected from the bank either by the deceased or by one or more of three persons, Leong Chin Woo whose death is the subject matter of the second charge, Ang Boon Chai, whose death is the subject matter of the third charge and a Mr Foo Leong Chin Woo was a trusted friend and Ang Boon Chai was an employee of Ngo Cheng Poh.
Some of the gold bars so purchased were exported, apparently illegally, from Singapore to Saigon through the first appellant, Andrew Chou Hock Guan (hereinafter referred to as Andrew) who from June 1969 was working for Air Vietnam as ground operations supervisor. His duties in December 1971 were among other things to look after the ramp side, to check the cabin cleaning work, to inform the pilot of the cargo and passenger load and to signal to Saigon the time of departure of an Air Vietnam flight from Singapore. The method employed by Ngo Cheng Poh to export to Saigon was for the gold bars to be delivered to Andrew at his house, no 19 Chepstow Close on the evening before an Air Vietnam flight would depart the next morning for Saigon. The gold bars were taken from Ngo Cheng Poh`s house, packed five bars to a package, four packages in a canvas bag, by Ngo, sometimes accompanied by his wife, in his own car, a Mercedes Benz, and followed by Leong Chin Woo driving his own car a Volkswagen. On some occasions Ang Boon Chai would also accompany the party when gold was delivered to Andrew at his house.
On every occasion when gold was delivered in the evening to Andrew, Ngo Cheng Poh would first await a telephone call from Andrew and soon after Andrew`s call Ngo Cheng Poh usually with Leong Chin Woo would then drive their respective cars with the gold to Andrew`s house.
On the evening of 29 December 1971 at Ngo Cheng Poh`s house 120 gold bars were wrapped by him with the help of his wife in packages of five in each package and put into six canvas bags. At about 11.25pm he received a telephone call from Andrew and thereupon he with Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai, who had both gone to Ngo Cheng Poh`s house earlier that evening, left in the Mercedes and Volkswagen cars taking with them the 120 gold bars which were put in the Mercedes car. Ngo Cheng Poh`s wife saw them driving off from her house and then awaited the return of her husband. At 2.30am she answered a telephone call and the caller who was Andrew asked for Ngo Cheng Poh. She told Andrew that her husband had already left after receiving his earlier call at 11.30pm to which he replied `No, No` which she understood as meaning that her husband had not been to Andrew`s house and so she replied `No, then I do not know.` After this call she waited without success for her husband to come home and eventually at about 6am she drove her own car to Andrew`s house arriving there after 6am. As she was walking into the house Andrew came out of the front door and, on being asked by her whether her husband had been to his place, replied that he had not. She saw Andrew`s right hand was bandaged up and was told by him that he had injured it while working at the Airport. She saw in the hall two male Chinese sleeping on the floor of the hall. At about 10.35am she went to the Joo Chiat Police Station and reported that her husband had left home with Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai in two cars at 11.30pm the previous evening and since then she could find no trace of his whereabouts.
At 2.40pm on 30 December 1971 a police party, on information received, found the dead body of Leong Chin Woo in blukar off Jalan Lembah Bedok which is in the Changi area near the Reformative Training Centre. The hands of the deceased were tied with a piece of rope which also went round the neck. About 200 feet away, also in blukar, was found the dead body of Ngo Cheng Poh. A piece of green nylon rope was tied loosely around the neck and a piece of cloth was tied round the mouth. A piece of black insulated electrical wire was tied round the legs. Shortly thereafter the dead body of Ang Boon Chai was found in a pond about 150 feet off Jalan Tiga Ratus, which is also in the Changi area and near the Reformative Training Centre, with a piece of green nylon rope lying on top of it.
When discovered, the body of Leong Chin Woo had bruises on the right eyebrow and the lower lip and rope marks round the neck. The body of Ngo Cheng Poh had bruises over the front side of the face, on both ears and on the left side of the chest. There were also multiple bruises on the back of the body and rope marks around the neck and the testicles were swollen. The body of Ang Boon Chai had bruises on the left side of the face and rope marks around the neck.
The three dead men had therefore clearly been brutally assaulted and strangled and the cause of death as found by the pathologist was, in each case, by asphyxia from strangulation. It was the opinion of the pathologist that their deaths occurred sometime between 8.30pm of 29 December and 2.30am of 30 December 1971 and that death would have ensued within one to three minutes of the application of pressure to their necks.
Apart from the above facts which were clearly established at the trial the following undisputed facts also emerged at the trial. The first appellant, Andrew and the second appellant David Chou Hock Heng (hereinafter referred to as David) are brothers and they lived at no 19 Chepstow Close together with their mother and other members of the family. During the period when Andrew assisted Ngo Cheng Poh in the exportation of gold to Saigon in Air Vietnam scheduled flights the gold would be taken to Andrew`s house on Wednesdays, Fridays or Sundays those being the three days in the week when Air Vietnam flies direct from Saigon to Singapore and, after an overnight stop in Singapore, flies from Singapore the next morning direct to Saigon. On these occasions Andrew would transport the gold to be exported and load it on the Air Vietnam plane leaving the next morning and for the part he played he was paid a commission of US$5 and Singapore $10 for every kilo of gold so exported.
Although Andrew had on the morning of 30 December 1971 told Mrs Ngo Cheng Poh that her husband had not been to his house on the evening of 29 December 1971, in fact Ngo Cheng Poh, Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai did arrive there at around midnight in two cars, the Mercedes and the Volkswagen. Ngo Cheng Poh and Leong Chin Woo went into the house with the 120 gold bars while Ang Boon Chai remained outside. When they arrived all the nine appellants were in the house together with another person, Augustine Ang. Andrew and David were in what is referred to as the backyard which leads from the kitchen. From the photographic exhibits the backyard has a cement floor and a roof but is open on three sides. Augustine and the other appellants were in the kitchen.
At about 12.30am Andrew was seen by a next door neighbour, Shirley Lim Yew Neo, to enter and drive a Volkswagen car from a place where it was blocking the entrance to her house, park it to the side of his house and then hastily enter the house. Shirley Lim also noticed a white Mercedes car parked just outside the gate of Andrew`s house. As she was about to enter her house through the rear door David called out to her `good evening` and she noticed he was with five or six male persons standing in a circle at the side of the house near the kitchen.
Later that evening the bodies of Ngo Cheng Poh, Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai were bundled into the Volkswagen car which was then driven away by the fourth appellant, Alex Yau Hean Thye followed by a Cortina car which was driven by the third appellant, Peter Lim Swee Guan and in which were the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth appellants. The two cars were driven to Changi and at some place in Changi the three bodies were dumped fairly near to each other. After that the Volkswagen car was abandoned at the Tanah Merah car park and the whole party drove away in the Cortina car.
Meanwhile, 115 of the 120 gold bars which Ngo Cheng Poh had brought with him were taken by Augustine and David (although David at the trial disputed that he accompanied Augustine) in Andrew`s car to no 4A Worcester Road, the flat of the third appellant`s aunt, Mrs Tay, and handed over to Mrs Tay. The next morning Augustine and the third appellant went to Mrs Tay`s flat, took ten of the gold bars and sold them to a goldsmith for $39,400. Payment was made with $29,400 in cash and an IOU note for $10,000. They then returned to the flat and handed over all the cash and the IOU note to Mrs Tay but that same evening they took from Mrs Tay $10,000 cash and this money was handed over to the third appellant.
At about 10.30pm on 30 December 1971, ie less than 24 hours after the three deceased persons had arrived at Andrew`s house, a police party interviewed David and Andrew at their home. Andrew told the police that although he was expecting Ngo Cheng Poh the previous night at his home Ngo Cheng Poh did not turn up and he did not know where Ngo Cheng Poh was. One of the members of the police party noticed that Andrew`s right hand was swollen and David had scratch marks on his body. When questioned about his swollen hand Andrew said that he had been sparring with his brother David. On 31 December Andrew was examined by a doctor who found that he had a bruised swollen and tender right hand and a fracture of the neck of the right fifth metacarpal which could have been caused by the hand hitting with severe force a blunt object or by a fall or by being hit by a blunt object. David was also examined on the same day by the same doctor who found that he had two recent bruises on the front of the left shoulder and the back of the right shoulder blade.
At 1.10am on 31 December the police found Ngo Cheng Poh`s Mercedes car abandoned at Jalan Somapah Timor and at 6.35am the same day the police found Leong Chin Woo`s Volkswagen car abandoned at Nicoll Drive and in it there were human bloodstains. On 2 January 1972 the third appellant took a police party to no 4A Worcester Road, the flat of his aunt, Mrs Tay and pointed to a tin on the ledge of the flat in which were found 15 gold bars and led the police party to the ceiling of the flat where 90 gold bars were found. Mrs Tay also handed to the police a pillow in which were found $29,000. At 1pm the same day David took the police to his place of employment and opened with a key a drawer of his office desk in which were found 5 gold bars.
On 3 January Stephen Lee Hock Khoon, the ninth appellant, who had earlier been arrested, brought the police to his house where he handed over $1,750 and on the same day the third appellant brought the police to his house and handed over $1,800. On 6 January, Ringo Lee Chiew Chwee, the fifth appellant, Richard James, the sixth appellant, Stephen Francis, the seventh appellant and Konesekaram, the eighth appellant were arrested.
The facts we have outlined above are in our opinion amply sufficient to warrant the conviction of all the nine appellants on all the three charges of murder if the other evidence led by the prosecution established first, that all of them at the time when the three victims were in Andrew`s house were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause the death of Ngo Cheng, Poh and the other persons accompanying him to Andrew`s house on 29 December 1971 and secondly, that whilst they were members of the assembly one or more members thereof in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly committed murder by causing the death of Ngo Cheng Poh, Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai. The prosecution relied principally on the evidence of Augustine Ang to prove that common object and that the deaths of the three victims were caused by one or more of the appellants in the prosecution of the common object. He was an accomplice who on his own admission took an active part from the very outset and took part in assaulting two of the victims in Andrew`s house. He was arrested on 2 January and a few days later made a statement to the police after the police had charged him with the three murders. After the prosecution had decided to use him as a prosecution witness they withdrew the murder charges against him which were pending in a magistrate`s court and he was discharged, the discharge not amounting to an acquittal, it being the law that a magistrate`s court had no power to grant an acquittal in such circumstances.
Augustine gave evidence at the trial that in November 1971 Andrew, David, the third appellant and he planned to attack, rob and kill the person or persons who would be bringing gold bars to Andrew`s house for export to Saigon by an Air Vietnam plane, with the aid of others to be recruited by the third appellant. Pursuant to that plan, on the afternoon of 20 November 1971, the third appellant brought five persons, among them the fourth and ninth appellants, to Andrew`s house where he briefed them on what they should do. Later in the evening he went with Andrew, David, the third, fourth and ninth appellants and three other youths and three girls in three cars to a coffee stall at Changi from Andrew`s house where David briefed them in similar terms to his own earlier briefing to the effect that two or three persons with whom his brother had business trouble would be coming to his house and must be brought drown, cleanly, and quietly and their bodies then buried. For this they, the recruits, would be paid $20,000. They were also told to stand by on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays from 7pm onwards.
A few days later because three of the five recruits dropped out of the scheme, he and the third appellant were told by Andrew and David to recruit others to replace them. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth appellants were recruited by the third appellant and were briefed to kill two or three men who would be coming to Andrew`s house and to get rid of their bodies for $20,000. Subsequently, he with Andrew, the third, fourth, sixth, eighth and ninth appellants went to Changi near the Reformative Training Centre to look at a possible `burial` site. On the afternoon of 29 December he was told by Andrew to get the boys ready through the third appellant as the gold bars were to be delivered that night.
Eventually he, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth appellants arrived at Andrew`s house that evening in two cars, one of which was a hired Cortina. Andrew and David were at home and they were shown by Andrew some nylon ropes, a roll of plaster and a towel and instructed by Andrew to remain in the kitchen to await the expected visitors. He was told to be near the kitchen door and to go out to the backyard when called. Around midnight when the sound of a motor car was heard all of them went into the kitchen except Andrew and David who remained in the backyard. A short while later he heard Andrew calling his name and he went into the backyard where he saw Ngo Cheng Poh and Leong Chin Woo and where, when he was about to assist in counting the gold bars, he saw Andrew and David pounce simultaneously on the two visitors. Andrew applied an arm-lock on Ngo`s neck and David did the same on Leong`s neck. He then shouted to the boys waiting in the kitchen to come out and then he joined in the assault by holding Ngo`s legs while Andrew still had his hands around Ngo`s neck. While he was holding Ngo`s legs he saw David pulling a rope round Leong`s neck and thereafter helping Andrew by putting his bands over Ngo`s neck.
A short while later he walked to a path at the side of the house running from the front to the back of the house past the porch and he saw Andrew stamping his feet on the body of a man and applying karate chops on the man`s neck. He picked up a small block of wood and hit the man several times and he heard the man begging not to be hit. Then he heard the sound of a car coming from the front of the house and heard David calling to Andrew that the neighbours were back. The man in the path was taken into the backyard and there he saw three bodies covered with cloth. He heard David `wishing` the neighbours as they were entering their own house which was next to the path and separated from Andrew`s house by a fence.
After that he saw a Volkswagen car parked near the back gate with the fourth appellant standing behind it and he went out and stood beside the fourth appellant. He saw three inert bodies piled inside the car and at David`s request he assisted in closing a door of the car. Then David covered the bodies with a piece of cloth and after that the fourth appellant went into the car and the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth appellants went into the Cortina car and then both cars were driven away.
Then Andrew, David and he washed the floor of the backyard as there was blood on it and after this all three of them went in two cars, a Mercedes and a Datsun which belongs to Andrew, to Changi where the Mercedes car was abandoned in a kampong area before returning to Andrew`s house in the Datsun. On returning, at Andrew`s request, he telephoned Mrs Tay to tell her to expect them and then David and he took 115 gold bars to her flat and left the gold bars there and then they returned to Andrew`s house where he remained for the rest of the night.
If Augustine`s evidence were true, it would establish that around midnight on the evening of the 29 December 1971 at Andrew`s house all the nine appellants and Augustine were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to kill the person or persons who were expected to arrive at Andrew`s house soon, that three persons in fact arrived as expected, that these three persons were brutally assaulted, strangled and died minutes after strangulation and that these three victims were the dead persons named in the three charges of murder. Augustine`s evidence, if true, would also establish that at the time when the murders were committed all the appellants remained members of that unlawful assembly with that common object and that in prosecution of that common object some of the members of that unlawful assembly committed murder by causing the deaths of Ngo Cheng Poh, Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai.
The trial judges accepted Augustine Ang as a truthful witness and, although they were of the opinion that his evidence was not corroborated, after warning themselves of the danger of acting on his uncorroborated evidence, said they had no hesitation in acting on his uncorroborated evidence. At the close of all the evidence, the trial judges said they remained convinced that Augustine was speaking the truth and they found that on the night in question when the nine appellants and Augustine assembled at Andrew`s house, they were all members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause the deaths of the three victims and that whilst all of them were members of that unlawful assembly some members thereof in the prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly committed murder by causing the deaths of Ngo Cheng Poh, Leong Chin Woo and Ang Boon Chai. The trial judges accordingly convicted all the nine appellants.
Two of the nine appellants were unrepresented at the hearing of the appeals before this court. They were below the statutory age and were sentenced to be detained at the pleasure of the President. The other seven appellants on each of whom the mandatory death sentence was imposed were represented by four counsel. It will be convenient to deal first with a ground of appeal thoroughly canvassed before us and which is common and applicable to all the appellants. This common round of appeal is that the trial judges` assessment of Augustine Ang, an accomplice, was wholly unwarranted and wholly unsupported by the evidence given at the trial. The trial judges` assessment appears in the following passage of their grounds of judgment: 
 
The only witness whose evidence implicated all the accused was Augustine Ang, who was a self-confessed murderer and was undoubtedly an accomplice. We looked to see if there was corroborative evidence which confirmed in some material particular not only the evidence of Augustine Ang that the crime or crimes were in fact committed but also his evidence that each of the accused committed the three offences charged. There was clearly no corroboration of Augustine Ang`s evidence. We, therefore, warned ourselves of the danger of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of Augustine Ang.
 
 
 
Augustine Ang was in the witness box for nine days out of which seven were spent in his cross-examination. The cross-examination was not only long but also severe and very thorough as he was repeatedly questioned by five different counsel on all the essential facts of the prosecution`s case. His answers were consistent throughout. Furthermore we observed his demeanour very closely while he was giving evidence in the witness box. It did not appear from his manner and conduct that he was inclined either to shuffle, to prevaricate, or to speak that which was false. He appeared to us to have all the marks of sincere contrition and we were well satisfied that, however iniquitous or obnoxious his former conduct had been, he was determined to speak the truth to the court. We also studied his evidence in the light of the other evidence adduced by the prosecution and he struck us as a truthful witness notwithstanding the role he played in the whole affair. We had no hesitation in acting upon his evidence.
Our attention was drawn to many passages in the transcript of Augustine Ang`s evidence where, when cross-examined, he admitted his earlier testimony was a mistake or changed his story as regards a particular incident or where his evidence is contradictory to that of a police officer. It is submitted that those passages showed that the trial judges` assessment as quoted above was completely unjustified as those passages, though they related to minor matters clearly raised doubts as to Augustine Ang`s veracity. This court has throughout the years always recognised the advantages which a jury or a judge, sitting alone, has in seeing and hearing the witnesses and in the present case we have not been persuaded that the trial judges were wrong or were not justified, on all the evidence before them during the trial in their assessment of Augustine Ang as a truthful witness.
The next criticism is that those passages at least gave rise to grave suspicion of Augustine Ang`s story of the central events on the fateful night and in the light of his being an accomplice, who was fully involved from the beginning to the end in the three murders and also had the strongest possible motive in implicating all the appellants, the trial judges ought not to have convicted the appellants on the uncorroborated and unsatisfactory evidence of such an accomplice. The law on the subject of corroboration has fairly recently been considered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of 
 Chiu Nang Hong 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 
 which was a case of rape where there was no corroboration of the evidence of the complainant. Lord Donovan, at p 42 said: 
 
On appeal, the Court of Appeal decided that it could not interfere with the learned judge`s judgment, though merely reading the notes of evidence the members of the court might feel something less than satisfaction as to the guilt of the appellant. But the learned judge had seen and heard the witnesses: he was aware of the danger of convicting without some corroborative evidence of the complainant`s story, and he knew that there was no such evidence. Nevertheless he was convinced of the truth of the complainant`s story, and in that position was entitled in law to convict the appellant. Their Lordships would be of the like opinion if it were correct to say that the learned judge knew that he was convicting in the absence of corroborative evidence, and bearing the risk in mind of doing so, yet felt convinced of the truth of the complainant`s story.
 
 
 
In our opinion the same principles are applicable where the uncorroborated evidence is that of an accomplice. Applying these principles, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial judges clearly indicated that they were aware of the danger of convicting without corroborative evidence of Augustine Ang`s story, and that they knew that there was no such evidence but nevertheless were convinced that he was speaking the truth and that his story was true when considered in the light of the rest of the evidence and the surrounding circumstances.
Accordingly, in our judgment, there was no misdirection or non-direction on the part of the trial judge`s in accepting Augustine Ang as a truthful witness and in acting upon his evidence even though he was an accomplice whose evidence was uncorroborated. Furthermore after a consideration of the careful arguments of all the counsel appearing before us and after a searching review of the shorthand transcript of the evidence at the trial we do not think that the verdicts of the trial judges were wrong nor do we think them in all the circumstances unsafe or unsatisfactory or unjust.
On behalf of the first and second appellants it is also contended that the trial judges erred in law in refusing their applications to be tried separately from their other seven co-accused. It is submitted that it was clear from the statements made by the other co-accused after their arrests that at a joint trial of all of them they would give evidence which must conflict with one another and thus a joint trial would be unfairly prejudicial to each of them. It is also submitted that as s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Ed) specifically permits a court to take into consideration a confession by a co-accused as against another accused when they are tried jointly for the same offence and as the statements of some of the other seven co-accused might be prejudicial to the first and second appellants, they would be deprived of their undoubted right to a fair trial if all the nine accused were tried at a joint trial. It is conceded that the law is that this is a matter for the discretion of the trial judges at the trial but the criticism is that there is no indication in the transcript that the trial judges exercised their discretion at all.
In our opinion this ground of appeal is also without substance. The transcript shows that the matter was argued fully on behalf of the first and second appellants and having regard to the charges as framed this court as an appellate court, in principle, ought to infer that the trial court which in this case consisted of two experienced trial judges had given due consideration to the matter although they did not think it necessary to give reasons for their decision. This being a matter of discretion it is not for this court to interfere with the exercise of the discretion unless it is satisfied that the trial judges acted upon wrong principles and so far from being satisfied we are of the opinion that they were correct in refusing the application for separate trials. For the same reasons we also reject as being without substance the same point raised by counsel on behalf of the third, sixth, seventh and eighth appellants. In this connection we respectfully adopt and emphasise the observations of Lord Goddard CJ in 
 R v Grondkowski 
 (1946) 31 Cr App R 116 at p 120 where he said this: 
 
The law is, and always has been, that this is a matter of discretion for the judge at the trial. The court so stated the law in this very case, and quite recently in 
 Youth
, [1945] WN 27, the Judicial Committee said that the question of joint or several trials had always been left to the discretion of the presiding judge. The discretion, no doubt, must be exercised judicially, that is, not capriciously. The judge must consider the interests of justice as well as the interests of the prisoners. It is too often nowadays thought, or seems, to be thought, that `the interests of justice` means only `the interests of he prisoners`. If once it were taken as settled that every time it appears that one prisoner as part of his defence means to attack another, a separate trial must be ordered, it is obvious there is no room for discretion and a rule of law is substituted for it. There is no case in which this has ever been laid down, and in the opinion of the court it would be most unfortunate and contrary to the true interests of justice if it were.
 
 
 
Another common ground of appeal is that the trial judges erred in law and in fact in finding that the common object of the appellants was to kill the three victims. If the trial judges` assessment of Augustine Ang as a truthful witness is justified in all the evidence and the circumstances and they were convinced that his story was true and acted upon it after warning themselves of the danger of convicting each of the appellants on his uncorroborated evidence then in our judgment there was no such error in law or in fact on the part of the trial judges. It mattered not, in our view, that on Augustine`s evidence there were other common objects shared by all the appellants or that some of them shared some other common object or common objects such as robbery or the disposal of dead bodies or assault which were not shared by the others so long as it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt against each one of the appellants that he shared with the rest of the appellants the common object of killing the persons who were expected by them to arrive at Andrew`s house on the night of the 29 December 1971.
It is also contended on behalf of the third appellant that the trial judges should not have admitted in evidence the cautioned statement made by him to a police officer after his arrest because he had made the statement under duress. The question as to its admissibility had been fully considered during `a trial within a trial` and we see no reason to doubt that the trial judges` discretion had not been judicially exercised. A somewhat similar ground was raised by the fourth appellant in his grounds of appeal the submission being that his cautioned statement was inadmissible because he had himself written the contents when the law requires the statement to be taken down in writing by the police officer to whom the statement is made. There is no substance in this point. The law governing the admissibility of such cautioned statements is contained in s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) and Sch E to that Code. Subsection (5) of s 121 expressly provides for the admissibility of a statement whether `it ... is oral or in writing` and proviso (b) of s 121(5) gives the court a discretion to refuse to admit a statement made after arrest `if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the rules set out in Sch E to this Code`.
Finally in respect of each of the nine appellants we have scrutinised with care the transcript of the evidence before the trial court having regard to the arguments urged before us by all the counsel that the conviction of each of their respective clients was unreasonable or was not supported by the evidence. We have considered these arguments bearing in mind the observations of the trial judges after a lengthy trial during which, as they said, Augustine Ang was subjected to a thorough and severe cross-examination for seven days out of the nine he spent in the witness box and bearing in mind the trial judges` assessment of Augustine Ang as a truthful witness on whose evidence they had no hesitation in acting well knowing the danger of acting on the evidence of a self-confessed accomplice to the crime of murder. We have come to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the conviction of each of the nine appellants on all the three charges of murder read with s 149 of the Penal Code (Cap, 1970 Ed).
Accordingly the appeals of all the nine appellants are dismissed.

The appellants were charged in the High Court on the following joint charge: 
 
You, 1 Sia Ah Kew, 2 Ho Kok Keng, 3 Hoong Khung Cheong, 4 Koo Ah Choo and 5 Lim Chai Thiam, are hereby charged that you on or about 14 March 1972, at about 7.00pm at no 58 Watten Estate, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of all of you, did abduct one Tjioe Kok Hwie with intent to hold the said Tjioe Kok Hwie for ransom, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
At the trial they pleaded guilty to the charge and were convicted by the trial court which consisted of two judges and all of them were sentenced to death. They now appeal against their sentences. Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Ed) provides as follows: 
 
Whoever, with intent to hold any person for ransom, abducts or wrongfully restrains or wrongfully confines such person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be punished on conviction with death or imprisonment for life and shall,
 if he is not sentenced to death, also be liable to caning
.
 
 
 
The legislature has thus given the courts a very limited discretion with regard to sentence, the discretion being limited to the imposition of one of three sentences, the maximum being death and the minimum being imprisonment for life. The third is imprisonment for life with caning.
Before passing the sentences Choor Singh J the presiding judge said: 
 
The crime of kidnapping for ransom is a detestable crime. It is motivated by avarice. It is carefully planned with great deliberation and executed with complete disregard for the anguish and suffering of not only the victim but also of all those who are near and dear to him. The mental torture which the victim`s family undergoes while apprehensively awaiting his fate equals or even surpasses that undergone by the victim while in captivity. Kidnapping for ransom is a crime which no civilised society can tolerate and it should be firmly rooted out. It is therefore imperative that the courts should impose deterrent sentences on persons convicted of kidnapping so that it is brought home to all would-be kidnappers that it does not pay to commit this crime in Singapore.
 
 
 
Much has been made by counsel for the defence of the fact that the accused have pleaded guilty. We have taken this fact into consideration. We are fully aware that 
 a plea of guilty is a mitigating factor which the court must take into consideration in assessing the sentence to be imposed 
 on an accused who has pleaded guilty. Normally in the case of an offence punishable with imprisonment, a plea of guilty warrants some leniency being shown to the accused and this is reflected in the term of imprisonment imposed on him. In the case of kidnapping for ransom, the punishment prescribed by Parliament clearly indicates the gravity with which this crime should be viewed. Parliament has given the courts a very limited discretion. The offence is punishable with death or life imprisonment. If this court accepts the contention that an accused convicted of kidnapping should not be hanged because he has pleaded guilty, it would be creating a precedent which would be not only dangerous but also contrary to public interest. It would give would-be kidnappers the impression that they can, if caught, always escape the death penalty by pleading guilty. On that basis no kidnappers would ever be hanged and the law would be completely frustrated. It is true that Parliament has vested the court with a discretion in the matter of sentence, but such discretion has to be exercised judicially in the light of the considerations applicable to the case. It is no doubt a very grave responsibility but where the facts are clear and the circumstances of the case warrant it, the court should not hesitate from its duty. In our judgment,
 a plea of guilty alone 
 does not entitle the accused to the lesser 
 sentence of life imprisonment 
. 
 The court should pass sentence on the accused in the light of all the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case including of course the plea of guilty 
 if the accused has so pleaded. Hard and fast rules cannot be laid down and the deter mination of the right measure of punishment must depend on the variety of considerations that apply in the case before the court.
We agree with these general observations though there is one other important factor which ought to be considered in the vast majority of criminal offences when judicially deciding what would be the appropriate sentence. It is a long and well established principle of sentencing that the legislature in fixing the maximum penalty for a criminal offence intends it only for the worst cases. However, in the case of the offence of kidnapping for ransom the discretion given to the courts as regards the sentence is, as earlier stated, very limited in scope. In our opinion the maximum sentence prescribed by the legislature would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or conduct of the kidnappers are such as to outrage the feelings of the community.
In the present case the trial judges, in our opinion erroneously, took the view that the alternative sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed only when there are some very exceptional circumstances which do not justify the imposition of the death sentence and on this erroneous view they came to the conclusion that there was no reason why the death sentence should not be imposed on all the accused.
Another factor which influenced the trial judges` decision was their view, based on a statement by the Solicitor General that kidnapping is rampant in Singapore, that this type of crime is on the increase in Singapore. We have before us an official communication which was not available to the trial judges, which reveals that for the past four years from 1970 to 1973 the total number of persons kidnapped for ransom was six, one in each of the years 1970 and 1972 and two in each of the years 1971 and 1973. On these statistics it is clear that the crime of kidnapping for ransom is neither rampant nor on the increase in Singapore.
Accordingly, we must now consider on all the facts and circumstances whether, in the case of each appellant, the sentence of death ought to stand. The admitted facts before the court are as follows. On 14 March 1972 the five appellants entered the house of the victim with the intention of kidnapping him for ransom. Two of them entered the house through the kitchen door at the back and the other three gained admission by the front door which was opened for them by a daughter of the victim. They were told the victim was upstairs. While two of them remained downstairs guarding the victim`s children, the other three, two of whom carried pistols and the third a dagger, rushed upstairs where they confronted the victim and his son and took them downstairs after tying the victim`s son`s hands with wire. Downstairs the victim was blindfolded with a piece of plaster and the children were told not to make a noise or report to the police. Then the second and fourth appellants led the victim out of the house into a waiting car leaving the other three appellants to guard the children until the victim had been safely driven away. A few moments later they left after warning the children that if they valued their father`s life they should not make a report to the police.
The victim was taken to a house where he was kept blindfolded for nine days except on four occasions when the blindfold was removed to enable him to write to his wife and fellow directors of his company. When sleeping, his hands and legs were also tied with straps. Negotiations for the victim`s release were first conducted over the telephone and at a face-to-face negotiation between the fourth appellant and a business associate of the victim $500,000 was demanded. Eventually at a later meeting between the victim`s wife, his business associate and the fourth appellant the ransom was agreed at $50,000 and on the seventh day after the kidnapping the victim`s wife handed over to the fourth appellant $50,000 in $50 notes and $10 notes. Two days later the victim was released.
The first appellant was arrested on 4 April 1972 at Seremban, Malaysia after he had earlier that day deposited ten $50 notes, part of the ransom money, into his savings account with a bank at Kajang. On 7 April 1972 the second appellant was arrested in a house in Singapore and he had in his possession $350, part of the ransom money. On 20 April 1972 the third appellant was arrested. The fourth appellant was arrested when he arrived at Subang Airport, Kuala Lumpur on 20 April 1972. The fifth appellant was arrested as he got off a plane at Singapore Airport on 12 May 1972. In all $6,000 of the ransom money was recovered.
The second appellant had previously been convicted on 10 November 1962 of armed robbery and sentenced to seven years` imprisonment. The third appellant had a previous conviction on 16 October 1961 for the offence of house trespass. The other appellants had no previous convictions. In their mitigation plea, all the appellants alleged that the master mind behind the kidnapping was another person who had enticed or persuaded each of them to take part in it. They all stressed that the victim was kindly treated and no violence was shown towards him while under captivity.
In our judgment, the facts and circumstances do not point to this case as being one in which the maximum sentence of death would be the appropriate sentence to impose. However, having regard to the fact that two of the appellants were armed with pistols and one with a dagger, the manner in which they effected the abduction of the victim and their treatment of the victim`s household we consider it appropriate to impose a sentence of caning on each of them.
Accordingly, for all these reasons, we set aside the sentences of death and substitute therefor the following sentences:
The first appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and to six strokes of the cane.
The second appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and to 12 strokes of the cane.
The third appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and to nine strokes of the cane.
The fourth appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and to six strokes of the cane.
The fifth appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and to six strokes of the cane.

In this appeal the appellant, Harbans Singh Sidhu, challenges the correctness of his conviction for an offence under s 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) and the sentence imposed on him. The criminal proceedings against the appellant were started on a complaint filed by the Attorney General who in his complaint alleged that the appellant defamed Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister, by spoken words. The alleged defamatory words, as set out in the charge against the appellant are these: 
 
Coming to the so-called Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, what type of man is he? I can tell you he is one of the biggest scoundrels in the world, not only in Singapore.
 
 
 
What did this scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew say in the Assembly?
 
 
 
Today the same scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew is doing worse than Lim Yew Hock.
 
 
 
What kind of a man is this scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew?
 
 
 
Now we complain about this scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew to the International Commission of Jurists on behalf of the political detainees in Singapore.
 
 
 
They wrote a letter to this scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew on 23 July 1971.
 
 
 
Dear gangster of Singapore.
 
 
 
I called him in the nomination day there a gangster and a kidnapper.
 
 
 
I would write dear no 1 gangster of Singapore. Dear no 1 public enemy of Singapore. Dear kidnapper no 1 in Singapore.
 
 
 
This scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew has not yet replied to this letter.
 
 
 
I want to respect this scoundrel/gangster.
 
 
 
But I will not write with respect to this scoundrel
 
 
 
This letter has not yet been replied by the scoundrel Lee Kuan Yew.
 
 
 
Section 499 of the Penal Code defines defamation in the following terms: 
 
Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs, or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.
 
 
 
There can be no doubt at all and indeed it is not in dispute that the impugned words spoken by the appellant are per se defamatory and would harm the reputation of the Prime Minister. At the trial the appellant relied on the first, second, third, ninth and tenth Exceptions to s 499 of the Penal Code. It is therefore necessary to set out these Exceptions and they are in the following terms:
 First Exception - 
It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it is for the public good that the imputation should be made or published. Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact.
 Second Exception - 
It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any discharge of his public functions, or respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further.
 Third Exception - 
It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question, and respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further.
 Ninth Exception - 
It is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another, provided that the imputation is made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person, or for the public good.
 Tenth Exception - 
It is not defamation to convey a caution, in good faith, to one person against another, provided that the caution is intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed, or of some person in whom that person is interested, or for the public good.
After considering the evidence the trial judge came to the conclusion that the words spoken by the appellant were defamatory per se and held that the appellant had not brought himself within any of the Exceptions he relied on. In the result he convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months` imprisonment.
Under s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Ed) if an accused person claims the benefit of Exceptions, the burden of proving his plea that his case falls under any of the Exceptions is on the accused. That burden is discharged if the accused person succeeds in proving a preponderance of probability.
Thus for the appellant at the trial to succeed on the First Exception, the onus was on him to prove that the impugned words spoken by him were true. The appellant`s evidence in support of his plea of justification can be briefly summarized. He was the solicitor for some persons detained without trial under the Internal Security Act. After studying books on international law and under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights he came to the conclusion that the Internal Security Act (Cap 115, 1970 Ed) was ultra vires, void and unlawful under international law. Therefore all persons detained under the Internal Security Act have been unlawfully detained. Furthermore, these detained persons would not be released from detention unless they signed statements and by requiring the signing of a statement a condition of their release amounts to asking them for ransom. The wrongful detention for ransom of these detained persons amounts to the offence of kidnapping under the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Ed). The Prime Minister as the head of the government is the person responsible for the wrongful detention for ransom of these detained persons and therefore can be charged under the Kidnapping Act for kidnapping. The Prime Minister is therefore truly a kidnapper and because a kidnapper is automatically a scoundrel he is in truth a scoundrel. As regards calling him a gangster it is because it is a criminal act to kidnap and as gangsters do criminal acts he is in truth a gangster. He believed the truth of every word he said of the Prime Minister.
The appellant called one witness who said that when he was the secretary of a trade union he was arrested and detained in October 1966 and eventually released on 1 April 1970. He was released even though he did not `issue` a statement.
It was contended before me by counsel for the appellant that the trial judge did not direct his mind to the question whether or not the alleged words were true. Counsel gave no reasons in support of this contention and indeed there can be no reason as the trial judge in fact dealt with the defence of justification and dismissed it. It is clear from the above summary of the evidence on the plea of justification that the appellant fell far short of discharging the onus on him.
With regard to the other four Exceptions relied on by the appellant at the trial, each of these four Exceptions requires that the imputations were made in good faith. The expression `good faith` where it appears in the Penal Code is defined by s 52 which provides that `nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention`. On the requirement of good faith s 500 also provides as follows:
 Explanation to Exceptions - 
In proving the existence of circumstances as a defence under the second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth or tenth exception good faith shall be presumed unless the contrary appears.
It is contended before me that with regard to the defence based on the second, third, ninth and tenth Exceptions the trial judge failed to direct his mind to the question whether or not the impugned words were spoken in good faith. In support of this contention, also, no arguments were presented or submissions made and indeed this contention is unsupported having regard to the judgment delivered by the trial judge at the close of the trial. In his judgment the trial judge said: 
 
As regards the other exceptions relied on by the accused, whilst good faith is to be presumed, it requires care, caution and prudence in the background of context and circumstances. What I have said of the evidence clearly shows, to my mind, without a shadow of doubt that the accused is a senseless person motivated, I know not by what impulse, to make scurrilous and scandalous statements without any regard whatsoever.
 
 
 
The trial judge in that passage clearly had in mind the `Explanation to Exceptions` in s 500 and the definition of `good faith` in s 52 and found as a fact that the impugned words were not spoken in good faith. That is a finding of fact which is amply supported by the evidence. As Gajendragadkar CJ who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in 
 H Singh v State of Punjab 
 [1966] CLJ 82 said at p 88: 
 
Thus, it would be clear that in deciding whether an accused person acted in good faith under the Ninth Exception, it is not possible to lay down any rigid rule or test. It would be a question to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case - what is the nature of the imputation made; under what circumstances did it come to be made; what is the status of the person who makes the imputation; was there any malice in his mind when he made the said imputation; did he make any enquiry before he made it; are there reasons to accept his story that he acted with due care and attention and was satisfied that the imputation was true? These and other considerations would be relevant in deciding the plea of good faith made by an accused person who claims the benefit of the Ninth Exception.
 
 
 
Another contention raised is that the trial judge erred in law in that he exercised his discretion wrongly and acted contrary to s 173(m) of the Criminal Procedure Code in refusing the appellant`s application to issue a subpoena to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore. The request for a subpoena addressed to the Prime Minister was to produce documents relating to all persons who are detained under the Internal Security Act and under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 112, 1970 Ed). It was an omnibus request for the production of all documents relating to all persons so detained. The reason given to the trial judge by Mr Kamil, counsel for the appellant at the trial was that all the documents are relevant because the defence has to prove that there are detainees. The trial judge refused the application and made a note that it was refused `for the reasons requested for by Mr Kamil`. It is to be observed that it is conceded by the prosecution that there were persons detained under the Internal Security Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.
While the trial judge had not, as indicated in his recorded reason for refusing the application, complied with the exact terms of s 173(m) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in my judgment that is no ground on the facts and circumstances of the application, for vitiating the conviction of the appellant as in my view there has been no failure or miscarriage of justice. It seems to me, it being admitted that there were persons detained under the aforesaid two Acts, that the application for a subpoena addressed to the Prime Minister to produce all documents relating to all such detainees was clearly vexatious. The fact that it was sought to subpoena the Prime Minister when he was not in law the Minister charged with the responsibility of administering these two Acts seems to me clear evidence that the application was vexatious.
Several other grounds were raised in the petition of appeal but at the hearing of the appeal no arguments were presented by counsel for the appellant in support and in my judgment there is no substance in any of them.
Lastly, it is contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive and reliance is placed upon the fact that some consideration ought to have been given because the defamatory words were spoken during an election campaign speech. It is to be observed that at the trial the defence was one of justification and the appellant in his sworn testimony continued to assert the truth of the imputations he had made. In my judgment, the trial judge was justified in imposing a sentence of six months and for all these reasons the appeal against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

The appellant was charged with two others of having committed the offence of having in their joint possession about $10,000 worth of US currency knowing the same to be counterfeit and intending to use them as genuine. All three pleaded guilty and the trial judge in accepting their pleas sentenced the other two accused to a term of imprisonment for two years but sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of three years, the trial judge distinguishing his case on the ground that he was the main culprit and also because he had tried to mislead the court by informing the court through his counsel that the counterfeits were so well done as to be hardly distinguishable from genuine notes of the same denominations.
Before me, through his counsel, he has appealed against the sentence on the grounds that the trial judge ought to have taken his plea of guilty as a mitigating factor and ought not to have imported the trial judge`s own view that the counterfeit notes were so badly made as to be obvious to the trial judge and therefore obvious to the appellant who had considerable experience in dealing with tourists and therefore personal knowledge of what are genuine US currency notes. Another ground was that the trial judge failed to take into consideration the evidence of good character. In principle I consider it proper that where an accused person pleads guilty the court in assessing sentence ought to consider such a plea as a mitigating factor. What weight ought to be given by the court depends on the other facts made known to the court at the time the sentence is considered. Similarly good character is always a circumstance which a court ought to consider in assessing sentence.
As regards the other ground of appeal namely that it was wrong in law for the trial judge to reject the statement made on his behalf by his counsel that at the time when he accepted the notes in payment for the goods purchased from him he did not realise they were counterfeits merely on the trial judge`s own view of the nature of the forgeries in question. I consider the point well taken in that in so far as arriving at the finding of facts as to whether the forged document, in this case a currency note, is or is not a good forgery, it is undesirable for a trial judge without the benefit of any evidence at all on the question to import his own view of the forgeries in question. This being the position as I see it I can properly review the sentence imposed when considering what is a proper sentence on the facts as appear in the record before me.
Now, the first factor is that his two other co-accused were sentenced to a term of two years` imprisonment. Although the appellant appeared to be the main culprit in that he started the chain of events which led to the other two accused coming into possession of the forgeries, on the face of the record, and this appears not to be contradicted, a reasonable explanation was given that he had received them in payment of goods sold by him. Taking into consideration the fact that he had pleaded guilty, the fact that he had a good character, the fact that for a person in his situation in life a sentence of imprisonment however short it may be would be a real punishment for this offence in every sense of the word for him and the fact that his other two co-accused were sentenced to a lesser term of imprisonment I would reduce the sentence to a similar term of two years. Having regard to the reasons I have earlier stated, the sentence will run from the same date as the sentences in respect of the other two accused.

The plaintiff was employed by the defendants at the defendants` factory to mill rubber. It was the plaintiff`s duty as such employee to feed unmilled rubber to two revolving rollers which were part of the machine which was in the defendants` factory. On 14 December 1968, while the plaintiff was in the course of his duties the plaintiff`s right hand got caught between the rollers and was crushed.
The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendants for damages for personal injuries, the statement of claim alleging that `the system which the defendants knew or ought to have known was used by the plaintiff for doing the said work was for the plaintiff to use his hands to feed the blocks or sheets of rubber to the running in point of the two rollers and when the rubber did not go between the rollers to use his hands to force it between the rollers`. It is further alleged in the statement of claim that: 
 
the said system was known or should have been known to the defendants to be unsafe in that there was a risk that the plaintiff`s hands might be caught between the rollers and thereby crushed. The said system was rendered even more unsafe in that the rubber was subjected to water during the operation of feeding it to the rollers and an operator`s hands were liable to slip when forcing the rubber between the rollers and/or the rubber block or sheet was liable to be gripped first on one side of its width and thus cause the operator`s hands on that side to slip forward to the nip of the rollers. Under a safe system, the plaintiff or the machine would have been provided with an implement or device for placing the rubber at the running in points of the rollers and/or the machine would have been provided with a guard which prevented the operator`s hands from reaching the nip of the rollers.
 
 
 
Further or alternatively the plaintiff alleged that the accident was caused by the defendants` breach of statutory duty in `failing to fence securely, or at all, the rollers or the nip of the rollers of the said machine, a dangerous part of machinery, when the same were not in such a position or such construction as to be safe to the plaintiff employed or working on the premises as it would if securely fenced, - contrary to s 22(1) of the said Ordinance. (Factories Ordinance, 1958.)`
The defendants put in a defence denying both negligence and breach of statutory duty. The defendants in their defence alleged that `the duties of the plaintiff consisted merely of feeding unmilled rubber to rollers which were left in constant revolution by a central control` and `all that the plaintiff had to do was to place the unmilled rubber in such a way as to cause the revolving rollers to grip the unmilled rubber and thereafter to leave it alone and let it pass through the revolving rollers`, and `if the unmilled rubber could not be gripped by the revolving rollers or where having been gripped but at some stage it could not pass through, all that the plaintiff had to do was to apply a little pressure to the unmilled rubber and if this still did not work, to reject the unmilled rubber which sometimes falls off by itself or to take away with a slight tug`.
The defendants denied that the system of work was unsafe and alleged that the plaintiff was himself negligent. The defendants also raised an alternative plea of contributory negligence.
The evidence of the plaintiff was shortly this. Prior to 11 December 1967, he was working at the Aik Hoe Rubber Factory as an apprentice milling rubber. On 11 December 1967, he started work with the defendants doing the same job. That day the supervisor of the defendants, Tan Kai Sin, who recommended him to the job, demonstrated to him how to do the work. The supervisor picked up a piece of rubber from the ground by the thick end with two hands, then pushed the thinner end into the rollers of the machine, after the thin end had got into the rollers he used the palm of his hands and pushed the thick end until it came to the end. The supervisor repeated this operation two or three times and then asked him to mill the rubber while the supervisor watched. After watching him for a while the supervisor left to do his rounds and he carried on with his job. The supervisor came round periodically to watch him do his job. On 12 December he was milling rubber and the supervisor came round periodically to supervise his work.
On 14 December he met with the accident. He said: 
 
I picked up the rubber by the thick end and fed the thin end into the rollers. Once the rubber had been gripped by the rollers I then pushed the rubber with the palm of my hands. Slightly more than 1/2 the rubber had been fed through the rollers. When the left side of the rubber got stuck the rubber on the right hand side went in fast. The rubber on the left side came. ... The left side got stuck, the right continued into the roller. I do not know how my fingers of the right hand got into the rollers. At that time I was exerting pressure with my right hand.
 
 
 
The machine I was operating, there was a switch at the top of the roller, what I mean is that there is a bar above the rollers as can be seen in photo D1, when the bar is pulled down towards me then the rollers would stop. It was to be used in case of emergency. If the rubber got stuck this emergency switch was not to be used but I was to use the other switch a brake which is on right of the photo D1: if I pull the brake the roller stops. Then the supervisor would come and attend to the machine.
I was instructed by the supervisor for five to ten minutes. He told me all this, about the brake and the switch, at that time. On day of accident one side of rubber got stuck and the right side went on. I had no opportunity to pull the brake as it was on the right. I got puzzled and I did not know if I pulled the switch or someone pulled it. When the left side got caught I had no time to pull the brake but I had time to pull the switch before my right hand was caught. My right hand was caught. I had no time to either pull the brake or pull down the switch.
Tan Kai Sin (DW 1), the defendants` supervisor, said in evidence: 
 
On the first day of his job I demonstrated the work for the plaintiff to see. At first he came he did not know how to work, then I demonstrated to him with pieces of rubber; I put the rubber into the milling machine until it is gripped and it went through, then I put the second piece of rubber and again it went through. The piece of rubber was of this width, 11/2 ft to two ft and this thick, about three inches and the other end was about four inches thick.
 
 
 
I fed the rubber into the milling machine. I carried the rubber and feed it to the machine and I let go of the rubber and stood there until it went through; then I picked up the rubber which had gone through from under the machine and placed it at the side. Then I feed in the second piece of rubber and let go the rubber, stood by until it went through, then I pulled the rubber from underneath the machine and placed it at the side. That morning I put in seven or eight such pieces. 
 
Yin: It has been suggested by the plaintiff that when you demonstrated what you did was you picked the piece of rubber and put it between the nip of the rollers and then with the palm of your hands you forced the rubber while it was going through the rollers until the end. Did you do that?
No, I did not do that.
 
 
 
Yin: Why did you say you did not do that?
If you do that there is danger that your fingers would be caught by the rollers. 
Sometimes some part of the rubber does not go through the rollers, if that happens it is taken out and thrown away.
 
 
 
To Court: It is taken out from the rollers and thrown away. The rubber is not stuck there, it could be taken away.
 
 
 
There is a safety disc somewhere inside here (points to right of the rollers in photo D1), which cannot be seen. When the rubber get stuck the safety disc is broken and a new one is replaced. When the safety disc is broken the machine would stop.
 
 
 
If part of the rubber could not go through the rollers it is thrown away. If the rubber that could not go through does not drop then it is stuck in the rollers, then a new disc is placed and a fresh piece of rubber is replaced. 
 
Yin:
 
Plaintiff has said that you have taught him that if some part of the rubber cannot pass through the rollers he has to use his hands and force it right through.
I did not teach him in that manner.
 
 
 
The pieces of rubber that dropped off or could not go through the rollers they are put away by the side for re-cutting.
 
 
 
Yin:
 
The plaintiff also told the court you also instructed him as part of his work to take these pieces of dropped-off rubber and force them through the machine.)
No, I did not instruct him.
 
 
 
After I had watched the plaintiff I asked him if he could do the work and he said `Yes` and I was satisfied that he could do the work.
 
 
 
After that I left the plaintiff and went to do my work. I came back to plaintiff again to see how he was going on. I came back to see plaintiff seven or eight times. Each time I came to see plaintiff I was satisfied with his work, I did not see plaintiff push the rubber through the rollers with his hnds on any of the occasions that I came to see him.
On 13 December 1967 the plaintiff was again milling rubber. I went round to see him work and I was satisfied he was doing the right thing.
On 14 December 1967 the plaintiff commenced work at about 7am. I went round to supervise his work; he was milling the rubber the correct way.
At 9.25am that morning an accident happened to the plaintiff.
The defendants called Ong Chin Hock (DW 3) who works in the defendants` factory milling rubber. He said: 
 
When I joined defendants` factory I was under the supervision of DW 1. On my first day of work DW 1 demonstrated to me how the work was to be done. DW 1 took a piece of rubber and fit it into the roller, then the rubber goes through the roller, I had to stand away from the rollers and let the rubber go through. After that I picked another piece of rubber and fit it in and go through the same process. DW 1 did not tell me that I had to push the rubber with both hands right to the end.
 
 
 
At times as the rubber is going through some part of the rubber would not go through that was due to the safety disc being broken; the machine would stop and I had to replace a new disc. Sometimes part of the rubber would go through and some part would not go through, in that case the part that would not go through would drop off by itself. The drop off pieces are put aside for re-cutting.
In my experience in other factories the same system used in feeding the machine. I have never used force to push the rubber through the machine.
In cross-examination he said: 
 
I have milled block rubber. When it grips into the roller I let go my hand. Yes I hold on to the rubber but until 1/4 of the piece had gone into the roller then I take my hands away, and water would splash out so I stood away. The more experienced worker would feed the rubber more before taking the hands off. Now I am experienced it is quite alright for me to guide the rubber through with my hands.
 
 
 
Yes that day there were other people milling block rubber as well; yes they would be experienced rubber millers, yes they would be guiding the rubber through.
Re-examination he said: 
 
If the rubber does not get through I push it a little with both hands. For an experienced person he pushes the rubber right to the end.
 
 
 
The defendants also called on another employee, Cher Ngak Poon (DW 4), and he gave evidence as to the method of milling rubber demonstrated by Tan Kai Sin when he first joined the factory and his evidence was similar to that of Ong Chin Hock. In cross-examination he said: 
 
I know DW 3 (Ong Chin Hock). He is an experienced miller; he is a friend of mine.
 
 
 
Cashin: DW 3 said for experienced millers once they put rubber in the rollers they guide it through with their hands right the way through.
Not necessary. I do not do it.
 
 
 
Cashin: He also says occasionally you have to use a little force to put it in.
 
 
 
Then the rollers are tightened and the rubber would drop off. That is what I do.
 
 
 
If they liked that way they do it but I don`t do it. Not true we all push the rubber.
I visited the factory of the defendants with the parties before the plaintiff was cross-examined. In the course of cross-examination the plaintiff said: 
 
Yes I visited the factory yesterday afternoon; yes I saw a man milling the same type of rubber as I was milling on day of my accident. Yes I saw that the man after putting in the thin end of the rubber and after it had been gripped by the rollers he stood away from the machine. Yes I saw that some piece of rubber which could not go through the rollers broke off and dropped to the floor. The supervisor taught me a different way. I don`t understand why the man I saw yesterday did what he did but I was taught a different way and I followed the supervisor`s way. Yes that way was what I described to the court yesterday.
 
 
 
Yes in Aik Hoe I would stand aside and wait, and rubber that could not go through would break away and drop down. Yes the man I saw yesterday at the defendant company was doing what was done at Aik Hoe. Not true the supervisor showed me what was done at Aik Hoe.
After considering the evidence before me I have come to the conclusion that the defendants` supervisor, Tan Kai Sin, was speaking the truth. I find that the plaintiff was taught to mill the rubber in the way described by Tan Kai Sin and that the plaintiff was properly instructed in the safe use of this machine. I find that the plaintiff himself was negligent and that was how his fingers were caught in the nip of the rollers. The plaintiff was negligent in that he failed to pay proper attention to his work and in forcing the rubber between the rollers knowing it was unsafe to do so.
The claim of the plaintiff based on the common law liability of the defendants therefore fails.
I now come to deal with the claim of the plaintiff based on an alleged breach of statutory duty by the defendants.
The breach of statutory duty alleged is the failure to comply with the requirements of s 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958. That subsection is as follows: 
 
Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced.
 
 
 
Provided that, insofar as the safety of a dangerous part of any machinery cannot by reason of the nature of the operation be secured by means of a fixed guard, the requirements of this sub-section shall be deemed to have been complied with if a device is provided which automatically prevents the operator from coming into contact with that part.
The first question that arises is whether or not the nip formed by the two rollers in which the plaintiff caught his hand is a dangerous part of the machinery in the defendants` factory. There can be no doubt that the answer is in the affirmative.
It is argued on behalf of the defendants that the dangerous part of the machinery could not be fenced in any way so that the machine could be worked practically. It was pointed out that that was the view of the Inspector of Factories who had been round to inspect the machinery and the inspector has not required anything to be done.
Section 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958 is similar to s 14(1) of the English Factories Act 1937.
Viscount Simonds in the House of Lords case of 
 John Summers & Sons Ltd 
 v 
 Frost 
 [1955] 1 All ER 870 said at p 872: 
 
My Lords, s 14 of the Factories Act 1937, and its predecessor s 10 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, have on many occasions been discussed in the courts, and I think that their true construction is not in doubt. In particular, I think it is clear that the obligation imposed by the section to fence securely every dangerous part of any machinery, except as in the section mentioned and subject to its proviso, is an absolute obligation. And by that, I mean that it is not to be qualified by such words as `so far as practicable` or `so long as it can be fenced consistently with its being used for the purpose for which it was intended` or similar words. I come to this conclusion for the following reasons which will be elaborated by my noble and learned friend.
 
 
 
First, it appears to me to be an illegitimate method of interpretation of a statute, whose dominant purpose is to protect the workman, to introduce by implication words of which the effect must be to reduce that protection. Secondly, where it has been thought desirable to introduce such qualifying words, the legislature has found no difficulty in doing so. This can be found both in other statutes, of which I need give only one out of many possible examples, viz, 60 & 61 Vict c 60, which, in providing for the fencing of chaff-cutting machines uses the words `so far as is reasonably practicable and consistent with the due and efficient working of the machine` and also in other sections of the statute now under consideration. For instance, in different forms, qualifying words are to be found in ss 18, 19 and 22 and, no doubt, in many other sections. Thirdly, it was decided as long ago as 1919 in 
 Davies v Thomas Owen & Co 
[1919] 2 KB 39
, that the obligation imposed by the comparable s 10 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, was absolute and that, if the result of a machine being securely fenced was that it would not remain commercially practicable or mechanically possible, that did not affect the obligation: the statute would, in effect, prohibit its use. This had been for seventeen years the unchallenged law when the Act of 1937 was passed and that Act, by s 14, substantially repeated the former section. It would be contrary to well established principles of construction to give a different meaning to the new section; see 
 Barras v Aberdeen Steam Trawling & Fishing Co Ltd 
[1933] AC 402
. Fourthly, the proviso to s 14(1) affords a strong indication that the substantive part of it imposes an absolute obligation: for, unless its effect is absolutely to prevent the operator from coming into contact with a dangerous part of the machine, there would be little meaning in the provision of an alternative which has just that effect. Fifthly, the absolute obligation impos ed by s 14(1) is subject to the regulation-making power of the Minister under s 60. I do not think it necessary to decide whether the Act of 1901 contained a similar power. But, in my opinion, it is clear that s 60 of the Act of 1937 enables the Minister by special regulation to modify the absolute obligation of s 14 in regard to such classes or descriptions of factory as he thinks fit. Reading the section as a whole, I do not regard the words `subject to the provisions of this Act` as qualifying the power of modification, but rather as looking forward to s 129. There is thus a consistency in the Act - first a provision for the safety of the workman which is absolute, and secondly a recognition that such a provision may render a particular industrial process practically impossible, and therefore, a power in the Minister, if he thinks fit, and subject always to the power of Parliament to annul the regulation, to relax rigour of the absolute obligation.
For these reasons, I think that the obligation to `securely fence` the machinery here in question is unambiguously absolute and will remain absolute unless and until the Minister makes appropriate regulations.
I entirely and respectfully agree with the opinion of Viscount Simonds.
Section 59 of the Factories Ordinance 1958 gives the Minister power to make special regulations similar to the powers given to the Minister under s 60 of the English Act.
I am of the opinion that the duty imposed by s 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958 is an absolute duty and accordingly, at the time of the accident, the defendants were contravening s 22(1) of the Ordinance.
The next question to consider is whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. As I have said, if the plaintiff had used the machine as he was taught to do this accident would not have happened at all and of course the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. I assess the plaintiff`s liability at 50%.
I now come to deal with the quantum of damages.
The plaintiff sustained a severe crushing injury of his right hand. He was admitted in the orthopaedic unit of the Outram Road General Hospital on 14 December 1967, and was discharged from the ward on 19 January 1968. His fingers were reconstructed and stabilized. Subsequently amputation was done on the index and ring fingers. The middle finger survived but developed an infection. He was re-admitted on 1 March 1968 for a minor surgical procedure involving the removal of a small piece of infected bone from the middle finger and he was discharged on 6 March 1968. The wounds of the right hand have healed leaving behind the middle finger and a little finger which has a flexion deformity and is practically useless. The only use is in the thumb and the middle finger which is only good for pinching. He is unable to carry heavy weights.
For pain and suffering and disability I assess damages at $15,000.
The plaintiff is unable to do his former occupation as a rubber miller. He is at present employed as an attendant at the National Museum at a salary of $145 per month. If he had continued to be a rubber miller his earnings would have been between $175 and $180 per month. There is every likelihood that the plaintiff would continue working at the Museum. I award the sum of $5,000 for loss of future earnings.
Special damage has been agreed at $33.
In the result there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $10,016 and costs.

A cyclist riding along Balestier Road, while being overtaken by a timber lorry 31` 4` long by 6` 8` wide, was knocked down by the lorry and sustained injuries which resulted in his death. The deceased`s personal representatives sued the driver of the lorry for damages on behalf of the estate and for the benefit of the dependants.
At the trial of the action an eye-witness gave evidence that as the deceased cyclist was cycling along Balestier Road the defendant`s lorry driven by the defendant in overtaking the cyclist knocked him down. This evidence was accepted by the trial judge and indeed was not denied by the defendant. The defendant said that he saw the cyclist ahead of him attempting to move towards the right, that he sounded his horn whereupon the cyclist turned back and held a straight course. He drove on, overtook the cyclist and after he had overtaken the cyclist he heard a bang, felt a jerk in the back portion of his lorry and applied his brakes. He said that the cyclist was travelling 11 or 12 feet from the edge of the road and he was driving his lorry on a straight course before and after overtaking the cyclist and that when overtaking the cyclist there was a gap of three or four feet between the cyclist and his lorry.
The trial judge disbelieved the defendant`s evidence that he saw the cyclist attempting to make a right turn and that he overtook the cyclist with a three or four feet gap between them. He found that the defendant was negligent in that he either failed to observe the presence of the cyclist on the road or if he did he failed to give him a sufficiently wide berth. However, he held the cyclist partly to blame, to the extent of one-fifth, because the cyclist should have used an available cycle track and should not have been cycling on the road.
The defendant appealed against the judgment of the trial court but there was no cross-appeal by the plaintiffs on the finding of contributory negligence by reason of the failure of the cyclist to use the cycle track. While counsel for the defendant was making his final address, he was asked by the trial judge to address the court on the question of negligence, on the assumption that the trial judge did not accept the evidence of the eye-witness. The trial judge made no note of what he said nor did counsel for the plaintiffs but counsel for the defendant after he had completed his address to the court `took down in writing what the judge said earlier as best as I could remember`. The note as taken runs thus: 
 
You don`t worry about plaintiff`s witness. Assume I do not accept his evidence. Address me whether there is negligence on the defendant`s evidence alone.
 
 
 
I say if there is a collision between the overtaking and overtaken vehicle there is a presumption of negligence against the overtaking vehicle - that is the law. I shall give you adjournment if you want to look up.
 
 
 
Before the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant/defendant moved this court for an order that the appellant be at liberty to amend the record of appeal by adding the above note taken by counsel at the hearing of the action in the notes of evidence. The motion was supported by an affidavit of Mr M Coomaraswamy who was counsel for the defendant at the trial and who made the above note. Mr Cashin who was counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs at the trial made an affidavit in reply stating that he was unable at this length of time (approximately ten months) from the occasion itself to remember verbatimexactly what was said. The trial judge was asked by this court as to the accuracy of the note made by counsel for the defendant but he was also unable to remember exactly what he had said.
It was submitted to us by counsel for the appellant that this court should accede to his motion as the only contemporaneous note of what the trial judge said was the one made by the defendant`s counsel at the trial and its accuracy was not denied by the trial judge and by counsel who appeared for the plaintiffs at the trial. We dismissed the motion. It is not the practice of the courts in Singapore to have a 
 verbatim 
shorthand note taken of the entire proceedings in court. If it is intended that any note taken by counsel at the trial of an action be accepted as part of the notes of evidence for use by an appellate court, it is desirable that the trial judge and counsel for the other party or parties should be supplied at the earliest possible opportunity with a copy of the note so made for correction or acceptance or otherwise. If the trial judge and counsel for all parties agree to the original or a corrected version then such agreed original or corrected version can properly be included in the record of appeal as part of the notes of evidence. Where no version can be so agreed, then in any application for leave to include the note made or taken by counsel at the trial, the affidavit in support of the application ought to set out the circumstances under which the note was made or taken and the steps taken to obtain the agreement of all concerned together with all correspondence relating to the attempt to obtain such agreement.
In the present case, having regard to the fact that the application was made at a very late stage in the proceedings and the fact that the trial judge and counsel for the plaintiffs at the trial were unable to say whether or not the note made by Mr Coomaraswamy was an accurate verbatimnote of what the trial judge had said at the trial, we thought it right that the application should be dismissed.
At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Ian Hill, counsel for the appellant, argued that as the eye-witness had been totally discredited at the trial so that his evidence must have been rejected by the trial judge and notwithstanding the fact that the trial judge had also rejected the evidence of the defendant lorry driver, the trial judge was wrong in coming to the conclusion that the defendant was negligent in failing to observe the presence of the cyclist on the road or if he did in failing to give the cyclist a sufficiently wide berth so that the defendant`s negligence was the cause of the injuries suffered by the cyclist. His submission was that the trial judge was not entitled to draw the inference that the driver of an overtaking vehicle is negligent solely and simply from the fact that his overtaking vehicle collides with the overtaken vehicle. The burden being on the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant is negligent, the trial judge ought, so he submitted, to have dismissed the action. Mr Ian Hill`s other submission was that if on the evidence before him the trial judge was unable to say how the collision occurred then be ought to have held both the cyclist and the lorry driver equally to blame, relying on the oft-cited case of 
 Baker v Market Harborough Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
.
On the first submission, while we did not disagree with counsel`s submission that no inference of law or fact adverse to the driver of an overtaking vehicle can be drawn solely and simply from a collision between the overtaken and overtaking vehicles, we were of the opinion that there was ample evidence, which was not disputed, for the trial judge to draw the inference that the appellant failed to give the cyclist a sufficiently wide berth. The appellant had testified that he saw the cyclist keeping a straight course and that he then overtook the cyclist giving him a berth of three or four feet. The trial judge found that the appellant was not speaking the truth when he said he gave the cyclist a berth of three or four feet. It follows, in our view, that the trial judge must have found as a fact that the defendant in overtaking the cyclist did so with a gap of less than three feet between the cyclist and the nearside of his lorry. Having regard to the fact that the appellant was overtaking a cyclist, that the lorry was 31` 4` long by 6` 8` wide and was a timber carrying lorry, the back portion of which was a trailer, that the cyclist was keeping a straight course as the lorry was about to overtake him, that the brake marks left by the lorry after the collision indicated that the lorry also kept a straight course while overtaking, we were of the opinion that it was not wrong for the trial judge to infer that the collision was caused by the failure of the appellant to give a sufficiently wide berth when overtaking the cyclist.
We accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs.

Whether motorcyclist or bus driver to blame
 
At the conclusion of the hearing we allowed the appeal indicating that we would give our reasons at a later date. We now proceed to do so.
The first respondent, a passenger in a bus No SH 706 belonging to the second respondent, was injured as a result of a collision between bus No SH 706 and a bus No SH 190 belonging to the third respondent. She brought an action in the High Court against the first and second respondents as well as against the appellant, the owner and rider of motor cycle No SAG 3250 which was also involved in the same collision. The first respondent alleged her injuries were caused by the negligent driving of the servant of the second respondent, or alternatively by the negligent driving of the servant of the third respondent, or alternatively by the negligent riding of the appellant or alternatively on the part of any two or all of them.
The High Court gave judgment for the first respondent in the sum of $5,500 against the appellant the owner of the motor cycle and dismissed with costs the claim against the second and third respondents. It was ordered that the first, second and third respondents` costs of the action as between party and party be taxed and paid by the appellant.
The appellant appeals against that part of the learned judge`s decision with regard to liability.
The undisputed facts were shortly these. The appellant stopped his motor cycle in the middle of River Valley Road intending to turn right into Leonie Hill Road. Bus SH 706 (hereinafter referred to as the Hock Lee bus) was coming from the opposite direction along River Valley Road. Bus SH 190 (hereinafter referred to as the Tay Koh Yat bus) was coming along River Valley Road behind the appellant`s motor cycle. On reaching the appellant`s motor cycle the Tay Koh Yat bus suddenly swerved to its right collided with the motor cycle and went to the wrong side of the road and collided into the Hock Lee bus. As a result of the collision between the two buses the first respondent, who was a passenger in the Hock Lee bus, sustained personal injuries.
During the trial it was conceded by the appellant that the driver of the Hock Lee bus was not to blame at all. The third respondent similarly attributed no fault to the driver of the Hock Lee bus. The contest was then between the appellant and the third respondent. The learned trial judge said: 
 
The sole question in issue was whether the bus driver of the Tay Koh Yat bus (of the second defendant) who was travelling along his correct side of the road down River Valley Road away from the City down a slight slope or the third defendant, motorcyclist who had previously been travelling down the same slope ahead of this bus or both were to blame for the collision which occurred between the two buses. The Hock Lee bus had been all along travelling on its own correct side of the road in the opposite direction.
 
 
 
The evidence of the appellant was that he was stationary in the middle of the road. He heard a loud sound behind him. When he turned his head round to look, the Tay Koh Yat bus came and collided into him and then went to the other side of the road and collided into the Hock Lee bus.
The driver of the Tay Koh Yat bus said that he was travelling behind a lorry at a speed of between 15 to 20 mph. He saw a motor cycle in the middle of the road waiting to turn right into Leonie Hill Road. After the lorry had passed the motor cycle, on the motor cycle`s left, and when he was seven to ten ft from the motor cycle, the motor cycle suddenly swerved left across his path. He swerved violently to the right to avoid colliding with the motor cycle and went to the wrong side of the road and on seeing vehicles approaching from the front he swerved to the left and there was a collision with the Hock Lee bus which was coming from the opposite direction.
The driver of the Hock Lee bus said that he did not see any other vehicle involved in the accident and he did not know why the Tay Koh Yat bus swerved to its right.
The learned trial judge found that the appellant swerved to his left across the path of the Tay Koh Yat bus and he found that the appellant was solely to blame for the accident. In his grounds of decision the learned judge said: 
 
All things considered, I found that the third defendant was not stationary in the centre of the road when hit. If he had been he would have been killed on the spot. I found that for reasons best known to himself or as a result of his inexperience he changed his mind about entering Leonie Hill Road to his right and swerved to his left across the path of the bus driver who had no alternative except to swerve to the right himself.
 
 
 
It must be borne in mind that this claim is by a passenger who was travelling in the Hock Lee bus and that the collision was between the two buses. It was the Tay Koh Yat bus that went to the wrong side of the road and collided into the Hock Lee bus. The onus, therefore, rests upon the third respondent to show that the Tay Koh Yat bus went to the wrong side of the road without any negligence on the part of their driver.
The main question is, has the third respondent discharged that onus? In our view they have not.
The trial judge accepted the evidence of the driver of the bus and rejected the evidence of the motor cyclist on the ground that if the motor cyclist had remained stationary he would have been killed on the spot and also that he was a most evasive witness who continuously shifted his ground. The trial judge accordingly preferred the version given by the driver of the bus.
It is clear, therefore, that the trial judge did not base his preference for the version of the driver of the bus on demeanour and furthermore this court, as an appellate court, is under a duty to re-hear the case by examining the evidence and arriving at its own finding, but always bearing in mind it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and paying due regard to the trial judge`s finding and his reasons therefore. The fact that the motor cyclist would have died on the spot had he remained stationary is a conclusion which, in our opinion, cannot be supported on the evidence before him. That conclusion seems to us to be a matter of pure conjecture. Again the conclusion of the trial judge that the motor cyclist continuously shifted his ground in his evidence cannot be supported. He told a simple story from beginning to end namely that he remained stationary on the middle of the road waiting to turn right into Leonie Hill Road when he was hit by the bus and thrown clear to the left.
The question remains, which version is the more probable of the two? It is impossible to accept as true or possible the bus driver`s evidence that travelling at a speed of between 15 to 20 mph his bus not more than seven to ten feet from the motor cyclist, stationary on the middle of the road, that the motor cyclist could swerve left suddenly and be across the path of his bus and that he could manage to, at the same time, swerve violently right and manage to strike a mere glancing blow on the motor cycle.
As often happens, a court on the evidence before it, has to decide which of two conflicting versions is the version to accept. In such a case, a court in considering which is the more probable one, ought to try and derive what assistance it can get from undisputed facts, if any, which are relevant for the purpose. A court also ought to consider, from undisputed facts, whether a version put forward as evidence is one which is inherently improbable or not.
For all these reasons, we had no hesitation at the conclusion of the hearing in coming to the conclusion that the motor cyclist`s version was the more probable one and accordingly we allowed the appeal.

Section 379 Penal Code (Cap 119, 1955 Rev Ed)
 
This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against the sentences imposed by a magistrate on the two respondents on conviction for three offences of theft of plants punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code read with s 34 of the Penal Code. The value of the plants on the first charge was $10, on the second charge $6 and on the third charge $50. Each respondent was fined $50 on each charge.
At the trial the respondents were represented by counsel and they pleaded guilty to the three charges. The brief facts given by the prosecution, as recorded by the magistrate, were as follows: 
 
Complainant is PC 8851 attached to RW Div. On 15 May 1970 at 11pm to 16 May at 7am complainant and another police officer were placed on static duty at Woodlands Road 121/2m/s to keep observation of plants planted by PWD.
 
 
 
On 16 May 1970 at 1.20am the two police officers saw two persons in a motor car SK 9185 driven slowly at Woodlands 121/2m/s.
Driver was accused No 2. Accused No 1 was the passenger.
The police officers saw the car stopping by the side of road divider near some plants.
First accused got down from the car and seen pulling out an Arancasia plant from the road divider. Police approached and arrested him. Second accused saw this and drove off. The police officers with assistance of a member of public drove towards Bukit Panjang police station. On their way, they saw motor car SK 9185 parked by the side of the road. They saw second accused throwing out some plants from the vehicle.
Attempts were made by the police officers to stop the car. She drove off. Whilst driving away she was seen to be throwing away some more plants.
At Bukit Panjang police station, the police officers reported.
A short while later, second accused surrendered. The car was examined and found to contain mud and sand at the rear seat.
Police investigations started. They went to 12_ m/s. Woodlands where they discovered five Acalypha Wilkesiana plants, three Dieffen Bachia Rudolf Roehrs plants.
Both accused subsequently led police to Holland Road in front of GHQ. Tanglin where they pointed out two empty flower pots where five Acalypha Wilkesiana plants were stolen. They also took the police to Cluny Road in front of Botanical Gardens and pointed out three empty pots where the three Dieffen Bachia Rudolf Roehrs plants were stolen.
All the plants belonged to PWD. Both accused subsequently admitted in their cautioned statements the theft of the plants.
The facts given were admitted by the two respondents and they were convicted on all the three charges.
Counsel for the respondents addressed the court in mitigation. The record of the magistrate reads: 
 
Mitigation: Mr Advani on behalf:
 
 
 
The man and his fiancee shortly to be married. First accused is a flight engineer. They had just acquired a home to be matrimonial home. They did this on spur of the moment. They had been co-operative after arrests. I don`t know the future of my clients. Your honour can guess.
 
 
 
My clients say they are prepared to make restitution for full value of the plants if any are damaged. I invite your honour to take into account there are three counts. They are not criminals but just stupid.
The magistrate fined each of the respondent $50 on each charge. At the request of the prosecution, the magistrate ordered the car seized by the police to be returned to the second respondent.
The magistrate in his grounds of decision gave his reasons for passing those sentences. The magistrate said: 
 
I was aware that the offence of theft of public property is a serious one. On the other hand there were several mitigating factors which had induced me to be lenient with the accused. It was shown by the facts and through the plea of mitigation that the accused had been co-operative after their arrests. Their plea of guilt and their offer of making good any damage they had caused to the flowers showed that they realized that their act was wrong. In any case, a record of conviction against the first accused who is a flight engineer is sufficient punishment in itself in view of his profession and background. Furthermore, the prosecution requested that the motor-car be returned to the second accused.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, I imposed a fine of $50 on each charge which I felt was adequate and hoped that they had learnt a lesson from their foolish act.
At the hearing of the appeal written factual submissions on behalf of the two respondents were put before the court. In these submissions the personal history of the respondents were given and the events of 15 May 1970 were set out and the respondents gave the reasons why they were driving around at 1.20am and the circumstances under which they committed these offences.
[The learned judge then summarised these submissions, which for purposes of this report are omitted, and continued:]
It is an established principle that an appellate court will not enhance a sentence unless it is manifestly inadequate or wrong in principle.
The object of punishment is stated by the learned editors of 10 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (3rd Ed) at p 487 para 889 as follows: 
 
The object of punishment is the prevention of crime, and every punishment is intended to have a double effect, namely, to prevent the person who has committed a crime from repeating the act or omission and to prevent other members of the community from committing similar crimes.
 
 
 
As regards the particular offender there are three ways of providing by punishment against the recurrence of an offence: 
 
(1) by taking from him the power of offending (incapacitation);
(2) by taking away the desire of offending (reformation); 
(3) by making him afraid of offending (intimidation).
 
 
 
In some cases, besides providing for the prevention of crimes in future, punishment may also include reparation for the past injury by ordering the offender to compensate the person injured.
 
 
 
As regards other members of the community who are disposed to commit similar offences, the only way of providing by punishment against the commission of the offence is by the deterrent effect which the punishment of an individual has upon others.
In deciding the appropriate sentence a court should always be guided by certain considerations. The first and foremost consideration is the public interest. Hilbery J in 
 R v Ball 
(1951) 35 Cr App R 164 at p 165 said: 
 
The criminal law is publicly enforced, not only with the object of punishing crime, but also in the hope of preventing it. A proper sentence, passed in public, serves the public interest in two ways. It may deter others who might be tempted to try crime as seeming to offer easy money on the supposition, that if the offender is caught and brought to justice, the punishment will be negligible. Such a sentence may also deter the particular criminal from committing a crime again, or induce him to turn from a criminal to an honest life. The public interest is indeed served, and best served, if the offender is induced to turn from criminal ways to honest living.
 
 
 
The maximum punishment for an offence of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or a fine or both.
I agree with the magistrate that the offence of theft of public property is a serious one. Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case into consideration I do not consider that a sentence of imprisonment is called for in this case.
The magistrate in deciding to be lenient with the respondents has failed to consider the public interest which is, as I have said, the first and foremost consideration. He has allowed certain considerations, namely (1) that a record of conviction against the first respondent is sufficient punishment in itself in view of the first respondent`s profession and background and (2) that the prosecution had requested that the motor car be returned to the second respondent, to weigh with him which should not rightly have been brought into consideration in this matter. Furthermore he has failed to take into consideration the financial position of the respondents.
The record shows that police officers were placed on static duty at Woodlands Road to keep watch over the plants, a measure no doubt necessitated by the frequent theft of plants there.
The respondents have submitted that there was no consciousness on their part when they picked the plants that that was theft. This I cannot accept. People with a good education like the respondents must surely know that that was theft. It was not from ignorance that the respondents had committed these offences.
Again it is submitted that consideration should be given to the possibility of the first respondent losing his job with the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. I am clearly of the view that the sentence ought to reflect the opinion of the court on the offence proved in the circumstances and the court ought not to take into account the possible or even the certain dismissal of the first respondent.
I am of the view that a fine of $50 on each charge in this case is manifestly inadequate. The fine is so low that the respondents would not feel the punishment and it would not serve as a salutary lesson to them and would not deter others from committing a similar offence.
Regard must be had to the costly effort by the Government to make Singapore a garden city. Many plants planted by the Government to beautify the State will disappear if people like the respondents could get away with a lenient sentence when they steal plants from public gardens to plant them in their own gardens. Plants can easily and cheaply be bought from the Botanical Gardens and from the very many flower gardens and there was no need for the respondents to steal them from the road side. The action of the respondents was disgraceful.
For these reasons I allow the appeal and enhance the sentence by increasing the fine to a fine, against each of the respondents, of $100 on the first charge in default two weeks` imprisonment, $100 on the second charge in default two weeks` imprisonment, and $200 on the third charge in default one month`s imprisonment.

The first respondent, who is the first plaintiff in the action, was involved in a collision on 21 June 1966 with a motor car driven by the appellant, the defendant in the action. At the time of the collision the first respondent was riding a motor-cycle and was not wearing a crash helmet. He was then seventeen and a half years old and in the first year of the Higher School Certificate class in the Arts stream after having obtained a Grade II pass in the Senior Cambridge Examination. In his school report for 1965 his teacher said `Should try for Grade I. Capable of better work`.
As a result of the accident he suffered personal injuries. When admitted into hospital shortly after the accident he was in a state of coma, reacting only to pain. He had fractures around the wrist of both arms. An X-ray of the skull revealed no fractures, but although during the next few days his coma became lighter he did not recover consciousness and after ten days he again lapsed into a deep coma. Further tests were made and though no blood clot was found the electro-encephalogram suggested deep-seated brain damage.
The consultant neurologist advised conservative treatment and not brain surgery. A tracheotomy was done for breathing and gastrostomy for feeding. Eighteen days after his admission into hospital he regained consciousness. Twenty six days after the accident the consultant neurologist reported that he was `unable to speak due to motor asphasia and the picture was consistent with vascular involvement of the left side of the brain which was of a degree that although some further improvement would be possible, a residual defect would be likely`.
He continued to improve steadily though slowly but when he was discharged from hospital on 3 August 1966 he was just able to understand speech and to take food by mouth. At that date he weighed about 75 to 80 lbs as against his pre-accident weight of 120 lbs and he could not utter a word. For the next few months he had to be spoon fed and a servant had to be employed for the first nine months to look after him and to attend to his needs.
According to his father, after six months he was able to talk about 20 to 25% of his normal self but was unable to read or write. The father had to teach him to read and write and it was like teaching a four year old child. His memory had gone and he had difficulty in remembering what he had been taught. His father work ceaselessly and patiently to rehabilitate him and about eighteen months after the accident sent him to classes run by the Adult Education Board to continue his studies as a student in the Higher School Certificate class. However, as he could not keep up with the class and his work was so bad, the father on the advice of doctors, discontinued his attendance. Since then his father, who is the secretary of the Automobile Association of Singapore, has taken him regularly to the father`s office and allowed him to do some typing work on an unpaid basis.
The medical reports of three specialist doctors who examined him show the effect of the head injury. We reproduce these reports hereunder:

Re: Chan Swei Yueh, A 56274
 
 
 
This case was seen by me on 2 July 1966 at the request of the `A` Surgical unit. He had a traffic accident on 21 June 1966 and was admitted in coma and remained stuporese.
 
 
 
Examination showed that he was immobile with right hemparesis including face, and further investigation of carotid angiogram and electro-encephalogram was carried out. The angiogram was normal, but the encephalogram showed the presence of a delta rhythm bilaterally, but more persistent on the left temporo-parietal area, suggesting deep-seated brain damage.
 
 
 
He was reassessed on 7 July 1966 when he was conscious, and unable to speak due to motor asphasia and the picture was consistent with vascular involvement of the left side of the brain, which was of a degree that although some further improvement would be possible, a residual defect would be likely. As the course was not likely to be affected by surgery, he was advised conservative treatment.

Specialist Report on Chan Swei Yueh (Orth 0357/66)
 
 
 
I would refer you to the specialist report issued by Professor Gunn dated 25 January 1967. Further to this report the patient states that he still walks very slowly and is not able to run and he has difficulty in writing fast.
 
 
 
On examination he walks with a very stactic gait, he certainly is not able to run, he has very brisk reflexes in the upper and lower limbs, and there is hypertonicity of all muscle groups. With regard to the fractures of the upper limbs, on the left side supination is limited by approximately forty-five degrees, pronation limited by approximately fifteen degrees, at the left wrist dorsiflexion is full whereas palmar-flexion is limited by approximately forty-five degrees. Moreover radial and ulnar deviations are approximately half the normal range. On the right side pronation is limited by twenty degrees and supination is also limited by approximately twenty degrees. The movements of the right wrist appear to be of normal range. The grip in both hands is a little weak. The lower end of the left ulna is dislocated and protruding dorsally and there is slight bowing of the lower forearm on the right side.
 
 
 
OPINION:There is no doubt that this person sustained a severe head injury and as a result of this head injury this patient is now a spastic and will remain a spastic for the rest of his life. This accounts for his inability to run and the slowness of his writing. The function of the forearm is reasonably good in view of his injuries but I feel that excision of the lower end of the ulna on the left side would be indicated in the future. In summarising my opinion is this patient will not show any further recovery. If for the assessment of the cerebral damage which appears not to have affected his intellect but only the muscle co-ordinating centres, you want a specialist opinion I would suggest that you contact a physician.

Re: Richard Chan Swei Yueh
 
 
 
The previous descriptions by Professor Gunn, and Dr Cheong June Chao and Dr Gwee Ah Leng give a clear picture of the case at the time they were written.
 
 
 
It is obvious from the duration of the coma, the alternation of reflexes and the bloody CSF that there had been severe brain damage.
 
 
 
I examined him in February 1968 at the request of Mr DWC Gawne - Mr Gawne`s letter attached - . At that time he was very unsure of himself and the final outlook was in doubt. Certain physical signs were present which indicated bilateral brain damage. He was slow at night school and his father had to take him away. Since then he has been employed (largely occupational therapy) in his father`s office. The father has been very sensible about him and has encouraged him.
 
 
 
On examining Richard Chan on 17 December 1968 he had made considerable improvement, was far more confident and he assessed himself as about 80% recovered. He seemed an honest boy, 
 not unintelligent and is likely to be able to earn a living,
but at a lower level than he would have done had he not had the accident.
 
 
 
He still cannot run and has rather stiff legs. The strength is good. He says he feels the left leg weaker than the right, and the right hand is weaker than the left. There were abnormal reflexes, both in the arms and legs but there was not very much loss of function. The arms and hands: excellent function considering there has been injury. Legs on the whole very good function but rather less so than the upper extremities.
 
 
 
The EEG showed pathological discharges on overbreathing otherwise normal.
 
 
 
I would say that considering that this boy had severe brain damage, he has done very well largely due to the efforts of his father. What handicap there is, is likely to be permanent and it is possible that he may get fits later on. As a result of the accident he has had several years of disability.
 
 
 
GA Ransome,
 
 
 
Professor of Medicine,
 
 
 
Outram Road General Hospital,
 
 
 
Singapore 3.
 
 
 
During the hearing of the action Prof Pillay, Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery, said he examined the first plaintiff on 8 May 1969 and found his condition still the same with no likelihood of any further improvement. Prof Ransome, Professor of Medicine, said that in his opinion the first plaintiff was about 30% of his old self with no possibility of any improvement in the brain damage, would never rise above that of a despatch clerk in an office and that it was doubtful if he would get employment in the open market. He may develop epilepsy and his chances of marriage were very slim.
It is convenient at this stage to observe that when the case was called for hearing on 19 May 1969 the defence was confined to a mere denial of negligence and an alternative plea of `unavoidable accident` in that the defendant`s `car skided upon the road which was under repairs with the result that he although exercising all due care and skill was unable to avoid a collision`. As the hearing could not be completed on 19 May 1969 it was resumed on 4 June 1969 and at some stage that day counsel for the defendant applied to amend the defence as follows: 
 
3A Further or in the alternative the first plaintiff contributed to the accident by his own negligence by reason of the fact that at the time thereof he was not wearing a crash helmet.
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiff not objecting to the application, it was granted and evidence was led that at the time of the accident the first plaintiff was not wearing a crash helmet.
No evidence, however, was led, nor were the medical or other witnesses questioned on behalf of the defendant, either before or after the amended defence, on whether or not, and if so to what extent, the wearing of a crash helmet by the first plaintiff would have resulted in less injury to him.
The trial judge held that the defendant was negligent and dismissed the defence of contributory negligence based on para 3A of the amended defence in the following words: 
 
... all that I would say is that there is as yet no statutory regulation requiring motor cyclists to wear crash helmets. The Highway Code is also, I believe, silent on this point. I find no contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff for not wearing a crash helmet. The defendant is entirely to be blamed for this accident.
 
 
 
The trial judge then went on to deal with the quantum and awarded a global sum as compensation for the first plaintiff`s injuries of $115,000 but indicated that the amount of compensation for the pain and suffering and loss of the amenities of life `should be in the region of between $30,000 and $35,000`, and for loss of prospective earnings ought to be based on an average of about $100 per month, and should be in the region of $80,000 to $85,000.
The defendant now appeals on two grounds which are: 
 
1 The learned trial judge treated the fact that the first plaintiff was not wearing a crash-helmet at the material time as one relevant only to the issue of culpability whereas it was relevant also to the question of compensation. The learned trial judge ought to have found as a matter of law that there was a duty upon the first plaintiff to mitigate the damages flowing from the defendant`s negligence and that, as a matter of fact, the failure to wear crash-helmet constituted a failure to discharge that duty.
(2) The quantum of damages awarded to the first plaintiff by the learned trial judge represented a wholly erroneous estimate of the amount which ought to have been awarded to him.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant argued the first ground in this way. He submitted, having regard to the fact that we are in Singapore a highly urbanised community and to the present day road conditions in Singapore, that it is unsafe for a motor cyclist and therefore negligent on his part to ride a motor cycle without wearing a crash helmet as a protection from head injury if he is involved in a collision. He contends that in law such a person owes a duty to himself to mitigate the damages he may suffer through the negligence of other users of the road and that, as a matter of fact, the first plaintiff`s failure to wear a crash helmet constituted a failure to discharge that duty.
So far as the proposition of law is concerned it is admitted that there is as yet no decided authority in support of it and counsel frankly invited us `to make new law`. We are of the opinion, however, that if we accept the proposition put forward by counsel we would be making bad law for in law there can be no duty on a person to minimise the effects or probable consequences of any injury he may suffer, but which he has not as yet suffered, through the negligence of another. The law is clear that just as actionable negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to others, so contributory negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to oneself. In our opinion, for a motor cyclist to ride a motor cycle without wearing protective headgear such as a crash helmet cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a failure on his part, acting as a reasonably prudent man would act, to foresee that he might cause harm to himself. It may well be that a reasonably prudent man would foresee that the wearing of a crash helmet might result in less harm being caused by someone else to him if he is involved in a collision while riding a motor cycle.
In any event, there was no evidence at all before the trial judge that the head injury suffered by the first plaintiff would have been less serious if he had been wearing a crash helmet at the time of the accident. The onus was on the defendant on para 3A of his amended defence to introduce such evidence so as to enable the trial judge to make a finding of fact on this issue.
With regard to the second ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant accepts the trial judge`s estimate of between $30,000 and $35,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities but contends that the figure of between $80,000 and $85,000 for loss of prospective earnings was so excessive as to amount to a wholly erroneous figure. He relies entirely on awards made by English judges in English courts and submits that on the evidence a more correct figure should be somewhere in the region of $50,000.
We have already set out in full the medical evidence. The trial judge on that and the other evidence before him was of the view that the first plaintiff `would in all probability have ended up in life doing a more responsible and consequently a more lucrative sort of work than that of an ordinary clerk`. We accept this assessment and indeed it has not been questioned by the appellant. We also accept, as did the trial judge, Professor Ransome`s opinion that as a result of the accident, he would find difficulty in securing the job of even a despatch clerk in the open employment market. It was also never in dispute that his expectation of life was not affected by the injuries he has suffered.
Having regard to all these factors, although each of us would have awarded a lower figure than $80,000 as damages, for loss of prospective earnings, we are unanimous in the view that the trial judge`s estimate was not wholly erroneous and that, therefore, the global award of $115,000 was also not wholly erroneous.
For all these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal with costs.

The plaintiff in the other suit sat in the front seat next to the taxi driver. The second defendant was driving a lorry filled with sand along Whitley Road towards its junction with Dunearn Road where it collided with the nearside of the taxi and both plaintiffs, were injured.
The first defendant herein was the second defendant in the previous suit and the second defendant herein was the first defendant in the previous suit.
In the previous suit, Buttrose J in the High Court found that the accident occurred at about 7.30am on 10 July 1966, which was a Sunday morning. In the present suit, on the evidence which I have heard, it seems clearer to me that the accident must have occurred at or around 8.00am and not as early as 7.30am. The police who arrived at about 8.15am at the scene on information received about the accident received their first information whilst they were on patrol duty at Boon Teck Road about a couple of miles away at or around 8.05am. The second and the first defendants respectively gave the time of the accident in their police reports as 7.30am and 8.20am. This cannot be correct. The plaintiff said it was about 8.00am. I find from the evidence that the accident must have occurred at about that time and most definitely before 8.20am because the police witnesses who arrived on information received found that the accident had already occurred when they arrived at 8.15 am.
When a police witness, PW 5, arrived at the scene at about 7.00am he found the traffic lights somewhat defective but the accident had not yet occurred. This particular witness, police constable Say Lip Buck arrived at the scene at 7.00am and took control of traffic along Bukit Timah Road at its junction with Stevens Road. He did not observe the state of traffic at the neighbouring junction of Whitley Road with Dunearn Road but the traffic at his junction, ieStevens Road and Bukit Timah Road junction, was piling up and he controlled traffic by hand signals.
According to him the lights were in a state of disorder at that time and were going faster than normal. He saw green/amber/green in Stevens Road and he saw lights going in their proper sequence along Bukit Timah Road to the north, but faster than normal. When originally challenged in court as to the respective speeds of the two sets of lights along Stevens Road and Bukit Timah Road he was only able to say that they were faster than normal but when he was taxed by counsel for the plaintiff as to a statement he had made to Mr Murphy, the senior partner in the same firm as counsel for the plaintiff, he admitted that he was not sure about the evidence he had given before me but agreed that what he had told Mr Murphy in December 1968 was correct and that the lights were going as fast as at one second intervals.
It is important to consider this witness`s evidence very carefully because he was also a witness in the previous proceedings. In the previous suit of course he did not given any evidence of this kind because Mr Murphy saw him only in December 1968, long after that suit had been concluded and decided. The present case with a new plaintiff in respect of the same accident came before me on 20 June 1969 and was part-heard from time to time until 9 March this year. I was apprised of what had occurred in the suit before Buttrose J where he found that the first defendant, the taxi driver, was only a quarter to blame and that the lorry driver who was driving along Whitley Road was three-quarters to blame for the same accident. Buttrose J held that it was palpably obvious to anyone approaching the entire junction, be he pedestrian or motorist, that the lights were defective and that both the defendants should have been on their guard because a situation had arisen which called for the exercise of the utmost care and caution at what was to all intents and purposes an uncontrolled intersection. Buttrose J held that in those circumstances the lorry driver owed a greater duty to traffic approaching from his right along a one way main road than the taxi owed to him.
In the event of appeal, reference will no doubt be made to both the proceedings before Buttrose J and before the Federal Court and perhaps before the Privy Council whatever my decision may be and I do not therefore propose to go into any great detail about those aspects of the evidence which were more or less the same both before Buttrose J and before me.
The plaintiff in this action through his counsel adduced what he considered to be better evidence about the defective state of the lights at this junction than had been adduced before Buttrose J and having considered the evidence before Buttrose J on which the Federal Court (
 Gan Soon Swee & Anor v Ramoo 
 
 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 59
 ) decided that both the defendants were not to blame, I have come to the conclusion on the evidence before me, insofar as it differs from the evidence before Buttrose J, that a different conclusion can be reached from that reached by the Federal Court. I should not be taken to be holding that the evidence before me was perfect but it satisfied me on the case as a whole that the lights were in fact so defective as to have been a warning to the defendants to proceed with the utmost care and caution.
Counsel prevailed upon me to visit the scene which is as familiar to me as it was to Buttrose J but on the occasion that I visited it during the trial I was taken to different positions along Whitley Road and along Dunearn Road to enable me to see from how far away one could see the lights clearly. Buttrose J, I understand, did not consider it necessary to visit the scene because he was familiar with it. Although I myself am familiar with the scene I nevertheless acceded to the request of counsel. Evidence was also called before me as it was not before Buttrose J of a surveyor who submitted a plan (exh P9) from which it is clear that from more than two hundred yards away in either direction the lights in question are visible to a person with good eyesight though they would not necessarily be shining like beacons.
Moreover, a person driving a vehicle along either road would be able to observe the nature of the traffic along the other road fairly easily; at least, in the case of a vehicle travelling along Dunearn Road one could observe a vehicle in Whitley Road coming from one`s left at a distance of 400 feet, almost immediately after passing the electric sub-station along Dunearn Road. Similarly, a person driving a vehicle along Whitley Road should be able to see traffic to his right along Dunearn Road travelling south along that one way street the moment that vehicle in Dunearn Road goes past the electric sub-station.
It should be remembered that before Buttrose J the pleadings did not allege that the lights were known to be defective by either driver. Before me, however, the pleadings were different and particulars of negligence relating to the failure of either driver to notice that lights were out of order and to exercise extra care were in fact added.
Another difference between the evidence given before me and that before Buttrose J was to the following effect. Whereas corporal Abdullah bin Rahman, PW4, who arrived at the scene at 8.45am said that it was possible that lights in both directions were green at certain stages at the same time the evidence before me of experts from the General Electric Company responsible for the maintenance of most of the traffic lights in Singapore (including those at this junction) was that it was virtually impossible for the lights in both directions to be green at the same time. This evidence I accept. There was clear evidence to the effect that the only reason why lights could show green in both directions would be when there was cable shortening. Insulation tests on all underground cables made it quite clear that they were in perfect condition and that there never could have been any cable shortening. Both the experts from the General Electric Company agreed on this.
This has been a somewhat perplexing case in the sense that I have to deliver a judgment without having the benefit of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on an appeal against the decision of the Federal Court in the previous suit as regards the respective degrees of negligence, if any, shown by either driver. In the meantime I am bound by the decision of the Federal Court to a certain extent on the kind of evidence which was before them as recorded by Buttrose J. As I do not know how long it will take before the decision of the Privy Council arrives and as I have already reserved judgment for nearly four months since March this year I have felt it incumbent on me to deliver a judgment as early as possible on the facts as they were presented before me. No doubt different results may appear but that cannot be helped much as I would like to avoid such a situation.
One outstanding feature of this case compared with the evidence before Buttrose J is the fact that the taxi driver himself gave evidence before me. Before Buttrose J on advice, he chose not to give any evidence at all. Another feature is that the plaintiff in the suit before Buttrose J gave evidence of having seen that the lights were green along Dunearn Road. In the case before me, the present plaintiff, the fisheries officer from Sarawak, did not notice what the lights were like at all. As he was seated on the nearside of the back seat it is not surprising that he did not notice the lights as in the case of the plaintiff in the previous suit who was seated next to the driver.
This brings me to the question of the state of the lights on the morning in question and this depends to a very large extent not only on the evidence of police witnesses at the scene who saw them at differing periods between 7.00am and 9.15am after PW4 had switched on the lights at 9.05am. It also largely depends on the view one takes of the evidence of the two experts from the General Electric Company.
Both the experts are agreed that the lights along both Dunearn Road and Whitley Road could not have shown green at the same time. Before Buttrose J there was no such expert evidence and all that Buttrose J had before him on the question of the lights insofar as their being green at the same time was concerned was the evidence of PW4 who said that he saw the lights, at one stage, green at the same time in both directions and this Buttrose J accepted. On the evidence before me, I do not accept that evidence as I prefer the evidence of the two experts.
I now turn to the question of the state of the lights at about 8.00 in the morning of 10 July 1966. It must be remembered that the police witnesses were giving their evidence a long time after the event. It should also be remembered that apart from PW4, who was in charge of traffic investigations, none of the other police witnesses were officers of any high rank or intelligence or experience in the maintenance of traffic lights and they were carrying out purely routine duties such as attending to injured persons, controlling traffic by hand signals, and so on. They were not particularly concerned with the speed of the lights.
It is unfortunate that, at an earlier stage, soon after 7.40am when PW5 reported that the lights were out of order, this was not conveyed to higher authority and that some senior police officer with greater understanding of these matters, say somebody from the traffic police charged with the maintenance of traffic lights in Singapore, did not come to the scene earlier. In so far as the evidence goes the only police officers who gave evidence were people like PW4 and PW5 and a few people who came in mobile patrol vans either to control the traffic by hand or to look after injured persons. It is therefore not surprising that most of them, when taxed about the speed of the lights, were quite unable to be more sure as to the speed at which the lights were changing. Some did not even look at the lights; some did not even see that the lights were out of order because they had other matters to attend to or were dense or obtuse or reluctant to commit themselves or unconcerned with matters outside their limited duties. This is the reason why I would draw attention to the evidence of PW4 and PW5 who showed greater initiative than the others and actually looked at the lights with some care.
The green/amber/green sequence at Stevens Road corresponded, according to the expert evidence, with the lights at the Whitley Road junction. According to PW4 the Whitley Road lights were changing faster than normal and green and amber were approximately of the same duration. Similarly along Dunearn Road the lights were changing in their normal sequence but faster than usual. All colours along Dunearn Road were approximately of the same duration. In his investigation papers, which he recorded at about midday on the same day, he wrote `Stevens Road green/ amber/green rapidly changing. Dunearn Road changing in a proper order but fast.` He saw no red light facing Whitley Road and also added rather significantly that although he said before me that the green was approximately of the same duration as the amber in Whitley Road he would not challenge his previous statement before Buttrose J that green was longer than amber then. When I questioned him about what he had told me about the green having been of the same duration as amber he said that he didn`t time it but that was what he thought, but if he had said to Buttrose J that green was longer than amber that previous statement must have been correct. Green was definitely faster than normal.
It is well known that amber hardly ever lasts more than three seconds anywhere in Singapore. The evidence of one of the experts, the technician, Mr Edward Chin, PW6 who carried out the repairs herein, is to the effect that the normal duration of amber at this junction was three seconds. If lights were going faster than normal and if lights were of approximately the same duration it is difficult to believe that the lights could have been going very much slower than at intervals of two seconds to say the least in both directions because of the synchronisation of the lights in both directions or, to use Mr Snow`s expression, `reciprocal relationship` between them. PW4 himself said that he did not time it. The truth of the whole matter is that nobody timed it. On the evidence before the Federal Court when it heard the appeal against the decision of Buttrose J the Federal Court said that it would be idle and wrong to speculate how rapidly the lights were changing when the only evidence was that they were changing rapidly.
In the case before me I have positive evidence from PW4 to the effect that although the green may have been slightly longer than amber they were approximately of the same duration. Amber was also faster than usual according to this witness. I have also evidence before me that the lights were changing in their proper sequence in Dunearn Road. All colours were of approximately the same duration. I have no hesitation in concluding that the lights were changing rapidly along both directions, at such a speed that the green and the amber and the red were approximately of the same duration even though perhaps the green was slightly longer than the amber. Further, green plus amber in one direction would equal red in the other according to Mr Chin. Further, I have the evidence of PW5 to the effect that they were changing at one second intervals as he had previously told Mr Murphy in December 1968 to support the evidence of PW4 that all colours were approximately of the same duration. PW5 even said that green in Stevens Road was slightly longer than amber. I strongly doubt whether he would have said this if green had been 24 seconds which was the shortest duration of green Mr Snow could visualise.
I now turn to the two experts. Mr Edward Chin, PW6, gave evidence to the effect that he thought that the reason why the lights were going faster than usual was because of high resistance in the coil as opposed to a damp controller or to any timing valve defect. He said that it was possible for a light to change from green to amber to green at such a speed that with the red going extremely fast red would be indiscernible. He agreed with Mr Hilborne`s first question in cross-examination on behalf of the first defendant that it was possible for green in Whitley Road to be showing for one second, for amber to be showing for one second and for red to be showing for 1/10 of a second. He said that at 10.25am he found that the winding of the coil was broken and the lights fixed. It was impossible for lights in both directions to be green simultaneously. The cause of the breaking of the coil could be increased current as a result of rapid changing of the lights.
Now, if red were indiscernible at Whitley Road because of extremely high speed then, it follows that green should have been indiscernible along Dunearn Road, assuming that the lights were going so rapidly with red going so fast that it became indiscernible in Whitley Road. There was a relationship between green and the amber in Whitley Road which would combined be of the same duration as the red in Dunearn Road and vice versa.If the lights were red in Whitley Road then they would be green and amber in Dunearn Road. So, if the red did not show in Whitley Road because of very high speed there would be no green and amber in Dunearn Road.
I therefore had to consider carefully the evidence relating to the green/amber/green at Whitley Road whilst the lights were changing rapidly in their normal sequence in Dunearn Road. Why did the green show in Dunearn Road as PW4 said it did?
PW4 and PW5 were quite sure that they saw the lights in their correct sequence in Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road respectively. If the lights in Stevens Road and Whitley Road were not going so terribly fast as to make red indiscernible then the lights should have shown green/amber/blank, green/amber/ blank. Both the experts were agreed on this. Because Mr Chin did not find anything wrong with the red bulb after be completed his repairs, the necessary inference is that it had neither blown nor been removed but nevertheless did not show.
I now turn to the evidence of Mr Snow, director of General Electric Company. He, however, never examined the lights on 10 July 1966. He went there the following day after the repairs had been completed. His evidence more or less is to the same effect as that of Mr Chin except in one particular respect which I think is important. His evidence is to the effect that with a damp controller the speed of the lights would have been accelerated by not more than 25%. It should be noted that he was not asked about high resistance in the coil or any timing valve defect. He said he could not visualisethe lights changing faster than by about 25%. In other words, if green is normally 30 seconds he could not visualise it being less than 24 seconds with a damp controller. It is unfortunate that he was not examined or cross-examined on the same lines as Mr Chin had been with regard to speeds in the case of high resistance in the coil or any timing valve defect, nor was he asked his opinion as to what he thought caused the coil to break. On a balance of the evidence given by the two experts, one of whom actually carried out the repairs whilst the other who though a senior officer, was more theoretical and placed in the position of a person who was only visualising what the lights should have been, I accept the evidence of Mr Chin in this respect and have no hesitation in concluding that the lights were changing so rapidly as to be evident to a user of either road though not so fast as to render red indiscernible in Whitley Road.
I have therefore, evidence before me on which I can decide as I now do that the lights were changing so rapidly at equal intervals of at the most two seconds or even less that the fact that they were out of order must have been palpably obvious, as Buttrose J held in the previous suit, to any person approaching the junction along either Dunearn Road or Whitley Road.
I find it difficult to believe that PW4 would have described the lights as changing rapidly or very quickly as he has all along maintained if the duration had been 24 seconds for green, 21/4 seconds for amber and 261/4 seconds for red which were the lowest duration Mr Snow could visualise.
I now turn briefly to the evidence of the plaintiff who did not, however, notice the lights as the taxi entered the junction. He was looking to his left. The speed of the taxi was over 40 mph. He said that there was plenty of traffic and that the taxi was travelling in the middle of the road. He also said that there were a lot of other cars speeding down. He saw the lorry coming along Whitley Road when it was 45 feet from the junction. The lorry was travelling faster than the taxi.
It should be remembered that when the lorry ran into the taxi the taxi had almost completed the crossing.
The first defendant, the taxi driver, said that he was travelling at between 20 to 30 mph along the left hand side of Dunearn Road towards the city. As he approached the junction he observed that the traffic light was red and he moved on when it turned green. He said the light was green when he was 38 feet away. There were no vehicles immediately to his front or to his left but there were three other vehicles, two of them more or less to his right and one to his right but further in front. All four of them went through the lights in that pattern. He agreed that his view was not obstructed. He saw the lorry when he himself was 50 feet and the lorry 76 feet from the junction. He said that the lorry was faster than himself and he presumed that the lorry would stop. He said he did not notice that the lights were out of order.
The second defendant, the lorry driver, said that as he approached the junction he saw the light was green in his favour at a distance of 40 to 50 feet from the junction. When he came within 15 feet from the junction he saw that it was still green and he accelerated. When he was 12 feet past the stop line he heard the noise of the taxi approaching in a fast manner like the sound of wind from his right. He said that his speed was then 10 mph. He braked and swerved slightly to his left and then the collision took place. He left no brake marks but the taxi did. He said he never saw the taxi until the collision. He said that although he looked left and right he did not see the taxi. He knew that Dunearn Road is a one-way-street in favour of traffic proceeding to the city from his right. He estimated the speed of the taxi at 60 mph `from the sound it made`. He said that as his lorry was loaded with sand his maximum speed along Whitley Road was 10 to 20 mph. I do not accept these estimates of speed. PW4 however confirmed that the lorry driver told him at the scene that the light was green in his favour whereas the taxi driver did not because he was in hurry presumably to enter the ambulance.
I do not accept the evidence given by the two defendants as to the speeds at which they were driving their respective vehicles. I find that the plaintiff`s version that they were both travelling at more than 40 mph is the more credible one. It seems to me absurd in all the circumstances that the lorry driver should have accelerated when he was 15 feet from the junction when it should have been obvious to him that the taxi was almost on top of him. According to the lorry driver there were no other vehicles along Whitley Road and Dunearn Road apart from the two vehicles which they drove. There was nothing to impede the view of either driver and they should certainly have seen one another at least after the taxi went past the electric sub-station in Dunearn Road which is about 200 feet from the junction.
What I find really took place was as follows on all the evidence as to the unusual circumstances prevailing at the time. The lights in both directions were, as I have already found, changing rapidly at equal intervals of two seconds at the most. They could have been changing at shorter intervals than that. They were both approaching the junction along their respective roads at more than 40 mph, ie60 feet per second. If they had been paying attention to the junction as they should have done, with nothing to obstruct their view of the road and the lights ahead of them they ought to have known that the lights were most certainly out of order. Moreover, they were undoubtedly travelling at great speed. Whilst it is true that the lights can be seen from at least two to three hundreds yards or more away from the junction in either direction there was nothing to prevent them observing the state of the lights when they were say at a distance of 100 to 200 yards from them if they were driving carefully. I find that the taxi driver saw the light red in the first instance as he was speeding down Dunearn Road and that it changed to green and then to amber just before he went over the stop line and he thought he could make it across the junction notwithstanding the fact that the lights were going pretty fast. In the meantime the lorry driver who was coming from his left should have noticed that his lights had changed from green to amber to blank as he was approaching the junction at speed. As he reached the junction, the blank must have changed to green at the same time as the lights in Dunearn Road changed to red behind the taxi driver as he went past them also at speed.
Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to determine, in view of my finding that the lights were so defective at the junction that both the defendants knew or ought to have known, if they had kept a proper lookout, that the lights controlling their entry into the junction were defective and not functioning properly, what light was actually showing to each driver at the time he reached the junction. The question then really becomes one of what a driver ought to do at an uncontrolled intersection bearing in mind that he ought to have seen the lights malfunctioning much earlier and been on his guard so as to exercise greater care. Travelling as they were at great speed they should have slowed down and perhaps also applied their brakes very much earlier. In my judgment both the defendants were undoubtedly guilty of negligence, the only question remaining being, as to liability, the question of degree. As the lorry driver, the second defendant was proceeding from a minor road on to a one-way major road the greater blame must undoubtedly attach to him as it was his duty to give way to traffic from his right. On his own evidence he never saw the taxi until it was almost on top of him when the latter was streaking past like the sound of wind. The lorry ran full tilt into the nearside of the taxi whilst both vehicles were belatedly taking avoiding action to no avail.
I do not consider that much assistance is obtainable from the authorities cited by counsel because they all deal with situations where nothing was wrong with the traffic lights in question at all. Nor do I consider that it would be fair to either driver for me to regard this intersection as completely uncontrolled before the lights came within vision as they were speeding down towards them. I think that 
 Lang v London Transport Executive & Anor 
 [1959] 3 All ER 609 is nearer this one on its facts. Had both roads been completely uncontrolled and of equal importance it would be difficult to say that they were not equally to blame in view of their high speeds. Doing the best I can in all the circumstances I find that the second defendant and the first defendant should share responsibility for the accident in the proportion of 2 to 1.
I now turn to the question of the damages I should award, special damage having been already agreed at $900. There is no doubt that the plaintiff sustained a number of injuries, the principal ones being the fracture of the left femur, iethe thigh bone, and fractures of the shafts of the tibia and fibula of the left leg. These have left some multiple scars and he has undoubtedly sustained, as a result of a discharging sinus, a further shortening of his leg from 2 inches to 21/2 inches in the last year or so. Although there is no further discharge from the sinus there is a likelihood of further shortening. There is also a 1 inches decrease in the girth of his left thigh and a 2 inch decrease in the left calf as compared to the measurements of the right thigh and right calf. As a result of these injuries he can no longer do field work and he can`t run. Muscle strength is now about No 4 in his left leg, assuming that the degree of muscle strength runs from nought to five, which is normal. That does not mean that he has 4/5ths of his former muscle strength in his left leg.
Mr Fung, the senior orthopaedic surgeon, in June 1969 made a report to the extent that he had been totally incapacitated for one year, partially disabled to the extent of 50% for six months, that he had in June 1969 a residual permanent disability of 30%, and that he is fortunate to have an employer sympathetic to his injuries who was prepared to employ him in a lighter capacity. Whilst it is no doubt true that his fractures have healed, it is also true that he has undergone considerable suffering and that he has had his promotion prospects somewhat affected. He was a fisheries officer undergoing a three-month course at the University of Singapore when he met with this accident and since then he has been unable to further his ambitions in the fisheries department. He has, however, been transferred to the establishment where he is employed on clerical duties because he can no longer do any field work, not at least for some considerable time.
So far as the injuries themselves are concerned, I find little difficulty in assessing what the general damages under the head of pain and suffering and loss of amenities and so on should be. I assess them in the round sum of $20,000.
The only difficulty is with regard to his loss of promotion prospects. He was a very junior officer in the fisheries department when he joined it in Sarawak in May 1966 and he was sent down to do this three months course at the university and he met with this accident in July. One does not really know how well he would have progressed in that field. He has said that his promotion prospects were better in the fisheries department than now as a clerical officer in the establishment but it is extremely difficult to predict what course his career in the fisheries department would necessarily have taken or what his future in the establishment will be.
It is odious to make comparisons based on promotion prospects and salaries as between different departments of the Government service as sometimes service in one department, though promising in the early stages, may as a result of changing conditions, turn out to be less rewarding while service in another department with a seemingly less promising future may turn out to be more fruitful than originally expected.
Undoubtedly initial prospects appeared to be rosier in the fisheries department which the plaintiff had just joined before the accident. It is said that he is now incapable of doing field work and because he is attached to the establishment he may not be able to rise as high in the latter service as in the fisheries department. It may well be that in the absence of any deterioration in his mental alertness and general efficiency he may achieve heights in the establishment which he might never have been able to reach in the fisheries department even though his immediate prospects there in 1966 were brighter.
However, there is always the likelihood that he could have done better in the fisheries department at least in the first five to ten years or so. I do not think that one should only take into account the extra allowances for field work, subsistence and so on which he could have earned in the fisheries department. It is difficult to conclude that he would have done so well there and made so much more money there than in the establishment that one should apply that yardstick alone to assess the greater financial benefits he would have gained over any greater length of time. There are always a number of other factors, both tangible as well as intangible, to be considered in assessing future prospects and chances of promotion. Some officers have been known to stagnate for reasons only known to their immediate superiors and the promoting authority. However, in view of the unfortunate accident which has, nevertheless, reduced his immediate chances, I would assess, for what it is worth, doing what I can in the realm of little more than speculation, damages under this head in the round sum of $7,000 at the very most.
I therefore assess total general damages in the round sum of $27,000. Together with agreed specials at $900 there will be judgment for $27,900 to the Public Trustee for the plaintiff to be paid by the first and second defendants in the proportions I have indicated.

I think we have indicated during the hearing of this appeal our view on whether the conviction of the two appellants under s 307 of the Penal Code can stand. It is in our judgment clear that the evidence falls short of establishing an intention to commit murder and that being so this conviction cannot stand. Neither can it be said on the evidence that the offence which was committed by the two appellants together with their third companion was such that it amounted to an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code, that is, causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. Unfortunately s 320 of the Code has defined grievous hurt as, among other things, any hurt which endangers life. It is submitted that on the evidence the medical evidence would support the finding that the victim`s life was in danger but we think it is clear on the evidence that at no stage was there any evidence to suggest that the injury to the victim was such that his life was ever in danger. That may be fortunate for the appellants so that we are left with only one offence which is disclosed by the evidence and that is the offence of voluntarily causing hurt by a dangerous weapon, namely, an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code.
Bearing in mind that this offence was committed at the time when the racial disturbances which overflowed into Singapore were at its height, we must, as did the trial judge, take an extremely serious view. Whatever the situation in the country may be, no one who causes physical injury to someone else motivated or actuated purely by racial hostility, if he is convicted and the facts bear out such a motive, can expect to be dealt with other than with the utmost severity and unless there are any mitigating circumstances he can expect to be sentenced or punished to the maximum extent allowed by the law so that in this particular case where there are no mitigating circumstances at all we in setting aside their conviction under s 307 and the sentence imposed for that conviction substitute a conviction under s 324 and impose the maximum sentence we can impose of imprisonment for a term of three years to commence from the date of their conviction in the trial court and it is, having regard to the circumstances, a proper case where each of them will also be punished besides a term of imprisonment to undergo caning and each of them will be punished with three strokes of the cane besides the term of imprisonment.

The plaintiff`s claim is as administratrix and co-administrator of the estate of Chia Peng Teow, deceased for damages for the estate and for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased under s 12 of the Civil Law Ordinance (Cap 24) who have suffered damage caused by the negligence of the first defendant, the servant or agent of the Government of the Republic of Singapore, in the charge, management and/or control of motor vehicle SGA 8116, whereby the said Chia Peng Teow, deceased was killed on 4 July 1967 and the plaintiffs claim damages under s 7 of the Civil Law Ordinance (Cap 24).
The facts which are not in dispute are as follows. The first defendant on the day and at the time in question was employed by the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Health, Singapore. At 4.50pm on 4 July 1967 the first defendant was driving a Land Rover No SGA 8116, the property of the Public Health Department and he was accompanied by four crew members who were presumably employees of the Public Health Department. The first defendant parked his Land Rover in Cambridge Road in the vicinity of the Cambridge Road Market as there was some refuse there which had to be removed. The first defendant and the four crew members got out of the Land Rover. The first defendant left the ignition keys of the Land Rover in the switch. A short while later, one of the crew members, Sim Ah Boon got into the said Land Rover and started it. The Land Rover moved forward for a distance of about 50 feet and came into collision with one Chia Peng Teow who was sitting at one of the food stalls nearby having a meal as a result of which the said Chia Peng Teow died from the injuries sustained.
The plaintiffs called two witnesses one of whom, PW2, is an engineer in charge of transport in the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Health who stated that the vehicle in question was a public health vehicle and that there are rules whereby action is taken against drivers leaving vehicles unattended. Under cross-examination, PW2 stated that disciplinary action is taken against drivers leaving vehicles unattended, depending on the circumstances of the case.
The first defendant in evidence stated that on the day in question at about 4.50pm he parked his Land Rover in Cambridge Road as he saw some refuse there which had to be removed. He pulled up his hand brake, freed his gear and switched off his engine but left the ignition keys in the switch. He then got out and went to the nearside of the vehicle to supervise and assist the crew members to carry the refuse that was there. The first defendant further stated that he did not normally leave his ignition keys in the switch but he would only do so when he is near the vehicle. If he was going away from the vehicle, he usually took the ignition keys with him. The first defendant had been a driver for more than 20 odd years. Under cross-examination, the first defendant admitted that there was not much refuse at that spot and it would take at the most only ten minutes to remove it. That is the reason why he left the ignition keys in the switch.
Learned counsel for the plaintiffs Mr Cashin submitted that the onus was on the plaintiffs to establish that there was a duty and if there was a breach of that duty then the plaintiffs had discharged that onus. In support of his contention, Mr Cashin tendered in evidence the Road Traffic Rules 1950 r 42 of which reads as follows: 
 
No vehicle which is on a public road or street shall be left unattended unless it is rendered immovable by the application of brakes or by some other sufficient means.
 
 
 
Mr Cashin further contended that according to r 42 no vehicle should be left on a public road or street unattended unless it is rendered immovable. The fact that the ignition keys were left in the switch did not immobilise the vehicle and therefore there was a breach of the duty of care. In further support of his case, Mr Cashin then referred to the cases of 
 Beard v London General Omnibus Co 
[1900] 2 QB 530
, 
 Ricketts v Thomas Tilling Ltd 
[1915] 1 KB 644
 and 
 Fulwood House Ltd v Standard Bentwood Chair Co 
[1956] 1 L1 Rep 163.
The meaning of `unattended` as given in the 
 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 
Vol 2 is as follows: 
 
Not having attendants; unaccompanied; with no one in charge.
 
 
 
Both Mr Cashin for the plaintiffs and Mr Woo, state counsel, dwelt at length on the 
 Fulwood House 
case. The facts of the 
 Fulwood House 
case were briefly as follows.
An employee of the defendant company left his lorry outside the defendant`s warehouse which was situated in a cul-de-sacfor a few minutes in order to go to the toilet in the defendant`s premises. The only other person authorised to drive the said lorry was the defendant`s foreman and the driver knew that the foreman was away from work that day. It was the practice of the driver when he left the vehicle outside the defendant`s premises to leave the ignition key in the switch so that the foreman could shift the lorry if he so wanted. Another employee of the defendant`s firm who had no authority to drive the lorry drove the said lorry and damaged the plaintiff`s garage door. It was held that the driver of the lorry was negligent in leaving his vehicle with the ignition key in the switch when he knew the foreman was away from work that day, and further that his negligence was an effective cause of the subsequent damage to the plaintiff. On appeal it was held by the Court of Appeal that the act of the driver in leaving the ignition key in the switch was not negligent and furthermore that the driver could not have anticipated or reasonably foreseen that another employee of the company would attempt to drive the vehicle.
The facts of the 
 Fulwood House 
 case are somewhat similar to the present case with three exceptions. The first being that whereas in the 
 Fulwood House 
case the driver was in the habit of leaving his ignition keys in the switch, the first defendant in this case stated that it was not customary for him to leave the ignition keys in the switch but he only did so when he was near the vehicle. Again in the 
 Fulwood House 
 case the driver parked his vehicle in a cul-de-sac.The first defendant however in this case parked his Land Rover in a busy street at 5pm. Again, in the 
 Fulwood House 
 case the driver left his vehicle unattended for two minutes. In the present case at no time did the driver leave his vehicle. In fact he was working beside it.
It would have to be shown in this case that the act of the first defendant, iethe act of leaving the ignition keys in the switch after he had parked his Land Rover in Cambridge Road on the day and time in question was a negligent act and that it was an act that a reasonably prudent driver in all the circumstances of the case would not do.
Now, what were the circumstances of the present case. The first defendant admitted that his leaving of the ignition keys in the switch was not a thing he would normally do and he only did it on this occasion because he was working beside the vehicle and the nature of his work was such that it could be completed at the most in about ten minutes and that was the reason for his action. The first defendant went on to say if he had occasion to leave the vehicle he usually took the ignition keys with him. The second factor to be taken into account is the place where the first defendant parked the Land Rover on the day and time in question. It is not disputed that the place was not far from the Cambridge Road Market. It is also not disputed that there were stalls in the vicinity and at that time of the day Cambridge Road is quite busy.
In 
 Ruoff v Long & Co 
 [1916] 1 KB 152, Avory J in his judgment said: 
 
It is impossible to say that those who leave standing unattended in a road a machine which would not move unless some person intentionally put it in motion are prima facieguilty of negligence.
 
 
 
It is pertinent to note that the first defendant did not at any time leave the Land Rover unattended. He was standing next to it or to be more precise on its nearside supervising his crew members at work. He had control over it. Furthermore, the only reason according to the first defendant why he left his ignition keys in the switch was that the nature of the work was such that it could be completed at the most in ten minutes, in other words he would only be there for ten minutes. Taking these facts into consideration can it be said that the act of the first defendant in leaving his ignition keys in the switch was a negligent act?
I would say certainly not. The mere possibility of accident is not enough to establish liability. The first defendant`s very presence beside his Land Rover would denote that he had control over it and had not even temporarily abandoned such control. From the nature of his work, iesupervising and assisting his crew men to carry the refuse from the road on to the Land Rover, it can reasonably be inferred that he was exercising proper control.
In the 
 Fulwood House 
 case, Lord Birkett at p 163 had this to say: 
 
It is easy enough to say that if you leave a lorry with an ignition key in it anybody can come and start it. Of course they can. But one has to be reasonable and to take the reasonable view of what a reasonable man would do.
 
 
 
In all such cases of interference by third parties the question before the court is whether the act of interference is one which the driver of the vehicle ought to have contemplated as likely to happen or one which he could reasonably have foreseen.
Again in 
 Ruoff v Long & Co 
 , Avory J in his judgment at p 152 said: 
 
Admitting that the accident would not have occurred but for the intervention of a third person, was such an intervention a thing which the defendants as reasonable men ought to have anticipated? If it was, then of course it is no answer to say that it was not their original negligence which caused the accident; the intervention is one link in the chain of causation and they are responsible. That leads to the question of whether the defendants, assuming that they were guilty of negligence in leaving the lorry unattended, ought as reasonable men to have anticipated that soldiers or other persons would mount the engine, pull out the safety pin, manipulate three different levers, and so set the lorry in motion. It cannot be said that any reasonable man ought to have anticipated such a set of circumstances; in other words, there was no evidence on which this or any other court could come to the conclusion that this accident ought to have been anticipated.
 
 
 
Similarly in the present case, the first defendant`s proximity to the Land Rover, the fact that he had control over it, the fact that he would remain at the place where he parked the vehicle for ten minutes, sufficient for him to complete his work, renders it highly improbable that he could reasonably foresee that anyone during this short period would intervene to attempt to start the Land Rover, least of all a member of his own crew, who according to the evidence, was a schizophreniac and not a regular member of the crew, but only a stop gap for that particular day.
For these reasons, I find that the act of the first defendant in leaving the ignition keys in the switch after he had parked his Land Rover in Cambridge Road on 4 July 1967 was not negligent and that he could not reasonably foresee any intervention by a third party. In the circumstances, the claim against the first defendant must fail. Such being the case it follows that the claim against the second defendant must also fail. The plaintiffs` claim against the two defendants is dismissed with costs.

On 17 October 1967 the first plaintiff, who was then seventeen years old, was injured at his place of work and as a result his right hand was amputated at the level of the lower third of the shafts of the radius and ulna. He had commenced working for the defendants about twelve months before the accident as a sweeper.
In his statement of claim he alleged that at all material times he was employed by the defendants at their factory premises as a sweeper and in the course of his said employment he was on or about 17 October 1967 instructed by the defendants` servants or agents to operate a machine for crushing wood pulp and while operating the machine his right hand was trapped by the machine and injured owing to the negligence and/or breach of statutory duty of the defendants, their servants or agents.
The claim in respect of breach of duty or negligence under the common law is particularized as:
 
 
(a) causing or permitting him to operate the said machine by himself when they knew or ought to have known that it could only be safely operated by two persons; 
 
(b) taking no reasonable or any precautions for his safety;
  
 
 
and the claim in respect of breach of statutory duty is particularized as:
 
 
(c) in breach of s 28 of the Factories Ordinance 1958 caused or permitted the first plaintiff to operate the said machine when he had not received a sufficient training in or for such work and as to the dangers likely to arise in connection therewith and the precautions to be observed nor was the first plaintiff under adequate supervision by a person who had a sufficient knowledge and experience of the said machine or process and they therefore exposed the first plaintiff to the dangers of the said machine. Alternatively, they ought to have prevented the first plaintiff from operating the said machine; 
 
(d) in breach of s 21 of the Factories Ordinance 1958 caused or permitted the first plaintiff to operate the said machine when the same was not securely fenced under sub-s (1) of that section; 
 
(e) failing to provide an efficient device or appliance by which electrical power could be promptly cut off from the said machine contrary to sub-s (2) of s 21; 
 
(f) failing to provide an efficient stopping appliance the control of which was in such a position as to be readily and conveniently operated by the first plaintiff.
  
 
 
The particulars (d), (e) and (f) above were contained in amendments to the statement of claim granted by the court at the commencement of the trial of the action. At the final stages of the trial counsel for the plaintiffs applied to the court to further amend the pleadings to include an allegation that the defendants were in breach of s 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958.
It is convenient, first, to describe the machine and how it operates. The machine is shown in the photographs which also show the `wood pulp` which is in fact shredded paper or paper sweepings which is fed into the machine to be compressed into a bale of compressed paper. An expert, Mr Loo Ming, who holds the degree of Master of Science in mechanical engineering, a member of the Institute of Engineers, Singapore and an associate member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and is presently a lecturer in the Engineering Faculty, University of Singapore, prepared a schematic or a diagrammatic representation of the working of this machine. He also gave evidence that essentially the machine consists of three sections, the prime mover, the transmission machinery with its control, and the end device or appliance. The prime mover is the electric motor that supplies the energy. The transmission machinery is the portion that is interphased between the prime mover and the end device and its purpose is to convert energy from one form to a form that is suitable for use at the end device. The end device in the case of this machine is the ram that bales the shredded or loose paper. Pressure is supplied by an electric motor to the hydraulic cylinder which moves the ram backwards or forwards. The hydraulic cylinder is controlled by the direction control valve which controls it forward, backward or stops it. The direction control valve is in turn controlled by a lever. A wall mainline switch controls the electric power to the whole unit and there is a push button switch in the machine which also controls the electric power to the electric motor.
The loose paper is fed into an opening or well in the machine, which opening or well is, according to the expert, part of the end device of this machine. Then the main switch and the motor switch are switched on. The lever which controls the direction control valve is then pulled down and this moves the ram into the well of the machine thereby compressing the loose paper in the well. As a result bits of the loose paper rises and a metal rod is used to press this rising paper down into the well. When the ram has passed a certain part of the whole machine the lever is used to bring the ram backwards to its original position and the whole process, including filling the well with paper, is repeated six or seven times before a bale of compressed paper is produced. The movement of this ram backwards or forwards is comparatively very slow. The evidence is that when there is paper in the well of the machine it moves forward about 1.1/3 inch per second, taking 15 seconds for it to move across the opening of the well and 13 seconds to come back to its original position.
It is clear, therefore, from the evidence and looking at the photographs that this machine is a simple one, easy to operate and capable of being operated safely by one person. In the words of the foreman who gave evidence, `even a child can operate it"". The only possible danger to anyone operating it would be if he places his hand in the well of the machine while the ram is moving forward and leaves the hand in the well when the ram has travelled across the whole length of the well in which event the hand would be jammed between the ram and far wall of the well. This was what happened to the first plaintiff and accepting as I do the foreman`s evidence that he instructed the first plaintiff, first by demonstration and then by supervision, as to how to operate the machine and of the possible danger of using the hand, instead of the metal rod which was provided and used by him during the demonstration, to press down the rising paper into the well when the ram was moving forwards, I find the first plaintiff`s claim at common law must fail.
There is obviously a remote possibility of injury in the use of this machine. This accident shows that but as was said in 
 Bolton v Stone 
 
[1951] AC 850
 at p 858: 
 
Nor is the remote possibility of injury occurring enough. There must be sufficient probability to lead a reasonable man to anticipate it. The existence of some risk is an ordinary incident of life, even when all due care has been, as it must be, taken.
 
 
 
I turn now to deal with the claim that the defendants were in breach of their statutory duty under the Factories Ordinance 1958. First, it is claimed the defendants were in breach of s 28. I have already indicated that I accept the evidence of the foreman as regards the instruction, supervision and the precautions to be observed when operating the machine and accordingly I find that the defendants were not in breach of s 28.
Secondly it is claimed the defendants were in breach of s 21 of the Factories Ordinance 1958. This section provides as follows:
 
 
(1) Every part of the transmission machinery shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced. 
 
(2) Efficient devices or appliances shall be provided and maintained in every room or place where work is carried on by which the power can promptly be cut off from the transmission machinery in that room or place. 
 
(3) Every machine intended to be driven by mechanical power shall be provided with an efficient starting and stopping appliance, the control of which shall be in such a position as to be readily and conveniently operated by the person operating the machine.
  
 
 
The evidence of the expert witness, Mr Loo Ming, which I accept, indeed there is no evidence to the contrary, disposes of the claim under this section. I also accept the evidence of the foreman and on his evidence, coupled with the photographs, it is clear that anyone operating this machine would place himself in the position as shown in the photographs. In that position his right hand would be within easy reach and he could conveniently operate either the lever which controls the movement of the ram or the push button switch on the machine which controls the electric power to the electric motor of the machine.
Finally I must deal with the last minute attempt to amend the plaintiffs` pleadings to bring in a claim under s 22 of the Factories Ordinance 1958. On the evidence it is sought to plead that the defendants were in breach of s 22(1) which provides as follows: 
 
(1) Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced:
 
 
 
Provided that, in so far as the safety of a dangerous part of any machinery cannot by reason of the nature of the operation be secured by means of a fixed guard, the requirements of this subsection shall be deemed to have been complied with if a device is provided which automatically prevents the operator from coming into contact with that part.
 
 
 
This application is resisted by the defendants. I am not inclined to accede to it first, because it was made at a very late stage of the proceedings and secondly and more importantly because it would deprive the defendants of the opportunity of calling evidence to meet this particular allegation.
In any event as the plaintiffs are relying on the evidence before the court and are not calling further evidence in support of this allegation I would hold that they cannot succeed under s 22(1) on the evidence before me. The submission put forward on behalf of the plaintiffs is, as I understand, that the mouth of the well should have been fitted with a device or guard, namely, a removable lid so that when the ram is in motion, the lid would automatically prevent the operator of the machine from coming into contact with the ram. In my opinion this submission can only succeed if the ram is a dangerous part of the machine within the meaning of s 22(1). It seems to me obvious that the actual well or opening into which the loose paper is fed could in no circumstances be said to be a dangerous part of the machine. It also seems to me obvious that the ram by itself is not a dangerous part of the machine. The question is whether or not the ram becomes a dangerous part of the machine when the machine is in normal operation. I think not because in my opinion the ram does not undoubtedly become dangerous when the machine is in normal operation performing the mechanical work which the machine is specifically designed to achieve. I come to this conclusion adopting the words of Lord Evershed (dealing with a different problem from the present case) in 
 Midland and Low Motor Iron and Steel Co Ltd v Cross 
 [1964] 3 All ER 752, 756 where he said: 
 
As it seems to me, the question whether it can properly be said that some part of a piece of machinery is dangerous must depend on considering whether such danger exists and arises from the normal operation of the machine, that is, from the purposes of the mechanical work which the machine is specifically designed to achieve; and if such a part becomes undoubtedly dangerous from such normal and projected operation, then it follows that such part of the machine is a dangerous part within the meaning of s 14(1).
 
 
 
However much I sympathize with the first plaintiff for the serious and permanent injury he has suffered as a result of this accident, I am of the opinion that the defendants are not in law responsible for the accident and accordingly the claim is dismissed with costs.

Matters to be taken into consideration in imposing fine
 
In this appeal I confirmed the conviction of the appellant on a charge of dishonestly retaining stolen property and altered the sentence of six months` imprisonment to a fine of $2,000 or six months` imprisonment. The sentence was varied not because it was wrong in law or manifestly excessive but due to circumstances which were entirely out of the control of the learned magistrate who tried this appellant in the court below.
The facts briefly are these. One Santhamoorthi who was sent to fetch a Caterpillar tractor engine from a godown of the Port of Singapore Authority and to deliver it to Tractors Malaysia Ltd removed the said engine from the said godown but instead of delivering it where it should have been delivered, he went and sold it to a man named Low Yoke Yong for $2,000. Low in turn sold it to the appellant for $6,800. The appellant in turn sold it for $17,000 to a man in Ipoh named Suppiah. When the said engine was delivered to Suppiah in Ipoh it was seized by the police and investigations revealed the transactions which I mentioned earlier. Suppiah had not yet paid the $17,000 to the appellant and obviously he will not do so now when he has lost the engine. Santhamoorthi pleaded guilty to theft of the engine and was sentenced to six months` imprisonment. Low pleaded guilty to dishonestly receiving stolen property and was fined $1,000. The appellant was tried and convicted of dishonestly receiving stolen property and was sentenced to six months` imprisonment.
Before me, it was pleaded on behalf of the appellant that in the first place the appellant has received the same sentence as that imposed on the thief and secondly, that whereas Low the first `receiver`, who made a profit of $4,800 in the transaction, was let off with a fine of $1,000, the appellant who has lost $6,800 in the transaction has been ordered to undergo six months` imprisonment, and that in these circumstances although the sentence cannot be labelled as excessive having regard to the nature of the crime, it is manifestly unjust having regard to the sentences imposed on the other offenders involved in the criminal transactions concerning the same engine. In my view there is some merit in this submission. As observed earlier although I consider that the sentence imposed on the appellant appears to be correct in law and not excessive when considered in the light of the facts relating to the appellant`s case alone, it is relatively excessive when considered in the light of the sentences imposed on the other persons found guilty on charges relating to the same engine. I am informed that the three offenders were dealt with by different courts and that that probably accounts for the variance in the sentences imposed on the two `receivers`. That may well be so but where there are no differentiating factors, as in this case, public interest demands that there should be some consistency in the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing the same or similar offences. Failure to observe this principle may, as in this case, lead to a legitimate complaint by an appellant that he has been dealt with more severely than another who committed an identical offence. It was for these reasons that I decided that the appellant should be given the option of a fine, as such an option was granted to the other `receiver`. The maximum fine that a magistrate`s court can impose on an accused person is $2,000. Accordingly I altered the sentence of the appellant f rom that of six months` imprisonment to a fine of $2,000 or six months` imprisonment. I am compelled to observe that the learned magistrate who imposed a fine of $1,000 on Low, the first `receiver` treated the matter very lightly. Even after paying the fine, that offender made a profit of $3,800. In determining the quantum of a fine a trial magistrate should always take into consideration the profit arising from the offence. As was observed by Pretheroe J (as he then was) in 
 PP v Goh Ah Moi 
 
 
 [1949] MLJ 156 
 at p 156: 
 
if a fine is to be imposed it should be such that it will take away from the convicted offender the desire to offend in a similar manner again. Quite clearly a balance of income left in an offender`s pocket after payment of a fine will have precisely the opposite effect and for a court to leave any such balance would be wrong application of the accepted principles.
 
 
 
As a magistrate is not empowered to impose a fine exceeding $2,000, Low, the first `receiver` should have been sentenced, in my opinion, to a term of imprisonment and had that been done, I would not have varied the sentence imposed on the appellant.

This is a case stated by FA Chua J arising out of an appeal by the appellants who appeared by their advocates before the Criminal District Court as persons claiming to be owners or persons having an interest in certain gold bars which had been seized at the Singapore Airport in April and May 1969 and whose seizure had been reported to the district court under the provisions of s 11(2) of the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance (Cap 214) within one month of such seizure. The district court, being satisfied that an offence under the provisions of the Ordinance had been committed by some person or persons, held that no sufficient cause had been shown by the appellants why an order for forfeiture of the gold bars should not be made and the gold bars were accordingly forfeited.
When the matter came before FA Chua J counsel on behalf of the Public Prosecutor objected to the appeal on the ground that this was not a criminal case or matter in respect of which an appeal lay from the decision of the district court to the High Court. After hearing all counsel concerned on 24 and 25 August 1970 FA Chua J decided on 28 August that this was not a criminal case or matter and that accordingly no appeals lay therefrom to the High Court and the appeals were dismissed. Counsel for the appellants prevailed upon the learned appeal judge to state a case under s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 and a case has accordingly been stated to us for our decision as to whether his determination was correct in point of law and what should be done in the premises.
It may be useful at this stage to set out the provisions of s 11 of the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance (Cap 214) as follows: 
 
(1) The Court before which any person is tried for an offence may, whether a conviction is had or not, order the forfeiture of any goods produced before it or seized under this Ordinance in connection with the offence for which such person is tried in respect of which it is satisfied that an offence has been committed.
(2) When any goods have been seized under the provisions of this Ordinance, the controller shall, within a period of one month from the date of such seizure, unless a prosecution has before the expiry of such period been commenced and is pending against any person for an offence in respect of the property so seized, report the fact of such seizure to a district court having criminal jurisdiction and such court may, if satisfied that an offence has been committed in respect of such goods, order the same to be forfeited:
 
 
 
Provided that no order shall be made under this section to the prejudice of any person claiming to be the owner of, or to have an interest in, such goods, unless such person has had an opportunity of being heard, either personally or by advocate, by such, court, to show cause why such order should not be made.
In response to a notice issued by the district court to any person claiming to be the owner of or to have an interest in the said gold bars to appear either personally or by advocate on a day stated therein to show cause why an order of forfeiture should not be made, the appellants appeared on that day before the district court through their advocates.
The procedure laid down by this sub-s (2) was followed in every respect by the district court concerned and the appellants were given an opportunity of being heard by their advocates to show cause why an order of forfeiture should not be made and after hearing them the district court made the order for forfeiture. It should be noted that before making the order for forfeiture the court had to be satisfied that an offence under the Ordinance had been committed in respect of such gold bars and the district court was so satisfied.
Counsel for the appellants contended that because the court was a court exercising criminal jurisdiction and because it had to be satisfied that an offence had been committed under the Ordinance, this was a criminal case or matter giving rise to a right of appeal under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132).
Section 11 confers power to make an order of forfeiture at the conclusion of the trial of any person for an offence under the Ordinance whether that person is convicted or otherwise. Subsection (2), however, contemplates a case where no prosecution has been instituted and provides an expeditious method of getting the matter before a district court having criminal jurisdiction within a period of one month from the date of the original seizure so that an order for forfeiture may be made after giving an owner or interested person an opportunity of showing cause why the order should not be made. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that bad a prosecution been instituted against someone in respect of these gold bars, then, regardless of whether a conviction was obtained or not the person tried would have had a right of appeal against an order of forfeiture made and that accordingly it was anomalous that, merely because no one was prosecuted, claimants such as the present appellants should not have a right of appeal under the Criminal Procedure Code. This argument presupposes that a person tried for an offence under the Ordinance has a right of appeal against an order for forfeiture under the Criminal Procedure Code. A careful reading of the proviso makes it clear however that it prescribes the procedure to be followed before an order for forfeiture can be made not only with regard-to cases falling within sub-s (2) but also with regard to cases falling within sub-s (1), iecases where a prosecution has taken place, whether it results in a conviction or otherwise.
Section 284 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides as follows: 
 
No appeal shall lie from a judgment, sentence, or order of a criminal court except as provided for by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
As FA Chua J said in his judgment, the critical section is s 290(1), the relevant portion of which reads: 
 
... any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any district court or magistrate`s court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the High Court against such a judgment, sentence or order ...
 
 
 
The question is whether the order made by the district court after an inquiry under s 11(2) of the Ordinance was an order pronounced by a district court in a criminal case or matter to which the appellants were parties within the meaning of s 290(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code so as to confer a right of appeal to the appellants thereunder since the Ordinance itself confers no right of appeal against an order for forfeiture thereunder.
As Lord Goddard said in 
 R v West Kent Quarter Sessions Appeal Committee 
[1951] 2 All ER 728 at p 730: 
 
It is most elementary that no appeal from a court lies to any court unless there is a statutory provision which gives a right to appeal. The decision of every court is final if it has jurisdiction unless an appeal is given by statute.
 
 
 
It is clear that the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance does not confer any right of appeal and it was accordingly incumbent on the appellants to establish that a right of appeal was conferred by the sections of the Criminal Procedure Code to which we have referred.
A number of cases were cited to us on the question of what is a criminal case or matter. In 
 Seaman v Burley 
 
[1896] 2 QB 344
, Lord Esher felt that `the question is really one of procedure. The question is whether the proceeding which was going on was a criminal cause or matter.` He held that when the proceeding is one which may end in the imprisonment of a person in default it must be considered a criminal proceeding. This case was cited with approval in 
 Amand v Home Secretary and Minister of Defence of Royal Netherlands Government 
 
[1943] AC 147
 where Lord Wright said: 
 
The principle which I deduce from the authorities I have cited and the other relevant authorities which I have considered, is that if the cause or matter is one which, if carried to its conclusion, might result in the conviction of the person charged and in a sentence of some punishment such as imprisonment or fine, it is a `criminal cause or matter`.
 
 
 
We are of the view that the proceedings before the district court in this case were not criminal in their nature and in their form nor did the proceedings contemplate anything other than the forfeiture of the gold bars in question. The question of the conviction or the punishment of the appellants or in fact anyone else was not then in contemplation. The appellants were never placed in jeopardy of being punished for any offence during those proceedings. Although the court concerned was a court exercising criminal jurisdiction and although the court had to be satisfied that an offence under the Ordinance had been committed before making an order for forfeiture we are satisfied that, despite the presence of these elements, which are some of the elements which are present in criminal proceedings generally, a most vital element was lacking, namely, that no one was ever liable to be convicted or sentenced to punishment such as imprisonment or fine and that the proceedings were accordingly not criminal. In our judgment, the inquiry before the district court was not a criminal case or matter giving rise to a right of appeal under s 290(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It seems clear to us that under s 11 of the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance no order for forfeiture can be made, whether at the end of the trial of any person for an offence under the Ordinance or after an inquiry under sub-s (2), to the prejudice of any person claiming to be the owner of or to have an interest in such goods unless such person has been given an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate to show cause why such order should not be made. Any order for forfeiture whether at the end of a trial or after an inquiry under sub-s (2) would not give rise to a right of appeal under s 290 of the Criminal Procedure Code. If it had been intended that an order of forfeiture should be appealable then the legislature would have made special provision for a right of appeal in such cases. The Ordinance is silent on this point. It does not provide as the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (Cap 137) did in fact provide, before 1959, that the owner of a conveyance forfeited under s 30 of that Ordinance should be deemed to be a party to a criminal case within the meaning of s 290 of the Criminal Procedure Code. If it had been the intention of the legislature to give a right of appeal in such cases then s 11 would have provided that the owner or person having an interest in goods forfeited under s 11 should be deemed to be party to a criminal case within the meaning of s 290 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
In conclusion we would refer to the case of 
 R v Justices of Central Criminal Court 
 
(1887) 18 QBD 314
 which was cited to us by counsel for the first appellant. It was held in that case that an order for restitution of proceeds of property made at the conclusion of the trial of a prisoner convicted for obtaining by false pretences by the criminal court having jurisdiction to try him was an order made in a criminal cause or matter. It was argued that the order was made in a civil cause or matter but this argument failed as it was held that the order was made by the court which tried the convict and s 100 of the Larceny Act empowered such court to order restitution in a summary manner.
We do not consider that this authority is of any assistance to the appellants since the order for forfeiture herein was not made after the conviction of anyone for an offence under the Ordinance nor even if there had been a prosecution resulting in the conviction of someone, could the district court have made any order for forfeiture without complying with the provisions of the proviso to s 11. What the Larceny Act empowered the court to do in the case cited was merely what s 430 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers a criminal court to do at the conclusion of a criminal trial in Singapore. Section 11 of the Ordinance confers different powers on the district court holding an inquiry thereunder.
In our judgment therefore the answer to the question raised in the case stated by FA Chua J is in the affirmative namely, that his determination was correct in point of law and that the appeals were correctly dismissed.

Section 31 Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960 (No 39 of 1960)
 
The first respondent Nagalingam Mathiyooke was charged in the second criminal district court that: 
 
You, Nagalingam Mathiyooke, are charged that you, some time between 28 November 1968 and 10 December 1968 at No 50-D, South Bridge Road, Singapore, did corruptly solicit from one Hoon Wee Long @ Woon Chaw Shing gratification in the form of $20,000 worth of shares in the Harbour Bar Snack Bar and Restaurant Co (Pte) Ltd on account of the Singapore Port Workers` Union having awarded the tender to Hoon Wee Long @ Woon Chaw Shing to run a restaurant at the new Union Building, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance No 39 of 1960. and the second respondent Molly Neo was charged that:
 
 
 
You, Molly Neo, are charged that you, on or about 4 July 1969, at the office of MN Samy, Asia Insurance Building, Singapore, did corruptly agree to receive for one Nagalingam Mathiyooke, gratification in the form of $20,000 worth of shares in the Harbour Bar Snack Bar and Restaurant Co (Pte) Ltd on account of the Singapore Port Workers` Union having awarded the tender to one Hoon Wee Long @ Woon Chaw Shing to run a restaurant at the new Union Building, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance, No 39 of 1960.
 
 
 
Both the respondents claimed trial and a joint trial was held. At the end of the prosecution case the learned district judge upheld the defence contention that the consents of the Attorney General for instituting these prosecutions against both the respondents as contained in the two documents P1A and P2A were not a sufficient compliance with the provisions of s 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960 hereinafter referred to as the said Ordinance. The learned district judge further ordered that these discharges were not to amount to acquittals.
The Attorney General as Public Prosecutor now appeals against these orders of the learned district judge in respect of both these respondents.
I shall for purposes of this judgment confine myself to the case of the first respondent only.
As the first respondent was charged with an offence under the said Ordinance, the prosecution must comply with the provisions of s 31 of the said Ordinance in instituting the action.
Section 31 of the said Ordinance reads: 
 
A prosecution under this Ordinance shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.
 
 
 
From the records it would appear that when the first respondent was first charged and called upon to plead in the second criminal district court on 25 April 1970 the charge in terms of what I have already set out above, and the consent of the Attorney General were both put in as exhs P1 and P1A respectively at the very outset by the court prosecutor senior inspector Joseph Low. The consent P1A of the Attorney General reads: 
 
I, Tan Boon Teik, Attorney General and Public Prosecutor of Singapore, in pursuance of the powers conferred on me by s 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960 (Order 39 of 1960: Reprint No RS(A) 27 of 1966) and of all other powers hereunto me enabling, do hereby consent to the prosecution of one Nagalingam Mathiyooke @ Ismail bin Abdullah of Singapore for an offence under s 5(a)(i) of the aforesaid Ordinance:
 
 
 
And I do hereby designate any Criminal District Court at Singapore to be the court of trial. 
 
Dated at Singapore this 7 April 1970.

The learned deputy public prosecutor, Mr Rajah, who argued this appeal on behalf of the Attorney General, submitted that the provisions of s 31 of the said Ordinance do not require the consent to be in writing nor do they prescribe any particular form for that consent. The Attorney General can give his consent even orally. The document P1A though it does not set out the facts of the case, nevertheless, names the first respondent as the person against whom the prosecution is to be launched and also sets out the section of the said Ordinance under which the alleged offence would come.
In these circumstances the learned deputy public prosecutor contended that the consent of the Attorney General as set out in the document P1A, coupled with the fact that this document P1A was tendered as an exhibit along with the charge P1 at the outset of the proceedings in the district court and the further fact that a deputy public prosecutor conducted the prosecution at the subsequent hearing of this case before the learned district judge all go to show that there has been a sufficient compliance with the provisions of s 31 of the said Ordinance.
In support of his contention the learned deputy public prosecutor referred to the case of 
 Berwin v Donohoe 
 (1951) 21 CLR 1. This was an appeal from the Court of Petty Sessions of New South Wales to the High Court of Australia.
One Berwin was prosecuted for an offence under s 3 of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914. The Act provides (s 3(6)) that: `A prosecution for an offence against this section shall not be instituted without the written consent of the Attorney General.` Before the prosecution was instituted the Attorney General signed a consent as follows: 
 
The Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia hereby consents to a prosecution being instituted against Alfred George Berwin of Sydney in the State of New South Wales for an offence against the Trading with the Enemy Acts 1914.
 
 
 
The High Court of Australia held that the consent of the Attorney General in the form set out there was a sufficient compliance with s 3(6) of the Act which I have quoted above. It would appear that in that case, the appeal was on a very narrow point as to whether the consent in that form, as stated above, without setting out the facts of the case, was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of s 3(6) of the Act. There, as the consent had to be in writing, the question was whether the consent, which did not set out the facts of the case and the section of the Act under which the alleged offence came, was a valid document to meet the requirements of the Act. It was not in dispute that the Attorney General had given his consent. It was only the form of the document that was in issue. In that case Isaacs J in the course of his judgment said: 
 
If the defence definitely challenges the fact that the Attorney General has examined the facts of that particular case, the prosecution may be put to prove that he has; but, as I say, no such challenge was made here. The objection was merely as to the form of the documents.
 
 
 
In the present case the defence did not complain about the form of the document P1A. Under the said Ordinance the consent of the Attorney General as I have mentioned earlier need not even be in writing. The respondent`s contention here, as I see it, is that there is no sufficient evidence in the prosecution case to show that the Attorney General has consented to this particular prosecution against the respondent.
On the evidence of the document P1A and having regard to illustration (e) of s 115 of the Evidence Ordinance, which says that the court may presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed, it is clear that the Attorney General has consented to the institution of a prosecution against the first respondent for an alleged offence under s 5(1) of the said Ordinance. The question is does this consent relate to this particular case or to some other incident in respect of the same respondent under the same section of the said Ordinance.
The learned deputy public prosecutor contended that the consent as at P1A taken with all the other circumstances of this case clearly show that the consent of the Attorney General was given to this particular case.
Now what are the other circumstances of the case on which he relies for this submission. They are the fact that the consent P1A was tendered along with the charge P1 at the outset by the court prosecutor when the first respondent was first charged in the court, the fact that a deputy public prosecutor conducted the prosecution at the trial of this case and the fact that the consent P1A is dated 7 April 1970 and the first respondent was charged in court for the first time on 25 April 1970.
I cannot agree with this submission of the learned deputy public prosecutor. I find that the evidence taken as a whole is not sufficient to establish that the Attorney General`s consent as contained in P1A referred to the facts of this particular case.
If the document signifying the Attorney General`s consent under s 31 of the said Ordinance contains sufficient facts to satisfactorily identify the particular case to which he has given his consent then the document would speak for itself. This does not mean that all the facts as embodied in the charge should have to be set out in the consent.
When the document signifying the consent of the Attorney General does not contain enough facts to identify the case to which he gave his consent then of course extraneous evidence can be led to supplement the evidence contained in the document. This would be so even if the consent has to be in writing as in the case of the `Trading with the Enemy Act 1914` of Australia referred to in the case of 
 Berwin v Donohoe. 
In that case Higgins J in his judgment said: 
 
Even if there were two prosecutions to which the consent would be equally applicable, evidence would be admissible to show to which the consent is applicable; the consent would not be a bad consent.
 
 
 
In the case here it was open to the prosecution to adduce extraneous evidence to show that the consent P1A related to this particular prosecution but no such evidence was forthcoming. The defence challenged this issue regarding the consent of the Attorney General only at the end of the prosecution case. The prosecution could even then have applied to adduce further evidence. I was informed during the hearing of this appeal that the prosecution elected not to call any further evidence when this challenge was made by the defence.
I next refer to the case of 
 Chong Tuck Loong v PP 
(Perak Cr App 73/52) (unreported) where Thomson J as he then was, in his judgment there discussed the question of consent under the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance of Malaya. He there made the following observations: 
 
... if that section (s 12, relating to consent) is not complied with the court has no jurisdiction to try offences under the Ordinance, and I do not think it can be said to be complied with unless it is clear either on the face of the proceedings or as a matter of reasonable inference that the Public Prosecutor ... has either taken an active part in the prosecution or has consented to the charges brought against the accused after applying his mind at the lowest to the facta probandaforming the material of these charges.
 
 
 
The same learned judge in the subsequent case of 
 Lyn Hong Yap v 
 
 PP 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 226
 , referring in his judgment to this very same passage said: 
 
In making these observations I was concerned with the particular facts of the case under appeal and my attention had not been invited to 
 Metz`s
case. On further consideration I have come to the conclusion that in making these observations I went too far and that they would more accurately state the law if the words, `either on the face of the proceedings or as a matter of reasonable inference` were omitted.
 
 
 
I respectfully agree with this last observation of Thomson J. This means that the evidence regarding the consent must be such that it should be clear from it, as to the facts of which particular case, the Attorney General had applied his mind and given his consent. It is not sufficient to prove this fact merely as a matter of reasonable inference.
Reference was also made to the case of 
 PP v Choy Kok Kuan 
 
 
 
[1959] MLJ 80
  both in the hearing before me as well as in the court below. The judgment in this case was based on the earlier remarks of Thomson J in the case of 
 Chong Tuck Loong v PP 
 to which I have already referred above and therefore does not require any further comment now having regard to the subsequent observations of Thomson J on the same matter.
Let me next refer to the case of 
 Gokulchand Dwarkadas Moraka v R 
 AIR 1948 PC 82. In that case GD Moraka was charged with an offence under the Cotton Cloth and Yam (Control) Order (1943) in Bombay, and under that Order a sanction from the Provincial Government was necessary to institute a prosecution. The sanction of the provincial government was in the following terms: 
 
Government is pleased to accord sanction under cl 23, Cotton and Yarn (Control) Order 1943, to the prosecution of Mr Gokulchand Dwarkadas Moraka for breach of the provisions of cl 18(2) of the said Order.
 
 
 
By Order of the Governor of Bombay,
 
 
 
(Signed)
 
 
 
Deputy Secretary to Government, Bombay.
 
 
 
There too as it was not clear from the face of the written sanction in reference to the facts of which particular case the sanctioning authority had given its sanction, extraneous evidence was necessary to prove that fact. The Privy Council there held that whatever extraneous evidence that was available on the records was insufficient to establish that the sanction of the sanctioning authority was obtained in relation to the facts of that particular case.
No doubt 
 Moraka 
 `scase was in respect of a sanction and the present case is in respect of a consent but the underlying principle in question in both the cases remains the same. The learned district judge was right in following the decision in 
 Moraka 
`scase regarding this matter.
I find that the written consent, P1A, of the Attorney General does not, on the face of it, show in reference to the facts of which particular case that consent, P1A, was given. Whatever additional material that is available on the records here is to my mind insufficient to show that the Attorney General`s consent contained in P1A was given in relation to the facts of the present case. That being so the prosecution here has failed to prove that it has complied with the provisions of s 31 of the said Ordinance. The learned district judge was right in granting an order of discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the first respondent.
This appeal is dismissed in respect of the first respondent.
For similar considerations, the appeal in respect of the second respondent is also dismissed.

This is an appeal by the appellants against their convictions on a joint charge of murder. They were charged as follows: 
 
That you, Lim Heng Soon @ Ah Soon and Low Ngah Ngah @ Low May Koon @ Ngah Ngah on or about 5 February 1968, at about 11.20pm at Bukit Timah Road, sixth milestone, Singapore, together with one other person unknown, in furtherance of the common intention of all of you committed murder by causing the death of one Munusamy s/o Doresamy, and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the said Code (Cap 119).
 
 
 
The deceased Munusamy was a detective in the Singapore Police Force. On the night of 5 February 1968 he was seen by a friend, Kuppusamy, arresting an unknown male Chinese at a lane off Annamalai Avenue and then leading his captive along Annamalai Avenue towards Bukit Timah Road. The deceased was next seen by another friend, Krishnan, talking with a male Chinese beside a public telephone booth near the junction of Annamalai Avenue and Bukit Timah Road. Krishnan was at the rooftop of a foodstall which was a few feet away from the telephone booth and was repairing the roof. Krishnan overheard the male Chinese asking the deceased to let him go as he had done nothing. Krishnan moved to a position on the roof nearer the telephone booth and squatted facing away from Bukit Timah Road and in the direction of a five-foot way which runs off Annamalai Avenue and parallel to Bukit Timah Road.
While in that position he saw three other male Chinese walking together along the five-foot way from the direction of Annamalai Avenue. They rushed across a foot-bridge towards where the deceased was standing with his captive and one of them knocked against the deceased enabling the captive to run away. The three Chinese then took positions, one behind the deceased, one on his right and one on his left and the deceased was held by two of them. He was then stabbed by the two who were beside him and fell down with the upper portion of his person lying on some aerated water cases. In that half-reclining position he managed to fire some shots from a revolver at one of the Chinese who was bending down in a manner as if to stab him again. Krishnan heard the sound of gunfire and saw green and red flame on the chest of the Chinese who was bending over the deceased.
Krishnan while witnessing this assault jumped down from the roof and ran to a bus shelter near by and while he was there he saw three persons walking abreast in the direction of Annamalai Avenue. He saw one of them, who was the centre one of the three, fall or appearing to fall and then being assisted along by the other two. He then went towards where the deceased was assaulted and found him lying on the ground with stab wounds. He subsequently accompanied the deceased in an ambulance which took the deceased to the Thomson Road Hospital. While he was outside the hospital, where he had been told to wait, he saw a green car and in it were three persons, two male and a female. He then saw a trolley or wheel chair being brought from the hospital on which one of the two males was put. This male person, who had on a sleeveless singlet at the time, he recognised as the `person who stabbed the first stab` and whose chest he saw aflame when he heard the sound of gunfire.
At an identification parade Krishnan identified the second appellant as one of the three male Chinese who took part in the stabbing of the deceased on 5 February 1968. The first appellant was examined by a doctor of the Thomson Road Hospital at about 12.45am on 6 February and found to have two bullet wounds one about three inches from the mid-line between the third and fourth ribs (hereinafter referred to as `the lower wound`), the other about six inches from the mid-line between the tenth and eleventh ribs (hereinafter referred to as `the higher wound`) on the left side of the front of the chest. X-rays were taken and the doctor then operated on the first appellant at about 3am the same evening and extracted two bullets, one from the left side of the tenth intercostal space and the other which was found embedded in the muscle in the abdominal wall. The doctor also found that the tenth and 11th ribs were fractured and the fractures were comminuted fractures.
An autopsy was performed on the deceased detective and the pathologist gave evidence that he found six triradiate incised and clear cut stab wounds all in the area of the chest and a small degloving abrasion over the palmar surface of the right thumb adjacent to the inter-phalangeal joint and that he certified the cause of death as shock and haemorrhage from multiple stab wounds. The six stab wounds apart from one of one cm deep ranged from a depth of seven cm to 13 cm.
The pathologist stated it was likely that each of those stab wounds was caused by `a sharp-pointed weapon with three edges, three sharp edges, such as a bearing scraper`. When he was giving evidence at the trial, the Deputy Public Prosecutor produced for him to see an instrument and the following questions and answers appeared in the transcript: 
 
Q: Now you have described the weapon that could have caused this one as a bearing scraper, something with sharp edges and with a point - would it be consistent with a weapon of this kind here?
A: Yes. 
His Lordship: What is that? 
Q: That would be a bearing scraper, doctor - you have it in mind? (DPP produces a bearing scraper). 
A: Yes. 
Q: The kind of weapon - 
A: The kind of weapon that was used. 
Mr Khoo: My Lord, It cannot be produced by any means. This is downright prejudicial. 
His Lordship: He is just showing what a bearing scraper is. 
DPP: Yes, this is to let them understand,
 
 
 
Another witness, Neo Yew, a bus conductor who owned a green Morris Oxford car was woken up by his wife at about 11.30pm on 5 February 1968 and as a result of what his wife told him he got up, opened the door of his house and saw three persons outside, one of whom was injured. He knew the injured person as Ah Soon (the first appellant) and one of the other two as Ngah Ngah (the second appellant) and the third as Sim Tua Poon. He was asked to take the injured person in his car to `the dispensary`. He went into his house to change and on going out he saw the second appellant assisting, the first appellant to get into the rear seat and saw blood on his chest. He then took them in his car and while driving he asked what the matter was and the second appellant replied that there had been a fight `outside Bukit Timah` with a detective who had opened fire and hit the first appellant. The first appellant also said he had a fight with a detective who opened fire and hit him. On hearing this, Neo Yew became frightened and instead of taking them to the hospital, which he had intended to, drove them to a place called `Ya Kar`, switched off the engine and told them he did not want to take them to hospital as he was frightened.
At that time and at `Ya Kar` a woman whom Neo Yew described as `Ah Soon`s friend, appeared to me like his fiancee`, came along and subsequently Neo Yew, with the first appellant and the girl friend sitting in the rear seat, drove to the Thomson Road Hospital. During the journey to the hospital he heard the first appellant telling the girl friend that if she was asked she was to say that they had been to see a Hokkien opera in the kampong and after the opera as they were hungry they went to have food at a stall in Bukit Timah Road and on arriving there some people were fighting and a detective opened fire and hit the first appellant. On arriving at the Thomson Road Hospital the first appellant was taken by a hospital attendant into the hospital in a wheel chair.
On 2 April 1968 Neo Yew was shown a male Chinese at the CID and he identified him as Ngah, the person who had helped Ah Soon into the car on the night of 5 February 1968. He also identified the first and second appellants at the trial as Ah Soon and Ngah Ngah respectively both of whom were known to him before 5 February 1968.
At 11.15am the next day a postman found a gun in the pillar post-box at the junction of Holland Road and Pierce Road which he took and handed over to a police officer at the Holland Road Police Station. The collection times for that particular post-box were 11.15am and 4.30pm daily. The gun was a .38 revolver bearing a Singapore Police Force registration number 294 as well as the manufacturer`s number and was the gun issued to the deceased.
A witness Ang Su Hoo who lived in a kampong at Jalan Tua also known as `Ya Kar`, having gone to bed after 11pm on the night of 5 February 1968 was awakened by a commotion in the kampong. He went out and saw a car with Neo Yew in the driver`s seat and two men and a girl in the rear seat. The two men were Ah Soon (the first appellant) and Ngah (the second appellant) both of whom were known to him and Ah Soon was lying down. The second appellant came out of the car, approached him and showed him a revolver and told him it belonged to a detective. The second appellant then broke open the revolver, told him there were five rounds of ammunition in it, and then kept the revolver in his own right trouser pocket saying that the detective had used the revolver to shoot the first appellant. The second appellant then asked Ang Su Hoo to take him on Ang`s motor-cycle to a place called Ban Guan Estate and this Ang did. On arrival there, the second appellant told Ang he wanted to drop the revolver into a post-box. Ang identified the first appellant and the second appellant to the police as the two males he saw with the girl in the rear seat of Neo Yew`s car.
Both appellants elected to make statements from the dock and as a result their evidence could not be subjected to cross-examination. The first appellant denied stabbing the deceased and explained that he had received the two bullet wounds found in his chest in the following circumstances. On the night of 5 February 1968 he had been to see a 
 wayang 
 show with his fiancee. After the show he cycled away alone and at the junction of Sixth Avenue and Bukit Timah Road he turned into a five-foot way and arrived at a spot in front of a shop directly opposite the public telephone booth near the junction of Annamalai Avenue and Bukit Timah Road. He saw a few persons engaged in a fight in front of the telephone booth. He parked his bicycle and crossed the foot-bridge towards the telephone booth to find out what the matter was. After crossing the foot-bridge he saw five persons engaged in the fight which was taking place near the telephone booth and one of the contestants was an Indian. This Indian was facing him and on the Indian`s left was a Chinese whom he recognized as Sim Tua Poon who lived near his place of work. Sim was twisting the Indian`s left arm. On the Indian`s right was a male Chinese, the second appellant, who was holding on to the Indian`s right arm with both his hands. Suddenly he heard gun reports in rapid succession and as soon as he heard the first shot he realised he was shot. He immediately held his hands against the upper part of his abdomen and after that heard two other gun reports and fell down feeling very giddy and his chest was hurting. Shortly thereafter, he felt he was being assisted and managed to walk a short distance with the assistance of a person, when another person joined to assist him. After walking a short distance, he was put in the back seat of a car and the next thing he knew was that he was in hospital.
The second appellant denied stabbing the deceased but admitted he was present at the scene. He said he was taking his usual way home after he had got off a taxi at the sixth milestone Bukit Timah Road. He saw an Indian assaulting a Chinese and on seeing that the person assaulted was someone who lived in the same kampong, he asked the Indian to stop the assault but was told to mind his own business. He intervened when the Indian continued to assault his acquaintance and was listed in the face. He became angry and fought with the Indian and after a while three male Chinese rushed up, one of whom was known to him as Sim Tua Poon who stood by the left side of the Indian. The Indian stepped back and drew out a revolver from his right trouser pocket. The second appellant grabbed hold of the Indian`s hand to try and wrench away the revolver and at this stage, it went off three times in rapid succession. Then he heard the Indian groan and saw Sim Tua Poon stab the Indian on the left side of the body. He then successfully wrenched the revolver from the Indian`s hand. One of the other two Chinese then stabbed the Indian who ran off with the three assailants chasing him.
The second appellant left the scene with the Indian`s revolver and saw the first appellant lying speechless near the foot-bridge. He helped the first appellant up and as he was walking him along the five-foot way Sim Tua Poon ran up to them asked what was the matter with the first appellant and then also assisted the first appellant. Later they hailed a passing motorist and Sim Tua Poon asked the motorist to take the injured first appellant to the hospital but he said he was not free. Eventually the motorist took them to Neo Yew`s house and from there they left in Neo Yew`s car without Sim Tua Poon who had refused to accompany them. During the car journey Neo Yew learnt that there was a fight in which the first appellant was shot by someone and be then drove his car back to `Ya Kar`. On alighting from Neo Yew`s car at `Ya Kar`, the second appellant met Ang Su Hoo and after telling Ang that the first appellant had been shot by a detective, and showing Ang the detective`s revolver, went with Ang on Ang`s motor-cycle to Ban Guan Estate. He then put the revolver in the postbox at the junction of Holland Road and Pierce Road and returned to his house in Jurong.
No witnesses were called by the second appellant but the first appellant called one witness, Mr Choo Jim Eng, a consultant surgeon and the head of the Surgical Unit of the Thomson Road Hospital. Mr Choo had on 4 March 1968 seen the first appellant for about two to three minutes when the first appellant came before him for a check-up prior to being discharged from the hospital. The next time he saw the first appellant was on the morning he gave evidence at the trial on 25 November 1968. On this occasion he examined the first appellant for ten to 15 minutes having previously read the case notes or medical report and seen the X-rays of the first appellant`s chest which were taken when he was patient at the Thomson Road Hospital. Mr Choo asked the first appellant on 25 November 1968 what he did when he felt the first shot and in answer the first appellant bent forwards from the waist down. Because of this demonstration by the first appellant, his reading of the medical case note, his examination of the X-rays of the first appellant`s chest and considering the entry wounds and final lodgment of the two bullets, Mr Choo said that it was highly probable that the first bullet hit the body at the lower entry wound, fractured the tenth and 11th ribs and finally lodged in the skin at the back of the body. Postulating (to use his own expression) that the lower entry wound was the first wound, that the parties were eight to ten feet apart, that the person firing was standing up and that the person had bent down on being shot, Mr Choo said the second bullet caused the upper entry wound and travelled horizontally along the subcutaneous fat and muscles of the abdominal wall without penetrating the chest cavity or the abdominal cavity and lodged just in front of the right flank about one inch below the tip of the 11th rib.
Mr Patel, a prosecution witness, the surgeon who operated on the first appellant and recovered the two bullets lodged in his body was not able to say which bullet wound, the upper or the lower entry wound, was inflicted first. He found one bullet on the left side behind the back about four inches from the mid-line and another bullet embedded in the muscles of the abdominal wall on the right side. He also found the tenth and 11th ribs were fractured, both fractures being comminuted fractures. He said it was unlikely that both fractures could have been caused by one bullet and that the bullet that made the lower entry wound traversed the chest wall fractured a rib and after spending its force lodged in the chest wall and that the bullet which caused the upper entry wound lodged on the left side behind the back and was the one which he felt during his clinical examination of the patient. Mr Choo, on the other hand, said that the bullet that caused the lower entry wound fractured both the tenth and 11th ribs and finally lodged in the skin at the back of the patient and disagreed with Mr Patel that one bullet could not have caused the comminuted fractures of both the tenth and 11th ribs.
Shortly after the jury retired to consider their verdict a member of the jury made a request to an officer of the court to whose charge the jury had been committed and as a consequence of that request the officer of the court obtained from the investigating police officer and handed over to the jury the bearing scraper which had been shown to the pathologist and which the pathologist had stated in evidence was the kind of weapon he meant when he said that the stab wounds found on the deceased were caused by `a sharp-pointed weapon with three edges, three sharp edges, such as a bearing scraper`.
It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that this amounted to the introduction in the trial of further evidence after the jury had retired to consider their verdict, as the bearing scraper, though produced at the trial, was not made an exhibit. It is in our opinion clear that there was no introduction of fresh evidence and therefore no departure from the strict rule of procedure that no further evidence shall be introduced in a trial after the jury have retired to consider their verdict. The bearing scraper which the jury wanted with them when considering their verdict was already part of the evidence introduced during the trial. It was not introduced in evidence at the trial as the weapon that could have caused the injuries on the deceased. It was introduced, as is apparent from the transcript we have earlier set out, to enable the jury to understand the pathologist`s description of the sort of weapon he said could have caused those wounds, namely `a sharp-pointed weapon with three sharp edges`.
The irregularity would seem to be the omission on the part of the trial court to take into its custody and to have marked as an exhibit produced before it the bearing scraper in question but in our opinion no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of this irregularity.
The other points raised on behalf of the first appellant relate to the summing up of the trial judge to the jury. One such point is that it was a mis-direction to direct the jury that `a reasonable doubt means a substantial well-founded concrete doubt such as would influence your decisions in the course of your everyday ordinary affairs`. This point is in our opinion without substance as the learned trial judge continued as follows: 
 
This does not include a fanciful doubt. In other words, members of the jury, you must consider the evidence as a whole and sec that it satisfies you so that you feel sure that the accused committed the offence before you can find him guilty. You must not find him guilty unless you are sure, upon the evidence that has been placed before you in this court, that the crime has been committed and it was accused in the dock who committed that crime and you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
 
 
 
Another criticism of the summing up is that it was a mis-direction to direct the jury that `there is a presumption that every person intends the natural and probable consequences of his actions`. While we agree with the observations of this court in the Malaysian case of 
 Yeo Ah Seng v PP 
 
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 231
  that judges `should avoid using this maxim in their summings-up to the jury when dealing with the question of intention in murder trials` we are of the opinion that the learned trial judge in referring to this common law presumption did not misdirect the jury in the context in which the words complained of appeared in the summing-up. The relevant passage runs thus: 
 
Now, members of the jury, I referred you to the crime of murder, to the offence of murder, that there were three intentions. It is seldom that the intention of an accused person is expressed in words. An accused person is not likely to tell anyone in the hearing of witnesses what he is going to do. It has to be inferred from his conduct and from other relevant circumstances of the case. You must consider all that the accused said and did and also take into consideration other matters relevant to the issue, such as the number of wounds inflicted, the severity, the seriousness of the wounds, and the weapons used. There is a presumption that every person intends the natural and probable consequences of his actions.
 
 
 
The other points raised in the appeal relate to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and in particular to the evidence of the main witness, Krishnan. One general submission is that the learned trial judge failed to give any or any adequate guidance to the jury as to the method of approach in assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the many inconsistencies and contradictions of Krishnan. We know of no principle of law nor has our attention been drawn to any authority which suggests that it is the duty of a judge in his summing up to a jury to give them such guidance.
The Court of Criminal Appeal in England in 
 Stoddart 
 `s case (1909) 2 Cr App R 217 at p 246 case in which the trial occupied 20 days and there was an omission to direct the jury upon many of the complex issues which had been considered in the course of it, cited with approval Lord Esher`s (Lord Esher was then Brett MR) words in 
 Abrath v North Eastern Railway 
 (1883) 11 QBD 400 at p 453 as follows: 
 
It is no misdirection not to tell the jury everything that might have been told them: there is no misdirection unless the judge has told them something wrong, or unless what has been told them would make wrong that which he has left them to understand. Non-direction merely is not misdirection and those who allege misdirection must show that something wrong was said or that something was said which would make wrong that which was left to be understood.
 
 
 
The Court of Criminal Appeal then went on: 
 
Every summing-up must be regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which have been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence respectively. This court does not sit to consider whether this or that phrase was the best that might have been chosen, or that a direction which has been attacked might have been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or whether other topics which might have been dealt with on other occasions should be introduced. This court sits here to administer justice and to deal with valid objections to matters which may have led to a miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 
We agree with these observations and accordingly we find no substance in those of the appellants` grounds of appeal which allege failure on the part of the trial judge to direct the jury on the significance of the absence of any attempt to prove any motive on the part of the appellants or to direct the jury as to the effect of their arrest and detention on the credibility of some of the prosecution witnesses or to warn the jury that Krishnan`s identification of the first appellant was unreliable and reflected on his credibility, or to direct the jury adequately on the issue of self-defence and the conduct of the identification parade.
Another ground of appeal alleges that the trial judge `failed to give adequate directions as to the defence and in particular as to the significance of the evidence of Mr Choo Jim Eng - Consultant Surgeon of the Surgical Unit at Thomson Road Hospital - and that his evidence if accepted proved that the wounds on the first appellant could not have been caused in the manner indicated by the only witness implicating him`. A great deal of time at the trial was taken up by the cross-examination of Dr Patel based on the evidence of Mr Choo Jim Eng, the defence expert medical witness, as well as by the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of Mr Choo Jim Eng and we do not doubt that in their closing addresses both counsel for the prosecution and counsel for the first appellant drew the jury`s attention fully to the evidence of these two medical witnesses and the points for and against the prosecution or the defence arising from their evidence. Having regard to all these factors and to the passages we have quoted from the judgment in 
 Stoddart 
 `s case, supra, we would also reject this ground of appeal.
The last main ground of appeal is that the trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately on the question of common intention. Section 34 of the Penal Code is in the following terms: 
 
When a criminal act is done by several persons, in futherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
 
 
 
The Privy Council in the Indian case of 
 Mahbub Shah v King-Emperor 
 LR 72 IA 148 construed s 34 of the Indian Penal Code, which is in identical terms with our s 34, as follows at p 153: 
 
Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say `the common intention of all`, nor does it say `an intention common to all`. Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
At p 154 the Privy Council said: 
 
In their Lordships` view, the inference of common intention within the meaning of the term in s 34 should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
The trial judge in his summing-up before dealing with the evidence, gave the jury the following directions on the ingredients of the offence of murder and of s 34 of the Penal Code: 
 
Murder is committed if the act by which death is caused is done with one of the following intentions: firstly, with the intention of causing death; secondly, with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom harm is caused; thirdly, with the intention of causing such bodily injury and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
 
 
 
So the offence of murder may briefly be described as the unlawful killing of one human being by another human being with one of the three intentions to which I have referred.
 
 
 
Now, along with this charge of murder the charge says it should be read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Now then, Gentlemen, that section says: `When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone.` Now there are three requirements under this section. First, there must be a common intention among a group of people, that is the first requirement; second, there must be participation in the criminal act by those sharing the common intention; thirdly, the criminal act must be in furtherance of the common intention. Now if these three requirements are there, then every person who participates in the commission of that criminal act would be liable as if he committed the act all by himself, irrespective of the fact that he might have played only a very small part in the commission of the act.
 
 
 
He then went on to direct them that the phrase `common intention` implies that there is a pre-arranged plan and the existence of a common intention may be inferred from the circumstances disclosed in the evidence but this inference must not be drawn unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case.
The trial judge, in our opinion, directed the jury on common intention in accordance with the law as laid down in 
 Mahbub Shah 
 `s case, and this being so it cannot be said that he failed to direct the jury adequately on the question of common intention.
We have earlier set out at some length the evidence before the jury and in our opinion there was ample evidence to justify the verdict of the jury that the appellants were guilty of murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. We would accordingly dismiss the appeals of both appellants.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court in which it was held that the plaintiffs, as administrators of the estate of one Lim Siew Liang, deceased, are entitled to recover damages from the defendants for the deceased`s loss of expectation of life.
The deceased was a poor old woman and one day when she was looking over some rubbish dump in Kolam Ayer Lane she was run into and killed by a lorry driven by the first defendant which was then reversing towards the said rubbish dump. It was alleged at the trial that the first defendant did not look to the rear to ensure that it was safe for him to reverse the lorry at the time of the accident. The defendants alleged that the deceased was a trespasser on the dumping ground; that she entered it at her own risk and that they owed no duty to take reasonable care for her protection. The trial judge held that `the defendants owed a duty of care to the deceased and the act of the first defendant in reversing without looking to make sure that the deceased was not behind the lorry was negligence on his part`. The trial judge held further that the deceased was aware that lorries of the Public Health Department were going in and out of the dumping ground; that she knew that these lorries reverse to get to the face tip to tip the refuse; that she failed to keep a proper lookout; that she failed to observe that the lorry was reversing and that she failed to move to a safe spot to avoid the accident. The trial judge assessed the degree of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased at 50%. Damages having been agreed between the parties at $4,600, judgment was entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $2,300. It is against this judgment that the defendants now appeal.
It is not in dispute that the deceased was a trespasser at the rubbish dump and the first question which arises for determination in this appeal is what duty, if any, does an occupier of premises owe to a trespasser.
There is a considerable body of authority on the duty to trespassers. There is no duty, save only that of not inflicting malicious injury. Hamilton LJ stated the rule of the English common law with great clarity in 
 Latham v Richard Johnson & Nephew Ltd 
 [1911-13] All ER Rep 117 at p 124: 
 
The owner of the property is under a duty not to injure the trespasser wilfully; `not to do` a wilful act in reckless disregard of ordinary humanity towards him; but otherwise a man trespasses at his own risk.
 
 
 
This statement of the law received the full approval of the House of Lords in 
 Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd v Dumbreck 
 
[1929] AC 358
. Lord Hailsham, in his speech observed, at p 365: 
 
The trespasser comes on to the premises at his own risk. An occupier is in such a case liable only where the injury is due to some wilful act involving something more than the absence of reasonable care. There must be some act done with the deliberate intention of doing harm to the trespasser, or at least some act done with reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser.
 
 
 
The principle was reaffirmed by the House of Lords as recently as 1952 in 
 Edwards v Railway Executive 
[1952] AC 737
 where Lord Goddard clarified the law further when he said, at p 747: 
 
A man can only act recklessly with regard to the safety of another if he knows of, or has reason to believe in, the presence of the other.
 
 
 
Turning to the law as laid down by the Privy Council, we find the same principle enunciated in 
 Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Barnett 
[1911] AC 361
 where the plaintiff was injured by a collision which took place on the appellants` railway line. It was held that the plaintiff could not recover damages because he was a trespasser on the train. Lord Robson in giving the decision of the Board stated, at p 369: 
 
The case must therefore be taken on the footing that the respondent was a trespasser, and the question is, what under those circumstances are his rights against the appellant company? ... The railway company was undoubtedly under a duty to the plaintiff not wilfully to injure him; they were not entitled, unnecessarily and knowingly, to increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way, but to say that they were liable to a trespasser for the negligence of their servants is to place them under a duty to him of the same character as that which they undertake to those whom they carry for reward. The authorities do not justify the imposition of any such obligation in such circumstances.
 
 
 
Two recent decisions of the Privy Council reaffirm the limits of the duty to trespassers. In 
 Commissioner of Railway v Quinlan 
[1964] 1 All ER 897, Viscount Radcliffe reviewed all the authorities and laid down the law in the following terms: 
 
... If on the evidence a plaintiff is a trespasser, a person present without right or licence, the occupier`s duty to him is determined by the general formula as laid down in 
 Addie`s
case [1929] All ER Rep at p 4. That formula may embrace an extensive and, it may be, an expanding interpretation of what is wanton or reckless conduct towards a trespasser in any given situation, and, in the case of children, it will not preclude full weight being given to any reckless lack of care involved in allowing things naturally dangerous to them to be accessible in their vicinity. What the law does not admit, however, is that a trespasser, while incapable of being described otherwise than as a trespasser should be elevated to the status of an ordinary member of the public to whom, if rightfully present, the occupier owes duties of foresight and reasonable care ...
 
 
 
And in 
 Commissioner of 
 
 Railways v McDermott 
[1966] 2 All ER 162 Lord Gardiner LC who delivered the judgment of the Board had this to say, at p 170: 
 
No duty is owing to a trespasser until it becomes known either that he is present or that the presence of a trespasser is extremely likely. They duty, when it arises, is a duty of a very limited character - not to injure him wilfully, and not to behave with reckless disregard for his safety.
 
 
 
The judgment of the trial judge shows that he appreciated the law applicable in the case of a trespasser and it is necessary now to examine his application of it to the facts of this case.
The facts, briefly, are these. The accident took place at the dumping ground for refuse at Kolam Ayer Lane. This site has been so used since 1952 and is under the control of the Superintendent of Public Cleansing, Ministry of Health. This dumping ground is not a prohibited area but there are signboards put up to warn outsiders that no unauthorised persons are admitted to this ground is not a prohibited area but there are signboards put up to warn outsiders that no unauthorized persons are admitted to this ground. The signboards are in the four languages. In spite of the signboards members of the public do trespass on to this ground. There is a watchman on duty and a mandor in charge of the dumping work who do their bit in chasing away the trespassers but with little success. Occasionally the police are called in to assist in keeping out the trespassers. Some trespassers have been prosecuted in the courts for trespassing. The trespassers usually gather at the face tip where refuse is unloaded. The face tip is over a wide area. The primary purpose of the trespassers is to collect items of value such as scrap metals, rags, etc from the discharged refuse. Health department lorries carrying refuse drive into the dumping ground and when they reach a certain distance from the face tip, the lorries reverse towards the face tip to discharge the load of refuse. After discharging its refuse the lorry moves off and the refuse is later bulldozed into the swamp. Sometimes when a lorry is reversing towards the face tip in order to unload the refuse, trespassers rush to the spot where they anticipate the refuse will fall, the reason being to get there first in order to salvage what they can from the discharged refuse.
As to the accident itself the only evidence adduced at the trial was that of the first defendant. He stated that he drove his lorry, laden with refuse, into this dumping ground, turned to his right and stopped in order to reverse his lorry. He looked into his nearside mirror but did not see anything. Then he opened the offside door of the driver`s cabin and turned around and looked towards the rear of his lorry. Seeing nothing behind his lorry he engaged the reverse gear and slowly reversed the lorry. While he was reversing he was looking at the nearside and offside mirrors. Just then he heard someone shout, `Oh! Oh!` He thought there was another vehicle behind his lorry and so he changed gear and drove forward. Someone ran up to his lorry and told him that he had knocked down a person. He got down from his lorry and went to its rear where he saw an old woman lying on the ground.
The first defendant admitted in cross-examination that when his lorry entered the dumping ground he saw a number of trespassers at a spot which he marked on the sketch plan of the scene. These people according to him were picking up tins from the discharged refuse and he maintained that he did not see anybody in between this group of trespassers and his lorry. He did not see the deceased when he drove in and there was no one at the spot where he later saw the deceased lying on the ground.
The trial judge disbelieved the first defendant`s evidence that he looked back towards the rear of his vehicle before he commenced to reverse it and counsel for the appellants has no quarrel with this finding.
It is important to consider the facts on which the trial judge held the defendants liable. The trial judge`s findings of fact are set out in the following passage from his judgment: 
 
Now what are the facts in this case? The evidence of the first defendant and of the Superintendent of Public Cleansing and of the Divisional Public Health Assistant clearly show that the defendants knew the presence of the trespassers and in fact on the day of the accident the first defendant saw many trespassers picking tins there. On the authority of 
 Quinlan`s
case the defendants owed a duty of care to the deceased and the act of the first defendant in reversing without looking to make sure that the deceased was not behind the lorry was negligence on his part.
 
 
 
The trial judge would appear to have found that the defendants knew of the presence of trespassers in the prohibited area. In our opinion, that clearly is not sufficient to fix liability on the defendants. The duty to a trespasser arises only when his presence is either known or is considered extremely likely. When that is proved, then and only then, does the question of liability arise. In so far as knowledge is concerned, the knowledge required to set up any duty at all in the occupier is his personal knowledge of the other`s presence. A person`s knowledge is a question of fact. Such a fact is a very different thing from the objective question whether there was a reasonable likelihood of someone being present at the relevant time and place and whether a person ought to have foreseen that likelihood.
What is the factual position in this case? There is no evidence that the first defendant knew that the deceased was at the rear of his lorry or anywhere near its path when he commenced to reverse it. It is true that he saw a group of trespassers at the scene but they were well away from his lorry and were towards its front offside. The crucial question therefore is, can it be said, on the evidence, that the deceased`s presence in the path of the reversing lorry was, to the first defendant`s knowledge, extremely likely? The trial judge did not consider this question at all and it befalls us now to answer it. In our opinion the facts of the case cannot justify an affirmative answer. The trial judge was therefore wrong in holding the defendants liable in damages. It is insufficient to fix the defendants with liability that the deceased was a member of a class of persons whom the defendants knew to be in the habit of resorting to the dumping ground. Nor is mere negligence on the part of the first defendant sufficient.
On the facts of this case there was no duty on the defendants towards the deceased and accordingly they are not liable to the plaintiffs in damages. The appeal is allowed with costs here and below.

In this case the first plaintiff was at all material times the owner of taxi No SH 2598 which was driven by the second plaintiff along Changi Road near the 121/2 milestone towards the city at about 1.30pm on 12 April 1965 when it came into collision with taxi No SH 4551 which was driven by the first defendant and was travelling in the opposite direction towards Changi Point.
By their statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that the second defendant was at all material times the owner of taxi No SH 4551. The plaintiffs therefore claimed damages against both the defendants. The learned trial judge awarded the second plaintiff the sum of $1,200 as general damages and the sum of $1,298 as special damages against the first defendant. He also gave judgment in the agreed sum of $4,165 in favour of the first plaintiff against the first defendant. The claim by the first plaintiff against the second defendant was dismissed with costs as no evidence had been given to show that the second defendant was the owner of taxi No SH 4551 or that the first defendant was his servant or agent. The first defendant has now brought this appeal against the judgment of the learned trial judge.
The second plaintiff`s version of the accident was as follows. As he was driving along Changi Road, the first defendant`s taxi, which was travelling in the opposite direction, overtook a moving bus and in doing so went over the broken white line in the centre of the road into his path and collided with his taxi. He first saw the on-coming taxi when it was about 30 feet away. He was then driving along the middle of his side of the road at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. He applied his brakes violently and swerved to the left but was unable to avoid the collision.
The first defendant gave the following version of the accident. As he was driving his taxi along Changi Road to Changi Point he saw the second plaintiff`s taxi approaching him when it was 200 yards away. There was a car 100 yards ahead of him which passed the second plaintiff`s taxi when it was 100 yards away from him. The second plaintiff`s taxi, which was being driven unsteadily, came on to the first defendant`s side of the road. The first defendant applied his brakes but the second plaintiff`s taxi came right in front of him and there was a collision between the two taxis as a result of which the first defendant`s taxi was spun round in a clockwise direction. When the first defendant applied his brakes he was 16 feet away from the second plaintiff`s taxi.
In connection with the first defendant`s version of the accident it is relevant to note that the brake marks made by his taxi were 66 feet six inches in length and he was unable to explain why they were so long.
After considering the two versions and the other evidence in the case, the learned trial judge made a finding of fact that the first defendant encroached on the second plaintiff`s path by crossing the centre white line immediately before the accident. The learned trial judge came to the conclusion that the first defendant was wholly to blame for the collision.
Counsel for the first defendant commenced his argument before us by attempting to show that the learned trial judge had erred in finding as a fact that the first defendant`s taxi had gone to its wrong side of the road. We are of the opinion that there is no substance in the submissions of counsel for the first defendant on this point.
Counsel for the first defendant went on to argue that the second plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.
Before considering this argument, it is useful to refer to the following passage from 28 
 Halsbury`s Laws 
 (3rd Ed) pp 89, 90 para 93 which, in our view, correctly sets out the law to be applied to this case: 
 
The existence of contributory negligence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party sued and all that is necessary to establish a plea of contributory negligence is to prove that the injured party did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed by this want of care to his own injury.
 
 
 
The principle involved is that, where a man is part author of his own wrong, he cannot call on the other party to compensate him in full. The standard of care depends upon foreseeability. Just as actionable negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to others, so contributory negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to oneself. A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonably prudent man, he might hurt himself.
 
 
 
In the present case the evidence shows that the two taxis were on a straight stretch of road and that visibility was good. The fact that the first defendant`s taxi left brake marks which were 66 feet and six inches in length on the road indicates that the first defendant swerved to the right some distance before the commencement of the brake marks. In spite of this, the second plaintiff did not see the on-coming taxi until it was about 30 feet away from him. There is also the fact which was found by the learned trial judge that the first defendant`s taxi did not encroach very far into the wrong side of the road. In view of all these considerations, we are of the opinion that the second plaintiff did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed by this want of care to his own injury.
In the circumstances of this case we apportion the fault as to one-fourth to the second plaintiff and as to three-fourths to the first defendant. The damages awarded to the second plaintiff should be reduced accordingly. The evidence shows that the second plaintiff was not a servant of the first plaintiff; the second plaintiff had hired the taxi from the first plaintiff and was driving it for the purpose of carrying passengers for profit on his own account. The damages awarded to the first plaintiff therefore remain unaltered.
The appeal is allowed to this extent and the judgment of the learned trial judge varied in the manner indicated.

In this suit the plaintiff claims damages for injury to the plaintiff`s premises alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the first defendant and by the negligence of the second defendant or alternatively by the negligence of one or other of them in the driving of their respective motor vehicles.
The facts are these. The plaintiff is the owner of premises known as No 196 Bencoolen Street, Singapore, hereinafter referred to as `the said premises`. On 29 March 1967 the first defendant drove motor car ST 441 and the second defendant drove motor taxi No SH 2884 so negligently into one another that both vehicles immediately thereafter ran into and collided with and damaged the said premises.
The first defendant did not enter appearance and was absent at the trial. The second defendant was also absent at the trial but was represented by counsel who did not call any witness. The plaintiff did not call any eye witness of the accident. Counsel for the plaintiff attempted to put in evidence the reports made to the police by the first and second defendants but I ruled that these reports were inadmissible under the Evidence Ordinance as the makers of the reports had not given evidence. It is generally not understood that such a report is admissible for the sole purpose of impeaching the credit of the person who made the report and for no other purpose. Hence if the person who made the report does not give evidence at the trial his report is inadmissible. In the result there was no evidence at all before the court as to the circumstances under which the collision took place.
However, it is not in dispute that motor car No ST 441 driven by the first defendant was travelling along Albert Street from the direction of Selegie Road and proceeding towards Queen Street; that taxi No SH 2884 driven by the second defendant was travelling along Bencoolen Street from the direction of Jalan Besar and proceeding towards Bras Basah Road; that the collision between the two vehicles took place at the intersection of Albert Street; and Bencoolen Street and that after the collision both vehicles went off the road and hit the said premises which are on the left side of Bencoolen Street as one faces Bras Basah Road.
Counsel for the second defendant submitted that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff and as he had called no evidence to show how the accident occurred, the claim of the plaintiff should be dismissed. I am unable to accept this submission. If two motor cars collide in the centre of the road, the inference is, in the absence of evidence enabling the court to draw any other conclusion, that the drivers of both were equally to blame, and it is not a proper decision to hold, in the absence of evidence enabling the blame to be fixed upon one driver or the other, that no sufficient case has been established against either. See 
 Baker v Market Harborough Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd 
 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
 and 
 Bray v Palmer 
 [1953] 2 All ER 1449. In my opinion the same principle applies in the case of a collision at cross roads.
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the second defendant should have given the right of way to the first defendant`s car because it was coming from the second defendant`s right hand side; that the failure of the second defendant to do so was the cause of the accident and that the second defendant was therefore solely responsible for the accident and for the damage to the said premises.
Counsel for the second defendant submitted that Bencoolen Street is a major road; that as the first defendant was coming out of a minor road on to a major road he should have done so only when it was safe for him to do that; that the accident was caused by the first defendant`s failure to observe taxi SH 2884 travelling along Bencoolen Street and that the accident was due entirely to the negligence of the first defendant.
There was no evidence before the court that Bencoolen Street was a major road in March 1967 when this accident occurred. It is true that Bencoolen Street is today a major road because all traffic from Upper Serangoon coming towards town has to use Bencoolen Street but this was not so at the time of the accident. According to the police sketch plan Bencoolen Street is 63 feet four inches wide on the west side of the intersection and 53 feet one inch wide on the east side of the intersection. Albert Street is 57 feet two inches wide on the south side of the intersection and 50 feet three inches wide on the north side of the intersection. There are no traffic lights installed at this intersection and traffic is thus uncontrolled. The accident took place at night at about 1am when there could have been hardly any traffic along either of these road.
In my opinion this was a collision at crossroads of equal status. There is a clear obligation to take special care at cross-roads and this is so even if one of the cross-roads is a major road. The driver of a vehicle which approaches a major road from a side road ought to give way to traffic on the major road, but the driver of a vehicle on the major road is not absolved from the duty of taking care to avoid collision with a vehicle emerging from a side road. See 
 Dorrington v Griff-Fender (Swansea) Ltd 
 [1953] 1 All ER 1177 Where there is a collision at cross-roads of equal status, as in this case, the inference to be drawn in the absence of special circumstances is that both drivers have been equally negligent. See 
 France v 
 
 Parkinson 
 [1954] 1 All ER 739. There is no evidence of any special circumstances in this case. A collision did take place between two motor cars at that wide and spacious cross-road. On those facts there is a prima faciecase that both the drivers were negligent. I am therefore satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a prima faciecase of negligence against the second defendant and as this prima faciecase has not been displaced, the plaintiff must succeed. As the plaintiff is an innocent third party it is enough for him to prove negligence against the second defendant even if it is not the whole of the negligence.
Counsel for the second defendant submitted that if the court holds that both defendants were equally negligent, then the judgment against the second defendant should be only for 50% of the total sum assessed as damages in this case. In my opinion this submission also fails. It is clear law that if each of several persons, not acting in concert, commits a tort against another person substantially contemporaneously and causing the same or indivisible damage, each tort-feasor, is liable for the whole damage. See 
 Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd 
 
[1961] 2 QB 162
 and 
 Drinkwater v Kimber 
 [1932] 2 QB 281. In 
 Dingle`s 
 case, Devlin LJ said at page 188: 
 
... Where injury has been done to the plaintiff and the injury is indivisible, any tort-feasor whose act has been a proximate cause of the injury must compensate for the whole of it. As between the plaintiff and the defendant it is immaterial that there are others whose acts also have been a cause of the injury and it does not matter whether those others have or have not a good defence. These factors would be relevant in a claim between tort-feasors for contribution, but the plaintiff is not concerned with that; he can obtain judgment for total compensation from anyone whose act has been a cause of his injury. If there are more than one of such persons, it is immaterial to the plaintiff whether they are joint tort-feasors or not. If four men, acting severally and not in concert, strike the plaintiff one after another and as a result of his injuries he suffers shock and is detained in hospital and loses a month`s wages, each wrongdoer is able to compensate for the whole loss of earnings. If there were four distinct physical injuries, each man would be liable only for the consequences peculiar to the injury he inflicted, but in the example I have given the loss of earnings is one injury caused in part by all four defendants. It is essential for this purpose that the loss should be one and indivisible; whether it is so or not is a matter of fact and not a matter of law ... .
 
 
 
By the common law the plaintiff is entitled to recover the whole of the damages awarded in this case.
The plaintiff proved that the repairs to the said premises cost him the sum of $2,650. He stated further that he had engaged an architect to prepare a plan for carrying out the repairs and that the architect had charged him $516 of which he had paid $100 and the balance was still due to the architect. When the architect in question, a Mr Kwan, gave evidence he stated that he had not received any payment at all and that whole sum of $516 was still due. It would appear that the plan was prepared by one Mr Siddique and although it was signed by Mr Kwan it was Mr Siddique who was in charge of the repairs and the plaintiff`s evidence was that he had paid $100 to Mr Siddique. Although these repairs were carried out some two years ago the remaining sum due to the architect has not yet been paid. In my opinion the whole cost of the plan to the plaintiff was only $100. I would therefore award the plaintiff the cost of the repairs amounting to $2,650 and another $100 being the cost of the plan.
The plaintiff also claims interest on the amount awarded as damages from the date of the accident. In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to interest from the date on which payment for the repairs was made. The repairs were completed and payment made to the contractor on 12 July 1967. A demand for payment was then made to The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corp Ltd, the insurers of the second defendant`s vehicle but this insurance company denied liability on the ground that the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of the first defendant. In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the sum of $2,750 at 6% per annum as from 12 July 1967. Accordingly there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,750 together with interest thereon at 6% per annum as from 12 July 1967. The second defendant will also pay the plaintiff`s costs of this action as taxed.

The second plaintiff in this suit is the wife of the first plaintiff and on 8 August 1967 at about 8pm she was riding pillion on a motor-cycle ridden by her husband along Orange Grove Road, Singapore, when their motor-cycle was knocked down by a car driven by the defendant. Both plaintiffs sustained injuries and they now claim damages from the defendant in respect of those injuries.
The first plaintiff`s version of the accident is as follows. He was travelling about three or four feet from left edge of the road at a speed of 20 mph. He saw the defendant`s car coming from the opposite direction. When the car was about to cross him it suddenly came straight towards him. He attempted to avoid it but failed to do so. The car collided with the front part of his motor-cycle and it was the front offside of the car which hit his motorcycle. He and his wife were flung on to the left side grass verge. The car ended up in the drain on the left side of the road. He and his wife were both injured and were taken to hospital in an ambulance.
The defendant`s version is that he was travelling along Orange Grove Road in the direction of Orchard Road and was doing between 20 and 25 mph. He was travelling on his correct side and was one or two feet from the left kerb. There was a sharp bend in the road and as he came out of this bend he saw a motor-cyclist coming from the opposite direction. The motor-cyclist came very fast and he did not have time to avoid him. After the impact he lost control and the car glided on to the wrong side of the road and finished up in the drain. Under cross-examination he admitted that the collision took place when he came out of a right hand bend. He admitted further that he took the bend at 25 mph; that he did not know on what part of the road the impact took place; that he might have crossed over to the wrong side of the road a foot or so and that he lost control of his car after the impact.
Counsel for the defendant submits that the impact took place in the middle of the road and therefore both the first plaintiff and the defendant were equally to blame for the accident. I am unable to accept this submission because 
 it is not supported 
 by the evidence in this case.
I accept the first plaintiff`s version of the accident which is supported by the evidence of his wife. In my opinion it is clearly established that the motor-cycle was travelling on its correct side of the road when the impact took place. This is so not only because of the evidence of the two plaintiffs but also because the defendant concedes that he may have gone a foot or so over to the wrong side of the road. In my opinion what happened was that the defendant in coming out of a right hand bend went over to the wrong side of the road and collided with the plaintiff`s motor-cycle which was travelling on its proper side of the road. The defendant was therefore clearly at fault. The accident was due solely to the negligence of the defendant in driving on to the wrong side of the road and in failing to slow down, swerve or otherwise avoid the collision. In my opinion there was no contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff.
The first plaintiff sustained a compound fracture of the right metacarpal bone and a fracture dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint of right ring finger. He also claims $48 for transport expenses incurred in 12 trips to General Hospital and $7 for transport expenses incurred on seven trips to an outdoor clinic where he went for medical attention and $406.75 for repairs to his motor-cycle.
I award him $3,000 as damages for the injuries sustained by him in this accident and $55 for transport expenses incurred in travelling to the General Hospital and the outdoor clinic. As regards the claim of $406.75 for repairs to his motor-cycle, I consider this to be on the high side. According to the police officer who investigated this accident the parts of the motor-cycle which were damaged were the handle bar, the front mudguard, the number plate and both the front forks. Even if all these parts were replaced by new parts I do not think that their cost would amount to $406.75. I agree with counsel for the defendant that the first plaintiff`s claim for the cost of the repairs to the motor-cycle is grossly exaggerated. Although a receipted bill for $406.75 has been produced, the person who carried out the repairs was not called as a witness and therefore counsel for the defendant has been denied the opportunity of cross examining him to ascertain why the repairs cost as much as $406.75. I do not think that the repairs to the motor-cycle would have cost more than $150 and accordingly I award $150 for this item of the claim. In the result I award general damages to the first plaintiff in the sum of $3,000 and another $205 as special damages.
The second plaintiff sustained much more serious injuries. She had a fracture of the right radius and ulna, compound comminuted supracondular fracture of the right femur and a fracture of the right first metatarsal bone. She was in hospital for over three months and had to continue treatment as an outpatient for several months. She has now a 21/2 inch shortening of the right leg and movement of the right knee is limited in 10[deg ] short of extension and flexed up to 80[deg ], ie a range of 70[deg ]. There is evidence of osteoarthritis in the right knee. The recovery from the other fractures is excellent. In view of the shortening of the right leg and the marked osteo-arthritic changes in the knee, she will no longer be able to perform her occupation as a domestic servant. She will, however, be able to do household duties of a minor degree. The question of damages for pain, suffering and disablement due to the injuries sustained in this accident does not present much difficulty because in my opinion, taking into consideration all her injuries, her age and her station in life, a sum of $20,000 will amply compensate her. What is much more difficult is the assessment of damages for loss of future earnings. She was at the time of the accident employed as a domestic servant by a UK-based civilian employed by the British Services in Singapore. She was paid $160 pm. Previous to that she was employed by a military officer at $150 pm. It is well-known that the British Services are gradually pulling out of Singapore and there will be a complete withdrawal by the end of 1971. The second plaintiff is now unable to work as a domestic servant. What is her loss in future earnings? Could she have had regular employment at $160 pm till the end of 1971? What salary would she have received after 1971? For how many years would she have worked as a domestic servant? These are some of the questions to which answers must be found.
The second plaintiff is 24 years old. She says she would have worked for another 15 years. She has three children aged six, five and four. They were looked after by her mother when she was employed as a domestic servant. She lived at her employer`s residence and came home to visit her children once a week. What would have happened if her mother had died or for some other reason was unable to look after the second plaintiff`s children? Would the second plaintiff in those circumstances have stopped work as a domestic servant in order to remain at home to look after her children? This is another factor which has to be taken into consideration in assessing loss of future earnings.
In my opinion she would most probably have been in regular employment as a domestic servant with the Service personnel until about the end of 1971 but not at $160 pm. As more and more Service personnel leave Singapore there will be an abundance of servants looking for employment and wages are bound to fall if they have not already fallen. The accident occurred on 8 August 1967. In my opinion the salary she would have earned till, say, August 1971, ie for a period of four years from the date of the accident would have averaged $120 pm. A sum of $5,112 invested at 5% will produce $120 pm for four years. After August 1971 I do not think she could have earned more than $80 pm as a domestic servant employed by an Asian family. There will be a glut of domestic servants available when the British Services have completely withdrawn from Singapore. Having regard to all the usual factors that are taken into consideration when assessing damages for lost of future earnings I would award her $80 pm for another six years. A sum of $4,876.80 invested at 5% will produce $80 pm for six years. The second plaintiff claims $412 for transport expenses incurred on 103 visits to the General Hospital as an outpatient. Counsel for the defendant submits that this claim is exaggerated. The second plaintiff did not adduce any evidence in support of this claim. She stated that each trip by taxi cost her $4 and that she had to make such a large number of trips because she was undergoing physiotherapy treatment at the General Hospital thrice a week. In my opinion she was speaking the truth and I would allow her claim for $412. In the result I award her $29,988.80 as general damages and another $412 as special damages.
There will be judgment for the first plaintiff in the sum of $3,205 and for the second plaintiff in the sum of $30,400.80. The defendant will pay the plaintiffs` costs of this action as taxed. The amount of the judgment in favour of such plaintiff is to be paid to the Public Trustee in trust for the plaintiffs. There will be the usual order for payment of costs by the Public Trustee out of the monies in his hands.

Section 5 Defamation Ordinance 1957 (FM No 20 of 1957)
 
In the normal way I would have written a considerably longer judgment than the one I am now about to deliver. The various aspects both factual and legal which were presented to me in the course of a protracted trial, which commenced on 24 June 1968 and came to an end on 17 July this year do not, on further reflection, necessitate such a course because the essential issues of fact, despite detailed and exhaustive presentation and pursuit over 25 working days, are relatively simple and the law relating thereto reasonably clear.
The plaintiff is a member of the Bar who is now of about eight years` standing. His complaint is that the words hereinafter set out were uttered to his friends and his clients in terms calculated to disparage him in his office and he also contends that not only did these words lower him in the esteem of mankind generally but also tended to injure him in his profession.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant had been friends from about 1962 until 1964 when the plaintiff prevailed upon the defendant to let him have the tenancy of the front portion of the first floor of the premises known as 61A Chulia Street, of which the defendant`s wife was the landlord. In fact, the wife of the defendant is more or less the defendant`s nominee. To cut a long story short, that friendship came to an end towards the latter part of 1964. The defendant and the plaintiff who was his solicitor in some matters had been associated in a number of transactions and enterprises, into the details of which I think it is unnecessary here to probe. Suffice it to say that disagreement and dissatisfaction took place on the part of the defendant who desired to terminate his connection with these transactions and to dissociate himself from them entirely. Matters came to a head when the defendant refused to be involved in these enterprises and withdrew from further association with the plaintiff therein.
It is alleged by the plaintiff that the defendant then started a campaign designed to get rid of the plaintiff from the premises. The plaintiff, of course, had spent some money in renovating the premises to make them suitable for a lawyer`s practice. He had air-conditioners put in, the walls white-washed and so on and had spent in all something like $7,000 in renovations.
It is quite clear from the evidence which is overwhelmingly in favour of the plaintiff that the defendant started a nuisance campaign to give as much trouble as possible to the plaintiff in order to induce him to leave the premises as well as to deprive him of clients both present and potential. There is little doubt that the defendant defied the plaintiff to do what he could to extricate himself from his unhappy position.
The alleged slanderous statements uttered by the defendant are set out in paras 4 and 5 of the statement of claim as follows:
 
 
(4) (a) (Why) is that lawyer upstairs showing off. He can`t even pay me three months` rent. 
 
(4) (b) The lawyer upstairs owes me three months` rent and still can`t pay up. He thinks that (because) he`s a lawyer I should be afraid of him. 
 
(5) (a) That lawyer upstairs owes me five months` rent and I intend to tell all his clients about it. 
 
(5) (b) What kind of lawyer is he; he owes me seven months` rent and cannot pay.
  
 
 
Four witnesses were called on behalf of the plaintiff to testify to the fact that the defendant uttered these words to them separately and on the various dates and at the times set out as follows:
 
 
Re 4(a) Yeap Pik Kiong 7 April 1965 at about 1.30pm. 
 
Re 4(b) Ho Yuan Wang, 9 April 1965 at about 1.30pm. 
 
Re 5(a) Sng Song Teck, 7 April 1965 at about 3.00pm. 
 
Re 5(b) Tan Hai Tong, 6 April 1965 at about 11.00am.
  
 
 
These witnesses gave their evidence reasonably well despite lengthy cross-examination out of which they emerged with flying colours and I accept them as witnesses of truth. I am quite satisfied from the evidence as a whole, including the evidence adduced by the defendant as to his alibi for these dates, that these words were in fact uttered by the defendant to these witnesses concerning the plaintiff at about the times and on the dates set out earlier in his office on the ground floor of 61 Chulia Street.
The only question that arises is whether these words can be said to have been calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office as a lawyer. Section 5 of the Malayan Defamation Ordinance of 1957 which applies in Singapore is the equivalent of s 2 of the Defamation Act 1952 of England and it is significant that, unlike the position previously, it is now unnecessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of people like the plaintiff in the way of his office or profession. In short, it is unnecessary to allege or prove special damage even if the words are not spoken of the plaintiff so as to affect him in his profession. Thus it will now be actionable per se to impute insolvency to a solicitor. Cases like 
 Dauncey v Holloway 
 [1901] 2 KB 447 where words were uttered to the effect that a solicitor had lost a considerable sum of money, would today be decided differently. In that case in 1901 it was held that these words did not impute any want of capacity in him as a solicitor.
In my judgment the words alleged to have been uttered by the defendant about the plaintiff are clearly slanderous within the meaning of s 5 of the 1957 Ordinance. I am even prepared to hold that these words were published of him in connection with his profession as a practising advocate and solicitor and were slanderous of him in his capacity as such and imputed unfitness or incapacity on his part to conduct his profession.
I also find on the evidence as a whole that the defendant was responsible for mounting a nuisance campaign against the plaintiff from the latter part of 1964, right through 1965, which campaign reached its peak around the time when the slanders were published, ie in April 1965. I accept the evidence of the defendant`s former clerk, PW 11, Ong Khoon Kian on these matters and I reject the monstrous suggestion that the plaintiff committed all the acts of nuisance complained of in order to make the case stronger against the defendant in respect of these slanders. I therefore find malice amply proved. This of course will go towards enhancement of damages.
It follows from what I have said so far that I reject the defence of alibi for the period 5 to 10 April 1965, both dates inclusive. The important dates are of course 6, 7 and 9 April and I am satisfied on all the evidence that the defendant was in his office on the ground floor of 61 Chulia Street at the times when the witnesses, to whom I have referred earlier, passed through his office on their way either upstairs to the plaintiff`s office or on their way out. His witnesses were wholly unconvincing and unreliable if not completely discredited.
Some of them contradicted themselves constantly and, when taken to task about the accuracy of their support of the alibi defence, reluctantly agreed that they only remembered that the defendant was present in Pontian at his estate or at some of the other places in the vicinity at the relevant times and dates because they were reminded about this by the defendant after the trial began. One of them said that if he had not been so reminded he would not have remembered that the defendant was present in Pontian. This was DW5. The biggest bundle of contradictions was DW7. As for DW6 (Abdulla b Suradi) he was useless. As for the rest of the witnesses as to the alibi the record speaks for itself.
It is also significant that the alibi seems to have occurred to the defendant only on or after 24 May 1968, some three years later, after he had already been to five previous solicitors to none of whom he appears to have communicated this defence although the writ herein was issued in July 1965 and the defence filed in August of that year. I am quite satisfied that the alibi has been fabricated at the last moment. This trial commenced as I have said on 24 June 1968 and it was only in April, 1969 that the court heard for the first time that the defendant had spent the daylight hours from about 7.00am to about 4.30 or 5.00pm each day from 5 April to 9 April 1965 in Johore or, to be more precise, in Pontian.
The alibi accordingly stinks to high heaven. Furthermore, the defendant`s own diary (Ex D1) for the relevant period contains no entry in it indicating his departure from Singapore on those dates nor did the Causeway check-point police officers have any record that his motor car No SL 2824 passed through to Johore on any of those dates.
One witness for the defence, DW6, Abdulla b Suradi, was clearly proved to be a liar. He said he accompanied the defendant everyday from 6 April onwards till the 9th to Pontian because he had obtained leave from the school where he worked as a care-taker. The principal of this school utterly refuted this by her evidence which was adduced in rebuttal. She said that this witness was not on leave from 6 to 9 April 1965, inclusive and produced the school attendance register for the staff to prove it and also stated quite categorically that if someone were missing though marked as present, she would know and she was quite certain that he was not missing. It is also significant that most of the witnesses for the defence relating to his presence in Pontian described the defendant`s motor car as being blue when in fact it was, according to the records of the Registrar of Vehicles, foggy silver and never blue.
It only now remains for me to assess the quantum of damages which I should award. Having considered all the aggravating circumstances carefully, I have little doubt that the plaintiff has suffered not only injury to his reputation but also to his own feelings. In the absence of the aggravating acts of nuisance which clearly reveal spite of an extraordinary quasi-puerile character on the defendant`s part one would have thought that if the slanderous words had been uttered only on one isolated occasion this would not normally have caused many professional men like the plaintiff to feel so aggrieved as to institute proceedings for slander. Here, however, the slanderous words were repeated persistently to the friends and clients or potential clients of the plaintiff who were total strangers to the defendant without any justification whatsoever. He even took pains to point out to one of these witnesses, PW10 Sng Song Teck, the litter that he had thrown around in order to embarrass the plaintiff and he even incited this witness to create a scene in the plaintiff`s office in front of his other clients - to which of course the witness very properly turned a deaf ear.
On the whole what the plaintiff really needs is. I think, not a large fortune by way of compensation as damages but some reasonable sum which will serve to vindicate his position and assuage his wounded feelings. I think a sum of $7,350 (the equivalent of Â£1,000 sterling) in all should be adequate particularly as the costs payable by the defendant will be quite heavy having regard to the length of the trial. I was almost inclined at one stage to reduce the costs payable, whoever won, but I do not propose to do so. I should like to make it clear that, in future, counsel, however successful they may be, will run the risk of reduced costs if they do not keep within a reasonable range of the estimated number of days for which they asked. Here I think that the plaintiff and his counsel were less to blame for the length of the trial although the evidence relating to aggravation could have been considerably shortened.
The moral to be derived from these proceedings, and which the profession would perhaps be wise to take to heart, appears to be as follows:
Never place yourself, as a professional man on whom your client depends for professional legal advice, in a situation of deep obligation to that client to such an extent that the value and purpose of the legal advice and your proper relationship with him as solicitor and client and the services you render are likely to be jeopardized by your involvement with him in extraneous private dealings and transactions which you can reasonably avoid.
For the benefit of the registrar when taxing costs I would indicate that the getting-up fee should not exceed $2,500 because, as I have already said, the law is reasonably clear despite the researches in which both counsel appear to have indulged. I should not be taken as fixing the getting-up fee at this figure or of binding the registrar. I am merely indicating what the maximum amount, in my view, should be. Counsel are of course at liberty to convince the registrar otherwise.
Judgment will accordingly be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $7,350 with costs.

The appellant Lim Chin Poh was convicted by a district court of an offence under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961 and sentenced to one year`s imprisonment. He now appeals against his conviction and sentence.
Section 26(1) of the Ordinance reads as follows: 
 
Any person who causes the death of another person by the driving of a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, shall be guilty of an offence under this Ordinance and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.
 
 
 
In my view there are three distinct offences under this section because the use of the word `or` is disjunctive:
 
 
(1) causing death by driving a motor vehicle on the road recklessly; 
 
(2) causing death by driving a motor vehicle on the road at a speed which is dangerous to the public, etc; and 
 
(3) causing death by driving a motor vehicle on the road in a manner which is dangerous to the public, etc.
  
 
 
In the present case the appellant was charged as follows: 
 
You, Lim Chin Poh (NRIC No 0981084) are charged that you, on or about 3 June 1967 at about 12 o`clock noon, at the 141/4 ms Woodlands Road, Singapore, caused the death of one Lee San, by driving motor bus SH 550 at a speed and in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or which might reasonably be expected to be on the said road, to wit, by driving the said motor bus in the direction of Johore at a speed and in a manner that you were not able to exercise proper control of it so that whilst attempting to overtake a stationary lorry No C 5844 which was parked on the left edge of the said road, you collided into the rear offside of the said lorry causing it to lurch forward into the deceased who was then refuelling the said lorry and under such circumstances caused his death, and thereby you have committed an offence punishable under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961 (No 26 of 1961).
 
 
 
It would appear from the charge that the appellant was charged with elements (2) and (3) abovementioned, the prosecution case being that he was driving at a speed which was dangerous 
 and 
 in a manner which was dangerous. Although there is no objection in law to a person being charged under s 26(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance with driving at a speed and in a manner dangerous to the public, the prosecution must appreciate that by framing a charge in that manner they are taking upon themselves the onus of proving two separate and distinct elements, a speed dangerous to the public and a manner of driving dangerous to the public. In this case the prosecution had to prove both elements of the charge and if they failed to establish either the dangerous speed or the danger to the public, the appellant would be entitled to be acquitted.
The undisputed facts are these. On the day in question the appellant was driving a bus belonging to the Green Bus Co along Woodlands Road and proceeding in the direction of Johore Bahru. When he arrived at the 141/4 ms he saw a stationary timber lorry parked on the left hand side of the road. In passing this lorry, the front nearside of the bus hit the rear offside of the stationary lorry. Unknown to the appellant the driver of the stationary lorry was standing on the road side and pouring petrol from a can into the lorry`s petrol tank which was on the nearside of the lorry behind the driver`s cabin. The impact of the bus hitting the lorry caused the driver of the lorry to fall on the road where he was run over by a wheel of the lorry. He died on the spot.
The only eye-witness who gave evidence for the prosecution was the lorry attendant named Ong Ah Tat. His evidence was as follows. His lorry ran out of petrol before they could reach a petrol station and the driver pulled up at the edge of the road just by the grass verge. There was a spare can of petrol in the lorry and the driver proceeded to pour the petrol into the lorry`s petrol tank on the nearside of the lorry. While the driver was doing this he (the attendant) guided the traffic by waving to them to pass along. Traffic was light and the road surface was dry. Visibility was very good. He saw a bus coming from the direction of the city. He first saw it when it was 400 to 500 feet away. It was travelling very fast. He waved to the bus to pass on. At that stage there was no other vehicle on the road. For no rhyme or reason the bus came and collided with the rear part of his lorry. The impact pushed his lorry five or six feet forward and after the impact he saw that the driver of the lorry was lying on the road. He went up to him and saw that he was bleeding from his head. He ran to the Caltex petrol station for help. In cross-examination he stated that in his estimation the speed of the bus was 40 to 50 miles an hour. He did not hear any screeching of brakes. He did not notice the bus slowing down.
On the above evidence the learned district judge who tried him, held that a case had been made out which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the appellant on the charge he faced and accordingly he called upon the appellant to enter upon his defence. It is unnecessary to consider whether on the evidence before him the learned district judge was justified in calling upon the appellant to enter upon his defence.
As stated earlier, the two elements in the charge were driving at a dangerous speed and driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The only evidence of speed was the word of the lorry attendant who was clearly an interested party. Quite apart from being the attendant of the lorry, he admitted that he was also a nephew of the deceased lorry driver. There was no evidence whether or not he could drive a motor vehicle and whether he was capable of estimating speed in terms of miles per hour. Even if his estimate of the speed was correct, namely, 40 to 50 miles per hour, I do not consider such speed was dangerous at the time and place of the accident. The accident occurred at the 141/4 ms Woodlands Road. There is one-way traffic there. There was no other traffic on the road. The accident occurred at 12 noon in broad day light. I see nothing wrong in a bus travelling at 40 mph in broad day light, on an empty road at the 141/4 ms Woodlands Road. In my opinion the prosecution failed to prove that the bus was being driven `at a speed dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road`.
I now come to the second element in the charge, the manner of driving, which was alleged to be dangerous. It was alleged in the charge that the appellant was driving his bus `in a manner that you were not able to exercise proper control of it so that while attempting to overtake a stationary lorry which was parked on the left edge of the said road, you collided into the rear offside of the said lorry causing it to lurch forward into the deceased who was then refuelling the said lorry.` There was no evidence at all to support the assertion that the appellant was not able to exercise proper control of his bus. The lorry attendant never mentioned anything about the appellant losing control of the bus or of not being able to exercise proper control of his bus. His evidence was that he did not know why the bus struck his lorry. It does not follow that because the bus hit the lorry, therefore the bus driver must have lost control of his bus or was not able to exercise proper control of his bus. The cause of the accident may have been something else. It may well be that the appellant did not keep a proper look out and did not see the lorry until it was too late or that there was an error of judgment on his part in that he overtook the bus too close to it and did not allow sufficient clearance. Whatever the cause of the accident, there was in my opinion no evidence to support the prosecution`s assertion that the appellant drove in a manner dangerous to the public. In my opinion the expression `driving in a manner which is dangerous to the public` indicates some dangerous act or manoeuvre on the part of the driver of a vehicle, eg overtaking a vehicle on the wrong side of it, or overtaking in the face of oncoming traffic, or overtaking when unable to see oncoming traffic, or crossing a junction against traffic light, and so on. There must be some positive act on the part of the driver which is dangerous having regard to all the circumstances.

[1963] 1 QB 412
; [1962] 3 WLR 1451; [1962] 3 All ER 1086 and relied on the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, at p 65: 
 
And it is quite clear from the reported cases that, if a man in fact adopts a manner of driving which the jury think was dangerous to other road users in all the circumstances, then on the issue of guilt it matters not whether he was deliberately reckless, careless, momentarily inattentive or even doing his incompetent best.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that even if the appellant was merely careless, then, on the authority of the decision in 
 Evans 
` case, the appellant was rightly convicted.
In 
 Evans 
 ` case, the appellant Evans, a medical practitioner and a very experienced driver with a very long and good record behind him, was driving his Jaguar motor-car along a straight open road. The road was only just over 20 feet wide, so that there clearly would not be room for three vehicles abreast. Ahead of him was a motor-car travelling at about 40 miles an hour. He decided to overtake. In the act of overtaking, he increased his speed to some 60 miles an hour and was driving on his wrong side of the road when he crashed head-on into a motor-car coming from the opposite direction and of whose approach he appeared to have been totally unaware. The driver of the other car was killed. The reason why Dr Evans did not see that approaching vehicle appeared to be that there was a dip in the road ahead of him and at the vital moment when he was deciding to overtake, and commencing to overtake, the approaching vehicle was hidden in this dip, but he knew that the dip was there and he was apparently taking a chance. The question, therefore, in that case, was, viewed objectively, did the course on which and the speed at which Dr Evans drove his car in the particular circumstances prevailing at the time involve danger to another road user? The answer to that question was obviously yes and Dr Evans was therefore rightly convicted and his appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The passage cited by counsel for the appellant must be understood in the light of the facts of that case. The operative words in that passage are `adopts a manner of driving which the jury think was dangerous` and as stated earlier there must be proved some act or manoeuvre on the part of the accused which could be considered dangerous. Careless driving may well be dangerous though all careless driving are not necessarily dangerous. This court is not going to attempt to lay down what is or is not dangerous driving. The question in these cases always is: `Did the co nduct of the accused amount to dangerous driving?` And to answer this question the court must consider whether or not the act or manoeuvre of the accused, viewed objectively, involved danger to other road users in the prevailing circumstances? In the present case, the overtaking of the stationary lorry by the appellant, an experienced bus driver, at 40 mph on an empty road, cannot be said to involve danger to other road users. In my opinion there is no evidence in this case to support a charge of `causing death by driving in a manner which was dangerous to the public`. The question is, what offence did the appellant commit? In my opinion, the evidence for the prosecution made out a prima facie case of negligent driving and at the close of the prosecution case the learned district judge should have amended the charge of one of causing death by a negligent act, an offence punishable under s 304A of the Penal Code and should have called the defence of the appellant on this amended charge.
The appellant`s version of the accident was that just as he was about to overtake the stationary lorry, another lorry came from behind him at very great speed sounding its horn furiously in an endeavour to overtake his bus. Consequently he swerved to his nearside to allow this lorry to pass. When this other lorry passed him he swerved back to his offside in order to pass the stationary lorry but failed to clear it. The front nearside of his bus hit the stationary lorry. The learned district judge rejected the appellant`s version of the accident because he found that the appellant was not speaking the truth. On the evidence before him he was in my opinion entitled to do so.
Having reviewed the whole evidence in this case, I am of the opinion that the appellant should have been convicted under s 304A of the Penal Code. I would therefore allow the appeal to the extent that the conviction is altered to one under s 304A of the Penal Code. As regards sentence I am of the view that a fine of $1,000 or six months` imprisonment would meet the ends of justice in this case. Accordingly the sentence of one year`s imprisonment and the disqualification is set aside and a fine of $1,000 or six months` imprisonment in lieu thereof is substituted.
There is one other matter. Counsel for the appellant criticised the manner in which the learned district judge conducted the trial of the appellant. His complaint was that, by reason of the frequency and nature of the interruptions by the learned trial judge when the appellant was giving evidence, the appellant did not have a fair trial. It was alleged that the trial judge intervened on no less than fifteen occasions; that he cross-examined the appellant; that he made it known that he was displeased with the appellant; and that he was so thoroughly annoyed with the appellant that he gave vent to his feelings by imposing a severe sentence.
I have examined the trial judge`s notes of evidence and they show that he did intervene on several occasions. On p 24 appears the following: 
 
Witness takes a long pause. He leans over rails. He does not show respect to court. He does not even stand properly. When court warns him he takes it as if it was very funny, court orders him to behave. He asks interpreter to repeat question. He repeatedly smiles and bandies words with interpreter. Court can understand what he says in Hokkien. Court warns him to behave himself. Court directs interpreter to repeat question.
 
 
 
And at p 28: 
 
Witness deliberately evades answering question. Court warns him.
 
 
 
Court orders him to answer question.
It is possible that some of the judge`s observations when he intervened may have indicated to the appellant that the judge was not favourably disposed towards him, but I can find no trace whatever of any tendency on the part of the judge to take the side of the prosecution. It is quite plain that he was asking the accused to be mindful of decorum and in pressing the accused to answer questions he was endeavouring to ascertain the truth. Nevertheless it is desirable that district judges and magistrates should bear in mind that the first and most important thing for the administration of the criminal law is that it should appear that the accused is having a fair trial and that he should not be left with any sense of injustice and certainly not on the ground that the trial judge was prejudiced against him. Where the prosecution and the defence are both represented by counsel, as they were in this case, the trial judge should refrain from intervening unless it is absolutely necessary.
Upon a full consideration of the case I have come to the conclusion that this is not a case where it can be said that the trial was completely irregular. I am unable to accept the argument that what took place would justify this court in ordering a retrial. As regards the sentence being severe, that should be the subject of an appeal as indeed it was in this case and has been dealt with.

Whether any contributory negligence on plaintiffÂ’s part
 
This is an appeal by the Attorney-General, Singapore against the decision of Kulasekaram J who held that the plaintiff/ respondent had proved negligence on the part of the prison authorities at the Medium Security Prison, Changi on 15 September 1965 and awarded him damages for the injuries sustained by him as a consequence of such negligence. The appeal is directed both against the question of liability as well as the quantum of damages awarded in the sum of $14,000 for general damages and $600 for special damages.
The plaintiff was a prisoner nearing the end of his term of imprisonment at the material time and had been instructed by the instructor of metal works at that prison to place some asbestos sheets on the metallic rafters of the framework of a garage which said sheets were intended to serve as the roof of that garage.
In order to appreciate what follows, without constant reference to a model which was produced, we propose to give a brief description of this garage. This metallic framework of the garage, which had been erected previously so as to adjoin the main Prison Industries Office was immediately to the right of that office as one looks at it from the front. The proposed roof had a slight downward slope from the front to the rear and the side nearest to the office ran parallel to the side of that office and, for convenience, we shall call it the third side of the garage. Needless to say, there were no walls on any of the four sides of the proposed garage and the proposed roof was supported by metallic poles. The last side, which we shall call the fourth side, was that side which ran parallel to the third side at the extreme right hand end of the structure as one looks at it from the front.
It is unfortunate perhaps that, although a model was produced without any clear explanation of the exact scale adopted in preparing it, there is little evidence as to precise heights, lengths or widths, and we are accordingly unable in this judgment to give precise measurements. It is common ground, however, that the metallic framework of the roof ranged from about eight to nine feet in height.
It is also perhaps unfortunate that in the presentation of the case by both parties no attempt was made to produce, as exhibits, a sample of the asbestos sheets the plaintiff was instructed to place on the framework of the roof and either of the two planks said to have been placed on the metallic framework of the roof to assist the plaintiff in his work on the roof. Neither party adduced evidence of the exact measurements of the asbestos sheets said to have been used or of the planks. All we know from the evidence is that the sheets were heavy and were seven feet long. It would appear that some pieces of paper were produced before the trial judge to represent the asbestos sheets to enable him to follow the evidence but we do not have the benefit of these pieces of paper nor do we know exactly where they were placed on the model by the witnesses during the trial and we have to rely heavily on what the trial judge has himself said in his grounds of decision as to where and how exactly they were placed. There is, however, just sufficient material, despite these inadequacies in the presentation of the case, for us to reach our own conclusions as to where responsibility should lie for the fall that morning of the plaintiff from the roof on to the ground outside as a result of which his injuries were sustained.
What we have to decide in this appeal is whether the trial judge was right in finding that the prison authorities were negligent in failing to provide a sufficiently reasonable and safe system of work for the work which they required the plaintiff to do on the metallic framework of the roof and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and finally whether the quantum of damages awarded was excessive.
We now turn to the facts bearing in mind that, on the question of liability, there were two conflicting versions of the accident.
The plaintiff`s version was to the effect that he was ordered by one Leong Fook Seng, the instructor of metal works at the prison, to climb up a ladder to the top of the framework and squat on one of two planks which had been placed on the framework by him and a fellow prisoner on their own volition the previous day. This plank, according to him, was near the fourth side and parallel to it. He squatted on this plank at about the middle of that side and was facing the fourth side with his back to the office. A sheet of asbestos was then handed up by Leong and another prisoner from the ground below which he and PW 3, another fellow prisoner who was also squatting on the plank beside him, placed on the top of the framework in front of them near the edge of the fourth side. The length of the sheet was parallel to the plank on which they were squatting. They were then requested by Leong to push the sheet forward which they did. PW 3 then moved away to bring the other plank. Leong then directed the plaintiff to push the sheet further forward which he proceeded to do. Whilst he was pushing the sheet further forward, the sheet broke into two halves and that half which was projecting beyond the fourth side over the grass below fell down leaving the other half still on the framework. When this happened he lost his balance and fell over outside the fourth side on to the broken half of the asbestos sheet which was already on the ground outside. He further said that this sheet was the first sheet placed on the roof and that this was his first experience of working on a framework such as this one and that he had never volunteered to do this job but had been ordered to do so by Leong who had never previously ascertained whether he had any experience of this type of work.
As against this version we have the version of the principal witness for the defence, that is, the instructor, Leong. That morning he had instructed the plaintiff to climb to the top of the framework and place two asbestos sheets, one on each of the two rear corners of the roof. The first sheet was placed on the corner between the third side and the rear. The longer edge of the sheet was along the third side while one of the shorter edges of the sheet was along the rear side edge of the roof. The second sheet was similarly placed on the other corner between the rear and the fourth side. Just before the accident occurred, the plaintiff was squatting on a plank which was placed lengthwise alongside the last rafter which ran parallel to the rear of the roof. According to Leong the plaintiff was squatting on this plank and was adjusting the second sheet into position so as to cause it to be in proper alignment with the first sheet. After this had been done Leong instructed the plaintiff to come down via the ladder which was then leaning against the framework on the rear side while Leong himself was standing on the ground below near it. The plaintiff then stood up on the plank and looked away from the building and while he was doing this, he happened to step with his right foot on to the asbestos sheet which broke and caused the plaintiff to fall down on the grass to the rear of the garage. But he did not know the manner in which the plaintiff fell.
It will be seen from these two versions that, whereas the plaintiff said that he fell off over the fourth side as a result of pushing the sheet which broke and caused him to lose his balance whilst he was still squatting on a plank running parallel to the fourth side, the defence version was that the plaintiff was squatting on a plank running parallel to the rear which had been placed alongside that rafter nearest the rear and that when he was ordered to come down, he stood up on that plank and looked away from the building and that he happened to place his right foot on the asbestos sheet which broke and caused him to fall down on to the grass at the rear.
The trial judge quite rightly rejected the plaintiff`s version as to where he fell and what he had been previously doing just before he fell, as it was indeed a most incredible story, and preferred the defence version of the accident up to a point, namely, that the plaintiff fell off towards the rear and near its corner with the fourth side and that he had previously been sitting or squatting on a plank parallel to the rear. The trial judge did not, however, accept Leong`s evidence thereafter when he said that he saw the plaintiff stand up on the plank and look away from the building and that while he was looking away, he happened to step with his right foot on the sheet which broke and caused him to fall down. This is what the trial judge said: 
 
Then Leong goes on to say that the plaintiff then stood up on the plank and looked away from the building and while he was looking away he happened to step with his right foot on the asbestos sheet which broke and he fell down. He went on to say that he did not know the manner the plaintiff fell down. One wonders why Leong who was an eye witness is unable to say the manner the plaintiff fell down. Could it be that Leong is not quite clear about the details of the last few critical moments before the plaintiff`s fall? On Leong`s evidence it would appear very probable that plaintiff as he was raising himself up, or as he raised himself up on the plank, with a view to coming down, lost his balance. This apparent stepping on the asbestos sheet was very probably an involuntary act on the part of the plaintiff when he tried to regain his balance having first of all lost it. To my mind this stepping on the asbestos sheet by the plaintiff was not a deliberate or careless act on the part of the plaintiff. There is no reason why plaintiff would want to step on this asbestos sheet.
 
 
 
I find that the plaintiff while raising himself up from the squatting position on the plank lost his balance and thereby stepped on the edge of the asbestos sheet and came to grief. The main cause of the accident was plaintiff`s losing his balance.
 
 
 
It should be noted that Leong`s evidence is to the effect merely that as the plaintiff stood up and looked away from the building, he happened to step on the asbestos sheet which broke. It does not seem to us that Leong was attempting to give the impression that the plaintiff deliberately stepped on that sheet. His evidence on this point is equally consistent with the plaintiff`s losing his balance. It is difficult to understand the trial judge`s conclusion that Leong`s evidence on this point amounted to an allegation of a deliberate act or of sheer careless conduct on the plaintiff`s part. It should be remembered that in Leong`s version which was accepted up to that stage, the plaintiff, after having climbed up the ladder, had managed to get on to the roof somehow and to place the first sheet against the third side towards the rear and then move himself into position to the other rear corner with the fourth side. During all these manoeuvres there was no suggestion by anyone that he ever stood up on the plank or conducted himself otherwise than in a careful manner. Presumably, he was comporting himself with sufficient care for his own safety by easing himself along in a squatting or sitting position on that plank from the third side to the fourth side. One would have thought that when he was asked to come down, he could have done so without mishap in the same manner as he tackled the work he had previously done on the roof. What caused him to lose his balance was his standing up or raising himself up to such an extent as to cause him to lose his balance.
We agree, however, with the trial judge that working on a framework of a roof such as this one is different from working on tops of buses which the plaintiff had done before. As the trial judge has said `it entails more risks and requires more experience at balancing oneself`. He rejected Leong`s evidence that he had ascertained from the plaintiff about his experience and that the plaintiff told him that he could work on the top without any support. He also rejected Leong`s statement that he had warned the plaintiff before he went on to the roof not to step on the asbestos sheet. He accordingly found that the system of work was reasonable and safe provided a worker employed on the roof had had the necessary experience. In short, he found that the system of work employed in the present case of using a ladder to go up to a roof and then to use planks already pieced on the framework to serve as a sort of a platform to work from to be unsafe in all the circumstances in the case of an inexperienced workman such as the plaintiff.
On the facts found by the trial judge, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the prison authorities, in sending up an inexperienced person such as the plaintiff on to the metallic framework of the roof, failed to take adequate precautions against the kind of over-balancing that did occur. Such precautions were those which a reasonable and prudent man would have thought so obvious that it was folly to omit them or that it was unreasonable or imprudent to omit them - see the test laid down by Lord Normand in 
 Paris v Stepney Borough Council 
 [1951] 1 All ER 49 or this test as explained in the later case of 
 Morris v West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
[1956] 1 All ER 385 which this court approved in 
 Eng Lye Hup Co Ltd v Chua Sai Choo & Anor 
 
 
 [1965-1968] SLR 369 
.
In our opinion it was insufficient merely to provide a ladder and a plank or two for a workman inexperienced in these matters and to require him to lift up a heavy asbestos sheet whilst sitting or squatting on a plank over the gaping void of the metallic framework of a roof and then to require him to place or align that sheet over the rafters in the desired position especially when the instructor himself had had no experience whatever of working on top of rafters and framework such as this.
The next question we have to decide is whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. As we have already said earlier the plaintiff had already executed certain works on the roof prior to his fall, such as placing two asbestos sheets along the third and fourth sides respectively towards the rear corner of the roof. He seems to have exercised sufficient care for his own safety in moving along the plank from one side to the other without mishap. What caused him to lose his balance was his act of raising himself up on the plank in order to reach the ladder. The trial judge found no contributory negligence on his part because: 
 
It cannot be said that this accident was in any way caused by the plaintiff not taking reasonable care over his own safety. His losing his balance on the day in question cannot in any was be attributed to his not taking reasonable care over himself. I take the view that it was solely due to his inexperience at working at heights from frameworks such as this one.
 
 
 
With respect we do not entirely agree. We appreciate the risks to which the plaintiff was exposed but he appears, despite his inexperience, to have successfully carried out his earlier duties. Our decision might have been otherwise if he had fallen off the metallic framework of the roof at a much earlier stage, for example if, soon after climbing up the ladder to the top and then in negotiating the rafters with a view to getting on to the plank, he had fallen down. We accept the trial judge`s finding that he did not deliberately step on the asbestos sheet with his right foot. This is exactly what Leong himself said about the plaintiff`s standing up and happening to step on the asbestos sheet save that the trial judge does not quite accept the position that the plaintiff was actually standing up before he fell. He held that the accident occurred as he was raising himself up or as he raised himself up on the plank with a view to coming down. This plank ran parallel to the rear edge of the roof and had been placed lengthwise alongside the rafter nearest the rear. The ladder was leaning up against the rear edge of the roof with the sheet to his right as he faced the rear of the building. One would have thought that if he had exercised the same care as he did on climbing on to the roof and on to the plank, he should have been able to negotiate the return journey safely. We think, however, once the job was done, in raising himself up from his squatting position, he failed to take reasonable care for his own safety and thereby contributed to his own injury. We would accordingly assess his share in the responsibility for the accident at one-half and the damages recoverable will therefore be reduced accordingly.
We now turn to the question of the quantum of damages awarded. The plaintiff suffered injuries to his face and hands. Examination revealed abrasions involving the forehead, nose and both upper limbs and he suffered pain on the passive movements of the shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers. Five days after the accident his fingers had become stiff, painful and swollen and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were noticed affecting both hands. On examination a year later, this diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was confirmed by Dr Horne. In 1967 it seemed probable that this disease had extended to his left leg. He was a blacksmith and the evidence is that it was not likely that he would ever be able to go back to that occupation. The trial judge accepted the evidence of Dr Horne that there was a relationship between the accident and the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, despite the contrary view expressed on behalf of the defence by Dr Gwee which suggested that the onset of this disease was probably rather the emotional upset of the plaintiff arising from his being a prisoner. As against this, the plaintiff had been a prisoner since 1961 and the disease only set in about September 1965 soon after the accident. In our opinion there was ample material to justify the trial judge`s finding on this issue. The trial judge, however, found no positive evidence that the disease had spread to the lower limbs and accordingly proceeded to assess damages on that basis. Although the plaintiff said he had worked as a blacksmith, he had prior to his imprisonment been working as a bar waiter. He was about 39 years of age when damages were assessed. It was then clear that he would be unable to do heavy manual work but the trial judge found that he could, bearing in mind that he was an ex-prisoner, probably be able to obtain some form of employment of a lighter nature for a period of ten working years and not more. We cannot disagree with this assessment of his working potential or with the finding that his earning capacity would have been reduced by about $100 per month from his previous earnings of $200 per month as a waiter. We would therefore confirm the award of $14,000 as general damages being as to $9,000 in respect of loss of earnings and $5,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life. We would also confirm the award of $600 as special damages for loss of earnings before the trial.
The appeal partly succeeds, as indicated earlier, and we would award the appellant three-quarters of his taxed costs of this appeal.

The appellant was employed by the second respondent as a lorry attendant. His duties were to load sand from a sand-pit on to a lorry and to accompany the loaded lorry to its destination. He had been so employed by the second respondent for a period of two years prior to the day of the accident.
On the day of the accident he was the attendant of a lorry No SG3284 belonging to the second respondent which was being driven by the first respondent who was also an employee of the second respondent. This lorry on that day was being used to load sand from a sand-pit which was situate at the end of an earth road off Peng Ann Road. This earth road which was 15` 10` wide sloped down from Peng Ann Road to the sand-pit and was full of pot holes of varying widths and depths.
The appellant was the regular attendant of that lorry but on that day accompanying him was another lorry attendant employed by the second respondent. This other lorry attendant also accompanied the lorry because his regular lorry was not being used that day and he was asked to assist the appellant.
On the day of the accident, after sand had been loaded on to the lorry, it left the sand-pit and made its way up the pot-holed earth road towards Peng Ann Road and as it was so travelling the appellant fell off the back of the lorry, where he was with the other lorry attendant, and sustained injuries.
The appellant sued both the driver of the lorry and his employer. In his statement of claim he alleged that the accident was caused by the negligence and/or breach of statutory duty of the first-named defendant and by the negligence and/or breach of statutory duty of the second-named defendant his servants or agents or alternatively by the negligence and or breach of statutory duty of one or other of them in the driving control management use and or loading of the said vehicle.
At the trial his evidence was that his job was to load sand on to the lorry at the sand-pit and after it had moved off he was levelling the sand, as usual, at the back of the lorry. When the lorry had travelled very fast up the slope for a distance of about 200 feet the lorry went into a pot-hole and he fell off while he was still standing and working at levelling the sand. The other lorry attendant was with him at the back of the lorry. He admitted there was a railing immediately above the driver`s cabin which was provided for the attendant to hold on to but denied that the usual practice was for the sand to be levelled off before a loaded lorry moved off from a sand-pit. He agreed that if he was holding on to the railing or was sitting on the sand he would not have fallen off that day and that while going up the slope he felt several bumps. He said that after he fell off, the lorry reversed and one of the front wheels ran over his leg. The injuries he suffered was a compound comminuted fracture of the midshaft of the left femur.
Both respondents gave evidence that the usual practice was that after sand had been loaded on to a lorry, the sand on the lorry would be levelled before the lorry moved off from the sand-pit. The reason for this practice was that the owner of the sand-pit sells his sand and is paid by the lorry load and he requires the sand on the lorry to be levelled off. The trial judge accepted the respondents` evidence that it was the appellant`s duty to level the sand while the lorry was at the sand-pit and before it moved off and not while the lorry was in motion. The trial judge also found that while it was the appellant`s duty to travel at the back of the lorry he would not have fallen off had he held on to the railings or had sat down on the sand. The trial judge found that the appellant had failed to prove that his injuries were caused by the negligence of the first respondent or by any breach of any statutory duty on the part of the second respondent. He found that the appellant fell off the lorry because he had failed to look after his own safety and that the accident was due to his sole negligence.
The appellant contends before us that the respondents being under a common law duty to take reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe system of work had failed in the circumstances prevailing at the time to do so. It is plain that this appeal cannot succeed against the first respondent, who is a fellow employee and not the employer of the appellant.
The common law duty of a master to his servant, arising out of the relationship of master and servant is stated at para 976 of 25 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (3rd Ed) as follows: 
 
A master is under a duty, arising out of the relationship of master and servant, to take reasonable care for the safety of his work-people in all the circumstances of the case so as not to expose them to an unnecessary risk. The master does not warrant the safety of the working conditions, nor is he an insurer of his servants` safety; the exercise of due care and skill suffices. The duty to exercise reasonable care is, however, one which is personal to the master, and if he entrusts its performance to a servant, agent or, it seems, an independent contractor, he is vicariously liable for any negligence on the part of the person so appointed in performing the duty. In order to succeed in an action for damages against his master, a workman must show that his injuries were caused by the master`s breach of duty, the onus being upon him to establish both the breach of duty and the fact that the breach was the cause of his injuries.
 
 
 
One aspect of that duty is to take reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe system of carrying on the relevant operation but the mere happening of an accident does not show that anyone (either the master or any one for whom he is vicariously responsible) has been negligent or that there is any defect in the system of working. A servant who sues his master must allege and prove specifically what is the defect in the system of which he complains. It is not sufficient that the system adopted was in fact unsafe, he must show something which could reasonably have been done or omitted which would have made the system reasonably safe and that this failure was the cause of the accident (see Lord Goddard CJ in the Court of Appeal and Viscount Simon LC in the House of Lords in 
 Colfar v 
 
 Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd 
 [1945] 1 All ER 326).
In the present case, the appellant has not only failed to allege specifically what is the defect in the system of which he complains but he has also failed to prove any defect in the system provided by the second respondent for him to carry out his work as the lorry attendant of a lorry engaged in obtaining a load of sand from a sand-pit and transporting the loaded lorry to another place. Furthermore, on the facts there was not only no defect in the system provided but also, on the appellant`s own admission, the accident would not have occurred had he adhered to the system provided. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

The plaintiffs in this case are the administrators of the estate of Lim Siew Liang, deceased, and they bring this action for damages for the benefit of the estate for the deceased`s loss of expectation of life.
The plaintiffs` case is that on 29 March 1967, the deceased was at the rubbish dump at Kolam Ayer Lane looking over rubbish when she was run into and killed by a motor lorry driven by the first defendant, the servant or agent of the second defendant, and which was reversing into the said rubbish dump. The plaintiffs allege that the first defendant did not look to the rear to ensure that it was safe to reverse at the time.
By agreement the report which the first defendant made to the police after the accident was put in at the outset of the hearing by counsel for the plaintiffs. The report reads as follows: 
 
At a/m time and date I drove the above lorry to dump the refuse. On arrival at the said place I then reversed the lorry to have it in position before dumping the rubbish, when suddenly I heard shouts that someone was being run down by my lorry. I got down and found that somebody - a F/Chinese lady was lying behind my lorry. I did not know her condition but ran off for fear of being assaulted.
 
 
 
Counsel then informed the court that the plaintiffs had no eye witness to the accident and was not calling any witness and that he relied on the report of the first defendant to establish a prima facie case of negligence against the first defendant. In my view such a case has been made out.
The case of the defendants is that:
 
 
(1) the deceased was a trespasser on the dumping ground and she entered it at her own risk and they owed no duty to take reasonable care for her protection. 
 
(2) the accident was not caused by the negligence of the first defendant. 
 
(3) the accident was caused solely or alternatively contributed to, by the negligence of the deceased.
  
 
 
The dumping ground at Kolam Ayer was under the control of the Ministry of Health.
The evidence of how the accident happened was given by the first defendant. His evidence is shortly this. He has been driving a lorry of the Public Health Division of the Ministry of Health for one and a half years prior to the accident. He has been many times to the dumping ground at Kolam Ayer. On the day of the accident he went there in the lorry to dump refuse. He turned into the dumping ground from the drive in and stopped. He looked in the nearside rear-vision mirror to see whether there was any person or vehicle behind. He did not see anything. He then opened the offside door of his lorry and turned round and looked towards the rear. He did not see anything behind the lorry. He then engaged the reverse gear and slowly reversed the lorry towards the face tip and while reversing he was looking at the near side and offside rear-vision mirrors. He had reversed about fifteen feet when he heard someone shouted `Oh! Oh!` He thought that there was a vehicle behind. He changed gear and drove forward. A person ran near his lorry and told him that he had knocked down a person. He got down from the lorry and went to the rear and he saw an old woman lying on the ground behind the lorry.
The first question for decision is whether the deceased was a trespasser. The evidence of the superintendent public cleansing and of the divisional public health assistant clearly show that no unauthorised persons were allowed in the dumping ground but nevertheless many people, as many as a hundred each time, trespassed to collect scrap metal, tins, rags etc. from the refuse discharged there by the refuse lorries.
Clearly the deceased was a trespasser and in fact the plaintiffs do not dispute it.
The next question for consideration is whether the first defendant did look to the rear before reversing. Having regard to the report that he made to the police in which he did not say that he looked to the rear and saw no one before reversing and his statement in his evidence that when he heard someone shouted `Oh! Oh.` he thought there was a lorry behind I think that in fact he did not look to the rear before reversing. If that is not negligence I do not know what is.
What is the defendants` liability in the light that the deceased was a trespasser?
The law is clearly summarised at p 53, para 49, of 28 
 Halsbury 
, thus: 
 
Duty to trespassers. The occupier of premises has no duty to take reasonable care for the protection of a trespasser, or even to protect him from concealed danger. The trespasser comes on to the premises at his own risk. The protection afforded by this rule is not limited to the occupiers of land but extends to those who control structures or objects such as a ship, part of a ship in a dry dock or a vehicle. The occupier is in such a case liable only where the injury is due to some wilful or reckless act involving something more than the absence of reasonable care. When a trespasser is known to be present, the occupier must abstain from doing an act which if done carelessly must reasonably be contemplated as likely to injure him and abstain from doing acts which are intended to injure him.
 
 
 
In the case of 
 Commissioner for Railways 
 v 
 Quinlan 
 
[1964] 2 WLR 817
, Viscount Radcliffe (delivering the judgment of the Privy Council) said at p 838: 
 
Their lordships have studied with care and respect the judgments of the members of the Court of Appeal in England in 
 Videan
 v 
 British Transport Commission
, two of which adopt much the same line of reasoning as that upon which their Lordships have commented in the recent High Court cases in Australia: but they remain quite unpersuaded that the measure of an occupier`s duty to a trespasser can be determined in all cases by what is called the foreseeability test or that it is correct to describe the nature of the duty by saying that if the circumstances are such that the occupier `ought to foresee` even the presence of a trespasser, the duty of care extends to the trespasser also. . . . the situation would be less liable to be misunderstood if it were explained that the only trespasser to whom the occupier is accountable for his actions, even if dangerous, is one of whose presence he actually knows or one whose presence at that time of injury can fairly be described as extremely likely or very probable.
 
 
 
Now what are the facts in this case? The evidence of the first defendant and of the superintendent public cleansing and of the divisional public health assistant clearly show that the defendants knew the presence of the trespassers and in fact on the day of the accident the first defendant saw many trespassers picking tins there. On the authority of 
 Quinlan`s 
 case the defendants owed a duty of care to the deceased and the act of the first defendant in reversing without looking to make sure that the deceased was not behind the lorry was negligence on his part.
The remaining question is whether the accident was contributed to by the negligence of the deceased. The deceased surely was aware that the Public Health lorries go in and out of the dumping ground and that these lorries reverse to get to the face tip to tip the refuse. Yet she failed to keep a proper look out and failed to observe that the lorry was reversing and failed to move to a safe spot to avoid the accident. I assess the degree of contributory negligence on her part at 50%.
General damages and special damages have been agreed at $3,500 and $1,100 respectively.
There will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $2,300 and costs.

This is an action according to the endorsement on the writ for damages for trespass to the plaintiff`s house and seizure of his property therein.
The facts which give rise to these proceedings are as follows.
On 29 August 1962, the defendant issued a writ against the plaintiff (Suit No 1099 of 1962) for the recovery of principal and interest due on a promissory note. On 13 September 1962 the plaintiff entered an appearance to the writ in person and gave his address as No 130A Cecil Street, Singapore.
On 19 September 1962 the defendant took out a summons under order XIV of the Rules of the Supreme Court for leave to sign final judgment against the plaintiff which was set down for hearing on 28 September.
On 22 September 1962 and six days before the hearing of the summons the plaintiff filed and delivered his defence and counterclaim in which he asserted, inter alia, that the amount due on the promissory note had been settled in full before the commencement of the action brought against him by the defendant.
It was never in dispute that the plaintiff never in fact had actual notice of the hearing of the summons and never received either a copy of the summons or of the affidavit in support thereof.
From an affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant it appeared that a copy of the summons and of the affidavit in support were sent by registered post on 21 September 1962 in a duly registered envelope addressed to the plaintiff at No 130A Cecil Street, Singapore. It was also ascertained from the Postal Services Department that three unsuccessful attempts were made to deliver this registered article on 22, 24 and 25 September 1962 as the plaintiff, the addressee, was not in when the delivery postman called. The plaintiff`s wife refused to accept the registered article and a request card was then sent to the addressee after the last call on 25 September 1962 to call at the General Post Office to collect it but as on 5 October 1962 it remained still unclaimed it was returned to the defendant`s solicitors.
On 28 September 1962 the summons came on for hearing before the deputy registrar in the absence of the plaintiff.
The order of the deputy registrar was as follows: 
 
Upon the application of the above named plaintiff (ie the defendant in the present case) made this day by summons-in-chambers No 1063/62 and upon reading the affidavit of plaintiff filed herein on 19 September 1962 and upon hearing the solicitor for the plaintiff and the above named defendant, [ie the plaintiff in the present case] not having appeared though duly served with the said summons and affidavit IT IS ORDERED that the plaintiff be at liberty to enter final judgment against the defendant for $1,755.62 being the amount claimed and endorsed on the writ of summons in this action together with interest on $1,000 at 20% per annum from 28 August 1962 to the date hereof and $157.50 costs.
 
 
 
Dated this 28 September 1962.
Pursuant to this order it was on 29 September 1962 adjudged that the defendant recover against the plaintiff the amount claimed with costs.
On 3 October 1962 a writ of seizure and sale was issued directing the sheriff to levy against the plaintiff and on 5 October the sheriff went into possession of the plaintiff`s goods and chattels and seized them.
It was apparently then and then only for the first time that the plaintiff became aware of what had transpired. He at once consulted a solicitor with the result that Mr LAJ Smith appeared for him and notified his appointment as such on 9 October 1962.
On the same date Mr Smith on behalf of the plaintiff took out a summons to set aside `the default judgment` entered against the plaintiff on 28 September 1962 and the writ of seizure and sale issued on 3 October 1962 and that the plaintiff be given leave to defend.
The summons came on for hearing before me on 29 October 1962 when I ordered that the judgment and writ of seizure and sale above referred to be set aside and that the plaintiff be given leave to defend the action on payment of costs. As far as I am able to recall the matter now I did so because the defendant appeared to me to have a triable issue on the merits and not because the judgment had been improperly obtained.
This order was not appealed from and the action proceeded to trial. The essential correctness of the order was amply demonstrated by the fact that Ambrose J who tried the case dismissed the defendant`s claim with costs. The defendant thereupon appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal who dismissed his appeal with costs. The plaintiff had won all along the line.
The present proceedings arose out of what was alleged by the plaintiff to be the unlawful seizure of his goods and chattels in pursuance of a judgment which was a nullity.
The plaintiff based his claim in trespass and also alleged a malicious abuse of civil proceedings.
The judgment however which the defendant obtained under O XIV was not, in my view, a nullity but had been regularly and properly obtained. By virtue of O IX r 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 the summons was sufficiently served as it was posted in a prepaid registered envelope addressed to the plaintiff at his address for service and that the time at which the summons so posted would be delivered in the ordinary course of post shall be considered as the time of service thereof.
The words `unless the contrary is proved` which appear in the definition of `service by post` in the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap 2) which was in force at the material time although now repealed by the Interpretation Act 1965 (No 10 of 1965) do not appear in r 14 and the omission must be taken to be deliberate.
Denning LJ in

 County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ex p Rossi 
[1956] 1 QB 682
 puts the matter in this way: 
 
To sum up, when service of process is allowed by registered post; without more being said on the matter, then if the letter is not returned, it is assumed to have been delivered in the ordinary course of post and any judgment or order by default on the faith of that assumption is perfectly regular. It will not be set aside except on payment of costs and showing of merits: see

[1952] 1 KB 42
. But if the letter is returned undelivered and nevertheless, notwithstanding its return, a judgment or order by default is obtained, it is irregular and will be set aside ex debito justitiae.
 
 
 
The important words are `when service of process is allowed by registered post without more being said on the matter` which was the case in 
 ex p Rossi, 
 and which distinguishes it from the present one.
In the case before me more was said, namely, that where service is made by registered post the time at which the document so posted would be delivered in the ordinary course of post shall be considered as the time of service thereof.
This additional factor coupled with the palpable and deliberate omission of the words `unless the contrary is proved` make it clear, in my opinion, that the summons was sufficiently served within the meaning of the rule.

 a similar question arose in connection with the service of a notice increasing the rateable value of land. By s 65 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act 1869 notices may be served by post by prepaid letter addressed to the occupier, and, if sent by post shall be deemed to have been served and received at the time when the letter containing the same would be delivered in the ordinary course, and in proving such service or sending it shall be sufficient to prove that the letter containing the notice was properly addressed and prepaid and put in the post. The occupier proved that he had not in fact received the notice. The court (Viscount Reading CJ, Ridley and Lush JJ) held that the effect of the section was that when the posting of a prepaid notice properly addressed was proved the addressee must be taken to have received it.
It is true that in that case the words `and received` occur in the section but I do not consider that the addition of those words carries the matter any further but were merely inserted 
 ex abundanti cautela. 
In the result therefore I have come to the conclusion that the judgment was regularly and properly obtained and the writ of seizure and sale lawfully issued in pursuance of the judgment.
That is sufficient to dispose of the plaintiff`s case in trespass but it appeared from his statement of claim that he was alleging a malicious abuse of civil proceedings.
In civil proceedings under certain circumstances, namely, those which involve an interference with liberty or property, or affect, or are likely to affect, reputation an action undoubtedly lies if those proceedings are undertaken maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause.
All that I need say on this aspect of the case is that the plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus of proof which lies upon him of proving malice and that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause nor can these matters be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.
In the light of my findings it is unnecessary to consider the question of damages except to say that the plaintiff`s evidence on the subject was highly unsatisfactory to say the least of it and here again he has, in my view, failed to discharge the onus which lies upon him of proving them.
The plaintiff`s claim therefore fails on all grounds and must be dismissed with costs and judgment entered for the defendant accordingly.

To raise a reasonable doubt
 
The appellant was charged in the High Court of Singapore before a jury on a charge of murder, the charge being as follows: 
 
THAT YOU, Mohamed Salleh bin Daim, on or about 15 August 1967 at about 7.25pm at the Bukit Timah Fire Station, Upper Bukit Timah Road, eight ms Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Rahmat bin Mohamed and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 119).
 
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution the trial judge through an official interpreter of the court called on the appellant for his defence, gave the appellant the usual warning and informed the appellant that he could consult his counsel if he so wished.
The usual warning is ordinarily in the following terms: `You may give evidence on oath in which case you have to do so from the witness box where you may be cross-examined like any other witness, or you may make a statement from the dock to the jury in which case you cannot be cross-examined by anyone, or you may remain silent`, and it is common ground that a `warning` to this effect was given to the appellant.
It appears to be not in dispute that the appellant consulted his counsel and then elected to make a statement from the dock.
After the appellant made his unsworn statement from the dock, no other witness was called for the defence. The trial judge then summed up to the jury and after a short retirement to consider their verdict they returned a unanimous verdict of guilty of murder as charged. The appellant now appeals against his conviction.
The first point raised by the appellant is that in the Chapter of the Criminal Procedure Code which deals with trials before the High Court, as there is no provision for an accused to make an unsworn statement from the dock, it was an irregularity, which could be cured only by a re-trial, for the trial judge to tell the appellant he had a choice of whether to give evidence on oath from the witness box or to make an unsworn statement from the dock. It is submitted that this irregularity had misled the appellant to his prejudice and deprived him of a fair trial because, if the choice of making an unsworn statement from the dock had not been offered to him, he would undoubtedly have given evidence on oath. Another submission is that it was also prejudicial because, having offered the appellant the right to make an unsworn statement from the dock, the trial judge in his summing up told the jury that the unsworn statement was practically worthless as it was not on oath and as the appellant could not be cross-examined on it.
In our judgment, the right of an accused at his trial on a criminal charge to make an unsworn statement from the dock is not a procedural right but a substantive right of an accused and accordingly does not depend on whether or not there is a specific provision for it in the Criminal Procedure Code. It seems to us beyond doubt that under our system of administration of justice, and it has been so throughout the entire history of our courts, a person accused of a criminal offence before an established court of justice has at his trial, as part of his defence, the right to make an unsworn statement from the dock if he wishes to do so. In our view this right can be taken away only by an express statutory provision to that effect.
With regard to the question of prejudice arising out of the trial judge`s comment on the probative value of the unsworn statement of the appellant, we are of the opinion that it is proper for a judge in summing up to remind the jury that a statement from the dock is not sworn evidence which can be the subject of cross-examination; that they can attach to it such weight as they think fit and that they should take it into consideration in deciding whether the prosecution have proved their case. In the present case the trial judge directed the jury as follows: 
 
Well, members of the jury, that is the case for the prosecution. Now what is the accused`s defence to this charge? You must also consider his evidence, or rather you must consider his defence. The accused, as you know, did not give evidence on oath. He made a statement from the dock and he could not be cross-examined by the prosecution, he could not be questioned by me, he could not be questioned by you. Members of the jury, you will naturally not be inclined to give so much weight to what he said in the dock as you would if he gave evidence, because when a man gives evidence one can cross-examine on it and test it and generally have a much better opportunity of assessing it. Of course, you must not reject the statement of the accused, you must consider it and give it such weight as you think it is worth having regard to the other evidence that you have.
 
 
 
In our opinion a direction in those terms was perfectly proper and in no way prejudicial to the appellant.
Before dealing with the other grounds urged on behalf of the appellant, it is necessary to set out the material facts briefly. The deceased was a fireman attached to the Bukit Timah fire station. The appellant is a son of another fireman attached to another fire station. Both lived in institutional quarters at the back of the Bukit Timah fire station. On the afternoon of 15 August 1967 the deceased and the appellant took part in a game of football as members of the same team. After the game, another fireman Poosiok bin Dol Raji was sitting near the store room of the Bukit Timah fire station when the appellant joined him and told him of his wanting to see the deceased. After a while, the appellant walked away towards the firemen`s quarters. After the appellant had left, Poosiok saw the deceased coming into the station compound through the main gate and walking towards the direction of his own quarters. This was at about 6.25 or 6.30pm.
At about 7.25pm the same evening a fire officer, Johan bin Ajmain, while having dinner in his quarters situate on the first floor of the station and just above the station engine room, heard a commotion coming from the direction of the quarters which were in front of his own. He heard shouts by several people and saw the deceased, with his hand on his abdomen, running towards Johan`s quarters and being chased by the appellant who was three feet behind the deceased and holding a knife. On seeing this Johan shouted out in Malay, words meaning literally `stop that work`. The deceased and the appellant, however, did not stop and Johan then hurried downstairs. He saw blood along the passage which led to the engine room and in the engine room he saw the deceased in the arms of another fireman Johari bin Som. He saw that the deceased had a stab wound in his abdomen. Later on he saw the appellant enter the control room and hand over a knife to a police sergeant.
The control room operator at the time, also saw Johari holding the deceased and saw the appellant with a knife in his hand standing in front of the deceased and Johari. He heard the appellant saying to the deceased words meaning `are you satisfied or not?` After hearing this the control room operator went back to the control room.
Johari testified that at about 7.25pm he was in the engine room and he saw the deceased just inside the engine room bleeding from his abdomen. The deceased asked him to help and he held the deceased on his lap. While the deceased was on his lap, the appellant came in holding a knife in his hand and spoke to the deceased words meaning `are you satisfied or not?`
The deceased`s wife said she was called from her quarters and informed of a commotion. She walked towards the station but at the foot of some steps leading to the station she came across the appellant who told her he had killed her husband and asked for forgiveness.
The knife which the appellant handed to the police sergeant belonged to the appellant`s father and was kept in the quarters in which the appellant lived with the father.
The deceased died shortly after admission into hospital and the post mortem revealed a stab wound in his abdomen, one on his right hip and two on his right forearm. The abdominal wound was described by the pathologist as a dual wound with two tracks indicating that the blade of the weapon used was first thrust in, then withdrawn but not completely and then thrust in again but in a different direction. The wound on the deceased indicated that a sharp pointed weapon, such as a knife, was used.
The appellant was examined by a doctor the following day and found to have seven minor scratches on the lower part of his left knee, a minor scratch on his left loin and a minor abrasion at the lower part of his right knee.
In his statement from the dock, the appellant said that during the football game, the deceased called him a bastard because he had missed a kick. After the game he brooded over what he described as insults and belittlements by the deceased during the past few months and after his bath he left his father`s quarters and met and told Poosiok he wanted to see the deceased to talk things over. He then saw the deceased enter the main gate and he went towards the deceased who abused him. Later, the deceased waved something in his hand and gestured to him to come down from his father`s quarters. He took a knife and went down and met the deceased with the knife in his hand. The deceased tried to grab him, he stepped back, the deceased tried to kick and slap him, he ducked and pulled out the knife from its sheath. The deceased tried to grab the knife, without success, and then ran away. He chased after the deceased who on turning a corner fell on the ground face upwards and he fell on top of the deceased. Both struggled up and the deceased continued running and he just followed. The deceased again fell, got up and ran into the station proper and he followed. In the station he found the deceased lying down being supported by Johari and he just looked on. Then he went away and sat at the bottom of a flight of steps where the deceased`s wife found him and he told her he had in a fight accidentally stabbed her husband.
It is urged upon us that as the appellant`s statement was the only account of how the deceased came upon the injuries found on him, the appellant`s version ought to have been accepted by the jury and he ought to have been acquitted because on that version the deceased`s injuries had been accidentally caused in the struggle to get up when they had both fallen on the ground with the appellant on top of the deceased. This submission we reject for the simple reason that there was ample evidence before the jury for them to find, as they must have found by their verdict of guilty of murder, that the injuries were not accidentally caused.
Alternatively, it is urged that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the fatal injury i.e. the abdominal wound, might have been accidentally caused and if they had a doubt on this matter they should give the benefit of the doubt to the appellant. We find no substance in this submission. The jury were adequately directed on the law relating to the defence of accident and were told that they must acquit the appellant if they thought that the injuries on the deceased were accidentally caused. Furthermore, at the close of his summing up the trial judge directed the jury that if they were left in any reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed the offence of murder as charged, then it was their duty to return a verdict of not guilty. In our opinion the jury was adequately directed on the issue of accident and this ground of appeal therefore fails.
Lastly, it is submitted that on the appellant`s statement from the dock, the question of grave and sudden provocation was before the jury and the trial judge had erred first, in withdrawing this issue from the jury, and secondly, in failing to direct the jury adequately on the quantum of proof required when an accused person endeavours to bring himself within one of the exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code, which would reduce the offence from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
On the first point, it is said that the trial judge had expressed his own views on whether there was provocation, and if there was, whether the provocation received could be said to be grave and sudden and such as to deprive him of the power of self-control. The views so expressed were said to be all unfavourable to the appellant and therefore amounted to a withdrawal of this issue from the jury. We do not agree. In our opinion a judge is entitled to express his own views provided the jury are told at the same time that they are not relieved thereby of the responsibility of arriving at their own conclusions. The summing up was not defective on this point as the judge repeatedly emphasised to the jury that they were not bound to accept his opinion or view on any issue of fact and that it was for them to decide.
On the second point, it is contended that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the quantum of proof required of an accused person who endeavours to bring himself within exception 1 of s 300 of the Penal Code, the relevant portions of which are as follows: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation causes the death of the person who gave the provocation.
 
 
 
It is conceded that s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance places the burden or onus on a person accused of an offence under s 300 of the Penal Code to prove the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any special exception of s 300 but it is contended that an accused person discharges that burden or onus if a reasonable doubt is raised in the minds of the jury as to whether or not the necessary factors exist. The case of 
 Soh Cheow Hor 
 
 v 
 
 R 
 
 
 
[1960] MLJ 254
  is relied on in support of this proposition. In that case Rose CJ delivering the judgment of the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal said at p 254: 
 
Whatever the position may have been in the past, it appears now to be the accepted rule that when an accused person endeavours to bring himself within one of the exceptions, it is sufficient for his purpose if a reasonable doubt is raised in the minds of the jury as to whether or not the necessary factors exist. If as a result of the evidence of the whole case taken and considered together the jury find themselves in genuine doubt as to whether or not the case falls within one of the exceptions then their verdict on the point must be in favour of the accused ...
 
 
 
The trial judge directed the jury as follows: 
 
If you think that the accused was gravely and suddenly provoked that he was deprived of his power of self-control, it will be proper for you to convict on culpable homicide not amounting to murder. If on the other hand having weighed all the evidence you are convinced that he is not covered by this exception, then of course it is murder.
 
 
 
It is contended on behalf of the appellant that this direction amounts to a misdirection in that it places too high an onus on an accused person who endeavours to bring himself within exception 1 of s 300 of the Penal Code. We disagree with the contention. In our opinion the language used sufficiently conveys to the jury that if they are left in genuine doubt as to the existence or non-existence of all the factors relating to the issue of grave and sudden provocation, they must find a verdict of guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
In any event, assuming there was a misdirection, we are of the opinion that on all the evidence, a reasonable jury properly directed on this point, would be left in no genuine doubt that the provocative conduct and acts of the deceased as related by the appellant in his statement from the dock could not amount to provocation under exception 1 of s 300 of the Penal Code.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Section 3 Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966 (No 38 of 1966)
 
This is an appeal against a sentence of caning imposed by a magistrate`s court. The appellant was convicted of an offence punishable under s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966 and was sentenced to three months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
He now appeals against the sentence of caning on the ground that the sentence of caning by the magistrate`s court is ultra vires the provisions of s 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (Cap 128) as the appellant was under the age of 16 years at all material times.
It is contended that in so far as a person who is under the age of sixteen is concerned and who has committed an offence under s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966 the only court that can sentence him to caning under the mandatory provisions of that section is the High Court because of the provisions to s 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (Cap 128).
That that is the correct contention is because, it is submitted, s 55(3) is a provision of law of general application in that the legislature has thought fit to limit the power to sentence a child or young person, ie a person under the age of sixteen, to suffer corporal punishment to the High Court only and not to other courts.
The determination of the point raised in this appeal requires the consideration of the provisions of three sections of three Acts of the legislature, namely, s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966, s 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (Cap 128) and s 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132). It is to be noted that the 1966 Act is the latest act promulgated by the legislature in point of time.
The material provisions of s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966 are as follows: 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, any person who commits any act of vandalism or attempts to do any such act or causes any such act to bet done shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, and shall also, subject to the provisions of s 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code, be punished with caning with not less than three strokes and not more than eight strokes.
 
 
 
Section 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance provides that: 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law no child or young person shall be sentenced by any court other than the High Court to corporal punishment`Young person` for the purpose of s 55 is defined to mean a person who is under the age of sixteen.
 
 
 
Section 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides: 
 
No sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments and none of the following persons shall be punishable with caning:
 
 
 
(a) females;
 
 
 
 
(b) males sentenced to death; 
 
(c) males whom the court considers to be more than fifty years of age.
  
 
 
There appears therefore to be an apparent conflict between the provisions of s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966 and the provisions of s 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance on the power of a court other than the High Court to impose a sentence of caning on a person under the age of sixteen but the answer in my opinion can be found by a consideration of s 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132) which is a clear enactment that none of the three categories of persons specified therein shall be punishable with caning and is in my opinion a clear enactment of general application so that in respect of these three categories of persons no court whatsoever can sentence any of them to caning. Section 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance is however not of the same general application in that persons under the age of sixteen can be sentenced to corporal punishment by the High Court.
Having regard to s 55(3) of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (Cap 128) and s 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code what then is the true construction of s 3 of the Punishment for Vandalism Act 1966? In approaching this problem I would adopt as correct the passage in 
 Craies 
 on Statute Law 
(6th Ed) at p 531 where it is stated: 
 
The distinction between a strict and a liberal construction has almost disappeared with regard to all classes of statutes, so that all statutes, whether penal or not, are now construed by substantially the same rules. `All modern Acts are framed with regard to equitable as well as legal principles.` `A hundred years ago,` said the court in 
 Lyons`
case, `statutes were required to be perfectly precise, and resort was not had to a reasonable construction of the Act, and thereby criminals were often allowed to escape. This is not the present mode of construing Acts of Parliament. They are construed now with reference to the true meaning and real intention of the legislature.` Therefore, `although the common distinction`, as Pollock CB said in 
 Nicholson v Fields,
`taken between penal Acts and remedial Acts, that the former are to be construed strictly and the others are to be construed liberally, is not a distinction, perhaps, that ought to be erased from the mind of a judge,` yet the distinction now means little more than `that penal provisions, like all others, are to be fairly construed according to legislative intent as expressed in the enactment, the courts refusing on the one hand to extend the punishment to cases which are not clearly embraced in them, and on the other equally refusing by any mere verbal nicety, forced construction or equitable interpretation to exonerate parties plainly within their scope`.
 
 
 
The legislative intent is clear from the preamble which states that it is `An Act to provide for exemplary punishment for acts of vandalism`. It is also, in my opinion, clear that the legislature by its express reference to s 274 of the Criminal Procedure Code intended to embrace all persons, except the three categories specified therein, within the latter part of s 3, ie the punishment of caning.
I am accordingly of the view that the sentence of caning imposed by the magistrate on the appellant was a valid sentence and the appeal is therefore dismissed and the sentence affirmed.

Section 22(1) Factories Ordinance 1958
 
The plaintiff in this case claims damages for personal injuries suffered whilst at work in the defendants` factory as a result of the negligence of the defendants` servant or agent and in the alternative arising out of the breach of statutory duty of the defendants under s 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958.
The short facts are these. The defendants are manufacturers of plywood and veneer. On 4 March 1966 the plaintiff was working with two other workmen at a band-saw in the defendants` factory sawing timber. While working the plaintiff was struck in the right eye by a piece of saw tooth which flew off from the band-saw. As a result the plaintiff lost the sight of his right eye.
The plaintiff`s evidence as to how the accident occurred was shortly this. Three persons were working at the band-saw. The plaintiff, and another person were at the front of the machine pushing the log core into the saw and one person (Teh Chin Guan) was at the rear of the machine pulling it. The log core had gone through the saw and Teh Chin Guan was pushing the log core back to the front for further sawing and in so doing the log core hit the saw which in turn struck the metal sawing platform and caused one of the teeth of the saw to break and fly out and hit the plaintiff`s right eye.
The plaintiff alleges that he and Teh Chin Guan were servants of the defendants but the defendants deny this.
The plaintiff`s evidence as regards his employment was shortly this. He had been working in various sawmills for eight years. Lim Chai Keng was the 
 kepala 
employed by the defendants and Lim Chai Keng came to see him in Kuala Lumpur in February 1966 and told him that the defendants` factory was short of a foreman and he, Lim Chai Keng, was instructed to look for one. Lim Chai Keng invited him to come to Singapore to work and said that he would get on the average $300 per month for 20 working days a month. He came to Singapore on the 12 February and Lim Chai Keng brought him to the defendants` factory where he was interviewed by an officer of the defendant company. He asked about his terms of employment and was told that there would be a minimum of 20 working days a month for which he would get as much as $300 per month and extra pay would be given in respect of additional work done and if he worked for less than 20 days a deduction of $1 per day would be made. The officer told him that he must work properly and obey the instructions of the defendants` officers. He started work the next day, 13 February. Lim Chai Keng kept the record of the attendance and supervised the work of the workers, and was responsible for the sharpening of the saw blades. From time to time an officer of the defendants would also supervise the work of the workers and he, the plaintiff, was told by Lim Chai Keng to obey the instructions of that officer. Pay day was on 5 and 20 of the month. On 20 February he did not get his pay but he got an advance of $15 from Lim Chai Keng who also gave him some meal coupons. On 4 March this accident happened. He agreed that he was not the only person called by Lim Chai Keng to work in the defendants` factory. He also agreed that when he was working in Singapore for two years previously he worked as an independent labourer.
The defendants say that the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were not employed by them but by Lim Chai Keng.
The evidence of Guo Shih Hung, the production manager of the defendant company, was shortly this. He was in charge of contracts with labour contractors, sales and purchase of logs. There were two kinds of workers in the defendants` factory, one consisting of workers directly employed by the defendants and the other of workers supplied by labour contractors. The workers employed by the defendants were concerned with the loading and unloading of logs and the packing of processed timber and the clearing of saw dust whereas the workers supplied by the labour contractors were concerned with the sawing of logs and sharpening of saw blades. The cutting of logs had to be done according to the defendants` specifications. On or about 16 February 1966 the defendants entered into a contract with Lim Chai Keng. The contract was in Chinese (exh D8). The contract was signed also by Leow Ee Siang. This was done to enable Leow Ee Siang to collect the payments from the defendants on behalf of Lim Chai Keng. The contract covered three main points. They were:
 
 
(1) the contract workers were to undertake indoor work consisting of cutting logs according to the defendants, specifications and the sharpening of the saw blades; 
 
(2) all arrangements relating to such contract workers were to be made by the contractor; 
 
(3) the contract workers were to be paid at piece rate on the basis of quantity and sizes of timber produced.
  
 
 
The contract also provided for a minimum period of 20 days` work per month. The contract did not specify the number of workers the contractor was to employ. There were two payments made a month, one on 5 and the other on 20. Payments were made on terms of unit rate for each type of timber produced in proportion to the quantity and made to Lim Chai Keng and based on the total output of all the workers of Lim Chai Keng. Transportation, board and lodging and medical expenses of the workers were not the concern of the defendants but the defendants were responsible for the premium due under the workmen`s compensation policy. The defendants did not deal with the labourers of Lim Chai Keng but only with Lim Chai Keng himself. The defendants did not keep a record of the number of labourers supplied by Lim Chai Keng nor the particulars of the labourers. All the workers working at the eight band-saw of the defendants were Lim Chai Keng`s labourers. There was a canteen at the defendants` premises; it was not run by the defendants but by a caterer who issued meal coupons to enable the labourers without ready cash to have meals on credit.
Lim Chai Keng`s evidence was to this effect. He was a labour contractor in the timber section of the defendants` factory. Under the agreement exh D8 he was to supply a team of labourers to cut timber in the defendants` factory. Payments were made to him half-monthly by the defendants and he would in turn pay the workman according to the quantity of timber produced by each team of three workers at one machine and at the same rates paid by the defendants to him. He paid the workers at this rate - to the first worker $32 out of every $100 paid to the team, to the second worker $24 and to the third worker $20 and to the person who sharpened the saw $24. The plaintiff was the first worker. He was the person who sharpened the saw. The plaintiff was not paid a salary of $300 per month by the defendants. The average monthly income of the plaintiff would be between $320 and $330. On the signing of the contract he had ten workers; the number of workers was not fixed, it would depend on the quantity of timber to be cut. The division of work and labour was done by him and did not concern the defendants. The plaintiff was engaged by him to work under this contract and not by the defendants. The plaintiff was not interviewed by any officer of the defendants. He told the plaintiff that the plaintiff would be engaged under the contract labour system. He did not submit a list of the names of the workers to the defendants. The defendants did not have a supervisor to supervise the work of his workmen but there were two clerks of the defendants who would check the amount of timber produced every day. He had not been asked to dismiss any of his workers or to tell any of his workers to work harder or to replace any worker but if he was asked to do any of those things he could not refuse. The central provident fund contributions were his responsibility and not the defendants. It was he who supplied meal coupons to the plaintiff, he obtained the coupons from the canteen which was run by a contractor and not the defendants. The powers of supervision and dismissal were vested in him and not the defendants.
The evidence of Francis Tan, the office manager of the defendants, was shortly this. In accordance with the agreement with Lim Chai Keng the defendants paid the insurance premium to cover Lim Chai Keng`s workmen under their workmen`s compensation policy and the workers were classified in the policy as the contractor`s employees.
It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were not employed by the defendants. The evidence shows that there was (and still is) a contract between the defendants and Lim Chai Keng under which Lim Chai Keng was to supply labourers to work at the defendants` eight band-saws and that the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were working in the defendants` factory under this contract at the time of the accident. The question arises whether the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were servants of the defendants.
It is convenient now to consider the test to be applied in deciding whether a man be a servant or an independent contractor.
The word `servant` is defined in 
 Salmond on Torts 
(14th Ed) p 648 as `any person employed by another to do work for him on the terms that he, the servant, is to be subject to the control and directions of his employer in respect of the manner in which his work is to be done.` In 25 
 Halsbury 
(3rd Ed) p 447, the characteristics of the relationship of master and servant are stated thus: 
 
Whether or not, in any given case the relationship of master and servant exists is a question of fact; but in general the relationship imports the existence of power in the employer not only to direct what work the servant is to do, but also the manner in which the work is to be done.
 
 
 
At p 498 of the same volume of 
 Halsbury 
the following passage appears: 
 
To distinguish between an independent contractor and a servant, the test is whether or not the employer retains the power, not only of directing what work is to be done, but also of controlling the manner of doing the work.
 
 
 
The following passage in 
 Smith`s Master & Servant 
 (8th Ed) p 254, is useful: 
 
But though it is the employer`s power of control that differentiates the position of servant from that of independent contractor, the employer may nevertheless reserve to himself by contract general rights of watching the progress of the works which the contractor has agreed to carry out for him, of deciding as to the quality of materials and workmanship, of stopping the works or any part thereof at any stage, and modifying and altering them, and of dismissing disobedient or incompetent workmen employed by the contractor, and yet he will not thereby of necessity render himself liable to third persons for the negligence of the contractor in carrying out the work.
 
 
 
MCardie J in 
 Performing Right Society 
v 
 Mitchell & Booker 
[1924] 1 KB 762
 said (at p 767): 
 
It seems, however, reasonably clear that the final test, if there be a final test, and certainly the test to be generally applied, lies in the nature and degree of detailed control over the person alleged to be a servant.
 
 
 
In 
 Honeywill & Stein Ltd 
 v 
 Larkin Bros 
[1934] 1 KB 191
 Slesser LJ who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said (at p 169): 
 
The determination whether the actual wrongdoer is a servant or agent on the one hand or an independent contractor on the other depends on whether or not the employer not only determines what is to be done, but retains the control of the actual performance, in which case the doer is a servant or agent; but if the employer, while prescribing the work to be done, leaves the manner of doing it to the control of the doer, the latter is an independent contractor.
 
 
 
To decide whether the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were or were not servants of the defendants I have to consider the agreement exh D8 as their relationship with the defendants rested upon this document.
The agreement provides that Lim Chai Keng was to provide the labour needed to cut the timber which the defendants required. The defendants certainly were not concerned with the number of labourers employed by Lim Chai Keng. What the defendants were concerned were the quantity and type of timber to be cut and the standard of the output and they could only give directions as to what work was to be done. Payment was to be made to Lim Chai Keng on the collective output of the labourers and the defendants were not concerned with the arrangement made by Lim Chai Keng with the labourers as regards payment to the labourers. The agreement provides that the cost of food, transport charges, provident fund, vacation, sick leave and medical charges of the labourers were the responsibility of Lim Chai Keng. The intention of the parties to the agreement is clear that the labourers were to be the employees of Lim Chai Keng and not the defendants.
Another matter to be taken into consideration is the power to dismiss. The defendants say that they have no power to dismiss the labourers working at the band-saws. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the terms of the contract in this respect.
Clause 6 of the contract provides as follows:
 Rest and Work Stoppage 
 
 
Party 
 B
(Lim Chai Keng) and his workmen shall not stop work or go slow an they please. Particularly when an order has to be fulfilled in time to catch a boat for shipment either extra work should be done or an extra gang should be engaged to work in order that production shall be co-ordinated. Otherwise Party 
 B
shall be held responsible for compensating Party 
 A
`s loss (the defendants`). If Party 
 B
and his workmen cannot attend work because of illness or because of some other matter they should apply for leave in advance and find a substitute/s. If a workman, before obtaining the `consent` of Party 
 A,
should go slow or not work hard or do anything detrimental to production, Party 
 A
shall order Party 
 B
to dismiss him for which Party 
 B
and his workman shall not make any claim against Party 
 A.
Otherwise either Party 
 A
or Party 
 B
may terminate the contract.
 
 
 
Clause 7 provides as follows:-
 Go slow, engaging workmen; dismissal 
 
If Party 
 B
and his workmen should be guilty of misconduct, or of being careless in work or of deliberately causing damage to timber, machines or tools, Party 
 A
shall ask Party 
 B
to pay compensation according to the cost (of articles damaged) and to dismiss the guilty workman/workmen. If a workman is not hard working, Party 
 A
may ask Party 
 B
to replace him. (Party 
 B)
shall not dispute and shall not make any claim against Party 
 A.
Before Party 
 B
engages the workman, a list of workmen`s names shall first be submitted to Party 
 A
for examination. Party 
 A
shall have the right to reject any particular workman/workmen. During the currency of the contract, if and when Party 
 A
is of the opinion that any particular workman/workmen is/are not hard working, he/they shall be replaced and Party 
 B
shall not refuse.
 
 
 
Clause 8 provides as follows:
 Trial period 
 
 
This contract is tentatively fixed for one year. If production is co-ordinated, there shall be a trial period of one month as from the time the contract is entered into. If, during the trial period, Party 
 A
& Party 
 B
should regard it as being unsatisfactory, they may agree to make re-adjustment or terminate the contract. If Party 
 A
in of the opinion that certain workman/workmen in not capable of doing his/their work he may instruct Party 
 B
to dismiss that/those workman/workmen whose account shall be settled immediately and who shall be told to leave Party 
 A
`s factory. Party 
 B
shall act accordingly and shall not make any claim including claim for allowance.
 
 
 
It seems reasonably clear from the agreement that the defendants have no power to dismiss any of the labourers, such power is with Lim Chai Keng.
Taking all these circumstances into consideration I have come to the view that the plaintiff and Teh Chin Guan were not servants of the defendants. The claim of the plaintiff for damages at common law therefore fails.
I now come to deal with the alternative claim of the plaintiff based on a breach of statutory duty by the defendants.
In the statement of claim the particulars of the breach of statutory duty of the defendants was pleaded as `contrary to s 25 of the Factories Act the defendants failed to completely encase the said machinery`, but at the trial the section relied upon is s 22(1) of the Factories Ordinance 1958.
Section 22(1) provides: 
 
Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or such construction as to be as safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced:
 
 
 
Provided that, in so far as the safety of a dangerous part of any machinery cannot by reason of the nature of the operation be secured by means of a fixed guard, the requirements of this subsection shall be deemed to have been complied with if a device is provided which automatically prevents the operator from coming into contact with that part.
The case of the plaintiff is that the defendants failed to fence the saw so as to prevent the danger of a tooth from the saw which has broken off from being ejected by the machine and causing injury.
For the defendants it is submitted that the obligation to fence under s 22(1) is an obligation only to protect against direct injury by contact with the dangerous part of the machine and not against injury from something that flies off from the machine.
On consideration of the terms of s 22 I am of the opinion that the obligation to fence imposed by sub-s (1) is an obligation to provide a guard against contact with any dangerous part of a machine and that it does not impose any obligation to guard against dangerous materials or articles ejected from the machine (See 
 Nicholls 
v 
 Austin (Leyton) 
[1946] 2 All ER 92 and 
 Close 
v 
 Steel Co of Wales 
[1961] 2 All ER 953).
From the evidence that I have, I am of the view that the defendants have complied with, s 22(1) in that every precaution has been taken for the safe operation of the band-saw. It is true that the exposed part of the saw was not fenced but the nature of the operation prevents a guard to be fixed and there is no danger of the workmen coming into contact with the exposed saw as they would be standing some distance away from the saw when working and they do not have to get near the saw at all. No fencing would be sufficient to prevent a broken tooth of the saw from flying out.
This accident is unusual and it is not one which could have been foreseen by the defendants.
In the result the plaintiff`s claim fails and is dismissed with costs.

Whether negligence established
 
This is one of those infrequent cases where I have no hesitation at all in rejecting the evidence of the plaintiff on all disputed matters. He was clearly proved to be a liar on about the most material issue in the case, to wit, whether there was an oncoming car which encroached on the defendant`s side of the road in such a manner as to render the defendant`s action inevitable in, what is frequently referred to as, the `agony of the moment`. I have found it impossible to place any reliance in him at all. On the contrary, I accept the defendant as, substantially, an honest and reliable witness.
Taking the view which I do about their respective attitudes towards the truth, I do not propose to enter into a detailed analysis of their evidence.
I am satisfied beyond doubt that what the plaintiff himself said about the oncoming car in his original police report, to wit, that it took too much of the road and caused the defendant to swerve left to avoid it, which he denied in evidence, was a true account of what actually took place and that he has subsequently seen fit to falsify and tailor his evidence to suit the remedy he now seeks.
In my judgment, he has hopelessly failed to establish any negligence on the defendant`s part. This should suffice to dismiss his claim but since the defendant`s veracity has been called in question, I feel I ought to state my own views on his version of the accident which I have no hesitation in accepting as a true version of what really occurred.
As counsel who took over the conduct of the plaintiff`s case at the continued cross-examination of the defendant on 30 May, after the case had been part-heard previously on 10 May this year, has himself stated in other motor accident cases in which he has appeared before me, it is difficult for witnesses to be mathematically precise some time after the event about matters such as times, distances and speeds. It is small wonder, therefore, that the defendant who was driving the taxi, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, just after midnight on the morning of 5 January 1967, on a left-hand bend in Upper Thomson Road at about the 5.75 milestone towards the city, was unable to be as mathematically precise about these matters as he was expected and required to be on this particular occasion.
Despite any apparent lack of precision on his part, I am satisfied, on the evidence as a whole, that he was telling the truth to the best of his ability as to why his taxi went off the road on to the grass verge and then landed upside down in a drain to his left.
I am also satisfied that there was an oncoming car which he suddenly saw approaching him at speed on his own half of the road after he had completed the left-hand bend. This left him with no alternative except to try to minimise the impending disaster as best he could. I do not accept the suggestion that he should have been crawling round the bend as he reached it at a very low speed in order to avoid possible speed maniacs who might have been bent on entering the bend from the opposite direction by slicing it. He had driven on this particular route for a long time without mishap and even the plaintiff stated that on this particular night he had driven quite well from the 13th milestone until the accident.
I am satisfied that the avoiding action taken by him was one which any reasonable user of the road, like himself, confronted with the same situation, i.e.a head-on collision through no fault of his own, could well have adopted on emerging out of this particular bend short of having to commit virtual suicide. In other words, I accept his explanation.
The plaintiff`s claim cannot succeed from any point of view and is accordingly dismissed with costs.

The appellants are the employers of the deceased, on behalf of whose estate the respondents, as administratrix and co-administrator, commenced an action in the High Court of Singapore claiming damages for the death of the deceased in an accident allegedly caused by the negligence of the appellants.
The evidence, which was never in dispute, before the trial judge was very meagre indeed. The facts that appear from the evidence are these. The deceased was at the time of the accident employed by the appellants as a mason having been so employed for two or three years. The appellants were at all material times general contractors, and at the time of the accident engaged in erecting and constructing an electricity sub-station at Toa Payoh, Singapore. The deceased`s duties included, inter alia, the erecting and constructing of brick walls of the electricity sub-station.
On 29 December 1965 the deceased was working on the roof of the sub-station which was then under construction having been working on that roof for the past ten days. To gain access to the roof top he had first to get on to the roof of a building described as a battery room. The height of this building was ten feet and the roof was a flat roof, the surface of which was tarred. The means of access used by the deceased from the ground to the flat roof of the battery room was a free-standing wooden ladder. From the roof of the battery room the deceased used a similar ladder to get on to the roof of the sub-station. The roof of the sub-station was nine feet above the roof of the battery room and the distance between the two buildings was five feet at ground level and merely two feet from roof-eave to roof-eave.
On the day in question, as was his usual practice, the deceased was climbing down the ladder leading from the roof of the sub-station to the roof of the battery room, on the first stage of his journey to the ground to have his midday meal, when he fell off this ladder through the space between the two buildings on to the concrete floor at ground level, a fall of about 15 feet having regard to the fact that the evidence is that he was less than half way down the ladder when he fell. Unfortunately the fall was a fatal one.
There was no eyewitness who saw the actual fall but a witness, a fellow employee with the deceased, testified that he saw the deceased climbing down the ladder immediately before the fall. He had after seeing the deceased starting his descent down the ladder turned away towards the place where they were going to have their meal when he heard the noise of a person falling. He then rushed back and saw the deceased lying on the ground between the two buildings and he saw the ladder no longer there. The ladder was found lying flat on the roof of the battery room. This witness was working with the deceased on the site for more than a month before the accident and it was the deceased`s usual practice while working on the roof of the sub-station to use this particular ladder as his means of access to that roof from the roof of the battery room. It was also the deceased`s usual practice to get on to the roof of the sub-station empty handed and to come down empty handed and daily to come down to the ground at about 10am for a coffee break, at 12 noon for a lunch break and at 3pm for another coffee break. The only other material facts are that the top portion of the ladder rested on the edge of the sub-station roof, the lower end of the ladder rested on the flat roof of the battery room and the ladder was not firmly lashed to any object or otherwise fixed firmly to prevent slipping or movement of any sort.
The respondents called no other evidence on the issue of negligence and, not surprisingly, the appellants elected to call no evidence at the close of the respondents` case and submitted that on the evidence the respondents had failed to prove that the death of the deceased was the result of any negligence on their part.
It would appear from his grounds of judgment that the trial judge made no positive finding as to the cause of the deceased`s fall from the ladder in question. In his judgment he stated: 
 
From the facts it would appear that while the deceased was coming down the ladder in a normal manner either the ladder slipped from its position for one reason or other and thereby caused the deceased to fall to the ground or the deceased himself slipped on one of the rungs or missed his step and thereby caused the ladder to shift and both he and the ladder fell together. It may also well be that the deceased may have lost his grip on the ladder, and fell, and in so falling caused the ladder also to fall from its position.
 
 
 
The trial judge however held that in the circumstances the possibility of this ladder slipping while in use was always present and could have been foreseen and that in the circumstances it was reasonably practical for the appellant`s who could have foreseen the contingency of an accident by reason of the possibility of this ladder slipping while someone was using it, to provide a safer means of access to the roof of the substation by taking some action, the least of which was to detail a person to hold on to the bottom of the ladder to prevent it moving or slipping while any person went up or down the ladder.
The question is what is the law to be applied to the facts of this case and the findings of the trial judge. In 
 Paris v Stepney Borough Council 
[1951] 1 All ER 43 at p 49, Lord Normand approved and applied the observations of Lord Dunedin in 
 Morton v 
 
 William Dixon 
,
 Ltd 
 1909 SC 807 at p 809: 
 
Where the negligence of the employer consists of what I may call a fault of omission, I think it is absolutely necessary that the proof of that fault of omission should be one of two kinds, either - to show that the thing which he did not do was a thing which was commonly done by other persons in like circumstances, or - to show that it was a thing which was so obviously wanted that it would be folly in any one to neglect to provide it.
 
 
 
Lord Normand after quoting Lord Dunedin continued: 
 
The rule is stated with all the Lord President`s trenchant lucidity. It contains an emphatic warning against a facile finding that a precaution is necessary when there is no proof that it is one taken by other persons in like circumstances, but it does not detract from the test of the conduct and judgment of the reasonable and prudent man. If there is proof that a precaution is usually observed by other persons, a reasonable and prudent man will follow the usual practice in like circumstances. Failing such proof the test is whether the precaution is one which the reasonable and prudent man would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it.
 
 
 
Applying the test laid down by Lord Normand, can the facts of the present case justify a finding that a precaution against the ladder slipping when in use was necessary where there is no evidence at all that it is one taken by other persons in like circumstances? In my opinion clearly not.
Then, again applying the test laid down by Lord Normand, can the facts justify a finding that this precaution was one which the appellants, as reasonable and prudent employers, would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it or that it was unreasonable or imprudent to omit it (see the observations of Lord Porter and Lord Cohen in 
 Morris v 
 
 West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
[1956] 1 All ER 385 at pp 395 and 402). The trial judge stated the question to be simply whether the employers had provided the employee with a safe means of access to his place of work as is reasonably practical having regard to the particular circumstances of this case.
In my opinion the trial judge should have applied the test laid down by Lord Normand or this test as explained in the later case of 
 Morris v 
 
 West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
.Applying this test, can it be said that the respondents have established, for the burden of proof is on the respondents, that the appellants had omitted a precaution against this ladder slipping which they, as reasonable and prudent employers, would think so obvious that it was folly to omit it or should have thought so obvious that it was unreasonable or imprudent to omit it? The answer to this question is entirely a matter of evaluation to be placed on facts found by the trial judge and I have no doubt that this question must be answered against the respondents. It seems to me, taking into consideration the degree of risk of accident, the degree of injury likely to result from a fall, the height of the ladder, the nature of the work the employee was employed to do, the experience of the employee, the factors in the particular circumstances of this case are such that no reasonable and prudent employer would have thought it was so obvious to take a precaution against the ladder slipping that it was either folly to omit it or it was unreasonable or imprudent to omit it.
What are the facts? The deceased was a mason, having been employed as such by the appellants for over two years. His work entails climbing up and down ladders. The height he had to climb was of the region of nine feet. If he fell off the ladder he would fall at most nineteen and possibly nine feet. He had the free use of both hands. A reasonable or prudent employer could reasonably expect that the deceased, as any prudent person would do, before using the ladder would test it to find out if it was in a firm position. In my judgment, all these factors when taken into consideration point to only one conclusion namely, that if the ladder slipped from its position thereby causing the deceased to fall when ascending or descending the ladder, it could not be held in law that his employers were negligent.
In any event, on the evidence the trial judge was unable to determine whether the deceased`s fall from the ladder was caused by the ladder slipping from its position because it had not been firmly secured. The trial judge, having found four possibilities in the passage of his judgment which I have earlier set out, should, in my judgment, as a matter of law, have dismissed the action on the ground that the respondents had failed to prove, as they had alleged in their pleadings, that the ladder slipped while the deceased was descending it, thereby causing the deceased to fall. In other words the respondents had failed to prove that the deceased`s death was attributable to the negligence of the appellants. In this connection it is pertinent to observe that at no stage of the proceedings did the respondents rely on the principle or rule of res ipsa loquitur and I do not therefore have to consider it.
For all these reasons I am impelled to the conclusion - though with regret - that the appeal must succeed with costs here and below.

These proceedings arise out of an accident which occurred on 10 July 1966, at the junction of Dunearn and Whitley Roads between a motor lorry driven by the first defendant and a taxi, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, driven by the second defendant.
The taxi was proceeding along Dunearn Road towards the city while the motor lorry was travelling along Whitley Road in the direction of Dunearn Road intending to proceed across it and over the bridge which spans the canal between Dunearn and Bukit Timah Roads and on into Stevens Road which is in effect a continuation of Whitley Road.
The accident occurred in broad daylight on a Sunday morning at about 7.30am.
This entire junction, ie the Dunearn/ Whitley Road junction and the Bukit Timah/ Stevens Road junction, is controlled by traffic lights.
Both the first defendant and the plaintiff said that the traffic lights at the Dunearn/Whitley Road junction appeared to be in order and each of them maintained that as they reached the junction on courses at right angles to each other the lights controlling their respective entries on to and across the junction were green and in favour of each of them. The taxi driver (the second defendant) was not called as Mr Hilborne who appeared for him elected to call no evidence and took the stand that no prima facie case of negligence had been made out against his client.
The independent police evidence established quite clearly that at the material time the traffic lights controlling the entire junction were defective and not functioning properly. Apart from the other police evidence there was the evidence of police constable Say Lip Buck who said that as he was returning to his barracks at Wayang Satu after coming off duty at Orchard Road Police Station he noticed that the traffic lights were out of order. This was about 7am, some half an hour prior to the accident. The other police officers said that the traffic lights were still out of order after the accident.
I find as a fact that at the material time the traffic lights were defective and not working properly at the junction.
The evidence established that the traffic lights facing traffic approaching the junction from Whitley Road changed from green to amber and then back to green again with no red light appearing at all. The traffic lights facing traffic approaching the junction down Dunearn Road changed correctly from green to amber and then to red in their proper sequence but the changes were at a very fast rate and not at their normal speed.
According to a police corporal who was at the scene after the accident, and whose evidence I have no hesitation in accepting, at various stages during this malfunctioning of the traffic lights at the junction the lights controlling the traffic in both direction would be showing green for brief periods at short intervals.
What then are the principles of the law of negligence applicable to these findings of fact?
Mr Yap for the first defendant asked me to say that in these circumstances there is no negligence attributable to either defendant and the liability for the accident must rest with the traffic authorities for having a faulty traffic lighting control system in operation. He invoked in aid the case of 
 Joseph Eve Ltd 
v 
 Reeves 
[1938] 2 All ER 115 where the Court of Appeal considered the application of the principles of the law of negligence to crossings controlled by traffic lights.
But that was a case of a motor vehicle entering a crossing against the appropriate traffic lights when they were showing red and the Court of Appeal held that a motorist entering a crossing when the appropriate lights were green in his favour owed no duty to traffic entering the crossing in disobedience to the lights beyond a duty that if he in fact saw such traffic he ought to take all reasonable steps to avoid a collision. As MacKinnon LJ pointed out at p 125: 
 
If, as the judge found, the light Reeves approached was green before he reached it, he was prima facie entitled to consider himself as on the open thoroughfare, and to go forward, without any apprehension that, in breach of the prohibition from the red light, the appellants` van or any other on the crossing would be intruding upon the thoroughfare that was closed to it. As Reeves was entitled to be without such apprehension, I do not think it could be said that he was doing anything negligent in going freely forward, when he was unable, by reason of the traffic which he was passing on his near side, to see into Lambeth Road upon that side.
 
 
 
It is perhaps not unworthy of note that all three members of the Court of Appeal felt some doubt as to whether, if they had been trying the case they would have arrived at the same conclusions of fact as did the trial judge.
Be that as it may, it is not this case where the appropriate lights relating to both defendants were faulty. In the view I take to say, as I understood Mr Yap to do, that because both traffic lights were not functioning properly or were even showing green at the material time that that absolves the defendants from all blame is to take a too superficial and a too simplified view of the matter. It is necessary, I think, to examine the situation closer in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.
That the traffic lights controlling the entire junction were defective and not functioning properly was palpably obvious to anyone approaching it be he pedestrian or motorist. The police officers who arrived at the scene had no difficulty in noticing this state of affairs and in fact one of them, police constable Buck, to whose evidence I have had occasion to refer, said that on his arrival because of the faulty traffic lights cars, to use his own words, were all tangled up at the Bukit Timah/Stevens Road junction.
A situation had therefore arisen which called for the exercise of the utmost care and caution.
If the defendants had been keeping any or any proper look out they must, in the view I take, have seen that their appropriate traffic lights were not functioning properly and were out of order which should have at once put them on their guard and warned them of the danger of proceeding across the junction until they were satisfied that it was safe to do so.
So, far from this object being achieved, they blithely carried on regardless apparently of any traffic approaching them on a course which must inevitably lead to a collision.
Not only were the traffic lights at the junction visible from a long way off in either direction but also traffic approaching it down Dunearn Road could clearly be seen for a considerable distance by motorists approaching it along Whitley Road and vice versa
 . 
There was nothing to impede the view of either of the defendants.
The remarkable feature of the first defendant`s evidence was that he only noticed the traffic lights first when he was but 15 feet from the junction. I do not accept or believe this evidence. Even more astonishing was his statement that as the lights were green he accelerated his lorry to cross the junction and it was not until he had actually proceeded some 15 feet across it (i.e. into Dunearn Road) that he first became aware of a vehicle bearing down on him from his right.
He did not even see it but said he heard a sound of a strong blast of wind - like the sound of oncoming vehicle. He maintained he applied his brakes, although no brake marks were discernible on the road surface and swerved to the left. The damage to the vehicles clearly points to the fact that it was the first defendant`s lorry which hit the near side of the taxi - the front near side door of the taxi being displaced and the rear near side door dented.
I did not have the advantage of hearing the second defendant`s version of the accident as he was not called for the reasons I have stated. The plaintiffs evidence added very little to the picture but he was merely a passenger that is perhaps not surprising. He also failed to see the lorry until it was inside the junction and almost on top of him.
Another extraordinary feature of the case was that the question of the traffic lights being defective was first raised, so it would appear, at the trial and then by the first defendant`s counsel in cross-examination of a police corporal called by the plaintiff. Mr Yap also called further police evidence as to the lights being out of order and this despite the fact that his client maintained that they were in order.
Neither of the defendants said a word about it in their police reports or in their pleadings although their attention was specifically drawn to the matter by the police corporal who arrived on the scene shortly after the accident occurred.
Both the defendants, in my judgment, were guilty of negligence in failing to keep any or any proper look out and in failing to drive their respective vehicles with that degree of care and caution which the circumstances of the case obviously required and the situation demanded.
The further question which arises is as to the degree of their culpability. In my view the greater blame is attachable to the first defendant. He was proceeding from a minor road out on to a one way major road which takes virtually the whole of the city bound traffic coming from north of the junction.
He was not concerned therefore with any traffic coming from his left but only from his right to which it was his duty to give way and on his own showing he never saw the taxi until the collision had to all intents and purposes taken place.
The second defendant, on the other hand, was travelling down this one way major road and whatever the situation which arose would anticipate traffic on his left giving way if a collision appeared imminent by the two vehicles keeping on their respective courses. The second defendant did apply his brakes as the 29 feet seven inch brake marks on the road surface clearly indicate. I consider that the rapid changing of his appropriate traffic lights albeit in proper sequence should have been almost as effective a warning that something was wrong as the absence of any red light showing should have been to the first defendant.
Giving the best consideration I can to the materials before me I apportion the blame as to 75% on the first defendant and 25% on the second defendant.
I now proceed to assess the damages to which, in my view, the plaintiff is entitled. He has undoubtedly suffered a very severe injury - a compound fracture dislocation of the left elbow joint known as a 
 Monteggia 
fracture. It is considered one of the most serious injuries that can occur in the elbow joint because the complete mechanism of the joint is disrupted. The plaintiff was admitted to hospital on the day of the accident. The fracture was reduced by the insertion of a 
 Kirscher 
wire to exert traction and a plaster was applied overall to maintain position. The reduction turned out to be unsatisfactory and a further operation had to be undertaken. This again was unsatisfactory and a still further operation became necessary in which a 
 Steiman`s Pin 
was inserted down the length of the ulnar to maintain its position.
The plaintiff has undergone considerable pain and suffering over a long period due to the injury and the recurrent operations necessary to get some kind of use back in his elbow at least to be able to use his hand. His range of movement is severely restricted as I was able to observe from a practical illustration which Mr Gawne the Senior Government Orthopaedic Surgeon got the plaintiff to give me. He has already developed osteoarthritis in the elbow joint which will get worse with age and the pain will increase. According to Mr Gawne it may well be that later on it will become necessary to immobilize the elbow joint and render it rigid. In all the circumstances I consider a sum of $13,000 to be a fair and reasonable award for his pain and suffering and loss of amenities.
There remains to consider the plaintiff`s loss of future earnings. This is always a difficult matter to determine. The plaintiff is now quite incapable of returning to his former work which was that of a labourer engaged in heavy labour. He is restricted now to sedentary or light work such as a watchman or a lift attendant work which does not entail lifting of weights.
His average monthly earnings were $180 a month.
As a result of the accident he was discharged from his government employment on 1 October 1967 and since then has been unemployed despite attempts to find a job. He is now 43 years of age. Despite the somewhat gloomy view which Mr Cashin paints of the labour market I think it would be wrong for the plaintiff to look upon himself as unemployable although I appreciate with his arm in the state it is, it will be difficult to obtain employment and may take some considerable time.
Taking into consideration all the various factors and contingencies I consider a reasonable sum to award for loss of future earnings is $15,000.
For loss of earnings to date claimed as special damages I award $2,000.
This brings the total damages awarded to $30,000.
There will accordingly be judgment for the plaintiff for $30,000 and costs.

On 20 October 1965 the appellants were convicted in the High Court of Singapore under the Penal Code of the murder of three civilians and sentenced to death. Their appeals to the Federal Court of Malaysia were dismissed on 5 October 1966 and they now appeal by special leave.
On 10 March 1965 at 3.07pm an explosion took place in a building called MacDonald House in Orchard Road, one of the main streets of Singapore. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp occupied part of the building. Other parts were occupied by other persons including the Australian High Commission.
Just before the explosion took place, a witness at the trial said he saw a Malayan Airways canvas travelling bag on the floor of the mezzanine floor. Smoke was coming from the bag and he heard a hissing noise. The explosion killed two girl secretaries employed by the bank and injured a driver who died two days later. The appellants were charged with the murder of these three persons.
Later examination of the building showed that the explosive used was 20 to 25 lbs of nitroglycerine.
Three days later, at about 8am, on 13 March, the appellants were rescued from the sea some distance from Singapore by bumboat man. He saw them in the sea clinging to a plank. The second appellant told him that he and the first appellant were fishermen and had been fishing when their boat had been capsized by another boat. He swore that neither of the appellants was wearing uniform and that one of them was bare bodied and wearing a pair of darkish trousers and the other a sports shirt and pair of long trousers.
A marine police boat came up and the appellants were taken on board it. The police officer dressed as the bumboat man had said and that they had no identification papers. He said that they told him that they were fishermen. The appellants were taken to the marine police station. The police sergeant at the station said that they told him they came from Indonesia and had been fishing. He too said that they were dressed as the bumboat man had said.
Later that morning the appellants were seen by an inspector of police. He gave evidence that the first appellant told him that he was a fisherman and that the second appellant said that he was a farmer. He also said that they were dressed as the bumboat man had said.
Evidence was also given that when they were admitted to person they were dressed in this fashion and not in uniform. In prison they were allowed to mix with Indonesian prisoners some of whom were wearing jungle green uniform. After that the appellants were seen in uniform.
At 1.25pm on 13 March Inspector Hill interviewed the first appellant and after cautioning him put a number of questions to him. The first appellant told him that he had come from Java and had come to Singapore at about 11am on 10 March; that after he and the second appellant had had their lunch, they had gone into a building and up some steps and that they had each placed a bundle containing explosives on the steps before reaching the first floor; that the second appellant had lit the fuse and that they had then left the building. He said that this had happened at about 3pm.
At 2.35pm the same day the first appellant was charged with the murder of the three persons killed by the explosion. He was again cautioned and he then made a statement saying that he had come to Singapore at about 11am on 10 March, that he had gone with the second appellant to look for a target, that he and the second appellant had placed `two bundles of explosives on stairs before reaching the first floor`, that the second appellant had lit the fuse and that after that they left and taken a bus.
In neither of these statements did the first appellant claim to be member of the Indonesian Armed Forces.
At about 4.20pm Assistant Superintendent Khosa interviewed the second appellant at the marine police station. In answer to questions put to him after caution, he said that he had come to Singapore on 10 March with the first appellant, that after lunch they had gone to a building and placed two bundles on a staircase, that he had lit the fuse at about 3pm, and that after leaving the building he had got on a bus. Later that day he was charged with the murders and after caution, he made a statement repeating what he had already said and also saying that he had come to Singapore on the instructions of `Kommando Operasi Tertinggi` and that his instructions were as a sworn soldier to carry a parcel and light it `at the electric power station ... or any other building`.
At 6.15pm, the first appellant had an interview with Mr Yeo, then fourth magistrate. He told him that he was a member of the Indonesian Army and that he had come to give the magistrate information with regard to the duties he had been instructed to perform by his superiors. After the magistrate had satisfied himself that this appellant wished to make a voluntary statement, what the appellant said was recorded. In substance he repeated what he had already said but he added that he had been instructed by Lieutenant Paulus Subekti to cause trouble in Singapore.
On 18 March the appellants were picked out at an identification parade by a bus conductor. His bus had gone down Orchard Road just before the explosion and he said that at the traffic lights just beyond the bus stop by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank the appellants boarded his bus. He said that they were then dressed in civilian clothes.
The appellants were tried in the High Court by FA Chua J sitting alone in accordance with the provisions of the Emergency (Criminal Trials) Regulations 1964.
The first point taken by Mr Le Quesne on behalf of the appellants was that these Regulations were inconsistent with the Federal Constitution of Malaysia and so had no validity. In March 1965 Singapore was part of the Federation. The Regulations, inter alia, dispensed with the requirement of a preliminary inquiry before trail, restricted the granting of bail and made provision for trial by a judge sitting alone.
Article 8(1) of the Constitution provides that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law. Mr Le Quesne contended that the Emergency Regulations amounted to a denial of the equal protection of the law since persons tried under the Regulations were deprived of the benefits of the procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code and so were treated not equally but differently from persons tried under that Code. He therefore contended that they were inconsistent with the Constitution and so invalid.
By art 150 of the Constitution the Yang di-Pertuan Agong was given power in certain circumstances to issue a proclamation of emergency, and, while such a proclamation was in force, Parliament was given power by art 150(5) notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, to make laws with respect to any matter if it appeared to Parliament that the law was required by reason of the emergency. Article 150(6) provided that subject to art 150(6A) (which is not relevant to this case), no provision of any Act of Parliament so passed should be invalid no the ground of inconsistency with any provision of the Constitution.
Pursuant to the powers given by this article, the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act 1964 was passed. This gave the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wide powers of making regulations, which he considered desirable or expedient for securing public safety, the defence of the Federation, the maintenance of public order and of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.
The Act expressly stated that the Essential Regulations might provide for amending, suspending or modifying any written law, and by s 2(4) declared that the Essential Regulations should have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any written law other than the Act itself or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any written law other than the Act itself.
Mr Le Quesne did not seek to challenge the validity of the Act. He contended that the words `written law` in the Act were not, despite the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance 1948, to be interpreted as including the Constitution. He pointed out that art 150(5) of the Constitution itself distinguished between the Constitution and written law.
In the Ordinance it is stated that `written law` means all Acts of Parliament, Ordinances and Enactments in force in the Federation or any part thereof and all subsidiary legislation made thereunder and includes the Federal Constitution.
The Emergency (Criminal Trials) Regulations 1964 were made under the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act 1964 and if it were the case that the Regulations were inconsistent with the Constitution, nevertheless if `written law` in s 2(4) of the Act includes the Constitution, the validity of the Regulations cannot be impeached.
Their Lordships can find nothing in the context which requires them to give a different meaning to the words `written law` than that prescribed by the Ordinance and they do not consider that the words of art 150(5) `any provision of this Constitution or of any written law` are any indication that the words `written law` in the Act were intended to have any different meaning to that stated in the Ordinance.
For these reasons their Lordships are unable to accept this contention.
At the opening of the trial counsel for the appellants asserted that they were both members of the Indonesian armed forces and that they were entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 1949. In 1962 the Geneva Conventions Act was passed in the Federation of Malaya to give effect to this, among other, Conventions.
Section 4(1) of this Act provides, inter alia, that the court before which a protected prisoner of war is brought up for trial for any offence shall not proceed with the trial until it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that a notice giving the full name and description of the accused and other details about him including the offence with which he is charged and the court before which the trial is to take place and the time and place of trial has been served not less than three weeks previously on the protecting power and on the accused and the prisoner`s representative.
In support of this contention the first appellant gave evidence that he was a member of the Indonesian armed forces, a corporal in the `Korps Kommando Operasi`, a regular force. He swore that when they had been rescued from the sea, he and the second appellant had been wearing uniform. He said that his and the second appellant`s identity cards had been in plastic bags which were lost when their sampan sank. The second appellant also gave evidence that he was a member of the Korps Kommando Operasi and that he was warning military uniform when he was rescued. He also said that he had not been allowed by his commander to wear his identity disk. After hearing evidence from the bumboat man and the other witnesses who had seen the appellants shortly after their rescue as to the appellants` clothing, the learned judge ruled that the appellants were not entitled to the status of prisoners of war. He said that the evidence was overwhelming that when they were rescued they were not wearing uniform. He also found that they first claimed to be fishermen while later on one claimed to be a farmer. He held that they had failed to discharge the onus of proving that they were members of the regular armed forces of Indonesia and that he had no doubt that they were not members of the regular armed forces of Indonesia.
He added that if they were members of the Indonesian armed forces, they were not in his opinion entitled to the status of prisoners of war. `In my view`, he said, `members of enemy armed forces who are combatants and who come here with the assumption of the semblance of peaceful pursuits divesting themselves of the character of appearance of soldiers and are captured, such persons are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war.`
After the hearing of the appeal by the Federal Court affidavits were filed on behalf of the appellants sworn by two officers of the Indonesian Army, stating that the appellants had since March 1965 been members of the Indonesian armed forces and serving in units under the `Kommando Mandala Siaga` and documents purporting to be their personal military records were produced.
None of this information was obtainable during confrontation between Indonesia and Singapore or prior to the hearing of the appeal by the Federal Court.
At the trial both appellants retracted the statements they had made. They said that they had left Indonesia on 13th March and that their sampan had sunk while they were on their was to a place in Singapore to collect a boat.
Mr Le Quesne argued that the information obtained from Indonesia showed that the judge`s conclusion that the appellants were not members of the Indonesian armed forces was wrong and, having found that they were not telling the truth about that, he consequently rejected their alibi defence.
Even if it be the case that they were at the time members of the Indonesian armed forces and that the judge`s collusion that they were not wrong, there were in their Lordships` opinion ample grounds for the rejection of the alibi defence. Their Lordships see no reason to suppose that the learned judge`s conclusion materially contributed to the rejection of the alibi defence which conflicted with the statements that each of appellants had made immediately after capture.
Mr Le Quesne further argued that as the appellants had retracted their statements, they should not under the law of Malaysia have been admitted in evidence unless there was some evidence to corroborate them. This argument was advanced before and rejected by the Federal Court. In support of it certain Indian cases were cited. The Federal Court adopted the view of the Malayan Union Court of Appeal in 
 Yap Sow Keong 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 90
  where it was said that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth; and where the court said it did not agree with the Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on his retracted confession, there must be corroborative evidence to support it.
In their Lordships` opinion if, contrary to the view of the Federal Court, corroborative evidence is required, it was present in this case. The evidence of the bus conductor which was accepted by Chua J corroborates the statements made by each of the appellants that when they left the building they got on a bus.
Mr Le Quesne also argued that the appellants were prisoners of war within the Geneva Convention and that the requirements of that Convention were not complied with, with the result that there was a mistrial.
Article 2 of the Convention provides that it shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognised by one of them. At the commencement of the trial State Counsel submitted that there was no state of war or armed conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia at the time but when FA Chua J said that in his view there was a state of armed conflict, State Counsel did not pursue the matter. The first question dealt with by the Federal Court was whether or not the Convention was applicable to Singapore. That court declined to decide the question which, they said, had not been raised before the trial judge and that court dealt with the appeal on the assumption that the Convention was applicable to Singapore. Mr French for the respondent sought to argue before the board that it was not but as this question had not been raised at the trial, he was not given leave to do so.
The appeal was therefore heard on the basis that the Convention applied to Singapore and that at the time there was a state of armed conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia.
The issue to be determined is whether in the circumstances of this case, the appellants were entitled to the protection of the Convention. The view of Chua J on this has already been stated. The Federal Court held that there could not `be the least doubt that the explosion at MacDonald House was not only an act of sabotage but one totally unconnected with the necessities of war`. They went on to say: 
 
It seems to us clear beyond doubt that under international law a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict who, out of uniform and in civilian clothing, sets off explosives in the territory of the other party to the conflict in a non-military building in which civilians are doing work unconnected with any war effort forfeits his right on capture to be treated as a prisoner of war.
 
 
 
They consequently held that the appellants were not prisoners of war within the meaning of the Convention.
It is first necessary to consider the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907. The first section of those Regulations is headed `Of Belligerents` and art 1 is the first article in that section and in the Chapter headed `The Status of Belligerents`. It reads as follows: 
 
The laws, rights, and duties of war apply not only to armies, but also to militia and volunteer corps fulfilling the following conditions:
 
 
 
(1) To be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
(2) To have a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance; 
(3) To carry arms openly; and 
(4) To conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.
 
 
 
In countries where militia or volunteer corps constitute the army, or form part of it, they are included under the denomination `army`.
 
 
 
Chapter II of this section is headed `Prisoners of War`. The Regulations do not in terms say that a person with the status of belligerent is on capture entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war but that is clearly implied. As Dr Jean Pictet said at p 46 in the 
 Commentary on the Geneva Convention 
 published by the Red Cross in 1960: 
 
Once one is accorded the status of a belligerent, on is bound by the obligations of the laws of war, and entitled to the rights which they confer. The most important of these is the right, following capture, to be recognised as a prisoner of war.
 
 
 
Article 29 of the Regulations reads as follow: 
 
A person can only be considered a spy when, acting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Accordingly, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information, are not considered spies ...
 
 
 
Article 31 says: 
 
A spy who, after rejoining the army to which he belongs, is subsequently captured by the enemy, is treated as a prisoner of war ...
 
 
 
These two articles show that soldiers who spy and are captured when wearing a disguise are not entitle to be treated as prisoners of war. In 
 War Rights on Land 
 by Mr JM Spaight published in 1911 the following appears at p 203: 
 
The spy is usually a soldier who has abandoned the recognised badge of his craft and his nation and adopted some disguise to shield his real character and intent. He has thrown away the insignia of his status, the evidence of his brotherhood among fighting men ... The spy in modern war is usually a soldier who dons civilian dress, or the uniform of the enemy, or of a neutral country ...
 
 
 
Article 4 of the Geneva Convention added a number of new categories of persons entitled to treatment as prisoners of war. It is only necessary to refer to art 4A, sub-paras (1), (2) and (3). They reads as follows: 
 
4A Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:
(1) members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces; 
(2) members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organised resistance movements, belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even of this territory is occupied, providing that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organised resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions: 
(a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; 
(b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance; 
(c) that of carrying arms openly; 
(d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war; 
(3) members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognised by the Detaining Power.
 
 
 
The wording of sub-paras ((1) and (2) is clearly modelled on art 1 of the Hague Regulations. The conditions which have to be fulfilled by militias and volunteer corps not forming part of the army or armed forces are the same.
There is no indication in the Convention that its intention was to extend the protection given to soldiers beyond that given by the Regulations; and in the 
 Manual of Military Law 
 Pt III (1958) in para 6 it is stated: 
 
Should 
 regular
 combatants to comply with these four conditions, they may in certain cases become unprivileged belligerents. This would mean that they would not be entitled to the status of prisoners of war upon their capture. Thus regular members of the armed forces who are caught as spies are not entitled to be treated as prisoners of war.
 
 
 
On this basis the conclusion must be drawn that it does not suffice in every case to establish membership of an armed force to become entitled on capture to treatment as a prisoner of war.
In neither the Hague Regulations nor in the Geneva Convention is it expressly stated that a member of the armed forces has to be wearing uniform when captured to be entitled to be so treated. In the case of certain militias and volunteer corps certain conditions have to be fulfilled in relation to those bodies for a member of them to be entitled to treatment as a prisoner of war. It is not, however, stated that such a member must at the time of his capture be wearing `a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance`.
International law, however, recognises the necessity of distinguishing between belligerents and peaceful inhabitants. `The separation of armies and peaceful inhabitants`, wrote Spaight in 
 War Rights on Land 
, supra, at p 37 `is perhaps the greatest triumph of international law. Its effect in mitigating the evil of war has been incalculable`. Although para 86 of the 
 Manual of Military Law, 
supra, recognises that the distinction has become increasingly blurred, it is still the case that each of these classes has distinct rights and duties.
For the `fixed distinctive sign to be recognisable at a distance` to serve any useful purpose, it must be worn by members of the militias or volunteer corps to which the four conditions apply. It would be anomalous if the requirement for recognition of a belligerent with its accompanying right to treatment as a prisoner of war, only existed in relation to members of such forces and there was no such requirement in relation to members of the armed forces. All four conditions are present in relation to the armed forces of a country or, as Professor Lauterpacht in 
 Oppenheim`s 
 
 International Law 
 (7th Ed) Vol II at p 25 calls them `the organised armed forces`. In 
 War Rights on Land 
 , supra, Mr Spaight says at p 56 in relation to art 1 of the Regulations: 
 
The four conditions must be united to secure recognition of belligerent status.
 
 
 
Pictet at p 48 of the 
 Commentary on the Geneva Convention, 
supra, says: 
 
The qualification of belligerent is subject to these four conditions being fulfilled.
 
 
 
And at p 63 in relation to sub-para (3) of art 4A: 
 
These `regular armed forces` have all the material characteristics and all the attributes of armed forces in the sense of sub-para (1): they wear uniform, they have an organised hierarchy and they known and respect the laws and customs of war.
 
 
 
In relation to troops landed behind enemy lines, Professor Lauterpacht at p 259 of 
 Oppenheim, 
supra, says that so long as they: 
 
... are members of the organised forces of the enemy and wear uniform, they are entitled to be treated as regular combatants even if they operate singly.
 
 
 
Thus considerable importance attaches to the wearing of uniform or a fixed distinctive sign when engaging in hostilities. In an article in the 
 British Year Book of International law 
 1951 by Major RA Baxter entitled `So-called `unprivileged Belligerency; Spies, Guerillas and Saboteurs` the author at p 343 says: 
 
The correct legal formulation is, it is submitted, that armed and unarmed hostilities, wherever occurring, committed by persons other than those entitled to be treated as prisoners of war or peaceful civilians merely deprive such individuals of a protection they might otherwise enjoy under international law and place them virtually at the power of the enemy. `Unlawful belligerency` is actually `unprivileged belligerency`. International law deliberately neglects to protect unprivileged belligerents because of the danger their acts present to their opponents. The peril to the enemy inherent in attempts to obtain secret information or to sabotage his facilities and in attacks by persons whom he often cannot distinguish from the peaceful population is sufficient to require the recognition of wide retaliatory powers. As a rough-and-ready way of distinguishing open warfare and dangerous dissimulation, the character of the clothing worn by the accused has assumed major importance. The soldier in uniform or the member of the volunteer corps with his distinctive sign have a protected status upon capture, whilst other belligerents not so identified do not benefit from any comprehensive scheme of protection.
 
 
 
In his 
 Legal Controls of International Conflict 
 (1954) Professor Julius Stone at p 549 in relation to the distinction between privileged or `protected` or `lawful` and unprivileged or `unprotected` or `unlawful` belligerents or combatants, says: 
 
The latter distinction draws the line between those personnel who, on capture, are entitled under international law to certain minimal treatment as prisoners of war, and those not entitled to such protection. `Non-combatants` who engage in hostilities are one of the classes deprived of such protection, but there are also many others. These include notably military personnel who conduct hostilities without conforming to the requirements of art 1 of the Hague Regulations (`guerillas` in the strict sense), spies, and saboteurs. Such unprivileged belligerent, though not 
 condemned
 by international law, are not protected by it, but are left to the discretion of the belligerent threatened by their activities.
 
 
 
At p 563 he says: 
 
It is clear, for example, that the donning of disguise by military personnel (for instance of prisoners of war for purposes of escape) does not destroy their status as privileged belligerents.
 
 
 
In a footnote to p 563 he says: 
 
... the greater difficulty of the position of `evaders` is a practical one, namely, that the circumstances place upon them the burden, a very heavy one, except in cases of escaped prisoners of war, of showing that they are not spies or saboteurs.
 
 
 
This seems to indicate that he regarded the donning of civilian clothes by soldiers to commit sabotage as depriving them of the status of privileged belligerents.
In this appeal it is not necessary to attempt to define all the circumstances in which a person coming within the terms of art 1 of the Regulations and of art 4 of the Convention as a member of an army or armed force ceases to enjoy the right to be treated as a prisoner of war. The question to be decided is whether members of such a force who engage in sabotage while in civilian clothes and who are captured so dressed are entitled to be treated as protected by the Convention.
In para 96 of the 
 Manual of Military Law, 
supra, it is stated that: 
 
Members of the armed forces caught in civilian clothing while acting as saboteurs in enemy territory are in a position analogous to that of spies.
 
 
 
and in para 331: 
 
If they are disguised in civilian clothing or in the uniform of the army by which they are caught or that of an ally of that army, they are in the same position as spies. If caught in their own uniform, they are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war.
 
 
 
In 
 The Law of Land Warfare 
 (1956), the American equivalent to the 
 Manual of Military Law 
, the following paragraph appears: 
 
74 Necessity of uniform. Members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces lose their right to be treated as prisoners of war whenever they deliberately conceal their status in order to pass behind the military lines of the enemy for the purpose of gathering military information or for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property. Putting on civilian clothes or the uniform of the enemy are examples of concealment of the status of a member of the armed forces. <6>
 In Ex parte Quirin
 (1942) 63 S Ct 1; 317 US 1; 87 Law Ed 3 the United States Supreme Court had to consider motions for leave to file petitions for writs of habeas corpus. The case related to a number of Germans who during the course of the last war landed in uniform on the shores of the United States with explosives for the purpose of sabotage. On landing they put on civilian clothes. They were captured. In the course of delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, Stone CJ said at p 12:
 
 
 
The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war ...
 
 
 
and at p 15: 
 
By passing our boundaries for such purposes without uniform or other emblem signifying their belligerent status, or by discarding that means of identification after entry, such enemies become unlawful belligerents subject to trial and punishment.
 
 
 
In the light of the passages cited above, their Lordships are of the opinion that under international law it is clear that appellants, if they were members of the Indonesian armed forces, were not entitled to be treated on capture as prisoners of war under the Convention when they had landed to commit sabotage and had been dressed in civilian clothes both when they had placed the explosives and lit them and when they were arrested. In their opinion FA Chua J and the Federal Court were right in rejecting the appellants` plea on this ground.
Mr Le Quesne further contended that the appellants` act in placing the explosives was a legitimate act of war and that they could not therefore be tried for murder. The Federal Court in rejecting the appellants` plea, appear to have done so partly on the ground that placing the explosives in MacDonald House `a non-military building in which civilians are doing work unconnected with any war effort` was not a legitimate act of war. `The immunity of non-combatants from direct attack is one of the fundamental rules of the international law of war` and `non-combatants are not, under existing international law a legitimate military objective`: Professor Lauterpacht in 
 Oppenheim, 
supra, at pp 524 and 525.
At, if they were members of the Indonesian armed forces, in their Lordships` opinion, they forfeited their rights under the Convention by engaging in sabotage in civilian clothes, it is not necessary to consider whether they also forfeited them by breach of the laws and customs of war by their attack on a non-military building in which there were civilians. Having forfeited their rights, there was in their Lordships` view no room for the application of art 5 of the Convention and, not being entitled to protection under the Convention, the appellants` conviction for murder committed by them when dressed as civilians and within the jurisdiction of Singapore cannot be invalidated.
For these reasons, their Lordships were of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

Defective traffic lights at traffic junction

Whether driver knew or ought to known lights defective Â– Whether driver entering junction with lights in his favour required to provide for possibility of other traffic entering junction in disobedience of lights
 
On the morning of 10 July 1966 a Sunday, the plaintiff was a passenger in a taxi driven by the second defendant which was proceeding in a southerly direction along Dunearn Road, a one-way carriageway. At the same time the first defendant was driving a motor lorry laden with sand in a westerly direction along Whitley Road which was a dual carriageway. The two vehicles collided with each other in the middle of the junction of these two roads and as a result of the collision the plaintiff suffered a severe injury, namely a compound fracture dislocation of the left elbow joint. That junction is a controlled junction, controlled by traffic lights operating automatically.
The plaintiff commenced an action in the High Court of Singapore naming the driver of the motor lorry as the first defendant and the driver of the taxi in which he was travelling as the second defendant alleging that the collision was caused by the negligence of the first defendant and by the negligence of the second defendant or alternatively, by the negligence of one or other of them in the driving of their respective motor vehicles.
The particulars of negligence alleged against the lorry driver, the first defendant, in the statement of claim were as follows:
 
 
(a) Failing to keep any or any proper lookout. 
 
(b) Driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances. 
 
(c) Driving from a minor road on to a major road when it was unsafe so to do and without regard for traffic on the major road. 
 
(d) Failing to give any or any proper warning of his approach and of his intention to derive on to the said major road. 
 
(e) Failing to give way to vehicles travelling on his right. 
 
(f) Failing to apply his brakes in time or at all or so to steer or control his lorry as to avoid the said collision. 
 
(g) Driving against the traffic lights.
  
 
 
The particulars of negligence alleged against the taxi driver, the second defendant, in the statement of claim were as follows:
 
 
(a) Failing to keep any or any proper lookout. 
 
(b) Driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances. 
 
(c) Failing to give any or any proper warning of his approach. 
 
(d) Driving against the traffic lights. 
 
(e) Failing to apply his brakes in time or at all or so to steer or control his taxi as to avoid said collision.
  
 
 
The lorry driver, the first defendant, in his defence denied that the collision was caused by the alleged or any negligence on his part and pleaded that it was solely caused or contributed to by the negligence of the taxi driver, the second defendant, and adopted the particulars of negligence alleged against the second defendant in the plaintiff`s statement of claim. The first defendant also pleaded that the second defendant had failed to take any or any sufficient precautions in the safety of his taxi and his passengers therein when entering the said junction of Dunearn Road and Whitley Road.
The taxi driver, the second defendant, in his defence denied that the collision was caused by the alleged or any negligence on his part and pleaded that it was caused solely or alternatively contributed to by the negligence of the first defendant in the driving of his motor lorry, the particulars of negligence whereof being as alleged against the first defendant in the plaintiff`s statement of claim.
At the trial before Buttrose J the plaintiff, who was seated beside the second defendant, stated that approaching the junction he noticed nothing unusual about the traffic lights and they were showing green when the taxi entered the junction. He said that he first saw the traffic lights when he was 15 yards away. He first saw the lorry when it was very near the taxi and inside the intersection. He guessed the speed of the lorry at 40 miles per hour and the speed of the taxi also at 40 miles per hour.
A police officer was called by the plaintiff to give evidence as to the damage suffered by both vehicles but in cross-examination by counsel for the first defendant he said that when he was at the scene the traffic lights were defective in that the lights facing Whitley Road changed from green to amber and back to green without ever changing to red and that the lights facing Dunearn Road changed from green to amber to red very quickly. Finally, he said that at this junction the traffic lights both for Whitley Road and Dunearn Road traffic at one stage simultaneously showed green.
The first defendant, the lorry driver, said that he began to look at the traffic lights when he was 40 to 50 feet from the junction and they showed green. He slowed down a little as he approached the junction and when he was 15 feet from the junction the traffic lights were still at green. He then accelerated and when he was 12 feet inside the junction the collision occurred. At that time his speed was 15 miles per hour. There was no traffic jam at that time and there was no other traffic.
He called as a witness a police officer who came on the scene soon after the accident and who stated that he saw the traffic lights facing Whitley Road change from green to amber and then to green again.
The second defendant elected to call no evidence, submitting that on the evidence there was no case for him to answer.
Buttrose J held that both defendants were negligent and apportioned the blame as to 75% on the first defendant and as to 25% on the second defendant. In his judgment he said that: 
 
Both the defendants ... were guilty of negligence in failing to keep any or any proper look out and in failing to drive their respective vehicles with that degree of care and caution which the circumstances of the case obviously required and the situation demanded.
 
 
 
He found that the traffic lights controlling this junction were not functioning properly at the time of the collision and although he did not specifically find that both defendants knew that they were defective it is clear that he came to the conclusion that both defendants knew that the traffic lights were defective and knew in what manner they were defective. This is contained in that portion of his judgment in which he said: 
 
I consider that the rapid changing of his (the second defendant`s) appropriate traffic lights albeit in proper sequence should have been almost as effective a warning that something was wrong as the absence of any red light showing should have been to the first defendant.
 
 
 
Both defendants appealed and both contend at the hearing of the appeal that the trial judge`s findings that the traffic lights were defective at the time of the collision and that each of them knew the traffic lights were defective and knew the nature of the defect in relation to each of them were wrong and contrary to the evidence.
We are of the opinion that on the evidence it was open to the trial judge to find that at the time of the collision the traffic lights controlling this junction were defective and were defective in the manner described by the police witnesses. It does not follows, however, because they were defective, that the defendants knew that they were defective.
In our judgment there is no evidence that the lorry drive, the first defendant, knew that the traffic lights controlling his entry into this junction were defective. In fact the evidence appears to be all the other way. The first defendant stated that when he first saw the traffic light he was 40 to 50 feet from the junction and the lights were showing green. When he was 15 feet from the junction the lights were still green and he accelerated and entered the junction at a speed of 15 mils per hour. The police evidence is that the lights controlling Whitley Road traffic were normal except for the failure to change to red from amber.
The trial judge also found the first defendant negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out presumably because he never saw the other vehicle, the taxi, `until the collision had to all intents and purposes taken place`. The law in relation to junctions controlled by traffic lights is clear. The driver of a motor vehicle entering a cross-roads junction when the lights are green in his favour is entitled to assume that the traffic approaching the junction from his left or right would obey the red signal light prohibiting such traffic from entering the junction (see 
 Eva 
 
 v 
 
 Reeves 
 
[1938] 2 KB 393
). He is under no duty towards traffic entering the junction in disobedience to the red light to assume or to provide for the possibility of such entry. It follows that the trial judge was wrong in holding that the first defendant was negligent in failing to keep a proper look-out.
The trial judge also found it was `palpably obvious to any one approaching it be he pedestrian or motorist` that the traffic lights controlling the entire junction were defective and not functioning properly because the police officers who arrived at the scene had no difficulty in noticing that state of affairs and because earlier on cars were all tangled up at another parallel junction controlled by a similar set of traffic lights. We find great difficulty in understanding how the trial judge arrived at this finding as on the plaintiff`s own evidence he himself noticed nothing unusual about the lights. The real question to be decided on this aspect of the case was whether either of the defendants knew or ought to have known, if he had kept a proper look-out, that the lights controlling his entry into the junction were defective and not functioning properly.
In the case of the first defendant, on the evidence, it was impossible to say that it was palpably obvious to him, a motorist, that the lights controlling his entry into the junction were defective and not functioning properly. Nor was it possible, on the evidence, to say that if he had kept a proper look-out he would have seen or would have been aware that these lights were not functioning properly.
In the case of the second defendant, the evidence is different. The lights controlling his entry into the junction were changing rapidly, albeit in proper sequence, from green to amber to red to green to amber to red and so on. It may well be if there was sufficient evidence it could be held that had he kept a proper look-out in relation to the lights controlling his entry he would have noticed this malfunction and noticing this ought to have taken the necessary precautions when entering this cross-roads junction at a time when to his knowledge the lights controlling it were not functioning properly. He chose not to give evidence and there is therefore no evidence at all as to when he first looked at the lights when approaching the junction. On the other hand there is no evidence as to the extent of the malfunctioning of the lights controlling his entry into the junction. The only evidence is that the lights `changed rapidly` in its proper sequence. How rapid this change was at the material time no one knows and it would be idle and wrong to speculate. It was for the plaintiff to prove that the change was so rapid that the second defendant must have known the traffic lights controlling the junction were defective if he had kept a proper look-out. The case as pleaded by the plaintiff against him was in the usual common form and the case against him at the trial appeared to be that although he entered the cross-roads junction with the traffic lights in his favour he was driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances and failed to see the lorry, coming from his left, entering the junction at the same time in spite of the lights being against the lorry. On the pleadings and on the case as presented at the trial against the second defendant we are of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot succeed against him and the trial judge was wrong in holding him negligent and blameworthy to the extent of having to bear 25% of the blame for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.
The result is unfortunate but we have here a case where the plaintiff was alleging that either the lorry driver or the taxi driver or both were responsible for the accident. He had therefore to prove a state of facts from which the reasonable inference to be drawn was that prima facie one if not both drivers had been negligent before he is entitled to call on both defendants for an answer. To make a prima facie case he must prove facts from which in the absence of an explanation liability could properly be inferred. In the case of the taxi driver, the second defendant, in whose taxi he was at the time of the accident, his evidence proved that the second defendant was not to blame for the accident. In the case of the lorry driver, the first defendant, the evidence at the trial clearly established that no blame could be imputed to him for the accident.
For all these reasons the appeals of both defendants are allowed and in the result the judgment of Buttrose J is set aside with costs here and in the court below.

	HER HONOUR: The offender is before me for sentence following his conviction before a jury after trial on three counts in an indictment dated 3 May 2016. They are as follows:
	
	
	Count 1 - that between 1 March and 15 March 2015 he assaulted Voula Karamalakis thereby occasioning her actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Count 2 - that between 1 March and 15 March 2015 at Woolloomooloo he caused grievous bodily harm to Voula Karamalakis with the intention of causing her grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Count 3 - that on 3 April 2015 he assaulted Voula Karamalakis thereby causing her actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 3 are brought contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 and as such each carries the maximum penalty in this Court of 5 years imprisonment. They are both capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the jurisdictional limit would be terms of imprisonment of 2 years.
	
	
	Count 2 is brought contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 and as such carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	There are three other summary offences sent up to this Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as related offences for which I must sentence the offender. They are referred to as sequences 3, 4 and 5 and each of them is a charge of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. They are summary offences which each carry a maximum penalty of 2 years in the Local Court.
	
	
	The offender faced trial with a jury from 4 May 2016. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts on 9 May 2016. He has remained in custody bail refused since these verdicts. The context for these offences I accept is that the offender and the complainant were in a relationship at the relevant time, living in accommodation in Forbes Street, Woolloomooloo. They had been together since about May 2014 and had moved into the apartment in February 2015.
	
	
	Evidence given by the complainant at trial was that the relationship was dysfunctional. The jury’s verdicts I accept lead inevitably to a finding that in large part they accepted the complainant’s evidence. On that basis I accept that between February and April, whilst the complainant and offender were living together in this apartment in Woolloomooloo, the relationship was in fact dysfunctional and violent. The offender in fact gave evidence and denied all of this and specifically denied the charges and the allegations made against him by the complainant. Clearly enough, the jury must have rejected his evidence.
	
	
	I accept from the complainant’s evidence that over this two month period he was violent towards her, he was regularly under the influence of Xanax and alcohol and other drugs and that in particular ways he attempted to control her and restrict her movements. This included taking away her mobile phone, taking away her medication, not allowing her to leave the house without him, making her stay awake for some days, specifically before count 3 in the indictment, and similar matters. His behaviour towards her was not only violent but very controlling.
	
	
	The specific facts for count 1 are that on a day during the relevant period which eventually at trial, would appear to have been 6 March 2016, the offender and the complainant were in the apartment. The offender had called a girl on the telephone which provoked an argument between the two of them. There were three friends also with them, a woman and two men. The argument escalated to the stage where the complainant said she was leaving and the offender started hitting her. Specifically for this offence he hit her on her right cheek, just below her right eyeball, and I accept that she ended up on the floor. Three people who were there stood between him and the complainant and she then left with them. There was a photograph taken of her injuries some days afterwards which indicates there was still bruising around the right eye. It is a relatively serious example of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. As for all of these offences, it was a domestic violence related offence. It was committed on the complainant whilst she was in her own home and entitled to feel safe there. The injury itself is certainly not minimal for an injury capable of being defined as actual bodily harm. The assault appears to have occurred in a fit of jealously and was brazen enough for it to have been committed in front of others who were present.
	
	
	Count 2 is the most serious of the offences for sentence. It occurred the following day, again in the house. The complainant stayed away overnight after the first assault and came back the next day. There then ensued an argument between her and the offender, in which he accused her of infidelity overnight. Apparently without more, he then went to the knife block in the kitchen and took out one of the three smaller knives and approached the complainant. She ran to a couch in the apartment and curled up and he then stabbed her with the knife three times as she tried to avoid the attack. He stabbed her three times, she had three wounds, one to the right shoulder, one to the thigh and the third to her right calf. She was bleeding and the offender took off her clothes, ripped them up and used them to attempt to stop the bleeding. He did not offer any medical assistance for her, nor was any sought. When photographs were taken following the last of the offences, on
	
	
	3 April 2015 the scars were still evident. There were photographs of them tendered before the jury and evidence from the medical expert indicating that the scars were consistent with the history given by the complainant. They are far from being the most serious of injuries capable of falling within the definition of grievous bodily harm, but nonetheless there was still evidence of them by way of scarring when those photographs were taken.
	
	
	It must follow from the lack of medical attention and the fact that they were largely healed by the time those photographs were taken, that they were not significantly serious injuries, albeit amounting to grievous bodily harm. There is no evidence to indicate that they have done anything else other than continue to heal and there is no evidence of any ongoing disability with the complainant as a result of these wounds. Nonetheless this is a very serious offence.
	
	
	The offender, for no reason other than either real or feigned jealousy, because the complainant was away overnight, and for that in circumstances where she had escaped his violence the day before, fought with her and then stabbed her in her home three times. Objectively, it is a serious offence but it is below the mid-range in terms of objective seriousness for offences capable of being charged under this section, which of course covers a very broad range of factual circumstances. Nonetheless it is serious and must have been a matter that caused great concern to the complainant. By that stage, I accept that she felt like something of a captive which no doubt explains the fact that she took no immediate action following this particular offence.
	
	
	The relevant facts for count 3, the third offence, are that on 3 April in circumstances where there had been ongoing aggression and violence since the stabbing offence, but where the parties had remained together, they came back to their apartment after they had been to Hungry Jacks. The offender refused to buy food for the complainant. She came back to the apartment where he was and he hit her with the TV remote control in his hands. He hit her on the head and that caused her scalp to bleed. There was a photograph of that injury at trial indicating a laceration at the top of her head which was still bleeding when she was seen by the medical people the following day. I accept from the evidence that she gave, that as soon as she came back into her apartment that day she was grabbed by the accused who started to assault her, including the one large blow that caused the injury to her scalp, the subject matter of count 3.
	
	
	This too is a relatively serious example of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It is an actual bodily harm that is towards the top of the range of offences capable of falling within that definition, amounting as it does to an open laceration which caused bleeding. Again the factors of aggravation include the fact that it was a domestic relationship and it was committed in her own home, apparently as a result of a previous trivial argument between the offender and the complainant.
	
	
	Taken as a whole of course these are all serious offences. Regrettably the community at present is only too familiar with the very large number of domestic violence assaults that are occurring in the community, particularly those committed by men on women. The statistics indicate a number of women die each week as a result of domestic assaults. Sentences for offences involving domestic assaults should carry a very serious message to the community that these are not private matters, these are matters taken extremely seriously by the Courts, which will inevitably lead to long prison terms, particularly so where offences are as serious as that covered by count 2 here is concerned.
	
	
	The legislature has seen fit to fix a 25 year maximum penalty for this particular offence and where appropriate a standard non-parole period of 7 years. They are both matters that I must bear in mind when fixing the appropriate penalty for that matter. It is, of course, an indication of how seriously the community takes all offences of violence, but particularly so offences of violence committed by those within domestic relationships.
	
	
	I accept for this sentence that as a result of his controlling behaviour, the offender had largely rendered the complainant incapable of removing herself for any length of time from his influence and he must have been aware of that. He does not have the benefit of any discount for a plea of guilty because this matter went to trial and he was convicted by a jury. That of course does not increase the appropriate sentence, but it prevents him from any discount for the plea.
	
	
	Turning to the subjective circumstances of the offender, I accept that he presents a very complicated picture to the Court. He is now 33. He was born in Australia of Fijian background. At the age of 3 he was taken back to Fiji by his grandparents, apparently after domestic violence between his parents in Australia. Unfortunately his grandparents died. He was brought back to Australia by his father when he was 17. He seems to have been abandoned here.
	
	
	He then reconnected with his mother who had since gone to live in the United States and went to live with her there. He did not settle in the United States and gravitated into criminal behaviour. He, I accept, committed offences that led to his being imprisoned in the United States for 5 years. He was deported back to Australia when that term of imprisonment ended and so appears to have come back to Australia when he was 23, about 10 years ago. He has a significant criminal history, which is an important factor in this sentence. Since he returned to live in Australia he has mainly been in New South Wales, although there is one largely irrelevant entry on his Victorian record after his return. From 2008 however and continuing he has a very significant history of violence on his criminal record, a great deal of which is domestic violence related offending.
	
	
	He has, I accept, served prison terms for these offences of violence, including for stalking and intimidating and common assault a term of 9 months; assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a term of 10 months; aggravated robbery, a term of 2 years; common assault, a term of 9 months and another common assault, a term of 10 months. As I have said much of that offending were for domestic violence related offences which gave rise then to apprehended violence orders. He has been dealt with for breaching those apprehended violence orders on numerous occasions, again leading to further periods of imprisonment.
	
	
	The criminal history of the offender is a matter of some concern. It seems to me that it falls just short of being so significant that it ought be treated as an aggravating factor. However it is a significant matter to take into account in assessing real prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The offender, since being in custody on this occasion apparently, has been in the Long Bay Hospital. That would appear to be as a result of his psychiatric condition. Unfortunately exactly the nature of that condition is not clear from the evidence. The presentence report indicates that when he was released to parole in 2014 he saw a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, although there is no clear indication that he suffers from that condition. He has also used methamphetamine on a number of occasions, including in 2014 and significantly at the time he committed the offences before me. It would appear that he was at the time using some prescribed mood stabilising medications but that he had stopped using those and was starting to use crystal methamphetamine.
	
	
	He has a number of identified criminogenic needs according to Probation and Parole including, perhaps most significantly, the need to be monitored and treated for his psychiatric condition. He is currently being treated in the prison hospital with Seroquel, an antipsychotic medication. According to the history given to the psychologist in a report tendered on behalf of the offender, he has been diagnosed with depression. He tests as below average intelligence.
	
	
	There is some glimmer of hope in that the offender has started to open up to those treating him to, in his own words, tell his story which more probably than not will assist his general rehabilitation by enabling those treating him to provide appropriate treatment. However it is a very difficult process for him and them. His background has been largely dysfunctional since he was a small child. More probably than not, he has never bonded appropriately with any of the adult figures in his life. He has been subject to violence and has enmeshed himself and his relationships in violence and drug taking. It would appear that he has never been properly treated for any of these factors in the past. He will need a relatively lengthy period of supervision in the community to deal with these issues, particularly his psychiatric condition, and drug counselling in an attempt to avoid relapse. His prospects of rehabilitation however are at best guarded, given his condition and the very lengthy history of violence. I have already indicated the sentence should indicate a degree of general deterrence and whilst his psychiatric condition may indicate a somewhat less emphasis on that, in the circumstances here, where his actual psychiatric condition is not clear, it is very difficult for that to be given much effect.
	
	
	There are no issues of contrition and remorse for me to take into account, given that these were pleas of not guilty and as is his right, the offender still denies having committed the offences.
	
	
	As I said there is no victim impact statement tendered. The complainant gave evidence at trial. She appeared to be relatively robust, although without doubt there would be ongoing psychological sequelae as a result of these offences. It is also clear from other material before the Court that she is a person with her own problems, but I accept from the most recent statement tendered that she has ended her relationship with the offender and wishes no more to do with him.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account I have come to the conclusion that the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences ought give rise to terms of imprisonment of 18 months. The more serious offence in my view, particularly bearing in mind the maximum penalty for it and the standard non‑parole period where that were appropriate, even though this is below the mid-range in terms of objective seriousness, it seems to me calls for an overall term of 7 years. I fix a non-parole period of 4 years on a finding of special circumstances.
	



	
	The psychiatric condition;
	
	
	The need for a longer than normal period of supervision in the community on parole and;
	
	
	A degree of partial accumulation.
	



	
	If each of those sentences was accumulated with the other, an overall term of 10 years would arise. That is too high in my view. The totality in my view ought give rise to an overall term of 8 years with an overall 5 year non-parole period. There will be some partial accumulation to give rise to that outcome.
	
	
	I will deal with the ADVO order afterwards, but first the 166 matters. As I have said, there are three additional related matters sent up to the Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. They are all common assault offences. The first of those, sequence 3, seems to have been charged as a result of a statement made by the complainant of which she did not give evidence at trial. They were all admissible at trial as context evidence but in simple terms she did not repeat that part of her statement. In those circumstances, given that there is no admission by the offender for that offence, it must be dismissed which I will do.
	
	
	Sequences 4 and 5 are events about which the complainant gave evidence and consistent with the jury’s verdict must have been accepted by them. One involves her being hit on the head with a suitcase handle in the unit during the same time period and sequence 5 involves her being punched by the offender outside a convenience store at around the same time as the third offence was committed, as the offender and the complainant were walking towards the Woolloomooloo Hotel and there was an altercation over cigarettes.
	
	
	I have indicated to the parties that it is my view that these matters ought not be taking up the time of this Court. They are summary matters that almost form part of the overall offending, the subject matter of these trial offences. They could not in any way give rise to sentences that elevate the overall terms of imprisonment and it is my view that they would preferably be dealt with by being dismissed in the Local Court rather than clogging up the administration of justice in this Court, requiring separate sentencing, separate recording of statistics, separate entries into JusticeLink and all of those matters that are so time consuming in this Court. I am also concerned that they will, in due course, give a skewed result to domestic violence related offences because inevitably in circumstances such as this, where the Court is sentencing for far more serious offences and the offender is to spend a considerable period in custody the only available outcome for these much more minor summary offences will be a conviction without further order pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	It would be wrong for the statistics to indicate therefore that these Courts do not take domestic violence offences seriously but it is the only appropriate outcome in my view given the fact that this is part of the overall sentencing exercise. I will deal with sequences 4 and 5 in exactly that way, but I repeat it seems to me that these matters ought not be brought to this Court and it has the flavour of doing nothing more than trying to clear the books.
	
	
	The offender spent 10 months in custody bail refused for these matters alone. It was in two periods, with a period in the community on bail, which was ultimately breached. Thus I will commence the sentence on 8 September 2015 to take into account his pre-trial custody. For those reasons I make the following formal orders:
	
	
	Count 1 convicted, sentenced to 18 months fixed term imprisonment, commencing 8 September 2015, expiring 7 March 2017. I decline to fix a non‑parole period because this is part of an overall non-parole period.
	
	
	Count 3 convicted, sentenced to 18 months fixed term, commencing 8 March 2016, expiring 7 September 2018. I decline to fix a non-parole period because this is part of an overall non-parole period.
	
	
	Count 2 non-parole period 4 years, commencing 8 September 2016, expiring 7 September 2020 with parole thereafter of 3 years commencing 8 September 2020, expiring 7 September 2023 giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of 7 years, commencing 8 September 2016, expiring 7 September 2023. I recommend that he be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period with the following conditions:
	



	
	Supervision from Probation and Parole.
	
	
	Referral for psychiatric treatment and medication.
	
	
	Referral for drug counselling.
	



	
	So as regards the apprehended domestic violence order, I decline to make an ADVO because of the length of the sentence, the fact that the interim order will be revisited by the Local Court on 21 October 2016 and there is no up to date evidence in relation to the complainant’s current state of mind.

		03 November 2016",2016-07-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2851160,R v Droudis (No. 14) [2016] NSWSC 1550,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Amirah Droudis, is charged that, on 21 April 2013, at Werrington, she murdered a 30-year old woman, about whom more will be said shortly.
	
	
	The Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and her trial commenced on 22 August 2016. The trial proceeded as a Judge-alone trial as both the Accused and the Crown agreed to the trial proceeding without a jury: s.132(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The deceased was the former wife of Man Haron Monis (“Monis”). As mentioned, she was 30 years old at the time of her death. She and Monis married in 2003 and there are two young sons of their marriage.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that Monis planned the murder of his former wife and then put the plan into effect with his then partner, the Accused, carrying out the fatal attack.
	
	
	It is common knowledge that Monis died in the early hours of Tuesday, 16 December 2014 in the Lindt Café, Martin Place, Sydney. It is, of course, not the function of this criminal trial to consider the events at the Lindt Café on 15 and 16 December 2014. That is the task of the State Coroner presiding at an inquest.
	
	
	What may be said, however, is that if Monis was still alive, he would be seated next to the Accused in the dock facing trial for his alleged involvement in the murder of his former wife. Monis had been charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact to the murder.
	


Identification of Persons in Judgment


	
	I will not identify the deceased in this judgment as to do so is likely to identify the two children: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. For the same reason, I will not identify the names of the parents of the deceased. Non-publication orders were made under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 prohibiting publication of the names of the deceased and her parents.
	
	
	These steps were taken by the Court to give effect to the statutory protection to which the children are entitled under s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, and so as to maximise the prospect that the children can lead normal lives not linked to the circumstances in which their mother died. As will be seen, the desire to have custody of these two boys lies at the heart of this murder trial. However, it is important that the boys’ mother, as the victim of this crime, not be deprived of human identity. I will refer to her as Helen Lee which, of course, is not her real name.
	


Issues in the Trial


	
	Helen Lee was attacked in the stairwell of an apartment block at 14-20 Parkes Road, Werrington in the late afternoon of 21 April 2013. Her attacker inflicted 18 stab wounds to her upper back, right anterior chest wall and her right and left arms. Her attacker then doused Helen Lee with petrol and set her alight using matches. The forensic evidence establishes that Helen Lee was already dead from the knife wounds before being set alight.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that there was overwhelming evidence that Monis planned and put into effect the murder of his former wife.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that the evidence demonstrated clearly that the killer was a female and that the killer intended to kill Helen Lee.
	
	
	The central issue in the trial is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the killer was the Accused.
	


The Conduct of the Trial


	
	The trial was conducted in a most efficient way by the legal representatives for the parties.
	
	
	A substantial volume of documentary, photographic, video and audio evidence was tendered at the trial. The parties limited the witnesses called to those who were essential to the determination of the issues in the trial.
	
	
	The factual narrative contained in this judgment is almost entirely undisputed. The question to be addressed is what conclusions should be reached by reference to this evidence, taken with the oral evidence of witnesses called at the trial.
	
	
	The testimony of witnesses whose evidence came under challenge in the trial will be considered expressly in this judgment.
	


Structure of Judgment


	
	This judgment will be divided broadly into three parts:
	



	
	Principles of law and legal directions and warnings which the Court should apply in the circumstances of the trial;
	
	
	consideration of the question whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Monis planned and put into effect the murder of Helen Lee;
	
	
	consideration of whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused attacked and killed Helen Lee.
	


Principles of Law, Directions and Warnings


	
	Section 133(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 requires the Court to state the principles of law to be applied, as well as findings of fact which are made. Section 133(3) states that where the law requires a warning to be given to a jury, the Court must take the warning into account in dealing with the matter. I will approach these statutory obligations in accordance with statements made in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 256 CLR 47 at 52 [6], 66-67 [52].
	


The Crime of Murder


	
	In order to prove the charge of murder, it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:
	



	
	that Helen Lee is in fact deceased;
	
	
	that the Accused did an intentional act that caused Helen Lee’s death;
	
	
	that the Accused did that act with an intention to kill or with an intention (at least) to inflict grievous bodily harm (really serious injury).
	



	
	The trial was conducted by the parties upon the basis that the irresistible inference to be drawn from the ferocity of the knife attack, followed by the setting alight of the victim, was that the attacker intended to kill Helen Lee. This is an accurate and realistic approach in this trial. The only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the attacker intended to kill Helen Lee.
	
	
	The critical element in issue is whether the Crown has proved that the Accused did the acts which caused Helen Lee’s death.
	
	
	None of the relevant defences or partial defences (such as self-defence, provocation or substantial impairment) have been raised in this case. It has not been submitted that there is any basis upon which the Court could find the Accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Nor does such a scenario arise in this trial so that the Court should address that topic, although it was not raised by the parties.
	


Presumption of Innocence


	
	The starting point in the trial is that the Accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence. She is not required to prove her innocence. The Accused is presumed to be innocent of the crime charged unless the evidence led in the trial satisfies me to the appropriate standard that she is guilty of murder.
	


Onus and Standard of Proof


	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proof, from the beginning to the end of the trial, to establish the guilt of the Accused. The Accused bears no onus and is not required to prove anything in the trial.
	
	
	The standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. Those words have their ordinary English meaning. It is not enough for the Crown to show suspicion of guilt or to demonstrate that the Accused is probably guilty.
	
	
	The matters that the Crown needs to establish beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements of the offence. In the circumstances of this trial, the critical question is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was the killer.
	
	
	However, the Crown is not required to prove the truth and reliability of every disputed fact nor to answer every question that might be posed concerning the evidence in the case.
	


A Dispassionate Approach


	
	It is necessary to consider the evidence in the trial impartially and dispassionately. The Court must not let sympathy or emotion affect its judgment.
	
	
	Certain evidence was admitted in this trial which emphasises the need for the Court to proceed without emotion in its assessment of the evidence. This was evidence of certain activities of the Accused which was admitted for both tendency and non-tendency purposes: R v Droudis (No. 13) [2016] NSWSC 1350. In that judgment, I observed at various points that it was necessary to consider the evidence without emotion, with the reasons to be provided by the Court in giving its verdict to demonstrate that approach: R v Droudis (No. 13) at [92], [173] and [178].
	
	
	In the same manner as required of a jury, I will approach the assessment of evidence in this trial in a dispassionate manner and without emotion or sympathy and without any element of prejudice. I will keep this direction in mind particularly when considering the evidence of prior conduct of the Accused relied upon by the Crown for tendency and non-tendency purposes, in accordance with the rulings in R v Droudis (No. 13).
	


Inferences and Circumstantial Evidence


	
	There is no direct evidence that the Accused killed Helen Lee. The Crown seeks to demonstrate that the Accused killed Helen Lee by inference from the primary facts it contends it has proven.
	
	
	The Crown case is circumstantial. This means that the Crown must first demonstrate that the inference or conclusion that it was the Accused who killed Helen Lee is a reasonable one to draw from the facts established by the evidence. The Crown must then prove that the only reasonable inference or conclusion that can be drawn from the consideration of all the established facts, viewed as a whole, is that it was the Accused who killed Helen Lee.
	
	
	If there is any other reasonable inference or conclusion open on the facts that is inconsistent with that conclusion, then the Crown’s circumstantial case fails and the Accused should be acquitted.
	
	
	In assessing the Crown’s case, I must consider all of the circumstances established by the evidence, and weigh them up in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637 [46]. A circumstantial case is not to be considered in a piecemeal fashion: The Queen v Hillier at 638 [48].
	
	
	The Crown submits that in this case, there are only two indispensable facts or circumstances that the Crown must prove as part of its circumstantial case:
	



	
	that Monis planned and put into effect the murder;
	
	
	that the attacker was a woman.
	



	
	I accept the Crown submission that these are the only two indispensable facts or circumstances which form part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. To this limited extent, the Crown case is a “link in the chain” case. These intermediate facts or circumstances are so crucial to the process of reasoning that each must be established beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 at 579.
	
	
	I mentioned earlier (at [10]-[11]) that neither party in this trial has submitted that the Court would be other than satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to these two facts or circumstances. Of course, it remains a matter for the Court, as the tribunal of fact, to determine whether it is so satisfied on the evidence adduced in the trial.
	
	
	Apart from these two indispensable facts or circumstances, the Crown case is otherwise a “strand in the cable” case, so that the individual circumstances relied upon by the Crown need not be established beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen at 579.
	
	
	Circumstantial evidence is not necessarily less reliable than direct evidence. In some cases, it can be more convincing. Clearly, this will depend upon the evidence in the particular trial. In El Hassan v R [2007] NSWCCA 148, Hunt AJA (with the agreement of Latham J and myself) said at [27]:
	


“27    It has been my experience that a circumstantial case can in some cases produce almost conclusive evidence of the accused's guilt. Circumstantial evidence does not usually depend to any great extent on the evidence of witnesses who could be either mistaken or maliciously false in their testimony: Regina v Cable (1947) 47 SR 183 at 184. Those cases I have in mind have all been of the ‘strands in the cable’ variety of circumstantial evidence case (see par [19] supra). It is a matter of common sense that the more strands in the cable, the stronger the cable is. The more circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused, the less likely it is that there could be any reasonable explanation for those circumstances other than the guilt of the accused, and thus the stronger is the circumstantial case against him. As McHugh J pointed out in Shepherd v The Queen (at 582):

‘There are many cases where the probability of the correctness of an inference of guilt drawn from the circumstances of the case is greater than the probability of the truth of any of the individual circumstances. As Lord Simon of Glaisdale pointed out in Regina v Kilbourne [1973] AC 729 at 758: 

‘Circumstantial evidence [...] works by cumulatively, in geometrical progression,

eliminating other 

possibilities’.”


	
	It is appropriate to keep in mind, in approaching a circumstantial evidence case, what was said by the High Court of Australia (French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Keane and Gordon JJ) in The Queen v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35; 90 ALJR 1013 at 1020-1021 [46]-[47] (footnotes omitted):
	


“46.   The prosecution case against the respondent was circumstantial. The principles concerning cases that turn upon circumstantial evidence are well settled. In Barca v The Queen, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ said:

‘When the case against an accused person rests substantially upon circumstantial evidence the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are 'such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused': Peacock v The King. To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be 'the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw': Plomp v The Queen; see also Thomas v The Queen.’

47.   For an inference to be reasonable, it ‘must rest upon something more than mere conjecture. The bare possibility of innocence should not prevent a jury from finding the prisoner guilty, if the inference of guilt is the only inference open to reasonable men upon a consideration of all the facts in evidence’ (emphasis added). Further, ‘in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence’ (emphasis added). The evidence is not to be looked at in a piecemeal fashion, at trial or on appeal.”


	
	The distinction between drawing an inference from proven facts and engaging in speculation was emphasised in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317; 241 A Crim R 321 at 348 [109]-[110] (Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ):
	


“109   The answer to that question lies in the distinction, which is a very real one, between inference and speculation. In Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness; James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262, Spigelman CJ considered this very question. He acknowledged that it is often difficult to distinguish between permissible inference and conjecture. Quoting from Jones v Great Western Railway Co (1930) 144 LT 194, his Honour adopted a definition of inference as ‘a deduction from the evidence’ which, if reasonable, may have the validity of legal proof.

110   He referred also to Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 152, quoting as follows: 

‘Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation. There can be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to infer the other facts which it is sought to establish. In some cases the other facts can be inferred with as much practical certainty as if they had been actually observed. In other cases the inference does not go beyond reasonable probability. But if there are no positive proved facts from which the inference can be made, the method of inference fails and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture.’

Spigelman CJ stated the test as:

‘... whether, on the basis of the primary facts, it is reasonable to draw the inference.’

To similar effect were observations of Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ in Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; 133 CLR 82 at 104-105.”

Consciousness of Guilt


	
	The Crown relies upon two areas of evidence as demonstrating consciousness of guilt on the part of the Accused:
	



	
	conversations between the Accused and Monis which included discussions concerning possible explanations for the presence of the Accused’s blood, hair or DNA at the crime scene: R v Droudis (No. 11) [2016] NSWSC 1319;
	
	
	conversations which were said to involve the creation of a false alibi.
	



	
	Evidence of consciousness of guilt is not capable of establishing guilt by itself. It is tendered effectively as corroborative evidence.
	
	
	Post-offence conduct may be capable of constituting evidence of consciousness of guilt in different ways. This may arise from lies told by an accused person or from other conduct such as flight, destruction of evidence or creation of a false account.
	
	
	Here, the Crown says that the Accused acted and spoke, in these two areas, in a manner which involved lies and the preparedness to tell lies about topics which were central to her guilt of the murder of Helen Lee.
	
	
	Before using evidence in these two categories as evidence corroborating the guilt of the Accused, I must be satisfied of two things:
	



	
	that the statements of the Accused amounted to a lie or lies concerning an issue relevant to the charge of murder;
	
	
	that the only reasonable explanation for the Accused having made the statement or statements in question was that she was aware that she was guilty of the murder of Helen Lee.
	



	
	I should exercise caution in using evidence of consciousness of guilt because it is often difficult to know how or why an innocent person may act in particular circumstances, and it is necessary to consider any other possible explanation for the statements of the Accused which are said to be motivated by a consciousness of guilt.
	


Use of Evidence for Tendency Purposes


	
	I have allowed certain evidence to be used for tendency purposes in the trial: R v Droudis (No. 13) at [35]-[38], [121]-[168], [175]-[180].
	
	
	The material which has been admitted for tendency purposes (and non-tendency purposes) is in evidence at the trial because the Crown says that there is a pattern of behaviour that reveals that the Accused had a tendency to act in ways at the behest of Monis, including engagement in socially and morally reprehensible acts. The Crown argues that the suggested tendency of the Accused to act in these ways bears significantly upon the question whether the Accused acted in a reprehensible way, at the behest of Monis, by killing Helen Lee.
	
	
	The evidence suggesting that the Accused had that tendency can only be used, in the way the Crown seeks that it be used, to make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. The first finding is a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those acts occurred. In this case, there is no dispute that the Accused acted in the various ways relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, the second aspect is of particular significance. It is necessary for the Court to ask whether, from the act or acts that are proved, the Court can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had the tendency that the Crown alleges. If the Court cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt, it must put aside any suggestion that the Accused had the tendency alleged.
	
	
	If the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused committed the acts relied upon as tendency evidence, and is likewise satisfied that the Accused had the tendency to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind as alleged by the Crown, the Court may use the fact of that tendency or state of mind in considering whether the Accused committed the offence charged.
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind that this is just one part of the evidence relied upon by the Crown, and it ought be given such weight as the Court considers it deserves in the context of the evidence admitted at the trial.
	
	
	The evidence of other acts must not be used in an impermissible way. It would be completely wrong to reason that, because the Accused had committed a crime or other acts of misconduct, she is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed the offence charged. The Accused cannot be punished for other conduct attributed to her by finding her guilty of the charge of murder contained in the indictment. That is not the purpose of the evidence being placed before the Court and reasoning of this type is not permissible.
	
	
	The Court cannot use the evidence for tendency purposes, unless the Court accepts the Crown’s argument that it discloses a tendency, and therefore makes it more likely that the Accused committed the offence charged against her.
	
	
	The evidence led by the Crown to prove that the Accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, and to have a particular state of mind, is separate from the particular allegation in the indictment. The Court must not substitute the evidence led by the Crown to prove that the Accused had that tendency for the specific allegation of murder contained in the indictment. The Court is concerned with the particular and precise occasion alleged in the charge.
	
	
	In considering the evidence admitted for tendency (and non-tendency) purposes in R v Droudis (No. 13), particular care is needed to ensure that the evidence is confined to its proper role and given appropriate weight only, given the portions of the evidence which indicate criminal or improper conduct on the part of the Accused on other occasions.
	
	
	In addition, care is required to guard against an emotional response to the evidence (see [28]-[30] above).
	


Accused Not Giving Evidence


	
	The Accused did not give evidence in response to the Crown case. The Accused was entitled to give evidence, but was under no obligation to do so. The onus lies upon the Crown from first to last in the trial. The Accused is entitled to say nothing if she so chooses.
	
	
	The Accused’s decision not to give evidence cannot be used against her in any way during the course of the Court’s deliberations. No inference may be drawn adverse to the Accused in this respect. The decision of the Accused not to give evidence cannot be used to fill any gaps that might be thought to exist in the evidence tendered by the Crown, nor can it be used in any way as strengthening the Crown case or in assisting the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Court must not speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the Accused had given evidence at the trial.
	


Alibi


	
	The solicitor for the Accused filed a notice of alibi on 20 June 2016 which stated that the Accused was at her parents’ address at Belmore at the time of the killing (Exhibit DB).
	
	
	The Accused has called witnesses intended to show that, at the time of the offence on 21 April 2013, she was somewhere else (at Belmore) and therefore could not have committed the offence (at Werrington).
	
	
	When an accused person puts forward an alibi, the burden of proving the Accused’s guilt continues to rest on the Crown. If the Crown fails to satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt that the alibi evidence should be rejected, then the Accused should be acquitted. The Crown must disprove the alibi.
	
	
	The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was at the apartment block at 14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington at about 4.25 pm on 21 April 2013. The Crown cannot do so if there is a reasonable possibility that the Accused was at Belmore at that time, as asserted by the alibi notice. The Crown must therefore remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility that the Accused was at Belmore at the relevant time, and also persuade the Court beyond reasonable doubt that, on the evidence on which the Crown relies, the Accused was at the Werrington apartment block at that time. If the Crown fails to remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility, the Accused should be acquitted.
	
	
	If the Crown satisfies the Court beyond reasonable doubt that the alibi evidence should be rejected, it does not follow that the Court would necessarily convict the Accused. In other words, it must not be assumed that because the alibi fails that the Accused is guilty. The Court must still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, upon the evidence as a whole, that the Crown has made out its case against the Accused before a guilty verdict can be returned.
	


Expert Evidence


	
	In this trial, Ms Sandra Trabuio was called as an expert witness in the Crown case. In addition, a report of Dr Mark Perlin was tendered, without objection, in the Accused’s case.
	
	
	An expert witness is a person who has specialised knowledge based on that person’s training, study or experience. A witness with such specialised knowledge may express an opinion on matters within his or her particular area of expertise. In this case, both Ms Trabuio and Dr Perlin gave expert oral or written evidence on matters concerning DNA analysis and associated matters.
	
	
	The value of an expert opinion is very much dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the expert used to reach his or her opinion. It is also dependent upon the degree to which the expert analysed the material upon which the opinion was based, and the skill and experience brought to bear in formulating the opinion given. Experts can differ in the level and degree of their experience, training and study, yet each can still be an expert qualified to give an opinion where that opinion is based on that witness' specialised knowledge.
	
	
	The expert evidence before the Court in this trial was adduced to assist in determining the question whether the presence or absence of the Accused’s DNA on a partly burnt match stick found at the crime scene was a neutral factor in the trial or, as argued for the Accused, it pointed towards the attacker being someone other than the Accused.
	
	
	In this case, there is no conflict between the evidence of the two witnesses. The evidence of Ms Trabuio and Dr Perlin has not been challenged and is not inherently unbelievable. The issue for consideration is what conclusions ought be reached, by reference to their evidence, concerning the absence of the Accused’s DNA on the partly burnt match stick.
	
	
	It remains a matter for the Court to consider the expert evidence, in the context of all of the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of reaching a conclusion as to the significance of the evidence in the trial.
	


View of the Werrington Premises


	
	A joint application was made by the parties for the Court to undertake a view of the premises at 14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington and this occurred on 18 August 2016, shortly before the commencement of the trial. The transcript of the view was tendered at the trial (Exhibit B).
	
	
	The view of the Werrington premises, and its surrounds, assisted the Court to understand the evidence. The observations made by the Court on the view are to be taken into account as part of the overall evidence upon which the Court will decide whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Direction Concerning Evidence of Sonia Conciatore


	
	During the trial, the Court admitted certain evidence of Sonia Conciatore concerning statements made to her by her close friend, Helen Lee, about the Accused and Monis: R v Droudis (No. 7) [2016] NSWSC 1274.
	
	
	The effect of the ruling in R v Droudis (No. 7) was that, for the purpose of s.65(2) Evidence Act 1995, the hearsay rule did not apply to a particular representation arising from the evidence of Ms Conciatore. The effect of that ruling was that Ms Conciatore was permitted to give evidence concerning what Helen Lee had said to her about an incident about two weeks before 21 April 2013, where there was said to have been an argument between the Accused and Helen Lee about Helen Lee’s sons, with the Accused allegedly saying that she wanted the boys to live with Monis.
	
	
	In approaching the use to be made of the evidence of Ms Conciatore concerning what Helen Lee had said to her, it is appropriate to keep in mind that the Accused has had no opportunity to test the evidence, in the sense that the account given by Helen Lee to Ms Conciatore cannot be meaningfully tested. In these circumstances, the Court should proceed with caution in considering the evidence of what had been said in assessing the reliability of that evidence.
	


Use of Photographic Identification Procedures


	
	As will be seen, there is no evidence in this trial from persons who were present at the scene of the crime which identifies the Accused as the attacker. There is evidence from a number of persons of the use of photographic identification procedures, in which persons were selected with varying degrees of certainty by the witnesses.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no need for an identification warning in these circumstances as there had been no positive identification evidence and Senior Counsel for the Accused agreed with this approach (T1029).
	
	
	I accept the approach advanced by the parties, but would make a number of observations concerning identification of this type, which I will keep in mind when assessing that evidence later in this judgment.
	
	
	Each witness was shown (head and shoulders) photographs of 20 females by means of either computer display or hard-copy display.
	
	
	As Stephen J observed in Alexander v The Queen [1981] HCA 17; 145 CLR 395 at 409, the accuracy of any identification of a stranger, seen only once, is likely to be affected by the fallibility of human perception and memory. His Honour noted that, when identification is attempted with the aid of photographs, there are introduced peculiar difficulties due to the various ways in which photographic representations differ from nature, including their two dimensional and static quality.
	
	
	In Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593, Kirby J at 639 [154] observed that an identification parade is a preferable means of attempted identification as it “affords a wider range of identifying factors and a more natural circumstance for perceiving the entire person of the suspect rather than head and shoulders photographs”.
	
	
	In the context of voice identification, in Bulejcik v The Queen [1996] HCA 50; 185 CLR 375, McHugh and Gummow JJ observed at 406 [20] that “Identification evidence is often unreliable evidence because human perception and recollection are prone to error”. Their Honours observed at 406 [21]:
	


“The capacities of individuals to remember sights and sounds vary enormously. Some persons may remember sounds that others do not, just as some persons may recollect physical features when others who were present cannot recollect them. Moreover, individuals who witness or are involved in criminal incidents react differently. Some remain relatively calm; others are shocked or confused.”


	
	It has also been noted that there may be little, or no, correlation between the confidence with which a witness gives evidence of identification and the reliability and accuracy of their evidence: R v Simmons (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 574 at [29].
	
	
	I will bear these considerations in mind when considering the evidence of photographic identification procedures in this trial.
	


Has the Crown Proved Beyond Reasonable Doubt that Monis Planned and Put Into Effect the Murder of his Former Wife?


	
	As mentioned earlier, the Crown submitted that the Court would readily find beyond reasonable doubt that Monis had planned and put into effect the murder of Helen Lee. Senior Counsel for the Accused accepted that the evidence established that Monis had acted in this way. In making this submission, it was made clear that the defence accepted these matters by reference to the strength of the Crown evidence on these aspects, and not by way of any knowledge or admission on the part of the Accused.
	
	
	It is a matter for the Court, as the tribunal of fact in the trial, to determine whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Monis planned and put into effect the murder of Helen Lee. As noted above (at [35]-[36]), this aspect of the Crown case is an indispensable circumstance, the existence of which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt. I have kept in mind, in considering the first question, that there is no one speaking for Monis in this trial and the Court should consider his position carefully by reference to the evidence and the onus and standard of proof.
	
	
	Consideration of this topic will also permit findings to be made as to the nature and extent of the relationship between Monis and the Accused.
	


Background of Monis


	
	The evidence in the trial disclosed some of the history of Monis both before and after he came to Australia.
	
	
	Monis was born Mohammad Hassan Manteghi on 19 May 1964 in Iran (Exhibit C, paragraph 54).
	
	
	Monis came to Australia in about 1996 (T602). He went by a number of names between 1996 and December 2014. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that he went by the names “Man Haron Monis” (from November 2006 to December 2014) whilst using the first name “Michael” for some purposes, and also the name “Sheikh Haron” from 2007 to about 2010 (Exhibit A, Tab 5).
	
	
	Between about 2000 and 2008, Monis worked as a so-called spiritual healer and clairvoyant, advertising his services in local and community (including ethnic community) newspapers.
	
	
	It is apparent that a number of women met Monis in the course of his spiritual healing business. Several of them had sexual relationships with Monis.
	


Monis and Helen Lee


	
	In early 2003, Helen Lee met Monis after she responded to an advertisement in a community newspaper with respect to his spiritual healing services. In February 2003, they became engaged. In August 2003, Monis and Helen Lee married in a religious ceremony. Sons were born of the marriage in 2004 and 2008.
	


Monis and the Accused


	
	The Accused was born Anastasia Droudis in July 1979 of Greek Orthodox background.
	
	
	It appears that Monis first came into contact with the Accused’s family in about June 2003, when the Accused’s mother, Soula Droudis, made an appointment to see Monis in his spiritual healing business (Exhibit A, Tab 4).
	
	
	Monis and the Accused commenced an intimate relationship by at least 2006, and their relationship continued until 21 April 2013 and beyond (Exhibit C, paragraphs 8-9).
	
	
	As a result of her association with Monis, the Accused converted to Islam and changed her first name from Anastasia to Amirah in July 2008.
	
	
	The Accused has a daughter from an earlier relationship who was born in about 2001. The daughter of the Accused will not be identified in this judgment: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Also, as a result of the Accused’s relationship with Monis, her daughter converted to Islam as well.
	


Monis and Female M


	
	It was through his work as a spiritual healer and clairvoyant that Monis also met Female M, to whom he became engaged, and who died of natural causes in May 2012. For a period, Monis was maintaining simultaneous relationships with Helen Lee, the Accused and Female M (Exhibit C, paragraph 55). More will be said about Female M in the course of the judgment.
	


Monis as “Sheikh Haron”


	
	From late 2007, Monis adopted the persona of “Sheikh Haron” to espouse his religious and political views, which may be fairly described as extremist in nature. He utilised, in this respect, amongst other things, the Sheikh Haron website (Exhibits BB, BC, BD and BE).
	
	
	Monis used a number of women as participants in videos, with extremist content, apparently made for posting on the Sheikh Haron website. Not all videos of this type were actually posted on the website.
	
	
	In 2008-2009, the Accused appeared in 11 videos which had been scripted by Monis (Exhibits BB and BC). The content of these videos was extreme and offensive in nature and sheds considerable light upon the beliefs and attitudes of Monis at that time.
	
	
	The 11 videos recorded by the Accused for the Sheikh Haron website were made in the period April 2008 to December 2008 (Exhibit BB). As noted above, not all the videos were posted to the Sheikh Haron website, but the Accused would have expected, in each case, that the video which she made could be posted publicly on the website and YouTube.
	
	
	In each of these 11 videos, the Accused appeared wearing a black niqab, so that her eyes only were visible. In the course of lengthy presentations, scripted by Monis, the Accused praised Osama Bin Laden, delivered a fatwa against Present-elect Barack Obama for apostasy (abandoning his Muslim faith for Christianity), expressed happiness about the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States of America, the Bali bombings in October 2002 and the Holocaust, described the Bali bombers as martyrs, called upon people to join the army of Islam and warned the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, that Australians would be attacked and killed by Muslims. In each of these videos, the Accused is seen reading Monis’ scripts with feeling and passion.
	
	
	Both the contents of the 11 videos and the material posted on the Sheikh Haron website referred to the Accused as “Sister Amirah”, a frequent spokesperson for Monis (Exhibit BD).
	
	
	The Sheikh Haron website referred to the Accused (as “Sister Amirah”) in the following examples:
	



	
	A message posted to YouTube in April 2008 described as:
	
	
	“ANZAC Day, fair or unfair?
	
	
	Message of Sheikh Haron’s website to Australians for ANZAC Day 
	
	
	(Delivered by Spokesperson of Website, Sister Amirah)” (Exhibit BD, Annexure G).
	
	
	A message posted to YouTube in May 2008 as follows:
	
	
	“A Sad Story About Violent Rapists and Rape Under Cover
	
	
	Message of Sheikh Haron’s website to President George W Bush (video of Spokesperson of Website, Sister Amirah)” (Exhibit BD, Annexure I).
	
	
	An item promoting the 10th video made by the Accused (Exhibits BB and BC), describing it in the following way:
	
	
	“’I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist but I’ll try not to be anymore!’
	
	
	An Australian Muslim confesses to terrorism on our website for the first time. Sheikh Haron takes full responsibility for all content on this site including the accuracy and authenticity of the confession and the identity of the Australian Muslim who confesses to terrorism here!” (Exhibit BD, Annexure J).
	
	
	An item posted to YouTube as “Sister Amirah speaks about our policy” with the following description:
	
	
	“When you slap me, if I slap you back am I considered as terrorist?
	
	
	Video 1 of Spokesperson of our Website on YouTube” (Exhibit BD, Annexure N).
	
	
	An item posted to YouTube described as “Sister Amirah’s personal video message” with the following content:
	
	
	“I feel sorry for you, but not for him
	
	
	Video of Sister Amirah’s message to Cassandra, dead soldier’s wife” (Exhibit BD, Annexure N).
	
	
	A further item posted to YouTube (Video 5 on Exhibits BB, BC and BE) under the banner “September 11, Bali and Holocaust” with the following content:
	
	
	“Should Muslims be happy about 9/11, Bali and Holocaust?
	
	
	Video of Sister Amirah about Act of God” (Exhibit BD, Annexure O).
	
	
	A message posted to YouTube on 20 June 2008 (Video 6 on Exhibits BB, BC and BE) under the banner “About media mafia” with the following content:
	
	
	“News.com.au shame on you!
	
	
	Sister Amirah’s video about conspiracy by Nationwide News” (Exhibit BD, Annexure O).
	
	
	A message posted to YouTube under the banner “Soldier Amirah’s message for troops” with the following content:
	
	
	“This is the message of the majority of the Australian nation
	
	
	Video of Soldier Sister Amirah” (Exhibit BD, Annexure O).
	



	
	Monis’ thought processes and beliefs were illustrated in this period by a letter dated 12 June 2008 which he sent (under the guise of Sheikh Haron) to then Senator Barack Obama, five months before the 2008 Presidential election. In this letter, Monis castigated Barack Obama for “hiding” his religion, warning him, “You will be apostate by denying your religion” and advising him to choose “the right path” and not “the satanic tactic”, counselling him to “be careful to pass this test of God successfully” (Exhibit BD, Annexure P).
	
	
	On 26 November 2008, the Accused (again dressed in a black niqab) participated in the ninth video in which she referred back to Monis’ letter of 12 June 2008 and stated that “Unfortunately Barack Obama kept denouncing his religion in order to achieve the position”, and stating that Monis’ letter was available on the Sheikh Haron website.
	
	
	The Accused continued, saying “Sheikh Haron has issued a fatwa against Barack Obama”, then reading the terms of the fatwa. The Accused stated that it was “an obligation upon every Muslim who is able to treat Barack Hussein Obama … as an apostate according to Sharia law” to do so and any Muslim who acted in this way “will be rewarded by Allah”. The Accused’s message continued at considerable length, culminating in the following (Exhibit BC, page 21):
	


“If any Muslim supports this apostate, he or she must await God's punishment. George Bush's danger for Islam is much less than Barack Obama's danger. Apostates and hypocrites are worse. Muslims are religiously responsible for any supporting comment they make for Barack Obama. It is also considered a very big sin. Dear American Muslims, in the next 4 years do your religious duty against Barack Obama. May Allah reward you. Do your Islamic duty against this apostate. May Allah accept your Jihad and place you as a (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) in paradise. Do it, don't doubt about it. Do it, do not miss the opportunity, do your Islamic duty and finish it. Finish it. Finish it. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE).”


	
	In the video of this message, the concluding words urging viewers to “Do it” or “Finish it” were accompanied by hand movements by the Accused in the form of stabbing motions (Exhibit BE).
	
	
	This detail is provided to assist an understanding of what Monis was saying and doing in June 2008, and what the Accused was saying and doing on film (at his behest) in November 2008. This illustration provides considerable insight into the dynamics of the relationship between Monis and the Accused at that time, involving her repeatedly participating in very strong video statements written by Monis. There is nothing to suggest that the Accused held beliefs of this type, let alone displayed a willingness to act on them in this way, before she had met and formed a close relationship with Monis.
	
	
	The Accused was not the only female companion of Monis who appeared in his Sheikh Haron videos. An unidentified Chinese woman, also wearing a black niqab, appeared in a video. Female P, described as “Sister Zahra” appeared in one video as did Female M, described as “Sister Fatimah” and Female B, described as “Sister Husna” (Exhibits 25 and 26), with each of them wearing a black niqab. In each case, I accept that the script was prepared by Monis so that the beliefs and thoughts contained in the presentations represented the thought processes of Monis.
	
	
	It should be said that the delivery of female speakers (other than the Accused) in these videos, was flat and indicative of a bare reading of a prepared script.
	
	
	In the case of the Accused, her delivery in the 11 different presentations was far from flat, and was accompanied by feeling and, at times, movement. The Accused’s forceful and dramatic delivery may be contrasted with the flat and expressionless delivery of other women who participated in these videos.
	


The Channel 7 Protests in June 2008


	
	On 16 and 27 June 2008, Monis and the Accused attended outside the Channel 7 premises in Martin Place, Sydney to undertake a protest. Monis had developed a grievance concerning an item on terrorism he had seen on the “Sunrise” program. It is clear from the videos of events on these days (Exhibit BF) that Monis filmed the Accused’s activities on one day and the Accused’s filmed Monis’ activities on the other day. The Accused was wearing a black niqab which covered her face, except for her eyes.
	
	
	The Sheikh Haron website had advertised the fact that a protest was to occur on 16 June 2008, described as “Soldier Sister Amirah’s protest in Sydney” (Exhibit BD, Annexure S). A notice posted on the Sheikh Haron website (no doubt written by Monis) announced the Accused’s protest on 16 June 2008, including the following (Exhibit BD, Annexure S):
	


“Sister Amirah has decided to have a protest by herself against terrorism in Martin Place, Sydney. We pray for her and ask God to make her successful in her Jihad against oppressors. May God bless her and all people who fight with terrorism.

In the last few months we have received many threats from some racist Aussies. We are hoping that the Australian Government feels responsibility for the protection of Sister Amirah while she is having protest. We don't want any violence like Cronulla happens again. May God make her protest peaceful and no racist try to attack her. Amen.”


	
	The Martin Place protests by Monis and the Accused in June 2008 serve to illustrate further the nature and depth of the relationship between them, and the Accused’s willingness to uncritically adopt and espouse Monis’ beliefs.
	


Monis and the Accused Communicate with Families of Deceased Australian Servicemen and a Deceased Australian Trade Commissioner


	
	At about the same time, Monis and the Accused embarked upon a course of conduct where written or face-to-face contact was made with families of deceased Australian servicemen who had been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. The following description of these activities, between May 2008 and July 2009, is drawn from a Statement of Agreed Facts (Exhibit EE).
	
	
	On or about 4 May 2008, two letters from Monis, in similar terms, were posted to the immediate family of an Australian soldier who had died whilst serving in Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Jason Marks. The letters were posted to his widow, Cassandra Marks, and his father, Paul Marks.
	
	
	On or about 6 May 2008, a further letter from Monis was posted to Cassandra Marks. A copy of this letter was posted on the Sheikh Haron website.
	
	
	In the above letters from Monis to the family of the late Lance Corporal Marks, it was suggested variously that:
	



	
	he had died for nothing;
	
	
	he was analogous to a Nazi soldier following the orders of Hitler; and
	
	
	Australians could not be proud of him.
	



	
	On or about 6 May 2008, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, participated in a video filmed by Monis (fourth video, Exhibits BB, BC and BE). The Accused was wearing a black niqab. In that video, the Accused referred to the 4 May 2008 letter that Sheikh Haron had sent to Cassandra Marks. She then delivered what she described as her own message to Cassandra Marks, which echoed the sentiments expressed in Sheikh Haron’s letter. The Accused, variously, compared Lance Corporal Marks to a Nazi soldier under Hitler, said that she did not feel sorry for him and described him as a murderer. The Accused’s video message to Cassandra Marks was placed on a DVD that was posted to Cassandra Marks. The video was also posted on YouTube and an announcement relating to the video was made on the Sheikh Haron website.
	
	
	On or about 29 November 2008, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned Madeline Fussell, the mother of an Australian soldier who had recently died whilst serving in Afghanistan, Lieutenant Michael Fussell. The Accused said words to the effect “I am a member of the public, you don’t know me, I would like to send you a card, could I have your address”. Ms Fussell declined to give her address. However, her husband, Kenneth Fussell, was listed in the telephone directory. On or about 3 December 2008, a letter in the name of Sheikh Haron was posted to Kenneth Fussell. The letter was also posted on the Sheikh Haron website under a heading “Letter of Mufti Sheikh Haron to Family of Australian Soldier Killed in Afghanistan, Michael Fussell”. The letter noted that “Sister Amirah” had called and spoken to Mr Fussell’s family.
	
	
	On or about 12 January 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned the home of Felix Sher and Yvonne Sher, the parents of an Australian soldier who had recently died whilst serving in Afghanistan, Private Gregory Sher. Felix Sher’s nephew, Darren Milner, answered the phone and spoke to the Accused. The Accused said that her name was “Sister Amirah” and she wanted to send a letter of condolence.
	
	
	On or about 22 January 2009, a letter in the name of Sheikh Haron was posted to Mr Sher. The letter was posted on the Sheikh Haron website under a heading “Why should we call pig, a hero?”. The letter noted that Sister Amirah had called to offer condolences.
	
	
	Between about 24 March and 27 March 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned the South Lake Macquarie RSL Club on four occasions. She tried to obtain the home address of the parents of Corporal Matthew Hopkins, an Australian soldier who had recently died whilst serving in Afghanistan. Following Corporal Hopkins’ death, a media statement was released by the RSL which indicated that Corporal Hopkins was a member of the South Lake Macquarie RSL Club. The RSL Club refused to provide her with these details.
	
	
	On or about 26 March 2009, two copies of a letter in the name of Sheikh Haron were posted to the parents of Corporal Matthew Hopkins, care of the South Lake Macquarie RSL Club. The letter to Corporal Hopkins’ father was also posted on the Sheikh Haron website. The letter and the heading on the website asserted “Matthew Hopkins was a big criminal”.
	
	
	On or about 24 March 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned Breeanna Till, the widow of Sergeant Brett Till, an Australian soldier who had recently died whilst serving in Afghanistan. The Accused asked when and where Sergeant Till’s funeral was going to be held. Ms Till asked the Accused who she was and the Accused replied “I am just a member of the public who is concerned about what is happening in Afghanistan”. Ms Till advised the Accused of the funeral details as requested. Ms Till described the call she received as “almost scripted” and that the Accused spoke in a “purposeful” way.
	
	
	On or about 27 March 2009, a letter in the name of Sheikh Haron was posted to Ms Kerrie Barclay, the mother-in-law of Sergeant Brett Till. The letter was addressed to Susan and Leigh Staden, the parents of Sergeant Till, with the names of Ms Bree Till, Sergeant Till’s widow, and Ms Kerrie Barclay and her husband, Peter Barclay, included at the bottom of the letter after “cc”. The letter was also posted on the Sheikh Haron website under a heading which included the words “Aren’t you aware that Brett Till was a criminal?”.
	
	
	On or about 29 March 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, phoned Kerrie Barclay. The Accused asked for confirmation that Sergeant Till’s funeral was going to be held at Woronora and Ms Barclay confirmed that it was. Ms Barclay asked the Accused who she was and the Accused replied “I’m an Australian citizen, member of the Australian public”. The Accused said that it was a public funeral and she had a right to be there. Ms Barclay described the Accused in that phone call as sounding “very deliberate with her words, as though she were reading from a script”.
	
	
	On or about 31 March 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, attended the funeral of Sergeant Brett Till dressed in a black niqab. After the service, the Accused approached Breeanna Till and introduced herself as “Sister Amirah” and indicated that she was a representative of Sheikh Haron. The Accused said that she was there to deliver a message and said words to the effect that Ms Till’s husband was a murderer. The Accused was carrying a package which was intercepted by an Army officer before the Accused had the opportunity to hand it to Ms Till. The package contained copies of the 27 March 2009 letter from Sheikh Haron mentioned above.
	
	
	On or about 18 July 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned Joan Senger, the mother of Craig Senger who was employed as a Trade Commissioner to Austrade stationed in Jakarta. At the time of the Accused’s telephone call, Mr Senger was missing following the terrorist bombing on the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta on 17 July 2009. Mr Senger was confirmed dead a short time later. The Accused said “I hope they find your son and I hope that he is safe”. Ms Senger asked who she was and the Accused identified herself as “Amirah”.
	
	
	Ms Senger described the telephone call as having been strange on account of there being no emotion in the voice of the Accused and that it “seemed like she was reading from a script”. Further, Ms Senger stated that there was a gap between her saying something and the Accused replying, similar to an overseas call.
	
	
	On or about 21 July 2009, a letter in the name of Sheikh Heron was posted to Ms Senger. The letter referred to the telephone call on 18 July 2009 from Sister Amirah and noted that Craig Senger was now dead. The letter was also posted on the Sheikh Haron website. The letter suggests that the victims of the attack (including Mr Senger) were responsible, saying that every citizen of Australia was to blame for the JW Marriott Hotel attack by remaining silent in the face of oppression by the Australian government. The letter concluded by saying “We should condemn the Australian nation first, then others”.
	
	
	On or about 19 July 2009, the Accused, as Sister Amirah, telephoned Andrew Ranaudo, the uncle of an Australian soldier who had recently died whilst serving in Afghanistan, Private Benjamin Ranaudo. The following conversation occurred:
	


“Accused: You’re against the war and the government sending troops overseas.

Andrew Ranaudo: I’m not against the war, I’m against sending a young man to war as he does not have enough experience. I’m not sure who they should send but I’m not against the government.

Accused: We have to stop them from sending our children there.”


	
	On or about 22 July 2009, a letter in the name of Sheikh Haron was posted to Mr Ranaudo. The letter was also posted on the Sheikh Haron website. The letter noted that Sister Amirah had called Mr Ranaudo’s home on 19 July 2009 to “offer her condolences”. The letter suggested that the Australian Army was a criminal organisation that killed civilians, including children, and that everyone in the Australian Army, including his late nephew, was a criminal.
	
	
	On 20 October 2009, arising from these communications with the families of deceased servicemen, Monis was charged with using a postal service to cause offence contrary to s.471.12 Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). In July 2010, the Accused was charged with similar offences arising from her involvement in those communications.
	


The Downing Centre Protests in 2009 and 2013


	
	On 10 November 2009, the Accused filmed Monis outside the Downing Centre following an appearance by him with respect to the Commonwealth charges. The Accused filmed members of the media and handed out leaflets in support of Monis (Exhibit BF).
	
	
	In the course of a telephone conversation with her cousin on 28 July 2013, on the eve of her and Monis appearing in Court to answer the Commonwealth charges, the Accused was heard to say (about the forthcoming hearing) “We are proud” and “We’re excited, we’re looking forward to it” and “We are strong. We are united …” (Exhibit EA, pages 15, 22 and 23).
	
	
	On 6 September 2013, after Monis and the Accused had pleaded guilty to the Commonwealth offences, the Accused filmed Monis outside the Downing Centre (Exhibit CT). The Accused smiled as she filmed Monis whilst he spoke to the media defending the letters which had been sent to families of deceased servicemen.
	
	
	It is important, at this point, to say something about the role of this evidence in the trial. The evidence of these activities sheds considerable light upon the dynamics of the unusual relationship between Monis and the Accused. There is no sign in the evidence that the Accused held political or religious views of this type prior to her meeting Monis. It is apparent that the Accused was greatly influenced by Monis’ political and religious views, which she was prepared to adopt and publicly espouse. Her actions involved her acting at the behest of Monis, in a number of different ways and over an extended period of time. There is nothing in the evidence which suggests that the Accused had abandoned these views and beliefs by the time of the killing on 21 April 2013. Indeed, things were said and done by the Accused after 21 April 2013 which point to her maintaining these views and beliefs.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that Monis wanted his former wife to be killed and that the Accused was prepared to do this both to cement her very close relationship with him and to further their plan to form a single family unit with Monis, his sons, the Accused and her daughter.
	
	
	The willingness of the Accused to act in these ways, at the behest of Monis, is relevant to the motive and state of mind of the Accused as at 21 April 2013, and her preparedness or tendency to conduct herself in extreme ways to please Monis.
	


Monis, the Victorian Bushfires and Fire as a Means of God’s Punishment


	
	Between 9 February 2009 and 7 March 2009, Monis sent letters to the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the then Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, concerning what Monis perceived as being the significance of the devastating Victorian bushfires (Exhibit DX). In effect, Monis asserted that God had used the Victorian bushfires as a means of punishing Australians for their participation in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and in anti-terrorist activities. In the letter to Premier Brumby dated 12 February 2009, Monis said:
	


“We, Australians, deserve to have an unsafe country as long as we are in a deep sleep. We, Australians, deserve to be burned in the fire of hell, the fire of bush is nothing!”


	
	In a letter of 7 March 2009 to Prime Minister Rudd, Monis said:
	


“God does not act accidentally, all acts of God are done deliberately with intention and reason/s. According to the Holy Quran, the Holy Bible, the Holy Torah and other Holy texts, God sometimes sends his punishments and/or warning signs to people by different facilities, sometimes by his angels, sometimes by his human soldiers, sometimes by nature disasters etc. Such an act is obviously a violent act but it is fair, God does not commit any unfair violence.”


	
	Entries on the Sheikh Haron website serve to emphasise Monis’ beliefs relating to the Victorian bushfires and God’s use of fire (Exhibit EL). By reference to his own letters, Monis made extravagant and extreme statements under headings such as “God is a terrorist”, “Australia’s 9/11”, “Australians deserve to be burned in the fire hell, the fire of Bush is nothing!” and “Australians will be punished!”.
	
	
	The Crown points to this material as illustrating Monis’ view concerning the use of fire in a manner which the Crown seeks to link to the use of fire in the killing of Helen Lee.
	


Monis’ Financial Position


	
	In early 2013, Monis was in a poor financial position. His bank accounts revealed small amounts only (T793-795).
	
	
	The evidence indicates that Monis had ceased his activities as a spiritual healer and clairvoyant by 2010. He was in receipt of an Austudy payment between January and March 2010, and again between June 2010 and February 2011. He received a Newstart allowance for the periods 5 March 2010 to 10 June 2010, and from April 2011 to 15 November 2013 ( T795).
	


Helen Lee Ends Relationship with Monis


	
	On 18 June 2011, Helen Lee ended her relationship with Monis (Exhibit C, paragraph 61).
	
	
	Within days of their separation, Monis reported an alleged indecent assault of his eldest son, by Helen Lee’s father. These matters were investigated, but the allegations could not be substantiated and no action was taken. The investigating detective determined that the allegations against the maternal grandfather were false and had been made by Monis with the intention of securing custody of the children. I am likewise satisfied that Monis’ allegations were false.
	
	
	On or about 2 July 2011, Monis asked Helen Lee if he could have access to the children for the weekend every fortnight. She would not allow this, but agreed to allow Monis to visit with the children in a public place at a McDonald’s store. Monis did subsequently visit with the children at a McDonald’s store on a supervised basis.
	
	
	On 22 July 2011, Helen Lee reported a domestic violence incident between herself and Monis which occurred on 20 July 2011 in the car park at McDonald’s at Hinchinbrook. During this face-to-face meeting, an argument occurred between her and Monis in relation to custody and access of their two sons. During this argument, she alleged that Monis became abusive and stated “If I can’t see the kids more than I am now, you’re going to pay, even if I have to shoot you”. Monis was later charged with an offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. A provisional apprehended violence order was made pending the hearing. The charge was ultimately dismissed on 30 May 2012 following a hearing at the Campbelltown Local Court. The effect of the court proceedings, however, was that Monis was deprived of seeing his children from 20 July 2011 until after interim orders for supervised access were made in the Federal Magistrates Court on 27 October 2011.
	


Monis Commences Custody Proceedings


	
	On 9 August 2011, Monis commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking full custody of the children. Affidavits were prepared by both parties in furtherance of those proceedings. The affidavits prepared by Helen Lee and her parents in 2011 and 2012 provided a history of the domestic relationship and conflict, during which she claimed to have been dominated, controlled and duped by Monis.
	
	
	In Monis’ affidavits from 2011 and 2012, he cited the alleged sexual abuse of his son as his principal reason for seeking sole custody. Monis also alleged that his wife had assaulted their youngest son. Both parties filed Notices of Child Abuse or Family Violence with respect to each other. Various interim Family Law orders were made with respect to these proceedings.
	
	
	In Monis’ initiating affidavit for the custody proceedings, he stated that he then lived in a two-bedroom unit in Blacktown, and that the children would share one room and he would live in another. Monis stated that the landlord would not charge him rent until the children reached 18 years of age. This reference to Monis’ landlord was a reference to Female M, who owned a two-bedroom apartment in Blacktown. Monis had bail conditions in his Commonwealth criminal proceedings to reside at Female M’s Blacktown address, and had also registered this as his address with the Roads and Traffic Authority.
	
	
	There was no mention of the Accused in any of Monis’ affidavits in the custody proceedings during 2011 and 2012.
	
	
	On 25 October 2011, interim consent orders were made in the custody proceedings which allowed Monis to have access with the children at Lollipops Play Centre in Wetherill Park, supervised by Helen Lee’s mother.
	
	
	On 20 February 2012, interim orders were made by consent in the custody proceedings for Monis to have unsupervised access at the Lollipops Play Centre. The orders provided for the maternal grandmother (or Helen Lee’s adult nominee) to attend at the handover.
	
	
	On 10 May 2012, a family consultant’s report dated 7 May 2012 (ordered by the Court in the custody proceedings) was released to the parties. The report recommended that Helen Lee have parental responsibility with Monis to have visitation rights.
	
	
	On 26 May 2012, Female M, to whom Monis was then engaged, died of natural causes in her Blacktown unit.
	


Monis Abandons his Custody Application and Proposes to File Application “in God’s Court”


	
	On 5 July 2012, Monis sent a letter to Magistrate Baumann, the presiding Federal Magistrate, complaining about the proceedings.
	
	
	At the top of the first page of the letter were the words “In the name of God” (Exhibit CI). Monis stated that he wanted to withdraw his case from the Federal Magistrates Court and to “file in God’s court”. Monis concluded the letter as follows:
	


“Now I want to tell you about my belief and I expect you to respect my idea. I believe that God is the creator of the worlds, the absolute owner of everything. In fact this is God that makes decision, not me and you. God is the decision maker, not you. This means if you order that the children must live with me, but if God decides that the children live with someone else the children will not live with me. Also if you order that the children must live with their mother, but if God decides that the children live with someone else the children will not live with their mother. I have already lodged my complaint and application file in God’s court, therefore it is useless to file my application in your court. God is my magistrate, God knows who is telling the truth and who is telling lie, my magistrate is able to protect my children from further sexual abuses, my magistrate will make the best decision for my children's best interests, I now want to withdraw my case from your court and I will rely on God's court.”

Monis and the Accused from July 2012


	
	Soon after Monis wrote this extraordinary letter, a number of significant steps were taken which shed light on the relationship between Monis and the Accused.
	
	
	On 10 July 2012, the Accused appointed Monis as the enduring guardian of her daughter in the event that she was unable to care for her daughter for any reason (T601).
	
	
	On 20 July 2012, the Accused made a will nominating Monis as her executor and the sole beneficiary of her estate (T601).
	
	
	On 27 July 2012, the custody proceedings were listed for hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court. There being no appearance for Monis, the Court vacated the hearing date and the proceedings were adjourned to 24 August 2012 for an undefended hearing, with Helen Lee to file and serve a Minute of the final orders which she sought.
	


Monis, the Accused and Child Access Visits


	
	Between 5 August 2012 and 7 April 2013, child access visits involving Monis and his two sons took place at regular intervals. A regular feature of these access visits was that the Accused and her 12-year old daughter would also attend.
	
	
	Monis videoed the child access visits between August 2012 and April 2013 (Exhibits BG and CE).
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court has had an opportunity to view and hear directly the interaction which took place between the Accused, Monis and their respective children as captured in these videos. It was common ground between the parties that Monis told his sons that the Accused’s name was “Mumi” (pronounced “Mummy”) with the boys being encouraged to call her that. As will be seen, Helen Lee became upset at this and complained to Monis about it.
	
	
	During the first access visit on 5 August 2012, the Accused acted warmly towards Monis’ sons, saying at one stage to the older boy (then eight years old) “Can I give you one kiss, cause you are so good” and she kissed the boy on the cheek. A little later, the Accused kissed the other boy (then four years old) on the cheek. Monis held out his hand towards the Accused and said to the younger boy “Kiss, kiss” and the little boy kissed the Accused on the cheek, with the Accused responding “That’s a big kiss, thank you”.
	
	
	On the second access visit, on 12 August 2012, the Accused and her daughter approached the boys with Monis saying “Mummy and [daughter’s name] … come to see you”. A little later, whilst a game was being played, Monis said to his sons “Mummy’s in the middle then” and a little later “Now, give it to Mummy”. Thereafter, Monis referred to the Accused repeatedly as “Mummy” when speaking to his sons. At one point when a game was being played, the older son called out to the Accused “Mummy, Mummy”. A little later, the Accused asked the younger boy to smile and he did so with the Accused saying to him “That’s my boy smiling, good boy” and kissing the little boy on the cheek. Soon after the Accused hugged the younger boy and said “I love you”.
	
	
	On the third child access visit at Lollipops Play Centre on 19 August 2012, the Accused and her daughter were again in attendance. At one point, Monis’ younger son used the word “Mummy” with reference to the Accused. Later on in the visit, the Accused said to the other boy “OK, Mummy’s going to have a coffee now so I’m going to sit and have a coffee. Anyone want to have a rest and sit with me?”. When the time came to leave, the Accused kissed the older boy goodbye.
	
	
	Final orders were made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 24 August 2012 in accordance with the Minute of Proposed Orders filed by Helen Lee. These orders granted her full custody with Monis being given visitation access every second Sunday between 10.00 am and 4.00 pm. The orders stated that the designated location for the exchange of custody was at Monis’ residence. The order stated that Monis was required to provide written notice of his address to his former wife. By letter dated 4 October 2012, Monis nominated the address as Unit 43/14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington.
	
	
	Monis signed an agreement to sublease the Werrington unit on 27 May 2012 from a friend, Female P. However, he did not reside at this location in any full-time capacity. The residents of the Werrington complex reported seeing Monis there infrequently, and had formed the opinion that he was there only on certain weekends. From October 2012, Monis used the Werrington address for custody exchange of the children every second Sunday.
	
	
	Throughout this period, Monis resided predominantly with the Accused and her daughter at an address in Croydon.
	
	
	On 21 October 2012, the first child access visit took place with the handover of the children occurring at the Werrington unit. Once again, Monis videoed the visit. The Accused and her daughter took part in the visit and the outing which took place during the day. The Accused played with the three children in the park opposite the Werrington unit block.
	
	
	On 4 November 2012, a further child access visit took place in which the Accused and her daughter were once again in attendance. The group went to Brighton-Le-Sands where, at one point, Monis filmed the Accused rubbing sun cream on to the back of his older son.
	
	
	A further access visit took place on 18 November 2012 with the pick-up and return of the children occurring at the Werrington unit. The Accused and her daughter attended once again and the group went on an outing to Ripples Swimming Pool at St Marys. At one point, Monis’ younger son called out “Mummy”, and the Accused told him he was a brave boy and that she was very proud of him because he was so scared. A little later, the Accused was filming Monis in the pool with his younger son. The Accused stopped filming when told to do so by Monis. Soon after, the elder boy referred to the Accused as “Mummy”. Whilst still at the swimming pool, the Accused was holding the younger son and asked him if he was warm. Monis said “Oh, very nice. You love Mummy?”. The little boy nodded and the Accused said “I love you too” and kissed him.
	
	
	Later in the afternoon of 18 November 2012, when back at the Werrington unit, the video indicated that Monis, his two sons and Female C were present. Female C told police investigators that she had been called by Monis to the Werrington unit not long before she attended. She was present there when Helen Lee came to pick them up. Female C considered that Monis had invited her to attend so that Helen Lee would see him with her (Female C).
	
	
	Monis had telephoned Female C at about 3.00 pm on 18 November 2012 inviting her to come to his unit to meet his children (Exhibit C, paragraphs 82-85). Female C attended the unit and met the two boys. Monis told Female C that the children’s grandmother was coming to pick them up and he asked her to open the door so that the children could leave. Female C opened the door and both the mother and grandmother of the boys were waiting. The boys departed and soon after Female C left. Monis had told her that he had to go and meet a friend.
	
	
	This brief appearance by Female C is the only occasion upon which a female, other than the Accused, appeared in any videos that Monis took of the child access visits.
	
	
	After the boys had been collected from Werrington on the afternoon of 18 November 2012, Monis and Helen Lee exchanged text messages in which Helen Lee complained about Female C’s presence at the unit. Monis’ text messages to his former wife included the following (Exhibit C, paragraph 85):
	


“‘..as you are aware I have withdrawn my application from your court and I have filed in a different court, so its [sic] too early to judge only after I see the result of the court. Meanwhile I will follow the order of your court. Thank you‘ and ‘I am genuinely happy that you have accepted that we should leave it to God. So then we will both leave it to God and we ask God to show us the result of accusing the innocent for getting an AVO, and selling Islam and Allah in the family court to gain custody’.”


	
	I do not consider that the limited attendance by Female C on this occasion evidenced any deeper relationship between her and Monis which bears upon the issues to be determined in this trial. The likely explanation for Monis’ sudden invitation for her to attend that afternoon was to irritate Helen Lee.
	
	
	A further child access visit occurred at the Werrington unit on 2 December 2012. The boys entered the unit and Monis told them that there was a “surprise” which would make them happy. Monis told the boys to check the unit balcony and the balcony opened revealing the Accused and her daughter. The Accused gave each boy a belt as a gift. A little later, Monis was seen on the bunk beds with the two boys, with the Accused filming. She ceased filming at the direction of Monis. The group proceeded on an outing and are seen with animals and, at one point, on an amusement ride.
	
	
	As the child access visits were fortnightly, the next scheduled visit was thought to be on 16 December 2012. It was the evidence of Jayesh Goundar (Helen Lee’s then boyfriend), that Monis had cancelled a child access visit on at least one occasion (T333). I am satisfied that no child access visit took place on 16 December 2012. If it had, Monis would have followed his invariable practice of videoing at least parts of the visit. The absence of such a video confirms the fact that no visit took place on that day, probably because Monis had cancelled it.
	
	
	The effect of this finding is that there is direct evidence that the Accused and her daughter participated in every child access visit which took place between 5 August 2012 and 7 April 2013.
	
	
	The next child access visit took place at the Werrington unit on 30 December 2012. Christmas decorations are visible in the video recording and the children are excited at what lies ahead. Monis frequently referred to the Accused as “Mummy” in the presence of the children. Presents are distributed amongst the group and the children refer to the Accused as “Mummy”. At one point whilst the group are on the unit balcony eating at a table, the younger son says “I love you” to the Accused, referring to her as “Mummy”, and the Accused replies “I love you too”. The Accused participated in the distribution of presents. The Accused gives the younger boy a guitar as a present, with Monis saying as the present is unwrapped “Oh, what is this, open it and see what is this present of Mummy”. Monis tells the boys that other presents were “Mummy’s choice”, with the Accused saying “I went to the shops and I chose this all by myself” and with Monis saying “Thank you Mummy”. Whilst the younger boy played with a toy, he calls out to “Mum” and “Dadda”.
	
	
	A by-product of the Accused’s close relationship with Monis, manifested as it was by her constant involvement in access visits from August 2012, was that there was a level of direct and indirect contact and communication between the Accused and Helen Lee. The Crown submits that activities of Monis and the Accused, particularly in the early months of 2013, were intended to place pressure upon, if not intimidate, Helen Lee and her parents.
	


Monis Uses Bikies to Intimidate Helen Lee and Her Parents


	
	The next child access visit occurred on 13 January 2013 at the Werrington unit. The group, including the Accused and her daughter, departed Werrington in Monis’ Jeep and travelled to the home of Helen Lee’s parents before moving onto the Ripples Swimming Pool at St Marys.
	
	
	On this occasion, Monis, the Accused, her daughter and the two boys drove to the residence of Helen Lee’s parents in the company of two other males on motorcycles, purportedly to collect clothing belonging to Monis. These males were members of the Mt Druitt Chapter of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang (“OMCG”), about which more will be said later in the judgment. The two Rebels OMCG members had gone with Monis “to do standover tactics on Man’s ex” (Exhibit AT, paragraph 26). Gary Clifford (about whom more will be said shortly) considered that these men “wouldn’t have done it for nothing” and that Monis “would have to have paid” them.
	
	
	Helen Lee’s mother was concerned and contacted the police who attended a short time later. Helen Lee returned to the premises whilst police were there and demanded that action be taken in relation to the incident. No criminal offences were identified by the police, but the other parties were informed that they were not welcome back at the premises.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 13 January 2013, Helen Lee attended to collect the children from Monis’ Werrington unit, accompanied by Jayesh Goundar. Monis became upset that Mr Goundar was present and asked that he not come to the unit.
	
	
	An argument occurred between Monis, Helen Lee and Mr Goundar. What was said is picked up on the video being recorded by Monis at that time. Monis told Mr Goundar that he was not to come to the unit because the court order said that the mother was to come. I observe that the order did not prohibit Mr Goundar from accompanying Helen Lee. During the ensuing argument, Helen Lee asked Monis not to bring bikie friends to her house, a reference to the incident earlier that day.
	
	
	Mr Goundar gave evidence about the incident at the Werrington unit block on the afternoon of 13 January 2013 (T327-329). He said that Helen Lee had told him about the incident involving “two bikies” accompanying Monis outside her parents’ home earlier that day, an incident that made her “really angry”. Mr Goundar said that he accompanied her to Werrington later that afternoon to “have a word” with Monis to the effect that what had happened earlier in the day should not happen again. After viewing the extract from the video taken on the afternoon of 13 January 2013, Mr Goundar said Helen Lee was “very scared” of Monis and that he (Monis) was “unpredictable”. Mr Goundar had been with her for about 17 months and she had once told him that Monis “would kill her” (T329).
	
	
	After the events of 13 January 2013, Mr Goundar did not accompany Helen Lee to Monis’ unit again. He always remained in the motor vehicle outside. It will be seen that this is what happened on 21 April 2013, the day of the killing.
	
	
	I accept the Crown submission that the actions of Monis on 13 January 2013 towards Mr Goundar were intended to discourage him from accompanying Helen Lee up the staircase to the door of Monis’ unit on future occasions, when the children were to be picked up after an access visit. This was said to point towards Monis’ plan to kill his former wife on an occasion when she came alone to his unit to pick up the boys, an event which came to pass on 21 April 2013.
	


The Child Access Visits from 27 January 2013


	
	The next child access visit took place at the Werrington unit on 27 January 2013. The boys entered the unit and a table was set for a birthday party for Monis’ younger son who had just turned five. The boys asked where “Mum” was and Monis said that “Mummy” and her daughter were there. The Accused helped to cut the birthday cake. At Monis’ request, the Accused’s daughter read a birthday card which said that it is from the other children and “Mummy”.
	
	
	On 27 January 2013, the Accused made two “000” calls to the police on behalf of Monis (Exhibits AI, AJ and AK). I am satisfied that the Accused complained in one of these “000” calls about an event which had not happened. I infer that the Accused was becoming actively involved on Monis’ side in activities intended to generate friction with Helen Lee. This conclusion is fortified by SMS messages from Helen Lee to Monis in which she complained about the Accused’s activities with the boys.
	
	
	On the evening of 27 January 2013, Helen Lee sent a text message to Monis in the following terms (Exhibit BX):
	


“Can you please ask [the Accused] not to tell the kids what to do and what not to do. During school holidays I make sure the kids go to bed at 8.30 pm and she is telling them to go to bed at 9.30 pm, this will confuse the kids. Please ask her not to try and become their mother.”


	
	Monis responded by text soon after (Exhibit BX):
	


“It’s not true. The kids have said usually they are very tired and they go to bed very late. She out of concern has advised them that it’s good to go to bed early. …”


	
	Helen Lee replied by text to that message (Exhibit BX):
	


“Kids will not lie to me. As for you and her lieing [sic] that’s possible. However, just ask her not to act like their mother. Thanks.”


	
	Monis responded by text (Exhibit BX):
	


“She has not done anything wrong that I ask her to stop. I didn’t mean that the kids are liars, like some people. I said what you told me was not true. Good night.”


	
	Further text messages were exchanged between Monis and Helen Lee that evening on the same subject (Exhibit BX). It is apparent that Helen Lee was expressing concern at the level of involvement and direction on the part of the Accused in the life of the two boys. Further, her unhappiness on these matters was being communicated to Monis and no doubt by him to the Accused.
	
	
	The next child access visit commenced at the Werrington unit on 10 February 2013. The group travelled to the Penrith Swimming Pool where they had a barbeque. At one point, Monis asked the younger boy “Do you love Mummy?” and the boy replied “Yeah”. The Accused said “I love you too”. Monis said “Do you love the food that Mummy cook, is delicious yummy”. When Monis and the boys separated from the Accused and her daughter, the Accused said “I love you”.
	
	
	The next child access visit commenced at the Werrington unit on 24 February 2013. Monis told the boys that “Mummy has bought watermelon”. One of the boys asked “Where is Mummy?” with Monis replying “Mummy is upstairs in bed”. Later one of the boys greeted the Accused saying “Hello Mummy” and she replied “Hey, how are you going?”.
	
	
	The next child access visit commenced at the Werrington unit on 10 March 2013. Later, the Accused and the two boys are seen preparing to light a barbeque with heat beads with the Accused’s daughter also present. One of the boys was holding an open packet of Redheads Extra Long Safety Matches which had been used to light the barbeque.
	
	
	On 10 March 2013, the Accused and Monis attended the St Marys Police Station to make a complaint to police concerning Helen Lee and Mr Goundar (Exhibit AL). Police made contact with Helen Lee about this. It is clear that this complaint upset Helen Lee, who regarded the complaint as being untrue. So much is apparent from her text message at 5.44 pm on 10 March 2013 to Monis which said (Exhibit BX):
	


“Enough of your and Amirah’s lies. If I get another phone call from the police I will take you back to court.”


	
	Monis responded by text later that evening (Exhibit BX):
	


“First of all I advise you to talk nicely and not to threaten me, as threatening does not help the situation. Secondly if a lady has been intimidated by a guy it has nothing to do with me even if those two people are our friends. Thirdly when she decided to go to police station so police officer asked her do U want to take the matter to court she replied no. She left the police station then I received UR threat and I shared with her, she then changed her mind and told the officer over the phone that she was returning to the station cause she had changed her mind and she wants to take Jay [Goundar] to the court. Anyway this has nothing to do with me and you, and I prefer not to intervene in their court matter. Have a nice afternoon.”


	
	Soon after, Helen Lee replied by text (Exhibit BX):
	


“My text has not been threatening, she can do as she pleases.”

And, soon after:

“I don’t like receiving unnecessary phone calls from the police.”


	
	Soon after, Monis responded, indicating that police were “trying to identify a guy who has been driving a blue Mazda … I think the reason they have called U because it’s UR car …”.
	
	
	The next child access visit was on 24 March 2013, commencing at the Werrington unit. The group travelled by train to the Royal Easter Show at Homebush. The Accused and her daughter separated from Monis and the boys after they left Homebush. Whilst Monis and the boys were on the train, travelling home, telephone contact was made with the Accused. Monis’ younger son repeatedly referred to the Accused as “Mummy” in the course of the telephone call.
	
	
	On 24 March 2013, Monis sent a text to Helen Lee expressing satisfaction that Mr Goundar “didn’t come in front of my place” and that “Mr Goundar will probably not come here anymore”, ending the text with a request that she thank Mr Goundar “that he didn’t come here again” (Exhibit BX).
	
	
	The final child access visit commenced from the Werrington unit on 7 April 2013. The group proceeded on an outing which involved skateboarding and riding on a mini-train at Darling Harbour. The Accused and her daughter were present, with the Accused holding the hands of the boys from time to time.
	
	
	On 9 April 2013, two days after the last access visit before the killing, Helen Lee texted Monis to say “Can you or Amirah not buy toy guns for kids please” (Exhibit BX).
	
	
	Monis replied soon after, “Hi how are you? Actually that’s a party toy which sprays string. OK we won’t give them such toys” (Exhibit BX).
	
	
	These text messages provide contemporaneous support for a conclusion that the Accused was taking on a form of motherly role, ingratiating herself with Helen Lee’s sons and that Helen Lee was upset at the conduct of the Accused and Monis.
	
	
	The evidence of Sonia Conciatore provided further insight into the interrelationship between Monis and the Accused on the one hand, and Helen Lee on the other. Ms Conciatore was a very close friend of Helen Lee. She gave evidence of conversations she had had with Helen Lee in the weeks and months leading up to her death on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	It is apparent from the things which Helen Lee was saying to Ms Conciatore that she was being placed under considerable stress by the words and actions of Monis and the Accused. This included activities which Helen Lee saw as the Accused purporting to act as their mother. The text messages in Exhibit BX provide contemporaneous support for these concerns which were communicated by Helen Lee, Monis and to the Accused.
	
	
	In determining what weight to give to statements made by Helen Lee to Ms Conciatore, I keep in mind that what was attributed to Helen Lee cannot be tested by cross-examination as she is dead. Having regard to all evidence touching upon this topic, however, I am satisfied that a level of conscious and intended pressure was being placed upon Helen Lee by both Monis and the Accused in the period between January and April 2013.
	
	
	The Accused was involved in communications to police which extended, at one point, to the claim that Mr Goundar had intimidated her. In light of the evidence, including that of Mr Goundar, I am satisfied that this allegation was, at the very least, a significant exaggeration on the part of the Accused.
	
	
	What is clear from the evidence is that Monis and the Accused were very close in the period leading up to 21 April 2013 and were acting jointly in a manner which, to their knowledge, caused distress and upset to Helen Lee.
	
	
	The evidence concerning the child access visits provides a solid foundation, supported by contemporaneous visual evidence, for a conclusion that Monis and the Accused were consistently acting between August 2012 and 7 April 2013 in a manner which was intended to develop a type of family unit, where Monis’ sons referred to the Accused as their mother and with the Accused’s daughter being involved constantly in the family activities.
	
	
	This is a most important body of evidence in the trial for two reasons. Firstly, it provides considerable insight into the intentions of Monis and the Accused in this period, in a manner which supports a conclusion that the boys’ mother was to be removed from the equation. Secondly, this consistent pattern of conduct throughout this period counts against any realistic suggestion that there was another woman in Monis’ life at that time whom he may have been able to recruit to murder Helen Lee.
	


Monis and the Rebels OMCG


	
	In early 2012, Monis began associating with the Rebels OMCG, firstly with the Mt Druitt Chapter and later with the Ingleburn Chapter (Exhibit C, paragraph 86ff). Monis expressed a desire to become a nominee so that he could become a full member of the Rebels OMCG. He regularly attended the Mt Druitt clubhouse on Friday evenings for social gatherings.
	
	
	Monis’ involvement with the Rebels OMCG was described in the statement of Gary Clifford dated 23 January 2014 (Exhibit AT). Mr Clifford had an association with the Rebels OMCG for more than 20 years as part of the Red, White and Blue support crew. Mr Clifford recalled Monis attending from early 2012. He said that Monis “always wore a bandana on his head and a chain on his jeans” with Mr Clifford volunteering that it “was like he’d watched too many American movies”.
	
	
	According to Mr Clifford, Monis wanted to become a nominee (“a nom”) so he could later become a member, a process which took 12 months. It is clear that Mr Clifford did not warm to Monis. Monis came across to Mr Clifford “as being fake”. Monis was “trying too hard to fit in and be accepted” and was “throwing money around for nothing and buying drinks for people”. According to Mr Clifford, most of the men at the club did not like Monis.
	
	
	In September 2012, Monis acquired a Harley Davidson motorcycle. He could only do so by obtaining assistance from Female P, who took out a loan for about $25,000.00 on Monis’ behalf (Exhibit DP). Mr Clifford said that two Rebels OMCG members had visited Monis’ Werrington unit in about October 2012. They had gone there “to check the place out” and said that “everything was under plastic and it didn’t look like anyone lived there”. Mr Clifford said that it was typical for background checks to be made on persons who wanted to be members and Monis had offered to show these people where he lived.
	
	
	In early 2013, Monis approached members of the Rebels OMCG on two occasions, soliciting assistance to have an unnamed ex-partner killed. On the first occasion, Monis approached Rebels OMCG members at the Mt Druitt clubhouse and stated that he wanted to have a woman “done in” and that he would pay to have it done. Monis had stated that he was going to lose everything if she “went through with it”, a comment that the witness took to be a reference to a divorce. It was evident to this witness that Monis wanted to have a woman killed. Monis’ approach was rebuffed. According to Mr Clifford, the Rebels OMCG member to whom Monis spoke “just laughed at Man and said we don’t do that sort of thing”.
	
	
	The second approach occurred in about January-February 2013, also at the Rebels OMCG clubhouse at Mt Druitt. Monis approached some members and raised the topic again. Monis said words to the effect “I’ve got a problem with my ex. She’s going to take my money and my kids. I’m going to do her in. Can you give me a hand?”. Again, Monis’ approach was rebuffed. Mr Clifford said “We all just walked away and left him standing there”. Mr Clifford considered that there “was something not right with [Monis]. He could have been an undercover cop or anything. No-one really knew who he was”.
	
	
	Monis also approached people individually about wanting to kill Helen Lee and about wanting to get knives and guns, but, according to Mr Clifford, “People were jack of him asking for knives and guns”.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Senior Counsel for the Accused submitted that Monis’ interactions with the Rebels OMCG demonstrated a desire on his part to bring about the death of his former wife in the months preceding her murder on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	I accept that Monis acted in this way. However, his requests were rejected summarily by Rebels OMCG members. The Crown says that, in the face of this rebuttal, Monis turned to the Accused to carry out the murder.
	


Monis’ Attempted Reconciliation with Helen Lee


	
	In late 2012 and early 2013, Monis attempted to reconcile his relationship with Helen Lee via third-party intermediaries, including a local Sheikh. These attempts at reconciliation were rejected by Helen Lee who made clear that she did not want to resume her relationship with Monis.
	


Insurance Taken Out by Monis in April 2013


	
	The Crown submitted that a series of acts by Monis provides strong evidence of his plan to murder his former wife on 21 April 2013. Reliance was placed upon his acts on 10 April 2013 in taking out insurance.
	
	
	On 10 April 2013, Monis changed his address details with the Roads and Maritime Services to 43/14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington (Exhibit C, paragraph 103). Later that day, Monis attended the Burwood office of the NRMA and took out a home contents insurance policy for 43/14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington (Exhibit EC). The home contents coverage was for $150,000.00, of which $20,000.00 was for collectables (books). Monis specifically wanted to insure the books which he described as “priceless”. However, he was unable to provide specific details about the books. Curiously, Monis also took out extra flood cover for his third-storey apartment. There had not been any previous home contents policy for these premises.
	
	
	On 12 April 2013, the Accused took out a home contents policy with NRMA with respect to her rental unit at Croydon. There had not been any previous home contents policy for these premises.
	
	
	The Crown argues, and the defence accepts, that Monis took out the home contents insurance policy in respect of his Werrington unit as an act in preparation for the murder on 21 April 2013. He knew there was going to be a fire at the unit block, and that his contents would be at risk of damage by fire, smoke and water. He intended to make a false claim in respect of a theft at the time of the killing, so as to introduce the possibility of another person who may be responsible for the murder.
	
	
	As will be seen (at [312]ff), following the murder, Monis did initially claim that his property was damaged by smoke, water and debris, but he later abandoned his insurance claim. Monis also made a claim in relation to an alleged theft at the unit.
	
	
	A further significant event occurred on 10 April 2013. Both Monis and the Accused took out life insurance policies in the sum of $500,000.00 each. Monis appointed the Accused as the sole beneficiary for his policy. The Accused appointed Monis as her sole beneficiary, after finding out that her daughter was too young to appoint as the beneficiary (Exhibit DY). These steps further fortify a conclusion that Monis and the Accused were in a very close relationship at that time, and that there was no other female in Monis’ life.
	


Removal of Documents by Monis from the Werrington Unit


	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that Monis had removed what he regarded as valuable documents from the Werrington unit prior to the killing of his former wife on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	Located during a search of Monis’ Jeep on 23 April 2013 were items including a number of Iranian documents and translations (birth certificates, a property deed, business registration records and academic records) as well as the Accused’s will (see [168] above), copies of Monis’ old passports, a change of name certificate, a lease agreement and correspondence from Monis to the Rebels OMCG.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Monis took these steps as he knew that these items were at risk of damage on 21 April 2013 because of the planned murder of Helen Lee, which he knew would involve the use of fire by the killer.
	


Monis Plans an Alibi for 21 April 2013 - An Outing with Friends Without the Accused


	
	On 13 April 2013, Monis met with some friends whom he had not seen for about three years. These were AK, a man who had met Monis soon after he (AK) had come to Australia from Iran in 2000. AK is described by initials as his son, OK, gave evidence at the trial of events which occurred when he was a child: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	The other friend contacted by Monis was Ebrahim Hossein-Noori who had first met Monis in Iran in about 1993 or 1994 (T272). He came to meet Monis again after he had come to Australia. Mr Hossein-Noori had become friends with AK. Mr Hossein-Noori had last had contact with Monis in about 2010 when he had an argument with him about Monis’ website (T273). His next contact with Monis was in March 2013 when he invited Monis to his daughter’s birthday party, but Monis did not come.
	
	
	Against this background, Monis met with AK and Mr Hossein-Noori on 13 April 2013. He told his friends that he had two children from a previous relationship. This was the first time they had heard that Monis had been married with children. At this meeting, Monis made arrangements for his friends to visit on 21 April 2013 at the Werrington unit where they would meet his children for the first time.
	
	
	Monis made no mention to his friends of the Accused at this point. Rather, Monis stated that because he did not have a wife, he could not provide food for the gathering and he asked his friends’ wives to bring some food.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that this meeting was arranged by Monis as part of his plan to account for his own movements and whereabouts on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	In preparing for his meeting with his friends, Monis calibrated the time on his Sony camera which he used on 21 April 2013 to record his movements. In subsequent searches, police seized a number of memory cards and a laptop, which included numerous videos taken by Monis during his access visits with the children (to which reference has already been made). An examination of these revealed that the time on the equipment used to video all access visits that took place between October 2012 and 7 April 2013 was incorrectly set, and was running approximately 10 minutes late.
	
	
	However, some time between 7 and 21 April 2013, the time on the Sony camera was calibrated by Monis to the correct time. The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that this was done as an act in preparation for the murder on 21 April 2013. It was submitted that this was likely done on 18 April 2013, when a call was made from the landline telephone number at the Croydon address occupied by Monis and the Accused to an automated computer time service.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Monis corrected the time on his Sony camera to ensure that it recorded the time accurately on 21 April 2013. Monis wanted to ensure he had an ironclad alibi for that day.
	


Events on the Morning of 21 April 2013


	
	At about 10.00 am on Sunday, 21 April 2013, Helen Lee drove to the Werrington unit and delivered of her sons to Monis in accordance with the prevailing order of the Federal Magistrates Court. This exchange took place in the stairwell of the unit complex, a few metres from the door to Unit 43. Monis video recorded this event using his Sony camera. The video commenced at 10.04 am within Unit 43 with the audio of a doorbell/intercom phone ringing. Monis video recorded himself using the intercom, walking to the balcony to check that the door was open and returning to the intercom and lifting the phone off the hook.
	
	
	Thereafter, Monis opened the unit door to allow the children in. Helen Lee can be partially seen in the stairwell. Monis greeted the children and, shortly after, the video clip ended. It is clear that Helen Lee did not have keys to the Werrington unit block, let alone to Monis’ unit.
	
	
	This was the first of 14 video clips taken by Monis on 21 April 2013 (Exhibits BJ and BK).
	
	
	After dropping off her children, Helen Lee returned to her residence. During the day, she exchanged numerous text messages with Mr Goundar.
	
	
	The Accused was not present with Monis when he collected the children at his Werrington unit on the morning of 21 April 2013. There was mobile phone contact between Monis and the Accused between 10.00 am and 11.00 am. The cell towers that facilitated that phone contact are consistent with Monis being at Werrington, and the Accused at her Croydon home address.
	
	
	The last phone contact between the Accused and Monis was at 10.58 am. At about 11.40 am, the Accused was seen by a neighbour at her unit complex in Croydon.
	


Monis’ Outing with his Friends and the Children to the Penrith Council Swimming Pool


	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that on 21 April 2013, Monis went to extraordinary lengths to provide himself with an alibi, to lay some groundwork to suggest that an unknown intruder killed his former wife (Exhibit C, paragraph 15ff).
	
	
	At about 11.00 am, Monis’ friends, Mr Hossein-Noori, AK and their respective wives and children arrived at the Werrington unit as arranged, to meet Monis’ sons and to engage in a social gathering. They socialised in Monis’ unit before going to the park on the opposite side of Parkes Avenue to play. Whilst at the park, Monis briefly returned to his unit to collect a ball. Upon his return with the ball, Monis told AK that he had seen someone take a photograph of him from a car.
	
	
	A short time later, Monis went back to his unit with AK to collect some food for lunch. Upon entering the stairwell of the unit block, they passed a man walking out of the stairwell. Monis said to AK, words to the effect “Why is he here? He doesn’t live in this block”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that Monis made these comments in order to introduce the possibility of unknown persons acting suspiciously in the area of the Werrington apartment block on the day of the murder.
	
	
	Monis later recounted details of these incidents, both verbally and in writing, with these versions containing a number of inconsistencies. In a letter to Detective Senior Constable Staples, the officer-in-charge of the murder investigation, dated 13 June 2013, Monis claimed that Mr Goundar was present that morning in a car, from which a woman took a photograph of him (Exhibit CM). Mr Goundar denied being involved in any such activity on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Monis falsely suggested these things to raise the spectre of a person or persons who may have been connected with the murder. They were steps taken to create a false trail which pointed away from Monis.
	
	
	After playing at the park, Monis and his friends drove in convoy in three vehicles from Werrington to the Penrith Swimming Pool. Once at the swimming pool, Monis and his friends continued to socialise together and the children went swimming. During each of these social activities, Monis made a number of short video recordings using his digital Sony camera. Monis recorded all persons present at the time and, on several occasions, turned the camera to record himself. These video clips effectively record Monis’ movements throughout the day (Exhibit BK).
	
	
	At about 3.34 pm, Helen Lee sent Monis a text message stating “Hi how are you? I will be 10 minutes late. I have been very sick in the last week and still feeling weak. Sorry about this”. Around this time, Helen Lee left her residence and drove towards Werrington, picking up Mr Goundar en route.
	
	
	At 3.49 pm, Monis commenced a video recording of the group as they packed up the picnic and prepared to depart the swimming pool. Monis commented to his sons and friends and asked everyone to help pack up so that they could go quickly.
	
	
	Monis then turned the camera towards himself and recorded a form of “selfie” showing his walk towards the pool exit, as depicted in the photograph below (Exhibit BK, page 26):
	





	
	The group talked about the picnic as they walked to their cars.
	
	
	As the camera was recording, there was talk about the time and Monis’ friend checked his phone and said “Seven to four”. Monis said “Seven minutes to four, we don’t have time”. Monis also said, “No, I think your time is not exact because this is 10 minutes to four”. Monis said this whilst panning the camera up at the wall clock near the entrance/exit to the pool. Monis zoomed the camera in on the clock, which read approximately eight minutes to four, as depicted in the following photograph (Exhibit BK, page 27):
	





	
	Monis continued to film as they all walked out to the car park and, whilst doing so, he filmed the “Penrith City Council War Memorial Swimming Pool” sign on the external wall.
	
	
	Monis’ preoccupation with discussing the time and filming clocks, as well as filming himself, demonstrated his heavy-handed attempts to record electronically his presence at a place distant from his Werrington unit as 4.00 pm approached that day.
	
	
	Upon leaving the swimming pool, Monis’ children travelled in Mr Hossein-Noori’s vehicle, as they had done on the way there. At 3.56 pm, Monis recorded a 27-second video clip which showed his sons seated in the rear of Mr Hossein-Noori’s car.
	
	
	The video clip also recorded Monis entering the driver’s seat of his black Jeep Cherokee, in which he was travelling on his own. This was the final video clip recorded by Monis on 21 April 2013.
	


Monis’ Vehicle Collision on High Street, Penrith


	
	The Crown submits, and the defence accepts, that when driving from the swimming pool, Monis staged a motor vehicle collision close to the time of the anticipated arrival of his former wife at the Werrington unit. I am well satisfied that this is what happened.
	
	
	At 4.03 pm, Monis was seen driving along High Street, Penrith with his friends following behind in convoy (Exhibits BL and BM). Outside Penrith Police Station, the Jeep driven by Monis swerved and nearly collided with a parked police vehicle. This incident was captured on CCTV footage from Penrith Police Station. The Jeep made a gradual deviation to the left as it approached the rear of the parked police vehicle. The passenger side of the Jeep passed extremely close, in a near-glancing impact, to the front driver’s side of the parked police vehicle. The Jeep’s rear brake lamps became illuminated as it drew alongside the police vehicle. The Jeep was then subject to a significant left-hand steer input towards the kerb, followed by a significant right-hand steer input to draw the Jeep parallel to the kerb.
	
	
	Investigation by the Metropolitan Crash Investigation Unit concluded that the movements of the Jeep were highly consistent with the intentional actions of a cognisant driver.
	
	
	Having failed to collide with the parked police vehicle, Monis travelled a further 240 metres along High Street, Penrith and drove into a parked Honda Jazz vehicle. The front passenger side of the Jeep collided with the rear driver’s side of the silver Honda.
	
	
	Monis complained to his friends of chest pains and requested the attendance of the police, rather than asking for an ambulance. AK attended the nearby police station to report the collision. At Monis’ request, Mr Hossein-Noori recorded the position of the collided vehicles in situ whilst Monis remained seated inside his vehicle.
	
	
	An investigation by the Metropolitan Crash Investigation Unit concluded that the crash was the result of a “driver commanded divergence” from the Jeep’s path of travel, resulting in an impact with the parked Honda vehicle. The damage to the vehicles and their position and alignment were inconsistent with an uncommanded deviation from the original path of travel. In reaching this conclusion, the investigation took into account the striking similarities between the near-crash event with the police vehicle outside the police station and the crash between the Jeep and the Honda soon after.
	
	
	The Crown contends, and the defence accepts, that the events in High Street, Penrith were orchestrated by Monis in order to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murder.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Monis’ intentional collision with a parked vehicle fortifies a conclusion that his actions that day involved an elaborate charade designed to prove that he was not at Werrington that afternoon, and particularly after 4.00 pm.
	
	
	After the collision, Monis made no attempt to contact Helen Lee and advise her of the collision. The Crown contends, and the defence accepts, that this lack of contact by Monis was inconsistent with the text message history between Helen Lee and himself, which showed a pattern of one messaging the other if one of them was running late. Monis’ failure to attempt contact with her points to his expectation that she would be dead by then or soon after.
	


Helen Lee Arrives at Werrington to Collect her Children


	
	At about 4.22 pm on 21 April 2013, Helen Lee and Mr Goundar, parked in Albert Street, Werrington. Whilst Mr Goundar waited in the vehicle, Helen Lee entered the gate to the unit complex at 14-20 Parkes Avenue, Werrington to collect her children.
	
	
	Entry by the locked security door, which led to the stairway leading to Monis’ unit, was only possible by use of a key to open the door, or by being buzzed in by somebody inside the unit with that person pressing the buzzer in the unit. Helen Lee did not have a key to the locked security door or to Unit 43. Various witnesses reported that throughout the day the security door was closed and locked, and not propped open. None of the residents of the units that shared the same secure access allowed entry to any unknown person on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Helen Lee was allowed into the locked security door by her attacker who was, at that time, inside Monis’ unit. Helen Lee had pushed the buzzer at the ground level and had been buzzed in by her attacker. It is not possible to conclude whether the attacker spoke in the process of allowing entry or remained silent, merely freeing the door by means of the buzzer.
	
	
	Helen Lee entered the stairwell and walked up towards the third level of the unit complex where Unit 43 is located. As she climbed the stairs between the second and the third levels, she was attacked by the killer who stabbed her repeatedly to her back, chest and arms before setting her alight. The evidence surrounding the killing will be considered in more detail when referring to the eye witness evidence (at [364]ff below).
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Monis had provided the attacker with keys to the locked security door on the ground floor, as well as the door to Unit 43. Both the Crown and Senior Counsel for the Accused acknowledged that the Court should make this finding. It was common ground that the Accused had keys to both these doors at the time of the killing.
	


Monis is Taken to Nepean Hospital


	
	Following the collision in High Street, Penrith after which Monis complained of chest pains, an ambulance attended the scene and transported him to Nepean Hospital for assessment. Monis’ children were put in the temporary care of Mr Hossein-Noori after Monis resisted an offer to facilitate their return to Helen Lee, by stating that she had contacted him earlier and advised that she was sick and was going to pick up the children late.
	
	
	It is the fact that at the time when Monis resisted this police offer, Helen Lee was already dead.
	
	
	On examination at Nepean Hospital, Monis’ cardio-vascular system and chest x-ray were both found to be normal. No abdominal abnormalities were identified. He had minimal tenderness to his right hand, and was observed to be moving normally around the Emergency Department. His chest pain was considered attributable to muscular-skeletal injury consistent with a motor vehicle accident. In short, I am satisfied that there was nothing physically wrong with Monis. His claim to be injured was just a further step in his elaborate charade to provide himself with an alibi.
	
	
	At 7.10 pm, the Accused called Monis. The call diverted to voicemail. Monis attempted to return the Accused’s call. Unsuccessful calls were then made back and forth between their mobile telephones.
	
	
	At 7.19 pm, the Accused successfully connected to Monis’ mobile telephone and was engaged for 120 seconds. This was the first identified telephone contact between them since 10.58 am that day.
	
	
	Before this, Monis made no attempt to contact the Accused to tell her about the traffic accident and his hospitalisation, despite making a series of phone calls to the friends with whom he had spent the afternoon (beginning at 4.16 pm and continuing throughout the evening).
	


The Accused at Croydon and Kingswood Railway Stations


	
	At 8.00 pm, the Accused appeared on CCTV at Croydon Railway Station and the nearby Café on Strand. She checked the train timetable before exiting the station onto The Strand. She then paused in front of the CCTV camera and played with her hair (Exhibits BN and BP).
	
	
	At 8.22 pm, Monis called the Accused and their phones were connected for 50 seconds.
	
	
	At 9.14 pm, the Accused appeared on CCTV footage at Kingswood Railway Station after departing from a train on Platform 2. The Accused walked around for a period of time before exiting the station onto the Great Western Highway at 9.19 pm (Exhibits BQ and BS). Below is a photograph of the Accused taken at Kingswood Railway Station at 9.19 pm (Exhibit BQ):
	




Police Speak to Monis at Nepean Hospital


	
	At about 8.45 pm, police officers spoke to Monis at Nepean Hospital, at which time he was informed of the death of his former wife. The officers sought to determine the whereabouts of Monis’ children so their welfare could be established. They repeatedly asked Monis for this information, however he was evasive and reluctant to provide details.
	
	
	The police interview of Monis, which commenced at 8.45 pm, was recorded by video (at least initially) (Exhibits AW and AX). The video tape depicts the police telling Monis that his former wife was dead. Monis stated that he was in pain and asked the police to stop the recording (Exhibit AX, Q/A43). The police officer placed the camera down, but the conversation between Monis and the police continued to be recorded. Monis asked to see a doctor, telling him that “my heart is very much beating”. An ECG was performed with no medical problem being identified. Monis gave the appearance of being distressed.
	
	
	Monis provided police with an account of his movements and whereabouts during the day, and stated that he had received a text message from his former wife which said she was sick. Monis said that he was wondering why she still had not called him and that he had been waiting for her call and would then tell her about his car accident.
	
	
	At 9.22 pm, the police officers observed Monis making a telephone call. It was a call to the Accused. Monis’ side of the conversation was recorded (Exhibit AX, Q/A178). He was heard to tell the Accused that he was at the hospital and that the police had just arrived to tell him that his former wife had died “two steps before my unit”. He told the Accused that the police wanted to see the children to make sure they were safe. Monis said that he needed to make other calls. Monis repeatedly told the Accused to wait for his call and that he would call her again when he had finished speaking with the police.
	
	
	The Accused did not attend Nepean Hospital to meet Monis even though she was close by, in the vicinity of the Kingswood Railway Station and the Great Western Highway, at about the time of this telephone conversation.
	
	
	At the conclusion of his telephone conversation with the Accused, Monis did not answer a question from the police as to the identity of the person he had been speaking to on the phone (Exhibit AX, Q/A179ff).
	
	
	Whilst speaking with police officers at Nepean Hospital, Monis asked for various details relating to the death of his former wife. He declined to answer questions regarding his current personal relationship or whom he had been talking to on the phone. Monis wanted a written guarantee signed by police that they would not tell the children that their mother had died. The officers agreed to this and Monis eventually agreed to accompany the officers to allow them to see the children and to confirm their safety at Mr Hossein-Noori’s house after his discharge from hospital. Monis was also advised that his Jeep had been towed from the accident scene in Penrith.
	
	
	Monis was filmed by CCTV leaving the hospital with police at 10.18 pm (Exhibit AY).
	


The Accused, Monis and the Three Children at Croydon on 22 April 2013


	
	On 22 April 2013, Monis, the Accused, Monis’ two sons and the Accused’s daughter were together at the Croydon unit. On the evening of 22 April 2013, Monis filmed family scenes of himself, the Accused and the three children inside the unit. The video footage contains images of the Accused cooking dinner, putting Monis’ children to bed and helping the children to put on their pyjamas and reading stories to one of them before bed time. The images may be described as happy family scenes of two adults and three children (Exhibits CQ and CR).
	
	
	It is clear that the two boys did not know at this time that their mother had died the previous day. The Crown submits that these domestic images of a family shed light upon the state of mind and intentions of both Monis and the Accused in that, within 24 hours of the murder of the boys’ mother, an apparently happy family unit has been formed and is functioning. In my view, this footage forms a telling part of the Crown case against both Monis and the Accused.
	
	
	On 22 April 2013, police officers attended the Croydon unit and spoke to the Accused at her front door. The discussion was filmed. Somewhat blurry photographs of the Accused depict part of her arms and her hands and (insofar as one can tell) there do not appear to be any visible injuries (Exhibit 10).
	
	
	On 22 April 2013, upon application by Helen Lee’s parents, a Family Law Recovery Order was issued by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia at Parramatta with respect to the two children.
	
	
	The Croydon premises were searched by police officers on 23 April 2013. At the conclusion of the search, officers served the Family Law Recovery Order upon Monis who was advised that the children were to be returned to their grandparents. The two boys were then taken by police who returned them to Helen Lee’s parents.
	


Monis Makes an Insurance Claim Which is Refused


	
	Mention was made earlier of Monis’ claim after 21 April 2013 that items had been stolen from the Werrington unit. On 30 April 2013, Monis’ legal representatives sent a letter to Detective Senior Constable Staples to advise that Monis had discovered that certain items had been stolen from Unit 43, some time after he left it on 21 April 2013 and prior to 30 April 2013.
	
	
	On 3 May 2013, Monis reported this break and enter to his insurance company, NRMA, and lodged an insurance claim for the theft of certain items. These items were initially reported as being $5,050.00 cash and a gold necklace worth approximately $4,000.00. Later six antique books were added to the list of stolen items. Monis stated that these books were valued at $3,000.00 each. Monis claimed that the offence occurred proximate to the time of the murder. He did not formally report the break and enter to police until 15 May 2013, and only after his insurance company insisted that a police event number was required to process the claim. Monis did not disclose the fact that his former wife had been murdered in the stairwell to his unit to the Police Link Operator or to the NRMA.
	
	
	Monis declined to give consent to the forensic examination of Unit 43 in relation to his break and enter report. However, an examination was conducted pursuant to a crime scene warrant on 16 May 2013 (during which Monis was present). Monis told the police that the cash and necklace were stolen from the bottom drawer of a locked two-drawer timber filing cabinet. However, the previous day, he informed an NRMA assessor that these items had been stolen from the top drawer of the same filing cabinet.
	
	
	Monis claimed the locks on the timber filing cabinets had been prised open by the thief. However, when police conducted a search of the unit on 22 April 2013, the drawer was found to be closed and locked. The drawers were later forced open by officers in order to search the contents of the filing cabinet. No cash or jewellery were located by police at the time of this search. Monis claimed that the cash and necklace had been concealed behind files in the drawer and had been stolen.
	
	
	In relation to the antique books, Monis was vague about where they had been stolen from in the unit. However, he advised the NRMA assessor and the investigator appointed by the insurance company that the books were inside a clear plastic bag located on the second or third shelf from the bottom.
	
	
	Police conducted a comparison of the internal appearance and condition of Unit 43 from photographs and videos from a number of sources between 21 April 2013 and 16 May 2013. A number of photographs and videos were located on a SD memory card, which was found inside the lining of a glasses case during a search warrant of Monis’ Clemton Park residence on 15 November 2013.
	
	
	These photographs, and a walk-through video, depicted the internal appearance of Unit 43 and were taken by Monis between 12.10 pm and 12.22 pm on 30 April 2013, which was the day he claimed that he discovered the alleged break and enter. A total of 42 photographs were taken, yet none of these photographs depicted the supposed damage to the drawers where the cash and jewellery were stolen.
	
	
	In photographs of the upstairs bedroom in Unit 43, six or seven books were visible on a shelf. These books were also visible in initial photographs taken by crime scene investigators on 21 April 2013 and during the recorded search by police on 22 April 2013. Significantly, however, these books were not on the shelf in the NRMA’s assessor’s photographs, and were not present at the time of the search on 16 May 2013. The location of these books was in the area where Monis had alleged that the antique books had been stolen. Monis told the NRMA that he did not remove anything after discovering the break and enter. However, these photographs revealed that this was not the case.
	
	
	Following examination of Unit 43 after the murder, investigators observed no forced entry or damage to the external security door. It was observed to be closed and locked when NSW Fire and Rescue arrived on the scene in response to the “000” calls. Unit 43 was not ransacked and was found to be in a clean and neat order when police officers arrived on the scene. There were many other high priced items that were not taken, such as a stereo system, plasma television, electric piano, laptop and other books of a similar description to the ones stolen. There had been no reports of any other break and enter offences for that date in the area.
	
	
	During the insurance investigation by the NRMA, Monis failed to disclose that his former wife had been murdered in the stairwell of the unit complex on 21 April 2013. In an interview with an NRMA investigator, Monis provided contradictory details of relevant information. Monis would not provide details of other key holders, and other relevant information requested by him of the insurance company. He failed to inform the investigator of the “stranger” he allegedly saw leaving the unit on 21 April 2013, although he did disclose the person in the car allegedly photographing him. Monis declined to answer certain personal questions. He could not provide any proof of ownership for the gold necklace or the antique books.
	
	
	After conducting its investigation, the NRMA refused Monis’ claim due to doubts about the veracity of Monis’ statements and his inability to demonstrate that he had suffered a loss. The company’s view was that the incident did not occur in the manner reported by Monis, if at all.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that the report of theft was made by Monis as a way of diverting attention away from the attacker by proposing a random property offender as a possible murder suspect. The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that this false report by Monis demonstrated his complicity in the murder of his former wife both before and after the fact.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the history of Monis’ insurance claim, arising from the events on 21 April 2013, provides strong support for a conclusion that Monis planned the murder, devising a false theft scenario in the process. It provides support, as well, for a conclusion that Monis did not hire a killer to whom he had paid or owed money for the killing.
	


False Allegations Made Against Helen Lee’s Father


	
	On 29 May 2013, Monis and the Accused attended the Parramatta Police Station where Monis spoke to Constable Najit Azeez (Exhibit CU). In the presence of the Accused, Monis complained that Helen Lee’s father had threatened to kill him (Monis) at the Family Court and maintained, as well, an allegation that his former father-in-law had sexually abused one of Monis’ children. Monis told police “My partner was murdered earlier this year, my children are with their grandmother and I am trying to get custody of them”. Constable Azeez took a statement from Monis dated 31 May 2013 concerning these issues.
	
	
	On 4 June 2013, Monis rang Constable Azeez and told him that he was bringing the Accused into the police station that evening. Monis and the Accused attended and the Accused had a prepared two-page statement which she handed to Constable Azeez (part of Exhibit CU). It related to her alleged fears of Helen Lee’s father and that she kept “thinking about his death threat and the fact that he is a locksmith”. In this document, the Accused purported to corroborate Monis’ allegation that Helen Lee’s father had made a death threat at the Family Court.
	
	
	When the Accused attended Parramatta Police Station on 4 June 2013 to make a statement in relation to this complaint, she was accompanied by Monis. Their conversation at the police station was lawfully recorded (Exhibits EI and EJ).
	
	
	The entire conversation between Constable Azeez, Monis and the Accused was recorded that day. Constable Azeez left the room on two occasions with the Accused and Monis discussing the matters in his absence. The Crown seeks to rely upon what Monis and the Accused said on this occasion. It is these parts of the conversations upon which the Crown seeks to rely. The Crown contends that, whilst the police officer was out of the room, Monis and the Accused were effectively rehearsing what was to be said to the police officer concerning their alleged fears of Helen Lee’s father, and an assertion that the fact that he was a locksmith was relevant to those fears. The Accused said things to Monis whilst the police officer was absent which fit this formula.
	
	
	Some of the things said in the absence of the police officer were repeated later in the recorded conversation (Exhibit EJ, pages 63, 79, 82, 88 and 94).
	
	
	In addition, Monis told the Accused to answer “No comment” in the event she was asked about events on 21 April 2013 and she adopted this course (Exhibit EJ, pages 10, 88).
	
	
	Prior to the Accused being interviewed, and whilst police were absent from the room, Monis said to the Accused “Don’t shy if he asks you questions about 21st April, don’t shy, just say that …”. The Accused said “I will not shy” and Monis said “I know just say that … this matter … I won’t make any comment, anything I say about this matter and if there is anything else, whatever you like to say, just don’t shy”.
	
	
	Constable Azeez took a statement from the Accused about her allegations. He said that the Accused was “argumentative” and when he asked probing questions about her relationship with Monis, Monis’ children or her knowledge of Helen Lee’s father “she became rude and stated ‘No comment’, I don’t see why that is relevant” (Exhibit CU).
	
	
	The Crown alleges that Monis and the Accused were both making knowingly false allegations about Helen Lee’s father. Helen Lee’s father denied these allegations (Exhibit CU). The Crown submitted that this was a further example of the Accused doing Monis’ bidding in a context where she well knew that the allegations were false. I will return to the events at Parramatta Police Station later in the judgment (at [613]ff).
	


Monis Points to Suspects for Murder


	
	On 13 June 2013, Monis wrote to Detective Senior Constable Staples providing information concerning the murder of his former wife. He asserted that the “main suspect” was her father, providing a lengthy explanation for his suspicion. Amongst other things, Monis alleged that Helen Lee’s father “chose a very close location to my unit as a cover” to try and make it look like Monis had killed his former wife. He asserted, once again, that the fact that Helen Lee’s father was a locksmith may have given him “easy access to any lock”.
	
	
	The “second suspect” provided by Monis was Mr Goundar. As to other possible suspects, Monis used the term “so many enemies” which he attributed to Helen Lee’s mother.
	
	
	At a later time, Monis proposed (to Detective Senior Constable Staples) to have the Accused wired up for the purpose of having a conversation with a member or members of the Rebels OMCG, allegedly without the Accused knowing why this was happening. Detective Senior Constable Staples gave evidence that this suggestion was far-fetched and was not acted upon (T624-628, T904-906).
	
	
	Between 14 May and 14 November 2013, Monis, the Accused and the Accused’s daughter were living together at premises in Clemton Park (Exhibit A, Tab 6).
	


Monis and the Accused are Arrested and Charged


	
	On 15 November 2013, Monis and the Accused were arrested in Campsie following a vehicle stop, and both were charged with offences related to the murder.
	


Monis Solicits Prisoners to Murder Helen Lee’s Father in November 2013


	
	Whilst in custody, Monis asked two different fellow prisoners, on different occasions, to have criminal groups assist in murdering Helen Lee’s father. Monis suggested to these prisoners that payment for the killing may result from items of value to be found in the premises of the proposed victims. Both requests were rejected by the prisoners in question (T889-890).
	


Monis and Accused Extract Apology from Soula Droudis in February 2014


	
	On 19 November 2013, Detective Senior Constable Staples interviewed Soula Droudis (the Accused’s mother). The interview was videotaped (Exhibits 35 and 36). In this interview, Soula Droudis sought to recant some of the things which she had told the police when they had visited her at her Belmore address on 25 April 2013. In the recorded interview of 19 November 2013, Soula Droudis indicated (amongst other things) that Monis was a “liar” and had “told lies” (T582).
	
	
	On 27 January 2014, a brief of evidence was served on the Accused and Monis. That brief contained a copy of the video where Soula Droudis had called Monis a liar (T582).
	
	
	On 20 February 2014, the Accused and Monis, both at this time on bail, visited Soula Droudis at her Belmore home. During that visit, Soula Droudis, who was clearly unwell and was breathing with the assistance of an oxygen mask, made an apology (in both English and Greek) to Monis which was recorded by the Accused on her mobile phone. The conversation between them was as follows (Exhibits BZ and CA):
	


“SOULA: I'm very sick. I'm very, very sick long, long time. Michael, I'm sorry  I been wrong to you.

MONIS: What do you mean?

SOULA: The time police come I'm very sick, I'm very upset for my heart. I'm very, really very upset. I'm sorry to you.

MONIS: O.K. Why sorry to me, what you say sorry for?

SOULA: Because I say you lies some now sorry. O.K. I can't talk no more.

MONIS: What you have to, you, I lie? What do you mean? Because you have to, I lie you are sorry?

SOULA: I don't know. The time police come here I talk about you, a few words, I'm very, very sick, I say to police you lies. I say to you now I'm sorry. I'm very sick.

MONIS: When lie to you?

SOULA: All right. You lies, no lies, maybe I'm wrong. I'm very sick, I'm very upset.

MONIS: No, I mean um, you’re saying you are sorry, do you mean that you believe that I have lied to you?

SOULA: I say to you I be wrong. I'm very sick, I can't talk more. Very sick.

MONIS: That's fine, that's fine, no problem.”


	
	It is apparent from the video that Soula Droudis was in a distressed state as the apology was given.
	
	
	On 30 April 2014, a document was prepared by Monis, being a draft statement designed for signature by Soula Droudis (Exhibit DU). The draft statement included the following:
	


“By the way, last year when my daughter and Mr Monis were in jail, police came to my house, I was sick and very upset, so I said a few words against Mr Monis. Those words were not true, I was sick and angry and I couldn't understand what I was saying, later I felt bad, so I said to my daughter that I feel bad and I want to apologise to Mr Monis. Then my daughter suggested to record it, I agreed. My daughter called Mr Monis, he came out of the room and I apologised to him while my daughter was filming. I am happy if my daughter, Amirah Droudis, or Mr Monis want to use this statement or those two videos as evidence for court.”


	
	Although apparently not signed by Soula Droudis, this draft was clearly intended to be read in conjunction with the filmed apology of 20 February 2014.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, quite apart from demonstrating Monis’ manipulative character, the incident on 20 February 2014 provided a telling insight into the relationship between Monis and the Accused, with the Accused being prepared to film what must have been a traumatic process for her sick mother apologising to Monis for things which she had said about him. It was submitted that the Accused was prepared to act at Monis’ direction, in subjecting her own unwell mother to this highly stressful experience solely to serve Monis’ purposes.
	


Continuing Close Relationship Between Monis and the Accused in 2014


	
	From March 2014 to December 2014, the Accused and her daughter and Monis (when not in custody) were living at premises in Wiley Park (Exhibit A, Tab 6).
	
	
	On 22 April 2014, the Accused wrote to Monis who was, at that time, once again in custody, this time as a result of having been charged with sexual assault offences (T607). The letter (Exhibit CL) demonstrates the depth of feeling which the Accused had for Monis at that time. In addition, it illustrated the Accused’s continuing adherence to religious beliefs which accorded with those of Monis.
	
	
	The Accused states that she and her daughter (who had also converted to Islam) “are still practising the last few verses of Ayat ul Kursi, as we still haven’t learnt it completely”. She states that she had “downloaded Mafatih in English, so [she] will start to read this”. In the course of the letter, the Accused states:
	


“Habibi, I love you very, very, much and I miss you so much I wish you were here with us at home. I am crying as I write this. I am praying for you Habibi, and I am asking Allah to bring you home soon.”


	
	The letter concludes with similar terms of endearment:
	


“I love you very, very, very much and I miss you very, very, very much and I can’t wait to see you.”


	
	On 31 July 2014, a number of photographs of Monis were taken using the Accused’s mobile telephone. Monis is wearing a headband containing Arabic script which stated “We are your soldiers Mohammed, may Allah honour him and grant him peace”. The photographs were taken whilst Monis was sitting in the Wiley Park premises occupied by Monis, the Accused and the Accused’s daughter (T645).
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Accused took these photographs whilst Monis posed for them. Apart from evidencing the continuing relationship between Monis and the Accused at that time, the photographs point more importantly to the preparedness of the Accused to assist Monis in a measure which involved the display of extremist religious content.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon this as a further piece of evidence which, when taken together with earlier events, demonstrated a continuing close relationship between Monis and the Accused, since about 2007-2008, with the Accused being prepared to act at the behest of Monis, in a range of ways in expressing or communicating Monis’ extremist views, and with the Accused seeming to adopt these views uncritically.
	


Conclusions Concerning Role of Monis in the Murder of Helen Lee


	
	I have outlined at some considerable length, Monis’ background, his relationship with his former wife and their sons, his relationship with the Accused, and his actions before, during and after the events on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that Monis planned and put into effect the murder of Helen Lee. This conclusion has been reached following an assessment of a variety of pieces of the evidence which lead inexorably to this conclusion.
	
	
	The principal factors which have led me to this conclusion are as follows:
	



	
	Monis had broken up with Helen Lee and there was no prospect of reconciliation by April 2013;
	
	
	Monis understood that the proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court would not result in him obtaining custody of his sons - faced with this reality, in July 2012, Monis declared to the presiding Magistrate that his complaint had now been filed “in God’s court” and that “God is the decision maker, not you” - in his own warped way, Monis saw himself as being the instrument to carry out God’s wishes;
	
	
	although Monis proceeded between August 2012 and 7 April 2013 by way of access visits with the children, it was his clear intention to have custody of the two boys so that a single-family unit could be created between himself, the Accused, his sons and her daughter;
	
	
	although many of Monis’ activities were bizarre, it was especially unusual that he sought to associate with the Rebels OMCG - in early 2013, he solicited unsuccessfully members of that group to kill his former wife - this was clear evidence of his intention to remove her from the picture so as to clear the way for Monis to have custody of his sons;
	
	
	eight days prior to 21 April 2013, Monis invited old friends (Mr Hossein-Noori and AK and their families) to spend the day with him and his sons on 21 April 2013 - this was a very curious and uncharacteristic invitation, with Monis not revealing his then relationship with the Accused and with the plans for that day being quite different to the pattern of access visits which had taken place, and had involved the Accused and her daughter, between August 2012 and 7 April 2013;
	
	
	I infer that Monis corrected the time on his Sony video camera prior to 21 April 2013 to ensure that it would record the time accurately on that day - he had shown no concern in this regard in the preceding months during which access visits and other events were videoed with entirely inaccurate times being displayed - I infer that Monis was taking steps to ensure that his planned videoing of events on 21 April 2013 was accurate so as to fortify his plan to give himself an ironclad alibi for the time of the murder which he knew was to take place;
	
	
	the activities of Monis on 21 April 2013 would seem farcical if they were not so serious - Monis and his friends met at the Werrington unit and later visited the Penrith Swimming Pool with Monis frequently videoing events (and himself) and noting the correct time, both verbally and visually - after leaving the Penrith Swimming Pool, Monis intentionally drove into another vehicle in the vicinity of the Penrith Police Station so as to attract attention to himself, including police and ambulance attention - these things were happening at the time of the planned murder of his former wife - Monis was taken to Nepean Hospital although not suffering from any real injury, where he remained until police visited that evening with Monis feigning shock and distress when police told him of the murder;
	
	
	on 10 April 2013, Monis had taken out contents insurance including water damage insurance for his third-storey unit which was not at risk of water damage from any natural event - I infer that Monis expected the murder of Helen Lee to take place, with fire to be used which would need to be extinguished by emergency services - he intended to claim that items had been stolen from his unit so as to support a false scenario that his former wife was killed in the course of a random crime committed in, or in the vicinity of, his unit;
	
	
	after the murder, Monis in fact made an insurance claim which was readily and quickly identified as a false claim, thereby supporting an inference that this was a type of cover planned by him to distance himself from the murder as well as a means of making money;
	
	
	the very next day, 22 April 2013, Monis, the Accused, Monis’ sons and the Accused’s daughter were apparently living a calm, normal and unremarkable domestic existence in the Croydon unit, giving all the signs of ordinary family life - Monis had achieved his plan to have custody of his sons now that Helen Lee was dead, and with a new family unit being established with the Accused and her daughter living under the same roof as Monis and his sons;
	
	
	after the murder, Monis went to considerable lengths to make false allegations against Helen Lee’s father of sexual abuse of one of the boys and of the murder of Helen Lee, with an allegation of murder also being levelled against Mr Goundar - these allegations were intended to divert police attention from Monis and the Accused;
	
	
	it is clear that the killer had been provided with keys to both the outer security door and also the door to Unit 43 of the Werrington apartment block - I readily infer that it was Monis who provided these keys to the killer.
	



	
	The Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that Monis planned the murder of his former wife, which was to take place on 21 April 2013 and that he arranged for someone to carry out the murder on his behalf.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the person who carried out the murder was the Accused. I now turn to consider that critical issue for the purpose of the trial.
	


Has the Crown Proved Beyond Reasonable Doubt that the Accused was the Killer?


	
	Much of the narrative of the relationship between Monis and the Accused, and of events which occurred over a period of years up to 2014, has been set out in the course of considering the position of Monis with respect to the murder. I will seek to avoid any unnecessary repetition in considering the position of the Accused.
	


Has the Crown Proved Beyond Reasonable Doubt that the Killer was a Woman?


	
	The Crown submitted, and the defence accepted, that the Court would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killer was a woman. It is for the Court to consider whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case.
	
	
	At the outset, I express my satisfaction that the evidence does demonstrate that the killer was female and that this has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence of the persons at the Werrington apartment block demonstrate this feature beyond any doubt.
	


Events at the Werrington Apartment Block after 4.00 pm on 21 April 2013


	
	At about 4.00 pm on 21 April 2013, Helen Lee met Mr Goundar and drove to the Werrington apartment block for the purpose of picking up her sons after the access visit. She drove the car and parked it in Albert Street. They arrived at about 4.20 pm or 4.25 pm (T334). Mr Goundar remained in the vehicle. After a time, Mr Goundar noticed that police and the fire brigade came to the building. At about 4.36 pm, he tried to call Helen Lee unsuccessfully (T335). Mr Goundar became increasingly concerned and in due course he came to speak to Detective Megan Oxley (T336).
	
	
	After leaving Mr Goundar in the vehicle, Helen Lee entered the grounds of the apartment block and approached the outer security door. She pressed the buzzer and was let in by the killer who was, at that time, inside Unit 43. She mounted the staircase and reached the intermediate landing between the second and third floors.
	


Evidence of Wayne Morris


	
	What then occurred is best described through the evidence of Wayne Morris, who occupied Unit 40 on the top level where Unit 43 was also located.
	
	
	Mr Morris was watching football on television when he heard a noise outside his unit door. He described in evidence-in-chief what happened next (T57-59):
	


“Q. Would you tell us as best you can what you heard initially? 

A. I heard a loud scream and it was a lady's voice and she was screaming out ‘I've got children, I've got children’, that's what I heard, and I got off the lounge and went to the door. Do you want me to keep going? 

Q. Yes, please. 

A. Then I looked through the peephole, and I saw a person in dark clothing going like that with a knife (indicated), stabbing in a downward motion, and there was a person on the ground trying --- it looked to me she had her hand up trying to defend herself, and then I --- 

Q. Pause there. Could I ask you to stand up and to demonstrate with your hand the action that you saw the woman in black doing? 

A. I can't tell you which hand it was, I can't remember, at the time I couldn't even say but it was just going up and down like that (indicated). 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: For the record, it is a stabbing motion from about head level down to about waist level that he has demonstrated. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. 

WITNESS: The person was on the ground ---

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. The other person, woman, who presumably you had heard calling out, was on the ground? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Was she entirely lying on the ground? 

A. That is what I could see, yes. She was on the ground and it looked to me she had an arm up trying to protect herself. 

Q. The woman who was doing the stabbing motion ---

A. She was leaning over the body, yes. 

Q. You were looking through a peephole in your door? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And are you able to tell us for how long you looked through that peephole? 

A. Obviously it happened really quick. 

Q. Please sit down. 

A. I saw --- to me I saw --- it was so surreal. I saw at least three to four like stabs, and then the lady just, the person on the ground, just went quiet and everything just went quiet, and then I don't know where the knife went. All of a sudden there was a plastic bottle in the lady's hand and she was pouring it over the body. 

Q. Can you tell us what size bottle it was? 

A. It looked like a 600ml Coke bottle, but it was clear. It didn't have a wrapper or anything like that on it. 

Q. No label that you could see? 

A. No. 

Q. Did you actually see her pouring liquid from the bottle? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Where was she pouring liquid? 

A. All over the body. 

Q. At that stage, was the woman on the ground moving at all? 

A. No. 

Q. You were still looking through your peephole? 

A. Yep. 

Q. Did you hear the woman on the ground or did you hear any calling out other than ‘I've got children’? 

A. No, all I heard was a loud scream, and then ‘I've got children, I've got children’.”


	
	The Senior Crown Prosecutor asked Mr Morris what happened next (T59):
	


“Q. Having seen all that, what did you then do? 

A. Obviously I was afraid, and I didn't go out there at first because when she had the knife because I was scared. I didn't think it was really happening, I couldn't believe it. Then when I saw her pouring the liquid on the body, I was on the top floor so I thought ‘I'm in trouble here, I need to stop her from doing it’. I knew, I just knew what was going to happen, so I opened up the door and ran out to the railing, and she was on the other side, and I tried to scare her off, you know, from lighting up the body because I knew I was on the top level. 

Q. What did you say? 

A. I just said, ‘Don't, no’. And she screamed back at me, ‘No, you go in there’. Just the rage in her face was --- yeah. And then she said, ‘Go back in there’ and I mentioned ‘I can't, I can't get down’, you know. 

Q. When she addressed you and said those words, can you describe the way in which she said those words? 

A. She was angry at me, she was very angry. She looked at me --- I have said all along that she made me feel that I did something wrong. I felt, like --- for a long time, I felt, yeah, I was, I did something wrong. --- That is how she made me feel, and it was very --- she was very very in a rage. It was a pretty scary moment. 

Q. Can you describe the voice to us? 

A. The voice? Imagine a --- it was definitely a female and imagine a female screaming at you after doing something like that. Well, that's what it was.”


	
	Mr Morris was asked to describe the appearance of the attacker (T61-62):
	


“Q. Can you describe to us as best you can the appearance of the attacker, her clothing, anything else that you remember about her? 

A. Well, I didn't know what the clothing was called at first but it looked to me --- it was a Middle Eastern clothing that they wear. Like she had the --- it came around like that, around her face like that (indicated). 

Q. Indicating around the face from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin in a circular motion? 

A. Yes, and it was all loose material that went down pretty long. I am not sure if it actually went straight down to the floor, but it was pretty long and it was like one whole piece that went down, and she had her headpiece on that was like loose. 

Q. What colour? 

A. It was all black. 

Q. Were you able to see her face? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Was there any other part of her head that you were able to see apart from her face? 

A. Only the face, yeah. 

Q. Were you able to see her hands at all? 

A. I can't recall the hands, like, yeah, no. 

Q. Can you describe any other clothing that she was wearing? 

A. No. 

Q. At the time, what was the name that you gave to the headdress that she was wearing? 

A. Middle Eastern clothing. 

Q. At the time when you made your first statement to the police, did you call it a burqa? 

A. Yes, I did call it a burqa. I didn't know the difference between them.”


	
	Mr Morris was asked to provide a description of the attacker (T62-63):
	


“Q. Can you give us any idea about anything else to do with this attacker about her appearance? 

A. About her appearance? Just she, yeah, she just scared me. She was very like --- 

Q. Can you give us a description of her? 

A. She was chubby. I tried to say that in my statement in a polite way. Like to me she was bigger than me, obviously, she was plump. 

Q. Talking about face, body or both? 

A. Face, body, body size. She wasn't thin or anything. She was, you know, medium build, like medium height, I mean. 

Q. Are you able to estimate how tall she was? 

A. She was on a step below me. She was just a little bit shorter than I was, probably, I reckon she was about my height, probably a little bit taller. 

Q. What is your height? 

A. About 5 foot 3, 5 foot 4, something like that. 

Q. Do you know in centimetres? 

A. 160, 162, something like that. 

Q. What do you say about your height compared to her height? 

A. She is probably about the same, probably a little bit taller. 

Q. The shape of her face? 

A. She had a roundish face, it was. 

Q. Did you notice anything else about her? 

A. Just she had like dark eyes, like the eyes, like, you understand, she was in a rage, and it was, yeah. 

Q. Did she have dark eyes? 

A. Yeah, darkish eyes. 

Q. What about her skin colour? 

A. She was darker than I was, just a little bit darker, like brown, yeah. 

Q. Can you say that again? 

A. She was a little bit darker than I am. 

Q. Did you come to any conclusion at the time about which part of the world she may have come from? 

A. To me like she looked Middle Eastern, to me, yeah, she was from a Middle Eastern country, but that could have --- she had the clothing on, too, so.”


	
	Mr Morris described the conclusion of his observations in the following way (T63):
	


“Q. After you had told this attacker to stop and she had told you to go back into your unit, did you see her do something? 

A. As soon as I said ‘no’ and she told me --- 

Q. You said ‘no’? 

A. When I said, ‘Don't, no’, she said, ‘Go back in there’. She said, ‘No, go back in there’ and I said, ‘No, I can't get down’, and all of a sudden she has gone like that with her hand (indicated) like she has thrown something on the body. 

Q. Stand up, perhaps if you could come out here and face his Honour and show us the motion. 

A. She was looking at me, she was facing this way, looking my way and then the body is there and she has just gone like that (indicated) and then ran down the stairs, and I have ran in because it went up straight way.”


	
	Mr Morris explained his fear concerning the fire started by the attacker on his floor of the building, and the “000” call which he made (T68):
	


“Q. Mr Morris, after the observations that you made that you told us about before lunch, did you go back inside your unit and grab your mobile phone? 

A. I ran to --- my daughter's got a little coffee table between my front door and the lounge and my phone was sitting on that and I ran to that straight away because I knew I thought I was in big trouble obviously, so I ran, grabbed my phone and ran to the balcony where the sliding door was and as I was going to the sliding door, I could see black smoke coming under the door already and the door was changing a different colour and I ran out on the balcony and screamed out for help and tried to explain what was going on and I was trying to see if I could find a way down and I grabbed a ladder and people were ---

Q. You were on your balcony at this stage? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What sort of condition were you in at this time? 

A. I thought I was going to die, I really did. I ended up on the phone to triple 0, people telling me not to get on the roof, I had people --- was a guy downstairs that pulled a mattress out and told me to jump. I was on the phone with triple 0, I can't recall how long, but then when I heard the fire engine coming, I heard sirens, I rang --- I rang --- I rang my ex wife and told her that not to tell Zoe. I was in a panic obviously and I told her to tell my daughter that I loved her. 

Q. You were very upset? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. Eventually some firemen came and you were rescued from the balcony of your unit? 

A. Yes.”


	
	It was an agreed fact that Mr Morris’ “000” call was made at 4.27.54 pm on the afternoon of Sunday, 21 April 2013.
	
	
	Mr Morris was assisted out of the building by firemen.
	
	
	On 23 April 2013, Mr Morris attended St Marys Police Station where he undertook a photographic identification procedure involving 20 head and shoulder photographs of females displayed, one by one, on a computer screen. Mr Morris did not select the photograph of the Accused. He selected the photograph of another woman (who had no connection to the offence) and expressed the view that it was “100 per cent that’s her” and “That’s her screaming at me” (Exhibit O, Q/A24-Q/A27).
	
	
	The Court was informed that the photograph of the Accused, which was used for the purpose of the photographic identification process, had been obtained by Roads and Maritime Services for the purpose of her driver’s licence.
	
	
	To the right below is the photograph of the Accused contained in the photographic array shown to Mr Morris (Exhibit F). To the left below is the photograph selected by Mr Morris:
	





	
	Earlier in the judgment (at [78]-[86]), I referred to factors to bear in mind in assessing photographic identification evidence. It was submitted for the Accused that Mr Morris’ identification of a person other than the Accused is exculpatory and assists the Accused in the trial. The Crown submitted that the person selected by Mr Morris is very similar to the Accused so that the evidence is capable of supporting the Crown case.
	
	
	I bear in mind that the observations of Mr Morris occurred in dramatic and highly charged circumstances (when Mr Morris understandably feared for his own life) and where he could only see the facial features surrounded by the head dress worn by the attacker. The events occurred relatively quickly although Mr Morris had an opportunity to see the attacker at reasonably close range and face to face. I have kept in mind the level of certainty which he expressed in his selection of a photograph of another person. At the same time, I note that the level of confidence of an identifying witness is not necessarily a reliable factor in the identification process.
	
	
	I have carefully considered the photograph of the Accused and the photograph of the female selected by Mr Morris, together with other photographs of the Accused which are in evidence. In particular, there are photographs of the Accused depicting her facial features in a range of circumstances between 19 July 2012 and 9 April 2013 (Exhibit DV). One of these photographs, which depicts the Accused and Monis on 9 April 2013, appears at [568] below. An examination of these photographs provides considerable assistance to an assessment of the photographic identification process undertaken by Mr Morris.
	
	
	As the above photographs illustrate, the 20 photographs used all involve images of the head and neck of each person only. Mr Morris, and the other persons who examined these photographs, did not have the advantage of a full-body view which applies at a line-up, nor the advantage of observing persons moving as may be seen, once again, in a line-up. The limitations of photographic identification referred to at [82]-[83] above are illustrated in this case.
	
	
	In my view, the process of identification undertaken by Mr Morris assists the Crown case. There is a marked similarity between the photographs of the Accused and the person depicted in the photograph selected by Mr Morris. Mr Morris was in the best position to see the attacker, with whom he also spoke, albeit under circumstances of great stress. What is also of importance in the evidence of Mr Morris is the description of the attacker as being “chubby” or “plump”, terms which the evidence reveals were apt descriptions of the Accused as at 21 April 2013, as the photograph at [298] demonstrates.
	


Evidence of Peta Drzewiecki


	
	Peta Drzewiecki was living in Unit 25 with Jonathon Truupold as at 21 April 2013. Unit 25 was located on the middle floor of the block below Mr Morris’ floor. Ms Drzewiecki stated that, at about 4.25 pm on 21 April 2013, she was standing in her kitchen and heard a disturbance in the stairwell. The Crown asked (T83):
	


“Q. Can you tell us anything about the gender of any voice? 

A. Female. 

Q. What can you tell us about the voice, what was it doing? 

A. Screaming, loud screeching, that sort of thing. 

Q. Could you tell whereabouts in your unit block it appeared to be coming from? 

A. From the stairwell.”


	
	Ms Drzewiecki explained that Mr Truupold had left the unit to find out what was happening, and had returned soon after saying that “There was a fire upstairs” (T85). Ms Drzewiecki rang “000“ at 4.28.33 pm.
	
	
	After making the “000” call, Ms Drzewiecki opened her unit door (T86-87):
	


“Q. So towards the end of that call, did you go and open the door of your unit? 

A. Yes. 

Q. As you opened the door, what did you see? 

A. I saw a female and Jonathan. Jonathan was further down the staircase and the female was running down the staircase. 

Q. When you say ‘the staircase’, was that the staircase from your level to the second floor? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Which way was this woman and Jonathan coming? 

A. Down. 

Q. Who was in front of whom? 

A. They sort of --- the female passed Jonathan. 

Q. As she passed Jonathan, are you able to say how quickly she was moving down the stairs? 

A. Relatively quickly. 

Q. What was Jonathan doing? 

A. Moving slower, heading back down the stairs. 

Q. About how many stairs separated this woman and Jonathan when you first saw her? 

A. I couldn't say. 

Q. At that time, was there still daylight? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Was the hallway well illuminated? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Was there a window in the stairway? 

A. Yes, there is. 

Q. Had you ever seen that female before? 

A. No. 

Q. Did she go past you as you are standing at your front door? 

A. Yes. 

Q. At the moment when she was the closest to you, how far away from you was she? 

A. Less than a metre. 

Q. Please give us your best description of this woman, what she looked like, what she was wearing, what you remember of her? 

A. Dark clothing, dark burqa that covered the hair. 

Q. When you say a ‘burqa’, could you describe what you mean by a ‘burqa’? 

A. Cloth that was wrapped around the head and around the front of the throat. 

Q. Did it leave her face open? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Could you see her hair? 

A. No. 

Q. Are you able to say what colour the burqa was? 

A. I would say dark, so black or navy. 

Q. How far down did it go? 

A. To her shoulders. 

Q. Can you remember anything else about her clothing? 

A. When she had gone past me heading for the stairwell that runs further down, she had her shirt tucked into the back of her pants and she was wearing dark pants.”


	
	Ms Drzewiecki said that the woman was carrying a “small bag” on her right shoulder (Exhibit K).
	
	
	Ms Drzewiecki provided a more detailed description of the female (T89-90):
	


“Q. You told us that she was wearing dark pants, I think you said black pants? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What about upper garment? 

A. Dark coloured top. 

Q. Can you tell us anything else about her appearance, her body shape, her face, anything else you can tell us? 

A. She had large eyes, roundish eyes. 

Q. Yes? 

A. That is probably --- 

Q. Anything about her eyebrows? 

A. They were very defined, very dark in comparison to skin tone. 

Q. What can you tell us about her skin tone? 

A. From memory, she was olive complexion. 

Q. Her height? 

A. Shorter than myself, 5'6, 5'7. 

Q. What is your height? 

A. 5'11. 

Q. Anything about her build? 

A. Slender to medium. 

Q. Are you able to say which shoulder she was carrying the bag on? 

A. On the right. 

Q. Did she appear to see you? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did she say anything to you? 

A. No, she was making noises. 

Q. She was? 

A. Making noises. 

Q. What sort of noises? 

A. Kind of like a moan or a whimper, not a cry, but that sort of repetitive --- it is hard to describe. That is probably as far as I can go. 

Q. Can you demonstrate to us the sort of noise? 

A. It was kind of like an ‘oh oh oh’, that sort of thing but higher pitched.”


	
	On 22 April 2013, Ms Drzewiecki attended the St Marys Police Station where she participated in a photographic identification procedure involving the same 20 photographs which were shown to Mr Morris (in a different order). Ms Drzewiecki selected a different photograph of a person as being “similar” to the female she had seen (Exhibits L, M, N and P).
	


Evidence of Jonathan Truupold


	
	Mr Truupold said that, between 4.00 pm and 4.30 pm on 21 April 2013, he was alerted by Ms Drzewiecki to a disturbance coming from the stairwell (T99). Mr Truupold described what he heard (T99):
	


“Q. What did you hear? 

A. I heard what seemed to be screaming or a loud noise from the stairwell. 

Q. Are you able to say what gender the person appeared to be who was screaming? 

A. It appeared to be a female voice. 

Q. Could you hear just one voice or more than one? 

A. More than one. 

Q. Where did it appear to be coming from? 

A. It came or appeared to be coming from the stairwell, so obviously somewhere outside our unit door.”


	
	Mr Truupold explained what occurred next (T100):
	


“Q. As a result of hearing that, did you go and open the front door of your unit? 

A. Yes, I did. 

Q. Did you take a few steps outside your unit? 

A. I did. 

Q. At that point, did you hear or see anything in particular? 

A. There seemed to be no noise as I left the unit door. I then took a couple of steps towards the upstairs level. 

Q. What did you see? 

A. As I took the first few steps and looked upwards, there were flames erupted in front of me. 

Q. Did you smell anything at that time? 

A. It seemed to be some sort of chemical fire, as in like kerosene or something like that. 

Q. Was the fire already in existence when you looked at it or did it start as you were looking up? 

A. As I took the couple of steps, it erupted in front of me. 

Q. How far up the stairs? 

A. I only took two or three stairs. Because of my height the railing was slightly above me and the flames came through the railing more or less directly in front of my face. 

Q. Shortly after that did you notice some smoke? 

A. There seemed to be black smoke coming from the fire, quite thick. 

Q. Did you then turn back around, go down those few steps and knock on the door of another unit on your floor, the first floor, unit number 24, and yell out that there was a fire? 

A. Yes, I did. 

Q. Was there any response from unit 24? 

A. No, there was no response.”


	
	Mr Truupold tried unsuccessfully to find a fire extinguisher and then obtained some flour from his unit which he shook onto the flames in an effort to reduce or extinguish the fire (T100-101).
	
	
	At about this time, Mr Truupold observed a person through the flames (T101-102):
	


“Q. At that time, did you see something else? 

A. I did. As I was throwing or tossing the flour out of the packet, I looked obviously into the --- I looked into the flames to see if it was affecting the fire by diminishing it. As I was tossing the flour, the flames were partially reducing and I looked through the flames and there was a face. I was confronted by a face and eyes. 

Q. At what level, was that at floor level or above floor level? 

A. Where I was, I would be looking up through the flames, there was obviously someone standing looking down at me. 

Q. Where was that person in relation to the fire? 

A. To the right of the fire, so up --- if I am standing on the stairwell looking directly up, I turned to my right so the person was up to my right. 

Q. In other words, to get out of the building that person would have to come through the fire? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. What did that person do? 

A. The person seemed startled, looked through at me. Obviously I am continuing and still a bit shocked, I suppose, throwing the flour, and the person ran through the flames and down past me. 

Q. So the person came down the stairs? 

A. Yes. 

Q. In your direction? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. Did you get a chance to look at the person? 

A. When I was looking through the fire, I think --- and obviously I was startled and still comprehending that someone had run through quite significant flames and very quickly passed me.”


	
	Mr Truupold gave a description of the person whom he saw (T102-103):
	


“Q. Could you tell us with what speed the person came past you? 

A. Moving quite quickly. 

Q. Give us your best description; firstly, are you able to tell us anything about the gender? 

A. It was a female, the person was wearing a head scarf or I believe they are called a burqa, so there was really only the portion across the eyes uncovered so, therefore, the mouth and everything --- it seemed to be a dark greeny colour. 

Q. So was the mouth covered? 

A. Yes. 

Q. So you could only see the eyes? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. You thought it was a dark green colour? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Are you able to say anything about the eyes and the areas around eyes? 

A. I would say dark olive skin, the eyes were quite inset. And dark brown or --- coloured eyes, they definitely weren't blue or green. 

Q. The eyebrows? 

A. Quite bushy. 

Q. Is there anything that you noticed about the look of the person as they were running past you? 

A. My initial thought of when I was looking through the fire, too, was that --- should I say a crazed or wild look in the eyes and obviously startled, as if panicked. 

Q. What about height? 

A. I am quite tall, so I am 6 foot 4, I would say medium height, maybe 5'6, something like that. 

Q. Anything about body build? 

A. Medium. 

Q. Skin colour? 

A. Olive or dark complexion.”


	
	On 23 April 2013, Mr Truupold went to St Marys Police Station where he underwent a photographic identification procedure involving the same 20 photographs shown to other witnesses. Mr Truupold selected five photographs of persons, none of which was the Accused, as being possible photographs of the person he saw (Exhibits Q, R, S and T).
	
	
	It will be observed that the evidence of Ms Drzewiecki and Mr Truupold did not involve selection of the Accused’s photograph. Other photographs were pointed to without the degree of certainty expressed by Mr Morris. It will be apparent that Ms Drzewiecki and Mr Truupold saw the attacker in challenging circumstances as well. The person was moving past them at some speed. Mr Truupold’s observations were made whilst the fire was burning in the stairwell.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the fact that these witnesses did not select the photograph of the Accused provides limited assistance to the defence. Of significance, is the description given by the witnesses of the dress and head covering of the attacker.
	
	
	Of particular significance is the fact that each of Mr Morris, Ms Drzewiecki and Mr Truupold were clear that the attacker was a female. Each of them had an opportunity to observe the attacker at sufficiently close range to make their identifications of the gender of the attacker reliable. This aspect of the evidence is of great importance in my finding to the criminal standard that the attacker was a woman.
	


Evidence of Kirstein Edwards


	
	Kirstein Edwards lived in Unit 42 of the Werrington apartment block in April 2003.
	
	
	Unit 42 was on the top floor of the block, with the apartments of Mr Morris and Monis.
	
	
	Ms Edwards left the apartment block at about 10.00 am on 21 April 2013 and did not return until later in the day. When she entered the stairwell, she encountered black smoke and could not proceed further. She returned to her vehicle and went to a friend’s place. Ms Edwards did not see the attacker and thus no photographic identification was sought to be undertaken with her concerning the attacker.
	
	
	Ms Edwards was asked if she could identify, from the 20 photographs, the female person whom she had seen going to and from Unit 43 on occasions other than 21 April 2013. Ms Edwards selected a number of photographs, nominating the photograph of the Accused as being similar to the person. Interestingly, Ms Edwards also selected the photograph which Mr Morris had picked in his photo identification procedure. Ms Edwards said that the photograph of the Accused was “very similar” to the woman she had seen entering and leaving Unit 43 (Monis’ unit) (Exhibits V, W, X and Y).
	


Evidence of Mathew Hill


	
	In April 2013, Mathew Hill lived in Unit 45 which was on the top floor, together with the units of Mr Morris, Ms Edwards and Monis. Although on the same floor of the building, a different stairway led to Mr Hill’s unit.
	
	
	Mr Hill said that, at about 4.15 pm on 21 April 2013, he heard a commotion. Mr Hill said that he heard a female scream and then a male scream, and he went out on to his unit balcony which looked into the main courtyard of the unit block (T130). The Senior Crown Prosecutor asked Mr Hill what he did and saw (T130-131):
	


“Q. That was a balcony that looked into the main courtyard, the front courtyard? 

A. Yeah, that's correct. 

Q. Were you leaning over the balcony? 

A. Yep. 

Q. Would you tell the Court what you saw? 

A. I saw there was smoke, and I saw a lady run out of the stairwell. 

Q. Which stairwell? 

A. Not my stairwell, the stairwell in the middle of the complex there. 

Q. From where you were, if you were standing on your balcony looking out --- 

A. Yep. 

Q. --- that stairway was to your left? 

A. That's correct.

Q. I think you said it was a woman? 

A. Yep, that's correct. There was a lady. I heard the door open and it slammed shut and a lady proceeded to run away from me to the exit of the complex that leads onto Parkes Avenue. 

Q. Could you give us your best description of that woman? 

A. Like I said, I was up high and she was running away from me. I didn't see her until she turned because you have to turn to get out of the complex. She was Middle Eastern in appearance, long black hair, medium size build lady, quite robust. She was wearing loose fitting clothing, like silky material. Yeah, she was in a hurry, she was in a great hurry. 

Q. Can you tell us anything else about her clothing? 

A. I recall that it was beige, it was loose fitting and that kind of silky --- that's ---

Q. Which part of her clothing was beige? 

A. I think it was a beigey top, and I think the pants were similar, so, in appearance. 

Q. Did you see whether or not she was carrying anything? 

A. It didn't seem to me she was carrying anything because she was running quite quickly, so yeah. 

Q. Are you able to tell us anything about her height? 

A. Yeah, maybe about 170cm. 

Q. I think you have already told us about her build? 

A. Yeah, like I said, I was up high looking down so give or take. 

Q. Did you get to see anything about her complexion? 

A. It was olive complexion, when she turned I seen her complexion, chubby round face, long back [sic] hair. 

Q. You might have told us this, the colour of her hair? 

A. Black, yeah, long dark hair. 

Q. You said it was long hair? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. Are you able to tell us how long? 

A. It was past her shoulders, yeah, so it was long hair, yeah. 

Q. Can you be any more specific than that? 

A. It was three years ago but I can remember it being long, you know, like (indicated). 

Q. Indicating halfway down the back? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. Did you notice anything about her shoes? 

A. No, not that I can recall.”


	
	After making these observations, Mr Hill went back inside his unit and went downstairs.
	
	
	On 24 April 2013, Mr Hill attended the St Marys Police Station and undertook a photographic identification procedure utilising the same 20 photographs as shown to other witnesses. He selected five photographs, including the photograph of the Accused, as possibly being the person whom he observed (Exhibits AB, AC, AD and AE).
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Hill was asked (T138):
	


“Q. Are you able to say what the age of the woman was that you saw in the courtyard? 

A. In the courtyard I would assume she was probably 25 to 30. Like I said, I was up high and when I seen her side on, it was from quite a distance so it was thereabouts. I wasn't completely, you know, specific in the age. 

Q. You weren't in an ideal position to describe her, would you agree with that? 

A. I could describe the type of person most definitely but as for more intricate details of the person, no. 

Q. In your statement you said this, paragraph 9:

‘I would describe as a female about 25 years old.’

A. Mmm. 

Q. That's the information you gave police within 24 hours? 

A. That's correct, yes. 

Q. Would you agree with that? 

A. That's correct, yes. But I also said that I couldn't make a specific identification because of the distance, so she may have been older or younger but from my --- yeah. 

Q. As I understand your evidence, you saw her walk away from you in the courtyard area --- 

A. No, she wasn't walking at all. 

Q. Running, sorry? 

A. Yeah, that's correct.”


	
	It was established that the distance from Mr Hill’s balcony to the gate to the Parkes Avenue exit at the side of the apartment block was approximately 33.8 metres (Exhibit DW). Accordingly, the observations by Mr Hill of the female departing via the gate at the side of the property involved an observation in daylight at that distance.
	


Conclusions Concerning Apartment Block Witnesses


	
	I pause at this point to refer to some submissions, and to express some conclusions, concerning the evidence of the residents of the apartment block who saw a person in the stairwell, or emerging from the stairwell, on the afternoon of the murder.
	
	
	Put shortly, the Crown submitted that the evidence of Mr Morris was strong evidence implicating the Accused by his selection of a photograph of a very similar looking person, his description of the size of the attacker and of her dress, manner and actions. The Crown submitted that the evidence of the other eye witnesses supported the description of the attacker as a female and her dress, including head covering. The Crown submitted that Mr Hill had seen the attacker leave the building and depart via the Parkes Avenue exit, although she had removed her head covering by then so that her hair was visible.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that a significant aspect of Mr Morris’ identification was that he did not respond at all to the image of the Accused during the photographic identification process. It was submitted that this was important because he had said that he had focused on the attacker’s face.
	
	
	Submissions were made for the Accused concerning the evidence of Mr Truupold and Ms Drzewiecki. It was submitted that Ms Drzewiecki’s evidence was deserving of the greatest weight for three reasons:
	



	
	of the three stairwell eye witnesses, she was the only one who saw the attacker on the same level as her, which was as the attacker rounded the bend at the bottom of the stairs;
	
	
	whereas Mr Truupold was taken by surprise when the attacker suddenly launched herself over the flames and past him, Ms Drzewiecki saw her coming down the stairs, passing her along the corridor and then disappearing down the next flight of stairs;
	
	
	Ms Drzewiecki was the only one of the three eye witnesses who saw the attacker’s body and who saw her actual body shape in close-fitting clothes.
	



	
	It was noted that Ms Drzewiecki said that the body shape of the attacker was slender-to-medium, with her meaning a slender build being between 50 kg and 60 kgs. It was noted that, when the Accused applied for life insurance on 10 April 2013 (see [242] above), she stated that her weight was about 85 kgs (in April 2013) and counsel submitted that this was likely to have been accurate at that time given the photographs of the Accused in evidence.
	
	
	With respect to Mr Hill, it was submitted for the Accused that his observation of the person leaving the building, and moving to the Parkes Avenue exit, was made at considerable distance, some 33.8 metres away. He had a side view only which must have lasted for a short period before the person disappeared. It was submitted that the distance factor, the side view and the period of time that Mr Hill observed the woman effectively eliminated him as a witness of any weight in terms of the facial features of the person he saw.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Morris had the best view of the attacker, including her body shape. Although he selected a photograph of a different person, that female was very similar in appearance to the Accused. It is clear from his evidence that the image of the attacker as being “plump” or “chubby” was one that struck him at the time. He saw the attacker moving and at close range. I do not accept the defence submission that Ms Drzewiecki was in the best position to observe the body shape of the attacker.
	
	
	I accept that each of these witnesses was an honest witness making every effort to give an accurate account of what each of them saw in very trying circumstances. The following features should be noted at this point:
	



	
	each witness identified the attacker as a woman;
	
	
	the attacker was not slim, with Mr Morris’ description of her as being “chubby” or “plump” being an accurate description;
	
	
	the dress of the attacker was distinctive with those persons who saw the attacker in the stairwell describing a head dress in the nature of a burqa, to be understood as a hijab where the whole face was shown but not the rest of the head;
	
	
	Mr Hill’s description of the clothing differs from that of Mr Morris, Ms Drzewiecki and Mr Truupold - however, Mr Hill was making his observations from a greater distance - I am satisfied that the person observed by Mr Hill was the attacker given the temporal proximity between events which had occurred in the stairwell, and the departure of the woman from the security door at the foot of that stairwell;
	
	
	by the time the attacker came to be seen by Mr Hill, she had removed her scarf or head dress so that Mr Hill could see her hair;
	
	
	I am satisfied that the attacker fled the premises via the exit that leads to Parkes Avenue and not the Albert Street exit.
	



	
	It is appropriate to consider next the evidence of another person who was in the vicinity of the Werrington apartment block, and upon whose evidence the defence seeks to place great weight. This is Nigel Quiney (described in the transcript as “Quiny”), and an associated witness, Peter Woods.
	


Evidence of Nigel Quiney and Peter Woods


	
	In April 2013, Nigel Quiney lived at an address in the vicinity of the Werrington apartment block. It was his evidence that, on the afternoon of 21 April 2013, he walked from his address to meet friends in the apartment block at 10 Parkes Avenue, Werrington. When in the vicinity of the Albert Street entrance to the Werrington apartment block, Mr Quiney said that he heard some screaming at a time when he was near an older lady in the street, who also appeared to hear this sound (T148). He walked another few metres towards Parkes Avenue. He gave evidence that he then observed a woman coming out of the Werrington apartment block (T149-150):
	


“Q. At that stage did you see something? 

A. I saw a lady come down, walk past in front of me and turn right walking past the cars on the road. 

Q. Did you see where she came from? 

A. I couldn't tell if she came from the steps from the second entry or from the driveway coming up underneath because they are right next to each other. 

Q. She walked past the cars on the side of Albert Street closest to that unit block? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And where did she go from there? 

A. Down heading west --- sorry, east, towards my end of Albert Street. 

Q. Heading east in Albert Street towards where your house was? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did you watch her for much of a distance? 

A. Not for much of a distance, no. 

Q. Can you say how she was walking, slowly, quickly, medium? 

A. Briskly. 

Q. Was she looking at anything? 

A. She was walking quite briskly with her head sort of down, looking at the ground, and popping her head up every now and again. 

Q. Can you describe this woman to us? 

A. Black hair, medium build, little bit shorter than me. 

Q. How tall are you? 

A. About 6 1. 

Q. Did you say she was taller than you? 

A. A little bit shorter than me. 

Q. And you are 6'1""? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Anything else? 

A. She had a hat on. 

Q. A hat? 

A. Yep. 

Q. What sort of hat? 

A. A cap. 

Q. What sort of cap? 

A. Don't remember, to tell you the truth. 

Q. Like a cap with a visor at the front? 

A. Like a baseball cap. 

Q. Anything else? 

A. No. 

Q. What about your age? 

A. I'd say she be in her late twenties. 

Q. Her complexion? 

A. Olive skin, I sort of figured Italian, something along those lines, Middle Eastern, European, yeah. 

Q. And her clothing, apart from the cap? 

A. Pair of black tights and it was a T shirt or a singlet, I don't remember. 

Q. What colour was the T shirt or singlet? 

A. I just remembered it was lighter than --- like it was a light colour. 

Q. Did you see her face on or only from the side or what? 

A. Sort of hard with the angle. I saw her face from the side but then when she turned in front of the car to walk on the street, I got sort of a bit of a view of her face. 

Q. Anything about her fitness level? 

A. She seemed sort of athletic.”


	
	I pause at this stage to note that the woman observed by Mr Quiney was leaving the Werrington apartment block on the opposite side (the Albert Street side) to that referred to in Mr Hill’s evidence (the Parkes Avenue side).
	
	
	Mr Quiney’s evidence took an unexpected turn at the start of his cross-examination (T151-152):
	


“Q. Mr Quiny, the last time you saw the woman, as I understand your evidence she was still on the roadway? 

A. Yes, that's correct. 

Q. And she was walking --- 

A. Sorry, no, that's incorrect. That wasn't the last time I saw her. The last time I saw her was in the car as they drove past me. 

Q. In the car as they drove past you? 

A. Yes. 

Q. ‘They’, how many people? 

A. A man in the driver's seat and a woman in the passenger seat. 

Q. What sort of car? 

A. A white older Falcon or Commodore. 

Q. Where were you when you first saw her in the car? 

A. Right on the corner, literally just turning, I heard the screech, sort of looked, saw the car pulling out and another behind it but obviously I'm not sure which one screeched the tyres. 

Q. Did you say you were on the corner? 

A. Yep. 

Q. Did you then turn around to see the car? 

A. No, when I heard the screech I was sort of like off to my side so I just looked to the side. 

Q. When you say it was a white older Falcon or Commodore was it an older Commodore as well or could it have been a newer Commodore? 

A. No, it was --- I would say a mid, early 90s. 

Q. And you said that there was another one behind it? 

A. It was a newer car. 

Q. Can you be more specific about what type of car it was? 

A. It was a newer little red four door thing. 

Q. When you say ‘four door thing’, was it a sedan? 

A. Sedan. 

Q. As opposed to a hatchback? 

A. Yes, correct. 

Q. Which way did they turn into Parkes Avenue, left or right? 

A. Left in Parkes Avenue from Albert Street. 

Q. So they headed in the same direction you were walking in Parkes Avenue? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. Did you notice what they did when they got to the end of Parkes Avenue to Victoria Street? 

A. They didn't get up to Victoria Street, they pulled over out the front of my friend's block, did a u-ey and drove back in the opposite direction. 

Q. Was that at speed when they drove back in the opposite direction? 

A. No, not that I would have thought, normal speed. 

Q. Where they did the u-ey, was there anyone on the footpath, anyone in that area? 

A. Not that I saw.”


	
	Senior Counsel for the Accused asked Mr Quiney about the woman (T153):
	


“Q. Coming back to the first car, the woman was in the passenger side? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. You recognised her? 

A. As the woman that walked past me. 

Q. What was the closest that she got to you when she was in the passenger seat of the car and you were on the corner? 

A. 4 metres, 5 metres. 

Q. Was she looking at you? 

A. No. 

Q. Where was she looking? 

A. Had her sort of head down. 

Q. Did you get the impression she was trying to avoid being observed? 

A. I thought more distressed. 

Q. Can you remember what it was about her appearance that made you think she looked distressed? 

A. Not sure, like --- 

Q. Did she seem to be crying? 

A. No, just a worried --- 

Q. Did you notice where her hands were, were her hands anywhere near her face? 

A. Not that I noticed, no.”


	
	Later in cross-examination, Mr Quiney said that police had shown him photographs when he gave a statement at the police station (T155.45).
	
	
	In re-examination, Mr Quiney was asked (T156):
	


“Q. Do you agree with me that there's nothing in your statement about having seen the woman again in a car? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Your statement was made I think five days after these observations? 

A. I don't remember how many days after, but yes. 

Q. If you look at your statement? 

A. I thought it was only three or four but it might have been five. 

Q. You agree your statement is dated on the first page 26 April? 

A. That's correct. 

Q. Can you explain to the Court why there is no mention in your statement about having seen this woman in a car afterwards? 

A. You would have to ask the Detective that took my statement. He told me it had no relevance. 

Q. The policeman told you? 

A. That's what they said to me, they said that part wasn't relevant. 

Q. Who was the policeman who told you that? 

A. The one that took my statement. 

Q. Is that Michael Marinello? 

A. If he is the one that took my statement. 

Q. You see the Detective Senior Constable who signed your statement on the last page? Would you have a look at the last page? 

A. I don't know who this man is, sorry. 

Q. When you made your statement, did you sign it? 

A. Yes, I did.”


	
	A joint application was made on 24 August 2016 that Mr Quiney be stood down to allow further enquiries to be made. Mr Quiney was recalled on 29 August 2016. The Crown foreshadowed that an application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 was to be made with respect to him. I accepted a defence submission that the appropriate way forward was for the cross-examination of Mr Quiney to conclude, with the Crown then to make its s.38 application and this is what in fact occurred: R v Droudis (No. 3) [2016] NSWSC 1553.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by Senior Counsel for the Accused, Mr Quiney said that police had shown him a number of individual photographs of persons (T209). Mr Quiney said that, after walking to the apartment block at 10 Parkes Avenue and entering his friend’s apartment, he was on the veranda and “smelt a strange smell” (T211).
	
	
	Under cross-examination by the Crown, following the grant of leave under s.38, Mr Quiney agreed that he had spoken to a police officer about these events “within 10 minutes” of having observed the woman and the cars about which he had given evidence (T225). Soon after, Mr Quiney was asked (T226-227):
	


“Q. I want to suggest to you that you in fact spoke to a police officer who was doing a canvass at about 10.20pm on the same night that you had seen the person that you have told us about? 

A. Yeah, every chance of it. 

Q. And I want to suggest to you that what you told the police officer was this, that you heard shouting or screaming at about 3.50pm. Do you remember saying that? 

A. No. 

Q. Is it possible that you said that? 

A. Hundred per cent possible. 

Q. And you heard a male screaming in the vicinity of Albert Street? 

A. Quite possible. 

Q. That you heard a male --- 

A. I don't actually remember what you are talking about here, so I don't know. You could tell me I told him I had ice cream for dinner and I might have had fish and chips but I don't know. I don't actually remember speaking to the officer that night. 

Q. Did you tell a police officer that you heard a male arguing in a one sided argument at about 3.50pm? 

A. No. 

Q. Is it possible that you told a police officer that on that night at Andrew's place? 

A. I'm --- I couldn't say. I don't remember having the conversation. I don't remember talking to a police officer that night. 

Q. Do you agree that that night your memory of what you had seen earlier that afternoon would be much better than your memory now? 

A. One would assume so, yes. 

Q. Do you agree with that? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. Do you agree that a version that you gave to a police officer then is much more likely to be accurate than the version you have given in court? 

A. No, not necessarily because everything is open to interpretation and if I said something and a police officer has interpreted in his way, not in the way I've meant it, I can't help the way someone has interpreted something else.”


	
	Soon after, the Crown asked Mr Quiney (T227.19):
	


“Q. Would it be correct to say that the observations you made were at about 3.50pm? 

A. Yeah, it was around that time, yeah, around 3.50.”


	
	The Crown then asked Mr Quiney about a telephone conversation allegedly had by him with a police officer on 24 April 2013 (T227-229):
	


“Q. I want to suggest to you that the next time you spoke to a police officer was on the phone on 24 April, that's three days later? 

A. Okay, quite possible. 

Q. Do you agree with that? 

A. I don't have any of this evidence here, so I don't know. 

Q. It doesn't conflict with your memory though, does it? 

A. It would be about that, yeah, I think it was about two days later, it might have been three days later. 

Q. What I want to suggest to you that what you said on the phone to a detective was this, that on 21 April, the date you made these observations, that you were walking past the complex when you saw a lady whom you described as half Indian and half Caucasian, do you remember saying that? 

A. Probably. 

Q. And that she was yelling abuse at someone as they came out from a stairwell, do you remember saying that? 

A. I can vaguely remember something like that happening, so yes. 

Q. And that she wore a boney jacket and it was about 4pm, do you remember saying that? 

A. Not really, I don't remember. 

Q. Does that accord with your recollection? 

A. Sort of. 

Q. Do you remember saying also to this police officer in this phone call three days later, there was a Caucasian lady delivering papers in a silver four wheel drive at the time? 

A. I don't remember saying any of it but yes. 

Q. Is that possible? 

A. Very possible. 

Q. Do you now remember seeing a Caucasian lady delivering papers in a silver four wheel drive? 

A. No. 

Q. Do you agree in that conversation on the phone three days later you said nothing about seeing a woman whom you had seen coming out of that complex, sitting in a car with a male? 

A. I don't --- I don't actually remember, to tell you the truth, sorry, but I've got a brain injury so my memory isn't very memory recall I think you would say. 

Q. I don't know if I heard you correctly. Did you say you've had a brain injury? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What sort of a brain injury have you had? 

A. A traumatic one. I was in a bad car accident and copped a major bleed on the brain which gave me brain damage and affects my memory and memory recall. 

Q. How long ago was that? 

A. I don't know to tell you the truth. I don't remember anything of it. 

Q. Do you know when your accident was? 

A. No. 

Q. Was it one year ago, 10 years ago? 

A. In the last couple of years, it wasn't in the last 12 months but sometime before that. 

Q. Do you know if it was before or after this incident that you've given evidence about? 

A. Guessing it would have been before, just trying to think. What year is it? 2016. 

Q. And in what way has it affected your memory? 

A. Short term memory is pretty bad, like I couldn't tell you what I ate for dinner last night. 

Q. Does it only affect your short term memory? 

A. I'm trying to think what I actually did yesterday. 

Q. It has affected your short term memory? 

A. And yeah, sort of when I try to remember things, other people will be telling me stuff and I will have been there but I won't remember it at all. 

Q. It might affect something that happened yesterday, your memory is affected. What about something that happened last year, is your memory affected? 

A. It is a 50/50 chance of whether I will remember something that happened sort of three months ago.”


	
	Mr Quiney maintained under cross-examination by the Crown that he had been shown individual photographs of females and males at the police station in 2013.
	
	
	In re-examination, Mr Quiney confirmed that he was walking to his friend’s place to watch the rugby league match which generally started at 4.00 pm every Sunday (T239). The Crown asked Mr Quiney (T240):
	


“Q. Do you remember on that day whether you --- was it your intention to catch the beginning of the match at 4 o'clock? 

A. Well, we normally sort of sit down and watch the five minute big spiel all the journalists have and the game starts, so. 

Q. Does the broadcast of the game start at 4? 

A. Most of the time, it is right on 4. 

Q. How long would it have taken you to walk from your place to your friend Andrew's? 

A. 10 minutes. 

Q. If you told a police officer that night that you made this observation at 3.50 in the afternoon, do you now say that that would be an accurate timing of your observation? 

A. Yes, completely accurate. 

Q. Because it is when the football normally starts? 

A. Yes.”


	
	A Channel 9 document confirmed that the telecast of the City v Country Rugby League match on 21 April 2013 was scheduled to commence at 4.00 pm (Exhibit CB; T585). A further document provided by Channel 9 confirmed that the kick-off in the City v Country match actually took place at 4.05 pm on 21 April 2013 (T778).
	
	
	Before considering submissions made about Mr Quiney’s evidence, it is appropriate to refer to the evidence of Peter Woods, who was called in the defence case.
	


The Evidence of Peter Woods


	
	Mr Woods gave evidence that he attended the apartment of a friend, Andrew Wolford, at 10 Parkes Avenue, Werrington on the afternoon of 21 April 2013 and that Mr Quiney also attended that day.
	
	
	Having arrived at about 3.25 pm - 3.30 pm, he and Mr Wolford watched television for a while and then walked to the bottle shop in Victoria Street, Werrington which was “a 5 minute walk there and back when you’re in a hurry” (T1002). The two men purchased a quantity of beer and returned to the apartment. Senior Counsel for the Accused asked Mr Woods about what happened on his return (T1002):
	


“Q. What happened when you got back to the unit? 

A. Stacked the fridge and then rang me mate Nigel to come around because he was waiting on me and Andrew to get back to watch the football with us. 

Q. What is Nigel's last name? 

A. Quiny. 

Q. Do you know how that is spelt? 

A. Q u i n e y? 

Q. When you stacked the fridge and then rang your mate, who actually rang him, do you remember? 

A. I rang Nigel just to say we were at Andrew's. 

Q. What did Nigel say? 

A. He'll be there in 5 to 10, 5 minutes. He had to lock up and then he was coming. 

Q. What happened after that? 

A. I heard screaming and a scream for help and about, say, 5 to 4, Nigel rocked up. 

Q. Where were you when you heard the screaming? 

A. In the lounge room.”


	
	About five minutes after he heard the screaming, Mr Woods said that Mr Quiney arrived at the apartment at 10 Parkes Avenue. In the course of conversation, Mr Quiney said that he “ran into a hot chick in the driveway” (T1003).
	
	
	Mr Woods gave evidence of his observations of thick black smoke coming from the middle block of units and the arrival of the fire brigade and ambulance.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by the Crown, Mr Woods was asked about Mr Quiney’s arrival time at the apartment (T1007):
	


“Q. When you got to Andrew's place you rang up Nigel in plenty of time so that he could get to Andrew's place in time for the start of the game? 

A. I didn't ring Nigel until quarter to 4, probably 15 minutes after me and Andrew had already arrived. 

Q. But you left him enough time for him to walk from his place to Andrew's place? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And he in fact arrived to watch the start of the game? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And the program of that City Country match started at 4 o'clock? 

A. Could have been 5 past 4. 

Q. When I say ""the program""? 

A. It is meant to start at 4 o'clock so I'm going [sic] that it did start at 4 o'clock. 

Q. Does it often start about 5 minutes after 4 because there are introductory comments and things like that? 

A. And sometimes it runs late because it is not a normal NRL game.”


	
	Mr Woods repeated soon after that Mr Quiney “was there before the kick off” (T1008.11).
	


Evidence of Sergeant Michael Marinello Concerning Mr Quiney


	
	Sergeant Michael Marinello gave evidence concerning his involvement with Mr Quiney during the investigation. Sergeant Marinello denied that he had shown Mr Quiney any photographs when he took a statement from him on 24 April 2013 (T284). He denied that he had told Mr Quiney, at any time, that any of the information which Mr Quiney had given was irrelevant and of no importance (T284). He said that he did not omit any of the information given by Mr Quiney from Mr Quiney’s statement (T284, Exhibit AQ).
	


Conclusions With Respect to Evidence of Mr Quiney and Mr Woods


	
	The potential significance of Mr Quiney’s evidence concerned his observation of a female leaving the Werrington apartment block from the Albert Street exit. The defence submission was that Mr Quiney’s evidence is reliable and that it is at least reasonably open that the woman seen by Mr Quiney was the attacker. It was submitted that the evidence of Mr Quiney should be taken with that of Ms Drzewiecki, in that the descriptions provided by each of them were similar and did not resemble the Accused.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that the evidence of Mr Woods provided corroboration of Mr Quiney’s account, in particular by reference to Mr Quiney’s observation of “a hot chick” leaving the Werrington apartment block. The defence submission was that it was at least reasonably open that this woman was the attacker and that the description of her was significantly different to the Accused. It was submitted that Mr Quiney’s account of his conversation with police ought be accepted, and that it should be noted that the police did not exhaustively pursue the unit occupants in Albert Street as a result of what Mr Quiney had told them.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Mr Quiney’s evidence, in particular with respect to the timing of his observation, was unreliable and wrong. The Crown submitted that the telecast of the football match commenced at 4.00 pm, with the kick-off at 4.05 pm. It was emphasised that the evidence of Mr Quiney and Mr Woods placed Mr Quiney inside Mr Wolford’s apartment at the time the football match had commenced. The Crown submitted that the murder occurred at about 4.25 pm - 4.27 pm so that whoever it was that Mr Quiney had observed, she was not related to the killing. The Crown submitted that the Court would accept the evidence of Sergeant Marinello where it was in conflict with that of Mr Quiney.

The cautioned statement made by the accused in this case is not admissible in evidence because it was not recorded in accordance with the provisions of the Rules relating to statements from accused persons laid down in Sch E of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The caution administered to the accused was the one laid down in r 6. This caution is administered to an accused person when he is formally charged by the police. In this case no formal charge was framed or read out to the accused and the caution in r 6 was therefore inapplicable.
The inspector who recorded the statement made a mistake in interpreting the caution to the accused in the Malay language by telling him that whatever he said would be taken down and used in evidence. Rule 6 expressly provides that care should be taken to avoid any suggestion to the accused that his answers can only be used against him. The proper words that should be used are that whatever the accused says will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.
After recording the statement which the accused is alleged to have volunteered, the Inspector put three questions to the accused. Rule 8 provides that an accused person making a voluntary statement must not be cross-examined and no questions should be put to him except for the purpose of removing ambiguity in what he has actually said. The three questions put by the Inspector to the accused in this case were not put for the purpose of removing ambiguity.
When a police officer desires to record a cautioned statement from a person accused of an offence and who does not understand the English language, the statement should be recorded through a competent interpreter. The whole proceedings should be interpreted to the accused in his own language or in a language which he understands through an interpreter competent to interpret in that language. There are already many judicial pronouncements on this question of interpretation to an accused person who does not understand English. The court must be satisfied that the officer recording the statement and the accused fully understood each other. In this case I am not so satisfied.
It must be borne in mind that a person in custody cannot be questioned without being first cautioned that he is not obliged to say anything, and it is essential that this caution should be correctly explained to him in his own language or in a language which he understands. The above-mentioned rules are part of our law and must be strictly complied with by any police officer who wishes to question an accused person in custody. Failure to comply with any of the rules vitiates the statement recorded and makes it inadmissible in evidence. For these reasons I hold that the cautioned statement of the accused is not admissible in evidence.
I must make it clear that I express no opinion on the accused`s allegation that he was assaulted by Inspector Moorthi because Inspector Moorthi is not a witness in this case and has not been given an opportunity to deny this allegation. Furthermore, it is unnecessary for me to express any opinion on this allegation because there are ample reasons for holding that the cautioned statement is not admissible in evidence in this case. I would only observe that where an accused person alleges that he was assaulted by a police officer and that in consequence thereof he made an incriminating statement, it is desirable in those circumstances for the prosecution to call the officer in question as a witness so that the officer can give his version of the incident. This is desirable not only for the purpose of assisting the court to ascertain the truth of the allegation made by the accused, but also for the purpose of giving the officer concerned an opportunity to rebut the allegation of the accused. Furthermore, the burden of proving that the accused`s statement was made voluntarily is on the prosecution. And when the accused alleges that he has been the victim of an assault at the hands of the police, I fail to see how the prosecution can discharge their burden without calling evidence to rebut that allegation. In this case, for example, no evidence has been led by the prosecution on the issue of assault and the accused`s allegation that he was assaulted, remains unanswered.
The cautioned statement having been held to be inadmissible, the only other evidence against the accused is that he led the police party to his house and in the compound of his house he dug up a parcel of explosives which were buried about 70 feet away from his house. The accused is stated to have taken the police to his house as a result of questioning by ASP Omar Rejab. The accused was arrested on 22 November 1965 at 1.30pm under the Internal Security Act and was taken to the special branch. Soon after that he was questioned at the Special Branch by ASP Omar Rejab who says that before questioning the accused he cautioned him in the Malay language in the following terms: 
 
You are not compelled or forced to say anything, but whatever you say ought to be used in the statement.
 
 
 
In the course of the questioning the accused is alleged to have said, `I buried the explosives in the compound near my house,` and it was as a result of this information that the accused was taken to his house. In my view ASP Omar Rejab failed to comply with the provisions of r 5. The accused, being in custody ASP Omar Rejab had no right to question him without the proper caution being first administered to the accused. As the accused does not speak English the caution had to be administered in a language which the accused understood. In administering the caution to the accused in the Malay language, ASP Omar Rejab clearly departed from the words of the caution laid down in r 5. This again emphasises how important it is that the caution should be correctly stated to the accused in a language which he understands. It seems to me that s 27 of the Evidence Ordinance must be read subject to s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The proviso to s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that a statement by a person charged with an offence made by him after his arrest is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that he was duly cautioned in accordance with the abovementioned Rules. When the Prosecution desire to invoke s 27 of the Evidence Ordinance they must satisfy the court that the information received from the accused which is tendered under s 27 of the Evidence Ordinance was received after the caution had been duly administered. In my view, as the accused had not been properly cautioned, his statement that he had buried the explosives in the compound of his house, is inadmissible. But evidence of the fact that he took the police to his house and there dug up the explosives is admissible. This fact by itself, however, is insufficient to warrant the inference that the explosives were in the control of the accused. Accordingly, there is no evidence that the explosives found in the compound of his house were under his control. He has no case to answer and is therefore acquitted and disc harged.

Collision between lorry and scooter Â– Which version of facts should be accepted
 
As is usual in cases of this nature, I have before me only the evidence of the plaintiff scooter rider, the defendant lorry driver, and a traffic police sergeant who made a sketch plan soon after the incident, as to how the collision occurred.
The handle-bar of the scooter had come off and its front head-lamp was dented and the headlamp glass was broken. The lorry sustained no damage. The final position of the scooter ridden by the plaintiff is slightly on the plaintiff`s side of the road with its handle-bar more or less on or over the crown of the road. Broken glass is shown on the plan to be scattered over an area extending roughly in front of the scooter which came to rest on its left facing the opposite direction from whence it came. It was stressed by counsel for the defendant that the final position is not conclusive as to the point of impact.
The plaintiff`s version is that he was riding a scooter along Telok Blangah Road towards the city on his own side of the road when he saw a man dashing out three feet into the road from a bus-stand on his near side. He sounded his horn swerved towards his right to a distance of six to seven feet from the near side kerb when a lorry coming in the opposite direction collided with him after over-taking a bus travelling in the same direction.
In his first report to the police, made three days later in hospital where he was lying seriously ill, he claimed that, on seeing a man suddenly dashing across the road from his left, he immediately applied his brakes and swerved towards the right, but while doing so his scooter collided with a motor lorry which was coming from the opposite direction. He made no mention of the fact that that lorry had been overtaking a bus or that that lorry had come on to his side of the road. His explanation for this omission was that he was not feeling well.
The defence version is that as the lorry was being driven along Telok Blangah Road towards Pasir Panjang, at a distance of about two to three feet from the near side kerb, the plaintiff`s scooter was first seen to be approaching from a distance of about 30 yards away travelling on its own side of the road but it subsequently moved obliquely or diagonally towards the lorry at a speed faster than the lorry. The defendant claimed that the scooter was wobbling and that subsequently he heard a bang behind his lorry and concluded that there had been an impact between the scooter and his rear off-side wheel. He stopped his lorry within two to three feet after he heard the bang but did not get down because of the presence of some aggressive Malays and he drove off. He made a report to the police at 5.30pm that evening, some seven hours after the accident, in which all he says is that the scooter came close to his lorry and collided with his offside rear wheel. He did not give any explanation in that report for having failed to remain at the scene. He merely said that he drove off and that he did not know whether the rider had been injured or not.
Both parties were agreed that it was raining at the time and that the road surface was wet.
It will be seen from the above account that, in their initial reports to the police, neither literally blamed the other. The plaintiff`s report seems to support the defendant`s evidence in court and I have, therefore, given very careful thought to the question of the weight which I should attach to his present explanation of the presence of a bus coming from the opposite direction which he now says the defendant`s lorry was overtaking. No mention of this was made in the report nor is there any indication from the pleadings that his counsel was aware of its existence. It must be remembered that, although he was not well at the time he made his report and was in fact in quite a serious physical condition, his report does contain a fair amount of detail.
While I have considerable sympathy for the gravity of his condition at the time he made his first report, I find it difficult to accept his version that the lorry was overtaking a bus at the relevant time and, in my opinion, this additional information should be regarded as an afterthought invented to improve his chances of success. I think that when he was in hospital at the time he made his report it never to him to blame the lorry for the simple reason that it was then, according to his reckoning, blameless. Even if the lorry had, in fact, been overtaking any such bus as now alleged, its offside wheels would, at the most, have been slightly over the crown of the road which should have allowed the scooter, which was the only other vehicle on its side of the road, to travel past the lorry in safety. It seems to me quite clear that the collision took place because the plaintiff swerved to his right to avoid the pedestrian who dashed across his path. The plaintiff himself admitted in evidence that `If not for the man stepping out and my swerving to right to avoid him the lorry would not have hit me even if it was on its wrong side of the road`.
From the final position of the scooter after the accident and the position of the broken glass, I am not satisfied that the point of impact was necessarily on the plaintiff`s side of the road. Even if it was slightly on the plaintiff`s side this would not, for reasons which will appear later, conclude the matter in the plaintiff`s favour. It is more likely that the scooter swerved over the crown of the road and made contact with some part of the rear of the lorry in such a manner as to cause the scooter to swivel round to face the opposite direction. In the course of this the handle-bar came off and the scooter fell on its left side. The plaintiff sustained injuries to his left ankle, left leg and left thigh.
Apart from the plaintiff`s version in court there is nothing in the evidence to indicate clearly that the lorry was on its wrong side of the road at the time of the collision. The only complaint one can make against the defendant is that he failed to remain at the scene but for this he has given an explanation. He also failed to make his report till some seven hours later. I do not now consider, however, that this conduct on his part, which at first appeared to me to be indicative of some kind of guilt, necessarily connotes culpability on his part. As Lord Justice Greer said in the court of Appeal in 
 Kirk 
 v 
 Parker 
 Lloyd LR 129 at p 132: 
 
... I take it that the learned judge was justified in deciding that the off-wheels of the lorry were probably a little over where the white line would have been. But that is not necessarily negligence if, by driving a car in that position, it is clear you will avoid any collision with vehicles coming in the opposite direction.
 
 
 
It is clear that the lorry would have avoided any collision with vehicles coming in the opposite direction even if its off-wheels had been on or slightly over the crown of the road. The sole cause of the collision was, therefore, the behaviour of the plaintiff in swerving to his right into the path of the lorry.
As Lord Justice MacKinnon said in the same case at p 134: 
 
... There cannot, I think, be the slightest doubt, when all these facts have been investigated, that the truth about this collision was told in a few words by Master Kenneth Taylor after the accident happened, when he said to the policeman: `My companion turned out on to his off-side and went into the side of the lorry coming in the opposite direction`. To my mind there is not a possibility of any doubt that that is really what happened.
 
 
 
In the present case it was not another eye witness such as Master Kenneth Taylor who, after the collision, told the policeman that his companion turned out on to his off-side and went into the side of the lorry coming in the opposite direction. It was the plaintiff himself who said this to the police in his first report.
As I have said earlier, I have carefully considered the fact that he was in hospital in a bad physical condition at the time of his report but I have no doubt that what he then said was a true account of what actually happened and that the defendant`s lorry was not, at any time, in his path to such an extent as to affect his ability to make his way safely towards the city had he remained on his normal course.
For these reasons I hold that the defendant was not negligent and the plaintiff`s claim is accordingly dismissed with costs.

The appellants were tried before FA Chua J in the High Court of Singapore on three charges under s 302 of the Penal Code for the murder of Susie Choo Kay Hoi, Juliet Goh Hwee Kuang and Yasin bin Kesit on 10 March 1965 at about 3.07pm at MacDonald House, Orchard Road, Singapore.
The trial was held under the Emergency (Criminal Trials) Regulations 1964 and at the conclusion of the trial FA Chua J found both appellants guilty and convicted and sentenced them accordingly.
The facts are relatively simple. On 10 March 1965 at about 3pm some one or more persons placed on the landing of the mezzanine floor of MacDonald House, a non-military building housing a bank and the offices of several commercial firms, about 20 to 25 lbs of explosives of the nitro-glycerine group, which shortly thereafter exploded resulting in the death of the three persons mentioned in the charges. Thirty other persons who were in the building and outside it at the time of the explosion were also injured, and the lifts and the mezzanine floor of the building were badly damaged.
Two of the deceased, Susie Choo and Juliet Goh, were secretaries working in an office on the mezzanine floor, and the third deceased, Yasin, was a driver who was found seriously injured on the road outside MacDonald House. He died two days later from intracranial and blast injuries.
Three days later, on the morning of 13 March at about 8am the appellants, who are Indonesians, were found hanging on to a floating plank in the sea off Pulau Sebarok in Malaysian waters and rescued by two men in a bumboat. At the time of their rescue, the first appellant was bare-bodied and wearing a pair of civilian trousers, while the second appellant was wearing a sports shirt and a pair of civilian trousers. On rescue they told the boatmen they were fishermen whose boat had capsized. Soon after they were handed over to the marine police who were in a passing marine police boat and brought ashore to Singapore.
They were then taken to the Marine Police Station. They arrived there at about 11.05am as also did their two rescuers, Lee Ah Paw and Tay Woon Lim. Inspector Mahmud of the marine police took charge of the appellants and had them placed in the passageway of the lockup. The inspector, after recording a statement from Tay Woon Lim, the taikong of the bumboat, formally charged the first appellant with having entered a controlled area, an offence under the Internal Security Act. At that time there was a state of `confrontation` by Indonesia against Malaysia.
Immediately thereafter it occurred to the inspector that the appellants might be able to throw some light on the MacDonald House explosion. As a result of questions put to the first appellant and his replies thereto, the inspector contacted the Special Investigation Section of the Criminal Investigation Department. After he had dealt with the first appellant, inspector Mahmud next charged the second appellant with having entered a controlled area.
At about 1.15pm the same day Senior I nspector Hill of the Special Investigation Section of the Criminal Investigation Department arrived at the Marine Police Station and took over the investigations from inspector Mahmud.
At 1.25pm Mr Hill commenced interrogating the first appellant with the assistance of Saruan, a Malay translator attached to the criminal investigation department, as interpreter. The interrogation, which took place in a room in the marine police station in which no one else was present, began with a caution administered by Mr Hill through the interpreter Saruan to the first appellant in the following terms: `You are not obliged to say, but anything you say may be given in evidence`. Thereafter, the interrogation took the form of questions and answers which were duly recorded by Mr Hill and subsequently read back to the first appellant, who signed the recorded questions and answers without making any corrections thereto, although he was expressly informed of his right to do so.
Then Mr Hill prepared formal charges against the first appellant charging him with the offences of murder of the three deceased persons Susie Choo, Juliet Goh and Yasin, and through the interpreter read these charges out to the first appellant. Mr Hill then cautioned him through the interpreter in the following terms: 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charges? You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.
 
 
 
The first appellant then volunteered the following statement: 
 
I reached Singapore on Wednesday at 11am. I was not alone. I came with Harun bin Said. We then walked towards the main road to look for a taxi when we got a taxi we went looking for a place to eat. After eating. Actually we went for a drink. After eating Harun and I, I mean after drinking Harun and I went to look for a target (sasaran). After finding the target, we went to eat. After eating we had some rest. After resting we straight went to the building. We then placed the two bundles of explosives (ledakkan) on stairs before reaching the first floor (tengkat satu). After placing the two bundles Harun lighted the fuse (sumbu). After that we left and took a bus. It was raining. I did not hear the explosion.
 
 
 
The caution and the volunteered statement which were recorded by Mr Hill were signed by the first appellant without any corrections after they had been read back to him.
Another police officer, ASP Khosa, who was assisting Mr Hill in the MacDonald House investigations, interrogated the second appellant at about 4.20pm on the same day in a room on the first floor of the marine police station, with no one else present except the same interpreter, Saruan. After the usual caution had been administered by Mr Khosa, the interrogation took the usual form of questions and answers which were duly recorded, eventually read back to the second appellant and signed by him.
As a result of that interrogation, Mr Khosa prepared three charges of murder against the second appellant in respect of the deaths of Susie Choo, Juliet Goh and Yasin, and at about 5.15pm the same day, through the same interpreter, read out the three charges to the second appellant. Then Mr Khosa administered the usual formal caution to an accused person through the interpreter to the second appellant, who volunteered a statement which Mr Khosa recorded. The recorded statement was then read back to the second appellant, who, though he was informed he could ask for corrections to be made if he so desired, signed it without making any corrections. The recorded statement is as follows: 
 
On 10 March 1965 Wednesday I came to Singapore with Osman bin Haji Mohd Ali on instructions from `Komando Operasi Tertinggi Indonesia.` My instructions as a sworn soldier were to carry the given parcel and light it at the electric power station in Singapore or any other building. Because of this instruction I came to Pasir Panjang with Osman and later went to the building where I lighted the fuse to the bundle. The two bundles were placed on a landing at a staircase of the tall building. After lighting the fuse Osman and I took a bus to Jalan Sultan. It was raining when I took the bus. We spent the night in a junk anchored at Tg Rhu S`pore. I do not know what happened after I lighted the fuse.
 
 
 
At 6.15pm the same day the first appellant in the presence of Mr Donald Yeo, then a magistrate, made a statement which was recorded by the magistrate with the assistance of an interpreter attached to the magistrates` courts. This statement is in the following terms: 
 
I was instructed by Lieutenant Paulus Subekti to cause trouble in Singapore. I left Indonesia on Monday 10 March 1965. I entered Singapore on Wednesday. I and a friend went ashore. I then looked for a taxi. We boarded a taxi and went looking for a place to have some refreshment. We had our refreshment at one of the coffee shops in Singapore.
 
 
 
We then boarded another taxi after that to look for suitable targets. After we had found a suitable target we then went to an eating shop and had our lunch.
After our meal we took a parcel containing explosives to the place which we mentioned earlier. 
 
Q: Do you know where?
A: According to my friend the building where we should put explosives was the most suitable place. I do not know what kind of building it was. I was told by my friend the building belonged to a European concern.
 
 
 
Soon after it began to rain. I then put explosives on first floor of the building. What I meant was the floor between the ground floor and the first floor. My friend then lighted the fuse. As soon as fuse was lighted we left building and boarded the bus. I don`t know where the bus took me to. My friend knows his way around Singapore.
 
 
 
We slept in taxi at night. The next day also we slept in taxi. That would be the second day.
On the third day at about 11.00pm we decided to leave Singapore Island. We boarded our motor boat. The boat smashed against a reef or rock. The boat was smashed to pieces. Each of us who got a plank from the smashed boat with its help we started swimming.
The current was strong. Our idea was to go towards the International Waters but because of strong currents we failed to do so.
At about 7.00am we were still stranded within Malaysian waters. We were then arrested by Malaysian Police.
I appeal for leniency.
At the trial both appellants retracted from the witness box all the statements made by them on the day of their arrest, their defence being that on the day of the explosion they were in Indonesia. In the case of the statements made before the police officers, Mr Hill and Mr Khosa their evidence was that, though they signed these statements, the contents thereof were untrue and that they were assaulted and forced to sign them. In the case of the statement made before the magistrate, Mr Yeo, the first appellant`s evidence was that he was taught by the police what he should say before the magistrate, that he was threatened with assault to death if he did not say what he had been taught, and that he was promised his freedom if he did. His evidence was that the contents of that statement were untrue.
The only other evidence material for the purpose of determining the guilt or otherwise of the appellants was the evidence of one Tan Boh Eng, a bus conductor. On 10 March 1965 he was conductor of Hock Lee Bus No SH 482, which was operating on the route from Alexandra to Jalan Kubor viaOrchard Road. One or two minutes past 3pm that day his bus arrived at the bus stop situate a few doors away from MacDonald House. After a short halt there, the bus moved on for a very short distance but was held up by the traffic lights at the junction of Orchard Road and Penang Road, and while it was there the appellants boarded the bus. They alighted from the bus at Victoria Street at a bus stop before the Jalan Kubor terminus. He attended an identification parade conducted by the police on 18 March 1965 and picked out the appellants as the two persons who had boarded the bus soon after 3pm on 10 March 1965 when it was held up by the traffic lights at the junction of Orchard Road and Penang Road.
The appellants were represented by one counsel at the trial, and a preliminary point was taken that they were members of the armed forces of Indonesia and were prisoners of war within the meaning of art 4 of the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. This claim was contested by the prosecution and evidence was led by the prosecution and the defence on this issue. The trial judge after hearing the evidence and submissions of counsel came to the conclusion that on the evidence they were not members of the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia. He also held that, even though they were members of the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia, they were not in uniform but in civilian clothing when they were rescued from the sea and captured and were therefore not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war under that Convention.
The first question raised in this appeal is whether or not the above-mentioned Convention is applicable in Singapore. In the case of 
 Stanislaus Krofan & Anor 
 
 v PP 
 
 
 [1965-1968] SLR 114 
 we have set out our reasons why we consider we should adopt the course of declining to decide this question and we do not propose to restate them now. Suffice it for us to say that the question was not raised before the trial judge and we therefore, proceed to deal with this appeal on the assumption that the Convention is applicable in Singapore.
The next question is whether or not the appellants are prisoners of war within the meaning of art 4. The trial judge on the evidence before him found that the appellants were not members of the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia. Counsel for the appellants has urged upon us that this finding of fact was wrong. We have examined the record with considerable care and are satisfied that there was ample evidence to support the trial judge`s finding.
However, in view of the fact that the appellants are Indonesians and were apprehended when there was a state of `confrontation` amounting to armed conflict between that country and Malaysia of which Singapore was then a part, we think it desirable to consider this question on the assumption that they were members of the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia. The facts as found by the trial judge were that they were rescued in Singapore waters and captured in civilian clothing. There can be no doubt at all, assuming they were the persons who placed and set off the explosives at MacDonald House, that they entered and left that building in civilian clothing and were so attired throughout their presence in Singapore. Nor can there be the least doubt that the explosion at MacDonald House was not only an act of sabotage but one totally unconnected with the necessities of war. It seems to us clear beyond doubt that under international law a member of the armed forces of a party to a conflict who, out of uniform and in civilian clothing, sets off explosives in the territory of the other party to the conflict in a non-military building in which civilians are doing work unconnected with any war effort forfeits his right on capture to be treated as a prisoner of war. In our opinion on the facts of this case the appellants, assuming they were members of the regular armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia, are not prisoners of war within the meaning of art 4 of the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.
It is next urged upon us by counsel for the appellants that the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances existing prior to and at the time they were recorded, was wrong in law in admitting in evidence the statements made by the appellants to the police officers, Mr Hill and Mr Khosa, and to the magistrate Mr Donald Yeo.
At the trial when these statements were tendered in evidence objection was taken by defence counsel that they were inadmissible and that issue was duly tried. The trial judge ruled all these statements to be admissible in evidence as being voluntary statements, the making of which was not caused by any inducement, threat, promise or force.
Before us, it is contended that because all these statements were made within a short period of 51/2 hours and on the very day of their arrest and because the appellants were given no food during that period of time the trial judge should not have admitted them in evidence. We find no substance in this argument and we uphold the trial judge`s ruling that they were properly admissible in evidence.
The next contention is that the statements amount to confessions, and the appellants having retracted them at the trial, no weight ought to have been attached to them, and there being no other evidence to prove the charges against the appellants, they ought to have been acquitted. It is also urged upon us that a retracted confession cannot be made solely the basis of a conviction unless the same is corroborated and certain Indian authorities were relied upon for this proposition.
We do not agree with the Indian cases cited. We adopt the view of the Malayan Union Court of Appeal in the case of 
 Yap Sow Keong 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 90
  which was stated in these words: 
 
In our view the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions in evidence is clear, and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court in satisfied of its truth. We do not agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on his retracted confession there must be corroborative evidence to support it.
 
 
 
Applying this principle to the facts of the present case we cannot but arrive at the same conclusion as the trial judge who after considering the whole of the evidence `was convinced that the confessions made by the two accused were true.` Let us examine the facts. There was the evidence of the bus conductor, which the trial judge accepted, who identified the appellants as being near MacDonald House at the time of the explosion. There was the evidence that they were found in Malaysian waters, where there was no valid reason for them, as Indonesians, to be at a time when Indonesia was confronting Malaysia. They gave evidence that they had been ordered by a superior officer to proceed to an island off Singapore in Malaysian territory to meet a Chinese who would give them a boat laden with goods to take back to Indonesia and that while on this journey their small boat collided with an object and sank. This was a most improbable story having regard to the fact of armed confrontation and one which the trial judge disbelieved. We then have this picture. At a time when Indonesia was confronting Malaysia, a non-military building in Malaysian territory was badly damaged as the result of an explosion in which between 20 to 25 lbs of explosives of the nitro-glycerine group had been used. At the time of this explosion and very near the scene of this explosion were two Indonesians. Two Indonesians were rescued three days later in Malaysian waters. They turned out to be the same two Indonesians whom a witness, accepted as a witness of truth by the trial judge, saw near the scene immediately before the explosion occurred. They confessed that they were responsible for this explosion. Later on in court they retracted their confessions and gave a reason why they were in Malaysian waters at the time of their capture, which reason to say the least was highly improbable. They also gave reasons why they confessed to something untrue, which reasons were disbelieved by the trial judge who also held that their confessi ons had been voluntarily made. From this picture we are satisfied that the trial judge notwithstanding the confessions were retracted was entitled to come and amply justified in coming to the conclusion that the confessions were true and in convicting the appellants.
We accordingly dismiss the appeals and affirm the convictions and the sentences.

The Attorney General applies for the transfer for trial to this court of this case in which it is claimed the law is complex, the trial likely to be lengthy, and the documentary exhibits voluminous.
The application is strongly opposed by counsel representing all the four accused persons concerned who claim that the case is within the competence of the district courts and that it would be against the financial interests of the accused persons to have it so transferred. It is also stressed that all the charges involve the same transaction and that the law is not complicated.
I am inclined to agree that, on the facts before me, this is the kind of case where the supreme needs of justice do not require that the ordinary course of justice should be altered. Its length alone is not necessarily a decisive factor for a transfer to this court and the mere fact that the case involves some knowledge of shipping and banking practice does not in my opinion render it beyond the competence of the courts already entrusted by the legislature with the task of hearing trials of accused persons charged with cheating and allied offences.
The power to order a transfer of a case to the High Court direct, without a preliminary inquiry, has very rarely been exercised and, in the only case in the post-war era in which it has been so exercised, both the prosecution and the defence were agreed that the High Court should try it - although there was disagreement between them about the right to a preliminary inquiry which the court decided did not exist in the case of a trial without jury. That case moreover proceeded on the common ground that a fair and impartial trial could not be had before the district courts. This case does not.
The prosecution have power under s 177 to apply for the case to be sent for a preliminary inquiry with a view to committal to the High Court. Perhaps the Attorney General would like to consider whether he wishes to exercise his powers under this section.
Another matter on which I feel obliged to comment is the fact that s 176 requires an application to be supported by an affidavit except where the applicant is the Attorney General or the Solicitor General. Without disrespect to the learned senior state counsel whose experience is wide and whose assurances from the Bar a court would be slow to refuse to accept I think that s 176 contemplates an application by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General in person. Otherwise the section would have mentioned the Public Prosecutor or a DPP.
I would accordingly make no order on this motion.

At about 6.50pm on 9 November 1963 three men entered a shop in Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore by the back door. There were then in the shop, its owner Chia Mui Song, his nephew Tan Peng Puan, three girls and two children. Tan Peng Puan was just about to leave the shop by the back door when the men came in. The leading man, identified by witnesses for the prosecution as the appellant, produced a revolver and told Tan Peng Puan to go back into the shop. The other two men were armed with knives. The appellant seized Tan Peng Puan`s left arm and twisted it behind his back. He took Tan Peng Puan up to the counter in the shop behind which Chia Mui Song was sitting. The other two men attended to the other persons in the shop. According to Tan Peng Puan, the appellant told Chia Mui Song to come out from behind the counter. Chia Mui Song did so and stood by a table near by. The appellant asked him for his keys and tried to search him. Chia Mui Song brushed his hands away and the appellant then fired a shot, Tan Peng Puan testified, in the direction of Chia Mui Song which hit him in the arm. After this there was a struggle between Chia Mui Song and one of the two men who had come in with the appellant, over possession of a chair. Chia Mui Song let go of the chair and tried to get hold of the telephone which was on the counter behind which he had been sitting. Tan Peng Puan said that when Chia Mui Song touched the telephone, the appellant fired again and Tan Peng Puan then saw Chia Mui Song hold his chest with his hands and collapse to the floor. After the shots were fired, the appellant and the other two men ran out of the back door of the shop. Chia Mui Song died.
Although the witnesses for the prosecution said that they only heard two shots fired, the post mortem examination of Chia Mui Song showed that more than that number must have been fired. The doctor who did the post mortem said that one bullet had entered the lower third of Chia Mui Song`s right forearm and had emerged nearer the elbow. He said that another bullet had passed through his right forearm. A bullet had entered the right side of Chia Mui Song`s chest high up and had gone through his heart. Another bullet had entered his right side directly below that one, in the region of the eighth rib. This had gone through his liver and into into the abdomen. In the doctor`s opinion these two bullets had caused Chia Mui Song`s death. Another bullet had grazed his back and gone through his left buttock. This bullet must have been fired when Chia Mui Song was sideways on to the appellant.
So, from the doctor`s evidence, it appears that three bullets struck Chia Mui Song`s body and two his right arm. One or both the shots which went through his right forearm may have entered his body but for that to have happened, and there was no evidence that it did, Chia Mui Song`s right forearm must, when the shot was fired, have been in front of that part of his body into which the bullet entered so that the shot which was fired must have been aimed at his forearm and his body.
By a majority of five to two the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder and the appellant was sentenced to death. The appellant had given evidence. He denied that he had been in the shop at all that evening. Whether the majority verdict was due to some members of the jury having doubts whether he was the man who fired the shots or doubts whether the shooting amounted to murder is not known.
The appellant appealed to the Federal Court of Malaysia. His appeal was dismissed and he now appeals by special leave.
Section 299 of the Penal Code of Singapore provides as follows: 
 
Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.
 
 
 
Section 300 reads as follows: 
 
Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -
 
 
 
Firstly - if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or
 
 
 
Secondly - if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows is likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or
 
 
 
Thirdly - if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or
 
 
 
Fourthly - if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such an act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
 
 
 
Where the trial is before a jury, it is for the jury to decide whether the accused had the knowledge or intention specified by s 300 as necessary to constitute the offence of murder.
In this case the learned judge began his summing-up by telling the jury that they had to decide all questions of fact, that they would give due consideration to any opinions expressed by him but that it was their duty to disregard them if they disagreed with them.
He then explained to them the first, third and fourth parts of s 300. He did not refer to the second part of that section.
After he had dealt with the burden of proof, he reviewed the evidence. He told them that in the light of the medical evidence they would have no difficulty in concluding that the two bullets which entered the deceased`s chest caused his death and that the wounds they inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
He then turned to what he described as the main issue in the case, namely whether the accused had fired the shots which caused the deceased`s death. Having reviewed the evidence on this, he told the jury that if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had fired the shots which caused the deceased`s death, they must go on to consider his state of mind at the time he shot the deceased.
The learned judge told them that the first question they had to decide was whether the accused intended to cause the deceased`s death. With regard to this he said: 
 
It seems to me a reasonable possibility that when he` (the accused) `fired the first shot he was trying to intimidate the deceased and make him hand over the keys. It also seems to me a reasonable possibility that when he fired the second and third shots he was aiming at the deceased`s right forearm which had altogether four injuries and that his intention was only to prevent the deceased from telephoning to the police. If you take the same view, as myself, you will decide that there was no intention to cause death.
 
 
 
The learned judge then turned to the third part of s 300. Having earlier in his summing-up told the jury that they would have no difficulty in concluding that the wounds in the deceased`s body were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, he expressed the opinion that it was a reasonable possibility that those wounds were not intended. He repeated that it seemed to him a reasonable possibility that the accused was aiming at the deceased`s forearm with the intention of preventing the deceased from telephoning to the police and that the bullets entered the chest and abdomen of the deceased either after passing through or without passing through his right forearm. He said: 
 
If you take the same view as myself, you will decide that the injuries to the chest and abdomen were not intentionally inflicted by the accused.
 
 
 
He thus directed them if they took the same view of the evidence as he did, not to find the` accused guilty of murder under the third limb of s 300. 
 
Tan Peng Puan said that the first shot had hit Chia Mui Song in the arm. The injuries suffered by the deceased showed that another shot had passed through his arm. Two shots must have been fired when the revolver was aimed at the deceased`s chest. One or both of these may have passed through his forearm but if that happened, it must have happened when his forearm was in front of his body and the revolver aimed at the chest. Even if the accused had fired with the intention of preventing the deceased telephoning the police, that does not exclude an intention to kill or to cause bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
 
 
 
The learned judge appears to have assumed that the jury would also take the view that it was a reasonable possibility that the accused had only intended to hit the deceased in the arm. He did not tell them that if they disagreed with his view and were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the shots fired at close range into the deceased`s body could only have been fired with the intention of killing or of inflicting such bodily injury as would in the ordinary course of nature cause death, they were entitled to return a verdict of guilty. If it was to be inferred from the fact that the first shot entered the deceased`s arm, that it was then the accused`s intention only to hit the arm, he did not point out that it did not necessarily follow that the second and third shots had been fired with the same intention or refer to the possibility that one or both the shots which entered his chest had gone through the deceased`s forearm as a result of the deceased putting his arm in front of his chest, when the shot was fired.
The judge then went on to tell the jury that they had to consider whether the accused knew that his act in aiming at the forearm was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or bodily injury likely to cause death. He then said: 
 
To my mind it seems impossible to believe that the accused did not have such knowledge. It seems that one cannot possibly entertain any doubt as to the existence of such knowledge in the mind of the accused. ... It seems to me that as far as the state of mind of the accused is concerned, the irresistible inference is that he had the knowledge that the act of shooting at the deceased`s forearm was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or bodily injury likely to cause death. ... It seems to me, therefore, that the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt one of the states of mind required for the offence of murder.
 
 
 
Complaint was made on behalf of the appellant that the judge failed to leave to the jury the vital question whether the appellant, if he fired the fatal shots, had any of the states of mind necessary to constitute the crime of murder. If his direction with regard to the first and third parts of s 300 based on the hypothesis, unsupported by any evidence, that the shots were fired with the intention of only hitting the deceased in the forearm was unduly favourable to the accused, his direction with regard to the fourth part really amounted to taking the issue away from the jury.
In their Lordships` view it was unfortunate that the learned judge gave expression to his views in the way he did. Although he told the jury that it was for them to consider what was the accused`s state of mind, he only gave them his own views as to that. He did not put before them other possible views for their consideration and he expressed the conclusion that it was an irresistible inference that the accused had knowledge that shooting at the deceased`s forearm was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or bodily injury likely to cause death. The jury might have taken the view that shooting at the deceased`s forearm was not of itself likely to cause death or such a bodily injury, or if it was, that the accused did not know it. Whether the act done by the accused was of this character was a matter for the jury to consider and to decide.
The learned judge appears to have proceeded on the basis that the four limbs of s 300 are mutually exclusive. That would not appear to be the case. For instance, an act may be done with the intention of causing bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and also with the knowledge that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.
The passage quoted above from the summing-up was followed by the judge saying: 
 
Your main task is, therefore, to decide whether you fully accept the evidence of Tan Peng Puan and Goh Ah Hong that it was the accused who fired the bullets which penetrated the deceased`s chest and abdomen. 
 If you are fully satisfied on this point, that is, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, you will find the accused guilty of murder
.
 
 
 
The words in italics were said by the judge near the end of his summing-up and following as they did the judge`s firm expression of opinion that the accused, if he fired the shots, had the state of mind necessary to constitute the offence of murder, they may have led the jury to conclude that in substance the only issue for them was whether the accused fired the shots.
In their Lordships` view this amounted to a misdirection of such a character that the conviction cannot be allowed to stand.
Two further grounds were put forward on behalf of the appellant. It was argued that the learned judge was wrong in not leaving the offence of culpable homicide to the jury. If the act causing death is done with the intention of causing bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, it comes within the third limb of s 300 and the offence is murder. If the act is done with the intention of causing bodily injury likely to cause death and it is not shown that the accused knew that that was the likely consequence, it is culpable homicide. It is not possible to define with precision the meaning to be given to the word `likely` but the contrast between the use of that word in s 299 and the words in the third limb of s 300 indicates that a higher degree of certainty is required to justify conviction under that limb for murder. In this case although the judge did tell the jury that they had to consider the third part of s 300, his direction was such as to amount to a direction that that part of s 300 did not apply. Where the question whether a case comes within this part of s 300 is in reality left to a jury, it is difficult to envisage a case in which reference ought not to be made to s 299 and to the contrast between the word `likely` in that section and the words `sufficient in the ordinary course of nature` in s 300, and it is also difficult to envisage a case in which it would not be right to leave the question of a verdict of culpable homicide to the jury.
The third ground of appeal was with regard to the cross-examination to which the accused was subjected. While some criticism can properly be made of that, it is not of such a character that in their Lordships` view it would be right to quash the conviction on this ground.
Their Lordships were invited to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. By the proviso to s 60(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 the Federal Court is given power to take that course notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
In 
 Woolmington 
 
 v DPP 
 
[1935] AC 462
 Lord Sankey LC said at p 482 in relation to the similar provision in the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 that the test was whether `if the jury had been properly directed they would inevitably have come to the same conclusion.` In 
 Stirland 
 
 v 
 
 DPP 
 
[1944] AC 315
; [1944] 2 All ER 13, Lord Simon at p 321 said that the provision assumed `a situation where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt convict.`
On the simple facts of this case it might well be said that a reasonable jury properly directed would inevitably and without doubt have reached the conclusion that the person who fired the shots was guilty of murder. Their Lordships cannot, however, disregard the fact that the learned judge who heard the evidence formed the view that the accused`s intention was only to shoot the deceased in the forearm. They are unable therefore to exclude the possibility that a reasonable jury properly directed would have reached the same conclusion, and, if it had, the possibility that it would not have concluded that the accused knew that the shots at the deceased`s forearm were so imminently dangerous that they must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death or that the injury intended was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Their Lordships are therefore unable to apply the proviso.
On any view of the evidence the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide.
For the reasons stated their Lordships allowed the appeal and set aside the verdict of guilty of murder and quashed the sentence of death passed on the appellant and substituted therefor a verdict of guilty of culpable homicide and a sentence of imprisonment for life.

2851284,R v Droudis (No. 4) [2016] NSWSC 1150,"JUDGMENT

 


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has called as a witness, John Aspros, who is the brother of the Accused.
	
	
	The particular piece of evidence which the Crown is seeking to adduce from Mr Aspros relates to a conversation which he had with police officers who visited his home on 21 April 2013, the day upon which the deceased was killed.
	
	
	There is already evidence in the trial of the visit by police and the conversation with Mr Aspros, through the testimony of Detective Senior Constable Megan Oxley (T169).
	
	
	I apprehend that the Crown is seeking to adduce evidence from Mr Aspros that he had not seen his sister, the Accused, for some days. This evidence, as I understand it, bears upon the issue of alibi.
	
	
	There has already been evidence from Anastasia (Sue) Droudis, a cousin of the Accused, and Mr Aspros. She has stated that Mr Aspros suffers from schizophrenia. She gave some evidence yesterday about Mr Aspros and features of his life, including memory. That evidence was taken initially on the voir dire, but was ultimately admitted without objection.
	
	
	A point has been reached in the evidence of Mr Aspros today where he is being asked about the occasion when police officers came and spoke to him at his house. He has said that he recalls two police officers, one male and one female, attending. He indicated (although he stated that he could not recall all that was said), that there was mention of the name of his sister and where she had been in the last two or three months.
	
	
	The Crown asked Mr Aspros for his best recollection of what was said thereafter in this conversation and he said that he could not recall. The Crown then asked Mr Aspros whether what he said on this occasion was the truth (T343). That question drew an objection. Mr Aspros left the Court and submissions have been made on the objection.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused submits that the question is objectionable - that Mr Aspros cannot answer a question as to whether what he was saying was the truth when he himself cannot recall what it was that was being said. It is submitted that any answer that would be given, in any event, would result in the prejudicial effect of the answer exceeding probative value (ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995).
	
	
	The Crown submits that the position is one where the witness has effectively exhausted any actual memory of what occurred, but is in a position to answer as to whether on the occasion he was or was not telling the truth, and that any answer to that question is admissible and has probative value.
	
	
	It is the case, and it is agreed between the parties, that Mr Aspros was, at that time, and for some time prior to 21 April 2013, suffering from schizophrenia. The evidence yesterday of Anastasia (Sue) Droudis indicated his memory was affected in different ways, to her observation, apparently as a result of that condition.
	
	
	If Mr Aspros was unable to remember the event at all, namely police officers attending and having a discussion with him about his sister, then the present question, it seems to me, would in truth go nowhere. However, Mr Aspros has given some evidence about the attendance of police officers and about some, at least, of the topics discussed.
	
	
	It seems to me that the witness, even if he is not able to give further evidence as a result of lack of recollection concerning the detail of what was said, may be asked permissibly whether, on the occasion which he does recall, he was seeking to tell the truth.
	
	
	In my view, the question is relevant and any answer is relevant to the issues in the proceedings. The ultimate question as to what weight can be given to it will be a matter for assessment in the light of other evidence to be adduced in the trial.
	
	
	The Court is not in a position to conclude that the prejudicial effect of the answer is such as to lead the Court to reject the question itself at the threshold.
	
	
	Accordingly, I allow the question and I will ask Mr Aspros to return to Court to continue his evidence.

The appellant was charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) as follows: 
 
You, Balasundaram s/o Suppiah M/26 yrs, NRIC No 6832377/J, are charged that you, on or about 8 February 1992, at about 9.50am, did knowingly give to Assistant Special Investigator Zainudin Mohd Amin of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, Singapore, information relating to the commission of an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, to wit, that one Corporal Rajendran s/o Kannusamy of the Central Police Station had offered you a bribe of $500 to withdraw a police report lodged by you against the said Corporal Rajendran s/o Kannusamy and one Inspector Ronnie Cheam of the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, which was false and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 26A(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to three months` imprisonment. On appeal, the primary issue before me, as contended by counsel for the appellant, was whether the trial judge had erred in law in refusing to grant an adjournment which the appellant had sought to enable him to be represented by counsel of his choice, thus resulting in the appellant suffering a miscarriage of justice. After hearing the arguments before me, I was of the view that the appellant`s contention was without merit and accordingly dismissed the appeal. Before I deal with the reasons for the dismissal, I should give a brief account of the events that led to this appeal.
The appellant was charged in court on 22 July 1995. He was represented by one Mr Suresh Damodara. On 28 October 1995, the matter was fixed for trial which was to commence on 14 December 1995. The fixing was attended by one Ms Dube, and there was no record that she had objected to the trial dates. However, on 11 December 1995, Mr Damodara faxed a letter to the court registry and applied to vacate the hearing dates as he had to go for reservist training and had to prepare oral submissions for a High Court case which had to be completed in five days` time. The registrar replied the next day and informed Mr Damodara that his application to vacate the hearing dates had been rejected and that the hearing would proceed as scheduled. A second request was sent by Mr Damodara on the same day but this was once again turned down. On 13 December 1995, Mr Damodara appeared before the registrar to make a personal appeal but was told that his request could not be acceded to.
On the day of trial, Ms Dube appeared on behalf of Mr Damodara and applied for a week`s adjournment. The application was refused and the appellant discharged her. He then refused to take part in the proceedings, which were then stood down after the first witness was called to enable him to reconsider his position. Subsequently the appellant changed his mind and decided to engage Ms Dube to conduct his defence. However, Ms Dube was certified unwell for two days and sought the court`s indulgence for more time to prepare the case. Thus, proceedings were adjourned to 18 December 1995. On the morning of 18 December, the appellant once again discharged Ms Dube. It turned out that on 15 December he had engaged one Mr JB Jeyaretnam to represent him. Mr Jeyaretnam made an application to vacate the hearing dates once again, and to have the trial postponed for two to three weeks on the grounds that he was not prepared for the hearing and that the right to counsel of the appellant`s choice was a constitutional right. The appellant had been warned by Mr Jeyaretnam on 12 December that, if he could not get an adjournment, he would not be able to conduct the case for him. The trial judge refused the application and proceeded with the trial.
During the trial the appellant maintained his stand of not taking part in proceedings. At the end of the proceedings, the trial judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and the appellant was convicted and sentenced to three months` imprisonment.
In dealing with the question of law posed before me, it would be apt to refer first and foremost to art 9(3) of the Constitution of Singapore which provides: 
 
Where a person is arrested he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
 
 
 
Reference should also be made to s 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides: 
 
Every person accused before any criminal court may of right be defended by an advocate.
 
 
 
Moreover, the court`s power to adjourn or postpone proceedings in criminal matters is governed by s 198(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which states: 
 
If in the absence of a witness or any other reasonable cause it becomes necessary or advisable to do so, a court may, by order, postpone the commencement of or adjourn any inquiry or trial on such terms as it thinks fit for such time as it considers reasonable and may, if the accused is not on bail, by a warrant remand the accused in such custody as the court thinks fit.
 
 
 
Although the appellant`s right to counsel is clearly spelt out in the Constitution as well as in the Criminal Procedure Code, this right is not an unqualified right. This had been established in the case of 
 Palaniappa Chettiar v Arunasalam Chettiar 
 FM CA 34/58 (unreported, quoted in 
 Practice Direction (Adjournment) 
 [1961] MLJ xxxiii) by Dato Sir James Thomson CJ who said: 
 
It is wrong to say, as is frequently said, that a litigant is entitled to be represented by the counsel of his choice. The true statement is that he is entitled to be represented by the counsel of his choice if that counsel is willing and able to represent him.
 
 
 
This passage was quoted with approval by Sharma J in 
 Bakar bin Ahmad v PP 
(1968) 4 MC 294 and cited in Jayakumar`s 
 Constitutional Law Cases from Malaysia and Singapore. 
It was also reiterated in
 Mohamed bin Abdullah v PP 
 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 201
  in which Harun J said: 
 
With respect, I agree with the aforesaid interpretation of art 5(3) of the Constitution [which is equivalent to art 9(3) of the Constitution of Singapore] in so far as it concerns an accused person`s right to counsel. The right is only to choice of counsel who is willing and able to act. It does not confer a right to counsel in every case, that is to say, it does not mean that an accused person cannot be tried unless he is represented by counsel which is what the appellant is in substance contending. That is the position in the United States where the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution provides:
 
 
 
`In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.`
 
 
 
It is the duty of an accused person to attend court when called upon and any obligation on counsel arises by reason of the contract between him and his client. If counsel is absent on the date of trial that is a matter between client and counsel. Article 5(3) does not in any way restrict the power of the court to fix any date for the hearing of a case nor does it prohibit the court from hearing the case in the absence of counsel who has been retained.
 
 
 
Thus it is clear from the authorities that, if counsel fails to turn up or is not willing or able to act for the accused person, the latter cannot by virtue of this fact alone claim that his constitutional right has been violated and as such any proceedings against him are rendered null and void. The question then is whether there had been a miscarriage of justice when the trial judge refused the appellant`s application for an adjournment thus depriving him of Mr Jeyaretnam`s representation. It should be borne in mind that this is a question of fact in the individual case. In 
 Tan Eng Hoe v Liang Hooi Kiang 
 
 
 
[1961] MLJ 119
 , the trial had been fixed for 13 June 1959 but was postponed to 11 May 1960 at the instance of the appellant. On 25 March 1960 the appellant asked his then solicitor to apply for another postponement on the ground that he wanted to go to Thailand for three months. He had also wanted to retain a senior counsel of his choice. The trial judge rejected the application on the ground that the appellant had been aware since the end of March of the date of the hearing. Furthermore, he had not gone to Thailand as he claimed and had desired a postponement merely for the purpose of retaining senior counsel of his choice. The trial judge found that he had deliberately intended not to be ready for the hearing on the date fixed and thus the responsibility lay solely with him. The Court of Appeal refused to disturb the trial judge`s decision and adopted the words of the then Chief Justice in
 Palaniappa Chettiar v Arunasalam 
 
 Chettiar 
: 
 
With regard to the refusal to grant an adjournment, it is well-settled law that the refusal of an adjournment of a trial is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal will be slow to interfere with his discretion unless it appears that the result of an order refusing the adjournment has been to defeat the rights of the applicant altogether and to do that which the Court of Appeal is satisfied is an injustice to him ... It is wrong to say, as is frequently said, that a litigant is entitled to be represented by the counsel of his choice. The true statement is that he is entitled to be represented by the counsel of his choice if that counsel is willing and able to represent him. Here counsel, although no doubt willing, was not able to appear. The appellant had known for at least a week and probably longer that the counsel of his choice would be unable to appear and he was not entitled to insist as he attempted to insist that the case should be adjourned until the counsel of his choice was able to appear.
 
 
 
Similarly in the present case, I was satisfied that there had been no miscarriage of justice. The trial date had been fixed since October 1995, some six weeks before the case was due to be heard. No objections about the hearing dates were made then by Ms Dube who was in attendance. However, on 11 December 1995, barely three days before the trial, Mr Damodara made an application to adjourn the proceedings on the grounds that he had to attend reservist training and that he had to prepare for oral submissions in a High Court case to be completed in five days` time. The trial judge was right in rejecting these grounds as valid and sufficient to adjourn the proceedings. As for the first ground, Mr Damodara had failed to explain when he had been notified of his reservist training and why he had not given advance notice of this fact to the court. With regard to the second ground, I agreed with the trial judge that this was clearly not a satisfactory explanation, since the oral submissions in the High Court were not being presented on the same day as this trial.
The appellant argued, however, that it was not due to his fault that Mr Damodara could not act for him and had given such late notice to the court. Thus, he ought not to be penalized for it. Counsel for the appellant cited the case of
 Dietrich v The Queen 
 (1992) 177 CLR 292 in support of his contention. Olaf Dietrich was charged before the County Court at Melbourne, Australia, with offences against the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) including the offence of importing into Australia not less than a trafficable quantity of heroin. The appellant`s application for legal assistance at public expense was unsuccessful and, before the trial commenced, he applied for an adjournment which was refused. Thus the appellant was unrepresented at trial before the judge and jury and was convicted. On appeal to the High Court of Australia, the appellant contended that there had been a miscarriage of justice by virtue of the fact that he was not provided with legal representation. The court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction of the court below, and ordered a new trial.
It should be noted that, in that case, the appellant had applied on numerous occasions to be represented by a counsel at public expense but his application had been rejected. The High Court found that the appellant had been deprived of legal representation 
 through no fault of his own 
. As such the court felt that the appellant had been deprived of a right to fair trial. Nowhere in the judgment of the High Court of Australia was it pronounced that the appellant had a right to be represented by counsel of his choice come what may. It is also pertinent to note that the court did not attempt to make a sweeping statement to the effect that the mere fact that an accused is unrepresented will itself amount to a miscarriage of justice. The court did state however that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a judge faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an
 indigent accused 
charged with a serious offence, who 
 through no fault of his own 
was unable to obtain legal representation, should adjourn, postpone or stay the trial until legal representation was available.
This is to be contrasted with the present case, in which the appellant had ample opportunity to be represented by counsel, namely, Ms Dube, a lawyer in the same firm and to whom Mr Damodara had in fact offered to pass the appellant`s brief. The appellant had also been informed by Mr Jeyaretnam that, if an application for an adjournment was refused, he would not be able to represent him on the proposed trial date. On the day of trial, Ms Dube appeared in court but was discharged by the appellant who applied for a week`s adjournment to enable Mr Jeyaretnam to take over the case. The trial judge rightly refused this application. The appellant could not be allowed to insist that Mr Jeyaretnam represent him when he well knew that he would be unable to do so at the trial date. As observed by the trial judge, the appellant apparently did not want nor considered any other solicitor to represent him. His attitude was plainly unreasonable. In fact, Ms Dube was willing and able to conduct the case. This was not a situation in which the appellant had been totally deprived of any representation. In fact, it would seem that the appellant had displayed scant respect for the court and its judicial process by subjecting it to his ever-changing whims and fancies.
In 
 Mohamed bin Abdullah v PP 
 , the appellant`s counsel had not been able to attend the hearing as he had to see to some other matter in another state. The trial judge refused to grant an adjournment and the appellate court held that there had been no miscarriage of justice although the appellant was unrepresented and had chosen to remain silent throughout the proceedings. It is pertinent to note the remark of the trial judge in that case where he said: 
 
The general principle of course is that trial dates should be fixed at the convenience of the court. This is the only way some order can be maintained so that courts sit regularly and public funds are not wasted on empty court rooms with paid staff. For the system to work effectively and efficiently, the prosecution must be ready to proceed with the trial on the appointed dates and defence counsel should not accept a brief if he is already engaged in another court on the same day. In practice, trial dates are fixed well in advance giving ample notice to all concerned and there is no reason why most cases should not be heard on schedule except in the rare case where death or sudden illness has intervened, in short when a trial has been frustrated by some act of God. In the instant case counsel had more than two months` notice of the trial and what was more the dates were fixed to suit counsel`s convenience. Unless courts are in full command of their proceedings, the administration of justice will be chaotic and respect for the law that much diminished. In any organization where a body of men gather together for a common purpose there must be discipline and an acknowledged leader. In a court of law, the Bench must necessarily and logically assume leadership and enforce discipline. It can never be otherwise. This in part explains the attitude of the learned President in the conduct of this case.
 
 
 
The appellant`s conduct was further displayed in the following events. He refused to take part in the proceedings and to answer the court as to whether he was challenging any statements. Nevertheless, the trial judge adequately warned him of the consequences of so doing and the trial was stood down for him to consider his position. The appellant subsequently decided to engage Ms Dube to conduct his defence. The trial judge was prepared to accommodate the appellant`s request within the available trial dates. As Ms Dube was certified unwell for two days, the trial judge allowed the proceedings to be stood down until 18 December. In the meantime Ms Dube was directed to confirm the appellant`s instructions on various matters, in particular whether the appellant was challenging his statements, so that the resumed trial could be more efficiently conducted. The trial judge had clearly granted the appellant sufficient indulgence in the conduct of the proceedings to ensure that the appellant obtained a fair trial. However, the appellant surprised the court once more when, on 18 February, he discharged Ms Dube and decided to engage Mr Jeyaretnam, when he had already been informed by the latter that he could not conduct the case on the stated trial dates.
Be it as it may, the trial judge, in refusing to grant the adjournment requested by Mr Jeyaretnam, was aware that the appellant was unrepresented and had chosen to remain silent. Thus he proceeded with the trial very carefully, instructing the prosecution to prove all matters strictly. In the course of the proceedings, the trial judge also explained to the appellant his rights at the trial and allowed him ample opportunity to cross-examine each prosecution witness. At the end of the prosecution`s case, the court called for the defence and read the standard allocution to the appellant. The trial judge then stood down the proceedings for half an hour to allow the appellant to consider his position. In spite of the appellant`s stand to remain silent, the trial judge went on to satisfy himself that every element of the offence had been made out and that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. In the light of all these, I could see no failure of justice and I could not find any grounds to interfere with the trial judge`s finding of guilt. As such I dismissed the appeal.

The appellant was convicted below on four charges of cheating. He appealed against that decision and was bailed pending the appeal. The hearing was set for 13 February 1996, but was postponed as the appellant was unwell, and had obtained a medical certificate to excuse his absence. This his wife brought and handed over to his counsel, who submitted it to the court. Accordingly, a new date was set for 12 March 1996. By that date, his counsel was ready; the prosecution was ready; and the court was ready. Alas, the appellant was not. On the day of the postponed hearing, he was absent and again tendered, through his wife and his counsel, another medical certificate.
His counsel acknowledged that s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) (Cap 68) permitted the court to dismiss the appeal. But he submitted that it would also be open to the court to exercise its powers of revision under s 268, and in effect allow the appeal. This I was not minded to do, and I dismissed the appeal under s 253. I also issued orders for the bailor to show cause, and for a warrant to issue for the arrest of the sickly appellant. In view of the submissions on ss 253 and 268, I thought it appropriate that some guidance be given on the application of those sections.
 Dismissal of appeal 
Section 253 reads: 
 
(1) When the appeal comes on for hearing the appellant, if present, shall first be heard in support of the appeal, the respondent if present shall be heard against it, and the appellant shall be entitled to reply.
 
 
 
 
(2) If the appellant does not appear to support his appeal in person or by counsel the court shall consider his appeal if the appellant is in custody, and may make such order thereon as it thinks fit. 
 
(3) If the appellant has been granted bail on a recognizance which is to be void if the appellant shall personally appear at the High Court during the hearing of the appeal, the court may dismiss the appeal if the appellant does not appear in person before the High Court on the hearing of the appeal:
  
 
 
Provided that the court may, if it sees fit, reinstate the appeal if the appellant subsequently appears before the court and satisfies the court that his non-appearance was not due to his own fault.
 
 
 
Only sub-s (3) is relevant in the present case. That subsection was incorporated into the precursor section of s 253 in 1933, through s 36 of Ordinance 36 of that year. This provision is home-grown: neither the Indian nor the Federated Malay States Codes have the same provision.
In India, there is no exact equivalent of s 253, but the wording of the nearest section is as follows: 
 
Section 384(1)
 
 
 
If upon examining the petition of appeal and copy of the judgment received under section 382 or section 383, the Appellate Court considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering, it may dismiss the appeal summarily:
 
 
 
Provided that - 
 
(a) no appeal presented under section 382 shall be dismissed unless the appellant or his pleader has had a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same;
 
 
 
 
(b) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed except after giving the appellant a reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same, unless the Appellate Court considers that the appeal is frivolous or that the production of the accused in custody before the Court would involve such an inconvenience as would be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case;
  
 
 
 
...
  
 
 
In Malaysia, criminal procedure is still largely governed, for present purposes, by the Federated Malay States Criminal Procedure Code (FMS CPC), being Enactment 6 of 1935. The relevant provision is s 313(ii), which reads: 
 
If the appellant does not appear to support his appeal the Court may consider his appeal and may make such order thereon as it thinks fit: provided that the Court may refuse to consider the appeal or to make any such order in the case of an appellant who is out of the jurisdiction or who does not appear personally before the Court in pursuance of a condition upon which he was admitted to bail, except on such terms as it thinks fit to impose.
 
 
 
That subsection was first incorporated into the FMS CPC by Enactment 33 of 1932, which amended s 311 of Enactment 22 of 1926, itself replacing the various State enactments of 1902 and 1903. Section 311(ii) of the 1926 enactment read: 
 
If the appellant does not appear to support his appeal the Court shall consider his appeal, and may make such order thereon as it may think fit; provided that the Court may refuse to make any such order in the case of an appellant who is out of the jurisdiction except on such terms as it may think fit to impose.
 
 
 
Section 300(2) of the Straits Settlements CPC of 1926, the precursor of the present s 253, is in the same terms.
No explanation was provided in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council debates of the change in wording to s 300 of the 1926 CPC. It is clear though that the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States thought fit that the court should have some discretion not to hear an appeal in which the appellant has failed to appear. In contrast, it would appear that in India an appeal cannot be dismissed because of the absence of the person supporting the petition of appeal.
As is apparent from the above, there is a difference between the local position and that in Malaysia. There, when an appellant is absent, the court may make an order which it thinks appropriate, or it may refuse to consider the appeal, or make such an order only on condition. There is no express power of dismissal, and indeed it could be interpreted that that provision does not in fact empower the court to dismiss the appeal, but only not to consider it, leaving it to be heard at some date in the future. However, this was not the approach adopted in 
 Rahim bin Usoff & Ors v PP 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 241
 , where Shankar J applied s 313(ii) of Enactment 6 of 1935 in respect of an absent appellant, and ordered the appeal to be dismissed. But, whatever the correct position in Malaysia may be, there is in Singapore an express power to dismiss, subject to reinstatement at the discretion of the court.
Section 253(3) is fairly clear. Some difficulty may be had with the phrase `recognizance which is to be void if the appellant shall personally appear at the High Court during the hearing of the appeal`, but this must be taken to mean one that is conditional upon the appellant appearing in court for the hearing of the appeal. Other than that, it is apparent that the subsection confers a discretion upon the court to dismiss the appeal upon the absence of the appellant, and to reinstate it subsequently if satisfied by the appellant, appearing before the court, that his absence was not caused by his own fault.
But thus far there is no guidance as to the application of this subsection. There are no cases that throw light upon the relevant considerations in the exercise of that discretion. It is necessary then to consider the various policy matters which may be relevant.
 The exercise of the discretion 
There are two broad categories of situations in which an appeal may be dismissed under s 253. In a category one situation, the appellant does not turn up, and no one, including his lawyers, knows what has happened to him. On the other hand, in a category two case, the absentee informs the court, possibly through counsel, of his absence and the reasons for it. Different consequences follow.
Category One
In respect of category one, where no explanation is offered, because there is nothing to attract the exercise of its discretion in favour of the absentee by granting an adjournment, the court would as a matter of course dismiss the appeal, leaving it for the appellant to apply to restore it.
Category Two
As for category two, where some explanation given, the court would then have to examine the sufficiency of that reason and whether it justifies a result in favour of the appellant. There are basically two competing policy considerations when determining the exercise of the discretion. On the one hand, the court must ensure that appeals are pursued expeditiously, and that no one is allowed to defer indefinitely the execution of justice. Indeed, delaying an appeal may be a prelude to absconding. But, on the other hand, fairness to the appellant has to be taken into account - he may truly not be responsible for his absence, and it would not be right to deprive him of the opportunity to have justice done because of occurrences outside his control.
These two competing policies must be balanced. No rule can be stated which would not lean too far to one side or the other. Unsatisfactory as it may be, all that can be said is that the court will have regard to the circumstances of the case. However, certain broad guidelines may be enumerated for the guidance of counsel and their clients. Generally, it must be shown that the absence was not through the fault of the appellant. That the legislature intended fault to be a relevant consideration can be seen in the inclusion of that concept in the proviso to sub-s (3), in which it is stated that an appellant seeking to reinstate a dismissed appeal must show that his absence was not his fault. The same considerations would apply to the question of dismissal. There are many clear examples of acts that will be considered as being the fault of the appellant. Forgetting the date of the appeal, going to the wrong forum and such like are clearly lame excuses, and will not move the court. Other than these, a court will have to consider on a case by case basis whether absence is the appellant`s fault. But it must be mentioned that tardiness will not generally attract dismissal, provided the appellant does turn up before the end of the hearing list. If he fails to turn up before the last case is called and dealt with, his tardiness becomes absence, and lacking an explanation will result in the dismissal of the appeal.
Additionally, the notion of fault implies that the excuse must be bona fide, and it is for the appellant, or rather through his representative in court, to show that it is so. The failure to substantiate excuses through proper documents will give rise to the inference that the appellant is not acting bona fide. Similarly, if the documents purporting to support his excuse are clearly inappropriate or inadequate.
Another indication of lack of bona fides is a frequent request for adjournment. What degree of frequency amounts to lack of bona fides will vary with the circumstances of the case - in some situations, grace may be given. It all depends on the strength of the appellant`s excuse.
 Reinstatement 
As provided for in the proviso, the court may reinstate the appeal if the appellant appears before the court and satisfies the court that the absence was not due to his own fault. As a matter of practice, an application for reinstatement ought to be made by motion to the court which first dismissed the appeal.
The same principles will apply, when the appellant seeks to reinstate the appeal, as when the court determines whether to dismiss it for want of his presence. It is then for him to convince the court that it really was not his fault that he was absent. And though it is not expressly stated in the proviso, the same considerations of bona fides will apply. In a category two situation, since the court has already examined the appellant`s excuse, the appellant must show that there was something more than the explanation originally proffered to the court.
The appellant must then appear in person, and provide cogent reasons for his absence, supported whenever possible by sufficient documentation, so plausible as to satisfy the court. Again, what is plausible must depend on the circumstances. But it must be noted that the application for reinstatement should not be transformed into a full trial.
As a matter of convenience, at the application for reinstatement, the parties involved must generally be prepared to argue the appeal proper in the event that the application is in fact granted. If, pending the application, the appellant has been arrested for breach of bail, he must be remanded until such time as his application is heard; if his application is granted, and for some reason the appeal is not heard immediately after, he may request bail from the court hearing the appeal.
 The facts of the present appeal 
In the present appeal, the hearing was originally set for 13 February 1996. However, on the day itself, the appellant was supposedly ill. His wife came to court, and through the appellant`s counsel submitted a medical certificate to the court, on which was written the following: 
 
Admitted for observation/treatment of hypomanic mental disorder with confusion and aggressivity. Unfit for court attendance today.
 
 
 
At the bottom of the certificate was printed the following: 
 
This certificate is not valid for absence from court attendance.
 
 
 
However, this appeared to have been superseded by the writing. The certificate further stated that the appellant was admitted on 13 February 1996. The medical certificate was only obtained on the day of the trial itself. That certificate was unsatisfactory as it was not disclosed why the appellant had chosen that very day to see the psychiatrist for observation and treatment of what must be a continuing condition, for which help could have been obtained earlier. This court accepted that certificate at face value, however, and adjourned the matter.
The hearing was then set for 12 March 1996. Again, on that day, the appellant was absent from court. Again, his wife came with a medical certificate, this time from the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital. All the medical certificate stated was that the appellant had been given outpatient sick leave. No diagnosis was recorded. The person signing and his office were not identified. Furthermore, it was dated the day of the hearing. This certificate was manifestly inadequate. The court could not assess how serious his illness was, or even what type of illness he was supposed to have. And all that was granted was outpatient sick leave of one day. It was not indicated whether the illness was such as to debilitate the appellant.
The inadequacies of the certificate on this occasion, coupled with those of the earlier certificate, indicated to me that there was, more likely than not, a lack of bona fides. There is no necessity for a court to decide the matter on the basis that such lack of bona fides has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is an exercise of the discretion of the court, and it is sufficient if it is exercised on the balance of probabilities. For these reasons, I dismissed the appeal.
It is to be hoped that counsel and appellants in general will note that an adequate medical certificate ought to contain all necessary details, such as the diagnosis and the identity of the doctor examining, which will enable the court to make its own assessment of the sufficiency of the appellant`s reasons for not coming to court. Generally, the court will be reluctant to accept certificates which are not expressly directed to attendance in court.
Without prejudging the issue, it may be said at this point that the appellant must, if he seeks reinstatement, show that the medical certificates were obtained bona fide. He must give adequate reasons, so as to satisfy the court that his absence was not due to his own fault. The motion to reinstate will not be conducted as a trial, but while the court will not be too astute to deny the appellant the reinstatement of his appeal, neither will it be easily satisfied without strong and convincing reasons.
 Revision 
The appellant`s counsel attempted to get around his absence by arguing that there ought to be a revision of the decision below. He founded his contentions on a supposed irregularity in the charges. The appellant was convicted on four charges of attempted cheating, relating to various sums of money, but which were really founded on a single act of representation to the victim.
The first charge against him read: 
 
You, Leong Yew Thong @ Johnny, m/35 years, NRIC No 1171441B, are charged that you, on a day in May 1991 at a restaurant in Kitchener Road, Singapore, did attempt to commit cheating, and in the said attempt, did certain acts towards the commission of the offence, to wit, you dishonestly induced on Chong Yuen May into believing that you could cause the criminal charge against her in MAC 3624/91 to abate or be withdrawn or otherwise not be proceeded upon, when in fact you were incapable of so doing, and by such deceit you dishonestly induced the said Chong Yuen May to deliver to her son, one Chen Hock Seng @ Steven Chen, a sum of $10,000 to be handed over to you, which she would not have done had she not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420, read with s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The second, third and fourth charges concerned similar offences involving the inducement of the daughter of Chong Yuen May, one Linda Chen, to deliver two sums of $3,000 each and one sum of $4,000 to one Siew K, upon the same representation as the first charge, made at the same time and place.
I accepted that only one charge of attempt should have been preferred against the appellant. However, that charge would have involved the whole sum of $20,000 which had been split up into the four charges.
The question then was whether revision ought to be granted.
Revision is governed by s 268 CPC: 
 
(1) The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
 
 
 
 
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by an advocate in his own defence. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
  
 
 
The competence of the High Court to do so is provided for in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) s 23: 
 
The High Court may exercise powers of revision in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure.
 
 
 
In 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  , this court dealt with the principles governing revision. After discussing various authorities, this court said (at p 330): 
 
... various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 
 
 
That case involved the forfeiture of a vehicle under the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95). The petitioner sought revision on the grounds of the hardship caused to him as well as of a change in law since the trial below, which, if it had been applied at the time of his trial, may have given rise to a different result. This court found that neither was sufficient to constitute serious injustice.
In 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
  , this court granted revision. The case involved a mistaken plea of guilt entered to the wrong charge. That was clearly a serious injustice, and merited the exercise of the revisionary powers of the High Court.
However, the present case was rather different. While the complaint made was that the charges were faulty, there was no serious injustice. It was a different sort of error from that which arose in 
 Koon Seng 
. A mistaken plea of guilt to the wrong charge is no plea of guilt at all, and a person who so pleads cannot be held to it. Any decision made on such a plea has no standing in law. In contrast, what the trial court had done here was to split up into separate charges what was essentially one charge. The appellant was neither misled nor prejudiced in any way. The defence could not have been conducted any differently. There could be no revision.
It must be noted that in fact the appellant had available to him the option of an appeal, which matter has been dealt with above. This court cannot hold that the availability of an appeal, whether dismissed subsequently or otherwise, necessarily means that no revision is available. Revision will be ordered whenever there is serious injustice.
 Conclusion 
I, therefore, concluded that the appeal should be dismissed, and that the matter was not one to justify revision of the judgment below.

2863477,Kelly v R [2016] NSWCCA 246,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: The applicant appeals against the sentence imposed on him by the then Chief Judge of the District Court, Justice Blanch, on 13 June 2014. The sentence was imposed following a plea of guilty to six charges, which are set out below.
	
	
	The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 years’ imprisonment. During the sentencing proceedings, despite suggestions from the sentencing judge that legal representation was appropriate and that Legal Aid could be supplied, the applicant dealt with the matter himself and was, during the whole of the sentencing proceedings, self-represented.
	
	
	His Honour set out indicative sentences which are contained in the following summary of charges:
	



	
	SEQUENCES 2 and 3: Wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900), for which the maximum penalty is 25 years’ imprisonment and for which there is a standard non-parole period of 7 years’ imprisonment, the sentencing judge set an indicative sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	SEQUENCES 4, 5 and 7: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s 59(1) of the Crimes Act), for which the maximum penalty is 5 years’ imprisonment and for which there is no standard non-parole period, the sentencing judge set an indicative sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	SEQUENCE 6: Destroy or damage property (s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act), for which the maximum penalty is 5 years’ imprisonment, for which the sentencing judge set an indicative sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment.
	



	
	As earlier indicated, the aggregate sentence imposed was 12 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 years’ imprisonment, to commence from the date of arrest and was fixed so as to take into account time already served and under which the applicant would be eligible for release to parole on 2 October 2022.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed (and, if leave were granted, appeals against the sentence) on the following grounds:
	



	
	A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the Court’s failure to order a pre-sentence report, anticipated by the applicant, and referred to by the sentencing judge;
	
	
	A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the failure of the sentencing judge to take up the applicant’s offer [to] pursue such procedures as were appropriate in the circumstances;
	
	
	A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the applicant’s incompetent presentation of his subjective case;
	
	
	A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the combined effect of Grounds 1 – 3 above; and
	
	
	New evidence is available to the Court demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
	



	
	At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant withdrew Grounds 1, 2 and 4 above and pressed only Grounds 3 and 5. Ground 5 is not a ground of appeal but a basis for supporting Ground 3. Counsel made clear that he was not being critical of the learned sentencing judge and accepted that, given the exchanges between the sentencing judge and the applicant, in the circumstances, little else could have been done by the judge to encourage the applicant to obtain legal assistance.
	


The Facts


	
	As the proceedings were conducted as sentencing proceedings following a plea of guilty, the facts were agreed and within very short compass. The applicant had committed previous offences and on 23 May 2013 he was released from gaol for those previous offences.
	
	
	On 3 October 2013, the applicant was staying at a private hotel in Pitt Street, Sydney. The applicant smashed a window in the room in which he was staying and took downstairs a number of pieces of broken glass, wrapped in a sock. He then approached a number of persons sitting on the steps of a nearby hostel.
	
	
	He stabbed Victim 1 (Leibrecht) on the victim’s left forearm, causing immediate pain and bleeding. He then attempted to stab Victim 1 in the thigh, but the piece of glass did not pierce the victim’s jeans. However, the victim did suffer a scratch to the right upper thigh. The laceration to his left forearm required four stitches (Sequence 7).
	
	
	The applicant then approached Victim 2 (Kofink) from behind and, using his left arm, grabbed hold of the second victim’s neck and, using his right hand, stabbed the second victim with the broken glass. The stab wound was to the neck and head area and there were approximately five stab wounds. The victim suffered wounds to the right side of his neck, the right side of his jaw and a puncture to the back of his neck. The wound to his neck was extremely close to his carotid artery and he suffered severe blood loss and scarring (Sequence 2).
	
	
	Victim 3 (Butler-Rees) was approached by the applicant, who stabbed her in the face. The piece of glass cut through the victim’s upper lip, cutting it in half. The pain and blood loss was immediate. The victim put her hands up to protect herself and the applicant then tried to stab her again, cutting her wrist. Apart from the immediate wound to the lip, which split it in half, the victim will suffer permanent facial scarring (Sequence 3).
	
	
	Victim 4 (Penpanussack) was in Pitt Street at the time, and saw the stabbing. The fourth victim approached the applicant and attempted to intervene to defend the earlier mentioned victims. The fourth victim pushed and punched the applicant and, as a reaction, the applicant assaulted him. At the time of the assault, the applicant was still holding the pieces of glass and he cut the fourth victim’s left forearm. There was a 25 centimetre cut to his left torso and a cut to his left forearm, which was not charged as a wounding. The applicant then ran down Pitt Street, holding the broken glass and chasing four or five other persons down the street.
	
	
	As the applicant was running down the street, he hit a security guard (Akkan) with the glass cutting the guard’s chin and throat. There were also scratches to his wrist and he suffered pain in his arm and leg. The security guard was working at premises in Pitt Street. On being felled by the blow with the broken glass, the security guard tackled the applicant and held his legs (Sequence 4).
	


Proceedings Below


	
	Given the remaining ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out, briefly, that which occurred at the sentence hearing. The matter came before the sentencing judge first on Friday 14 March 2014, at which time his Honour listed the matter for sentence before Haesler SC DCJ. At the hearing on 14 March 2014, after being informed by the DPP that the applicant was self-represented, the learned sentencing judge asked the applicant if he had a lawyer, to which the applicant replied, “No, your Honour, I am representing myself, thank you.” (Transcript, 14 March 2014, page 1)
	
	
	On several occasions during this hearing the Chief Judge suggested to the applicant that legal representation was appropriate and that Legal Aid could be supplied. This was done in the context that the learned sentencing judge had indicated that the earliest date upon which the matter could be heard was likely to be 9 May 2014.
	
	
	Throughout these proceedings his Honour continued to encourage the applicant to apply for Legal Aid. His Honour, having been so far unsuccessful in that regard, then set the matter down for sentence before Haesler SC DCJ for 24 April 2014 and, once more, having set that date, urged the applicant to obtain legal advice and be represented. To that urging, the applicant responded:
	


“Yes, I understand, your Honour. I’ve just - to be honest with you in past times I’ve had to cancel my representation when I’ve had Legal Aid in the past, I’ve just felt that it was better to represent myself in the end. I’ve had Legal Aid representatives to tell you the truth that have almost tried to string me up for the full term of the crimes I did in the past. I cancelled them luckily at the last second before I appeared and in that case I – … received … a smaller – a sentencing as in it was just a probationary period and a fine.” (Transcript. 14 March 2014, page 2).


	
	The sentencing judge also suggested obtaining a pre-sentence report or a psychiatrist’s report as it may be of assistance. His Honour pointed out to the applicant that the charge of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm carried a very lengthy maximum penalty and suggested a psychologist’s report.
	
	
	The applicant responded, firstly, that he thought there may have been a pre‑sentence report already and secondly to the effect, that:
	


“the only thing they could diagnose me with and that I’ve been diagnosed in the past with is just anxiety depression … I’ve been a binge drug user over a period of my life, I used to drink a lot of alcohol when I was younger.” (Transcript, 14 March 2014, pages 2-3)


	
	Notwithstanding the response by the applicant, the learned sentencing judge again expressed the view that the psychologist’s report could help, stating to the applicant:
	


“we don’t want to just bring you in and fling you into gaol without considering what should happen with you. And if a psychologist’s report might help you’d need somebody to pay for it and Legal Aid would do it.” (Transcript, 14 March 2014, page 3)


	
	Despite the constant pressing of the view that the applicant would be assisted by a Legal Aid representative and Legal Aid qualifying an expert report, the applicant insisted that he would “just rather the matter be dealt with please”. (Transcript, 14 March 2014, page 3)
	
	
	On 24 April 2014, the matter was not reached and was stood over by Haesler SC DCJ before the Chief Judge, Justice Blanch DCJ for 13 June 2014.
	
	
	Again, during the proceeding on 13 June 2014, the learned sentencing judge repeated his urging as to the need for the applicant to obtain Legal Aid and qualify one or other experts. His Honour expressed a number of concerns as to the failure of the applicant to explain the events or to give a reason for the events and how that would have been assisted by representation and the qualification of an expert.
	


Judgment on Sentencing


	
	The sentencing judge recited the facts as they pertained to the sentencing task and as otherwise summarised above. His Honour then referred to the limited subjective circumstances recited by the applicant, largely as a result of questioning from his Honour. The sentencing judgment then (at page 4) concludes:
	


“The matter is of some concern because Mr Kelly is not represented and he said that he does not want to be represented and wants me to proceed with the sentencing today. The troubling aspect of that is that there appears to be no explanation for the commission of these offences. He does not know why he did it, there is no psychiatric and psychological material which might explain it. Mr Kelly tells me that he has used drugs of various kinds since he was 13 years’ of age and has been on and off the methadone program for his heroin/morphine addiction since 2013. He does not attribute the commission of the offences to his use of drugs, and although I have suggested that he might be assisted by a psychological or psychiatric report, he does not want to do that and he wishes me to proceed with the sentencing.”


	
	The written submissions of the applicant on appeal stress the exchange between the applicant and the sentencing judge and the comment by the applicant that “if you [the sentencing judge] persist that I go and get things done on my behalf, I’ll have to do that but otherwise I would like to persist in getting it dealt with today if I can”.
	
	
	The submission suggests that his Honour was in error in proceeding thereafter without either legal assistance for the applicant or the qualification of a psychiatric/psychological expert. A judge’s capacity to “persist” or “insist” is limited in the face of the insistence of a person to deal with the matter then and there.
	
	
	A sentencing judge cannot force a person to obtain legal assistance or to qualify a psychiatrist or psychologist. Thus, when the applicant expressed the view to the sentencing judge that if he, the sentencing judge, persisted “I’ll have to do that” immediately after expressing the opinion “I’d really like to get the matter dealt with”, the sentencing judge had little option but to deal with the matter as requested by the applicant. A sentencing judge is not in the position to be able to insist on legal representation and/or the qualification of an expert in the face of constant requests by the applicant to proceed.
	
	
	It is not said that the sentencing judge erred, manifestly or otherwise, in the sentence imposed, given the material that was before him. Nevertheless, it is argued that this Court should intervene because there has been a miscarriage of justice occasioned by the applicant’s conduct of the sentence proceedings, by the applicant himself, and in particular the presentation of his subjective case.
	


Evidence on Appeal


	
	In support of the applicant’s only effective ground of appeal pressed, the applicant relies upon the Affidavit of the applicant himself, sworn 13 July 2016, and the Affidavit of his solicitor annexing a psychiatric report of Dr Olav Nielssen of 4 September 2015 and a psychologist’s report by Dr Mark Milic of 5 February 2016.
	
	
	The Crown objects to the receipt of evidence for a purpose other than re‑sentencing, should that be necessary. The Crown submits that, given the urging by the sentencing judge to obtain legal representation and psychiatric expert evidence, there has been no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	It was also suggested during oral submissions, that to allow an appeal on this basis would be to “open the floodgates” for such submissions and for the receipt of evidence that could have been, but was not, adduced at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the applicant has not, even on the new evidence, made out a substantive case involving a miscarriage of justice and the factors to which the psychiatrist’s and psychologist’s reports refer are matters that his Honour took into account in dealing with the sentence to be imposed. To the extent that other factors are utilised, such as drug use and/or intoxication, they are not matters that are permitted to be used to mitigate the seriousness of the offence or the severity of the sentence to be imposed: s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Thus, the Crown submits that the new material ought not be taken into account in re-sentencing; ought not be admitted, because it could not have been taken into account, relevantly, in the sentencing exercise by the learned judge below; and ought not now be admitted. The Crown submits that the material is not fresh evidence and it would be inconsistent with principle to allow its admission.
	


Principles on admission of evidence


	
	The circumstances relating to the admission of the evidence upon which the applicant seeks to rely are unusual. The applicant, on appeal, seeks to adduce evidence as to his psychiatric condition, in circumstances where that condition existed at the time of the sentencing hearing and evidence of the condition could have been available and adduced at the sentencing hearing, but was not.
	
	
	Ordinarily, parties are bound by the manner in which their cases were presented at first instance. There are, however, exceptions. In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509, Simpson J (with whom Davies J and Grove AJ agreed), at [104] – [105] said:
	


“[104] The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals.

[105] The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide:

(1) that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance;

(2) that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied.

But there are limits as to the extent to which the court may legitimately accept additional evidence. There is no call here to consider the application of the principles in appeals against conviction: these have most recently been considered in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [282] and following. These remarks are confined to the circumstances in which this Court may properly, and will, admit and take account of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence, in respect of which a distinct sub-set of principles has evolved.”


	
	Later in the judgment in Khoury, her Honour Simpson J (as her Honour then was) said at [113]:
	


“Too rigid an application of the principle clearly has potential to be the cause of injustice, and has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence. Where it is held that the facts or circumstances of which evidence is sought to be adduced existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time, then, where the interests of justice have so dictated, the Court has admitted the additional evidence (sometimes properly categorised as fresh evidence) in order to correct the misunderstanding. It appears that the justification for this is that, although on the state of the evidence before the sentencing judge, no error could be identified in the process or the sentence, the sentencing proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances. This proposition is sometimes traced back to the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588. In all cases the power to admit the additional evidence is a discretionary one; ‘proper grounds’ must be established as a foundation for the exercise of the discretion to admit the evidence: R v Lanham [1970] 2 NSWR 217.”


	
	The present situation is complicated by the direct questions of the sentencing judge relating to the availability and desirability of material of the kind upon which the applicant now seeks to rely. Nevertheless, the discussion initiated by the learned sentencing judge points to two propositions: first, that the sentencing judge considered such material relevant and important; and secondly, that the learned sentencing judge was not provided that material and was bound to sentence the applicant on the basis of the material before him.
	
	
	Ultimately, the determination, of whether to allow this material to be adduced, rests on the principle that justice must be the determining criterion in the exercise of that discretion. Nevertheless, justice may have different effects, or pull in different directions, if one considers the long term effects on a just system or the immediate effects on a particular applicant. The foregoing refers, at least in part, to the “floodgates” argument.
	
	
	There are a number of answers to the suggestion that to allow the evidence in circumstances, other than re-sentencing, would be to encourage others to take a similar course. First, the discretion to admit material on appeal is one exercised by the Court and can be controlled by the Court. Secondly, the reference to the flexibility that the discretion be exercised in the interest of justice, with particular reference to medical evidence (see Khoury at [115]), has not led to a plethora of applications based upon such flexibility. Thirdly, the ground of appeal associated with a miscarriage of justice caused by the incompetence of counsel is not often agitated or successful as deliberate forensic tactical decisions cannot be utilised for such a purpose. Moreover, there are few appeals against sentence utilising such a ground.
	
	
	In this case, the ground of appeal is that there was a miscarriage of justice associated with the incompetence of the “representative” of the applicant, being the applicant himself. Moreover, where the evidence is, as it is in this case, to the effect that the applicant suffers a traumatic brain injury following an intra-cerebral bleed and surgery to drain a subdural haemorrhage, then the very decision to continue with the sentencing proceedings, regardless of the urging of the sentencing judge, becomes a factor in the determination of whether, in the Court’s discretion, the additional evidence ought to be allowed on the appeal and not just on the process of re-sentencing.
	
	
	The “floodgates” fear is not apparent. One would need an applicant, suffering from cognitive difficulties, who was prepared to conduct proceedings otherwise than in their best interests in order to establish a possible ground of appeal against sentence, which, if successful, would result in this Court sentencing in accordance with law or remitting the matter to the District Court in order for it to carry out the sentencing process. Ultimately, it would seem that any reasonable approach would result in the person to be sentenced putting their best case at the time of the original proceeding. To do otherwise would be irrational, which is exactly what occurred in this case.
	
	
	I would propose to admit the evidence on the leave to appeal and the appeal itself, and, if the appeal were granted, also use the evidence in the re‑sentencing exercise.
	


Consideration


	
	For reasons already outlined, the sentencing judge was denied, by the irrationality and incompetence of the applicant, material that was relevant to the sentencing process. As a result, the process, notwithstanding the urging of the sentencing judge, miscarried.
	
	
	The foregoing does not necessarily result in a successful appeal. There can be little doubt that the sentencing judge, because of his vast experience, took into account a number of matters that might otherwise have been the subject of expert evidence. He did this, seemingly, on the basis of his experience.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as the sentencing judge pointed out, he was required to sentence on the basis of the evidence and material before him, which did not include the psychiatric and psychological reports now before the Court. In those circumstances, the incompetence of the representation at the sentencing proceedings has caused a miscarriage of justice. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed.
	
	
	The Court is thus required to re-sentence. As the Crown correctly notes, the provisions of s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 precluded the use self-induced intoxication of an offender at the time of an offence as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Even before the introduction of that relatively new sub-section, the intoxication by alcohol or drugs ordinarily did not mitigate the penalty to be imposed on a particular offender: Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at [26].
	
	
	Nevertheless, as McClellan CJ at CL in Bourke said, that ordinary rule does not apply where the intoxication is the result of an addiction and the original addiction did not involve a free choice. His Honour’s comments were that offenders could not expect reductions in sentence merely on account of the offence being committed while the offender was intoxicated.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the effect of s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is also “to abolish” that part of R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 that the High Court approved in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571. I do not agree with that last mentioned submission.
	
	
	The effect of Fernando and of Bugmy is to recognise that, in certain communities to which the circumstances in Fernando and Bugmy applied, the abuse of alcohol and drugs is so prevalent and accompanied by violence that the intoxication no longer fits the description of being “self-induced”. In that way, the intoxication fits the description to which McClellan CJ at CL referred in Bourke.
	
	
	I accept and adopt the comments and classification of the objective circumstances of the offence in question that was described by the learned sentencing judge. After reciting the facts, summarised above, and the subjective circumstances such as they were known, his Honour said (at page 5):
	


“He [the applicant] has entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and is entitled to the maximum discount in relation to that. However, the offences are serious, although it has to be borne in mind, in terms of working out what is the appropriate sentence to impose in the case, that they all occurred as part of the one episode. Nonetheless, the wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm offences carry 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years, and there are four other offences in addition, all of which form part of the same episode as the first two.”


	
	The offences certainly were serious and the objective seriousness of the offences, particularly in circumstances where the motivation was unexplained, were above the mid-range of objective seriousness. Further, the sentences should reflect the significant injuries inflicted on each victim, which injuries differ as between victims and are described above.
	
	
	Likewise, I accept, in relation to the material that was before the learned sentencing judge, those comments his Honour made in relation to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. One of those circumstances is that the offender was not young. He was 36 years of age at the time of the offences and 37 years of age at the time he was sentenced. He had only recently been released from prison. Nevertheless, his criminal history in New South Wales only commenced in 2003, but includes offences of having custody of a knife, the possession of safe-breaking implements, goods in custody, resisting police, larceny, steal from person, damaging property, assault and the possession and self-administration of drugs. In 2011, the applicant was sentenced for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Most importantly, the learned sentencing judge took into account his finding that the applicant had used drugs of various kinds since he was 13 years of age and has been on and off a methadone programme for his heroin/morphine addiction since 2003. At the age of 13 years, the applicant was not at an age of “rational choice” that would give rise to the full responsibility for the moral culpability and the predictable consequences of a choice to become addicted: see Bourke, supra at [28], citing R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [185]. The psychiatric evidence that is now before the Court confirms the sentencing judge’s findings.
	
	
	The report from Dr Nielssen reports the history given and an early childhood use of drugs and/or alcohol. He left home at 21, when his father committed suicide. At the age of 21, he took up using heroin. There is a history given of admission to psychiatric wards, mostly as a result of what was said to be drugs psychosis. Most interestingly, the applicant reported that he found amphetamines “were the worst for bringing on paranoia … but I’ve had it when I haven’t had amphetamines”. He reported paranoia or feeling a bit paranoid at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The psychiatric history is also interesting. The applicant was not aware of any firm history of diagnosed schizophrenia or bipolar disorder among members of his biological family. His father shot himself several months after an admission to a psychiatric ward.
	
	
	The applicant gave a history of use of amphetamines from around 14 or 15 years of age, but started using heroin only after 21 years of age. He was on a methadone programme and a programme involving anti-craving medication (buprenorphine).
	
	
	Dr Nielssen described his emotional responses as being restricted in range:
	


“in a way that was thought to be consistent with schizophrenia. He had several episodes of latency in his responses and subtle disorganisation of speech in a pattern that was thought to be consistent with the presence of an underlying schizophrenic illness. He described what seemed to be the persecutory belief that society was somehow against him, although it was not clear that he held any enduring delusional beliefs.”


	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as suffering from substance use disorder; probable underlying psychotic illness; and traumatic brain injury. Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion:
	


“The diagnosis of a probable psychotic illness is based on the history symptoms consistent with psychotic episodes, including persecutory beliefs, the history of long admissions to psychiatric hospitals an aspect of [the applicant’s] presentation at the time of the recent interview, when he was thought to have subtle disorganisation of speech and to be guarded in his responses to questions to elicit symptoms in a way that was thought to be typical of underlying mental illness. There is a family history of mental illness, as Mr Kelly reported that his father committed suicide soon after his [the father’s] discharge from a psychiatric hospital.

….

On the face of it the offences were due to the effects of intoxication in an irritable and chronically depressed person with a history of assault. [The applicant] did not describe specific symptoms of mental illness directly prompting the attack, but described a vague form of paranoia, the perception that noise was intruding from the street and the perception that society was against him. The effect of an underlying psychotic illness, an impairment in emotional regulation and impulse control arising from the brain injury may have been factors contributing to Mr Kelly’s behaviour, in addition to intoxication with a medication that is similar in its effects to alcohol.”


	
	The psychologist’s report was to similar effect, but the psychologist undertook testing and also gave a more detailed history of the applicant’s drug abuse. After his release from prison in May 2013, the applicant was bingeing on marijuana, Xanax and morphine every fortnight and had binged on Xanax tablets on the day of the offences.
	
	
	The psychologist referred to a textbook on benzodiazepines by C Paton and noted that:
	


“the majority of users of benzodiazepine drugs such as Xanax experience calming effects. A minority of users, however, experience ‘paradoxical reactions (also called dis-inhibitory reactions), characterised by acute excitement and an altered mental state, increased anxiety, vivid dreams, hyper-activity, sexual dis-inhibition, hostility and rage’ (page 460). Albrecht and colleagues (2014) came to a similar conclusion. They found that benzodiazepine use was ‘moderately associated with subsequent aggressive behaviour’ (page 1110).”


	
	The psychologist expressed the opinion that the applicant’s psychological health deteriorated as a result of substance abuse, beginning in high school and deteriorating markedly in his 20’s. The psychologist took the view that the deterioration in drug abuse also occasioned a deterioration in the applicant’s psychological health, which was in part due to the suicide death of his father, the loss of his apprenticeship and addictions to heroin and benzodiazepine pills.
	
	
	The psychologist said:
	


“After the age of 20, he [the applicant] experienced further deterioration in his psychological health due to the suicide death of his father, loss of his diesel mechanic apprenticeship, and addictions to heroin and benzodiazepine pills. Lost relationships, unstable accommodation and lack of steady employment had a destabilising effect on Mr Kelly and made it more difficult for him to overcome his substance abuse problems. It appears that at the time of the offence, he [the applicant] was heavily affected by benzodiazepines, which had a disinhibiting affect, releasing violent impulses.”


	
	It seems, from the foregoing, that the applicant suffered from dis-inhibitory reactions, which were paradoxical and not reactions ordinarily associated with the use of benzodiazepine. As a consequence, it could not be said that the violent impulses and aggressive behaviour, caused by the benzodiazepine, and the disinhibiting effect of it, was a “predictable consequence of his choice as to the use of drugs” (being a reference to the passage in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Bourke, above).
	
	
	The foregoing has an effect on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, the seriousness of the offences requires that a sentence be imposed that is appropriate to serious offences of this kind. Even though the effect of the benzodiazepine on the applicant was out of the ordinary, the use of the drugs was still self-induced.
	
	
	Further, the effects of the benzodiazepine on the applicant were not effects that could be described as “intoxication” or the ordinary effects of “intoxication”. Rather, it was not the disinhibiting effects that was the major difficulty associated with the benzodiazepine, but the violent, aggressive tendencies caused by them.
	
	
	I accept that it was appropriate for his Honour to provide a discount at the highest order for the plea of guilty. It seems to me that the issues of the applicant’s mental health render the applicant less appropriate as an example to the community at large and renders less significant the issue of general deterrence. Nevertheless, general deterrence still plays a significant role in the fixing of this sentence.
	
	
	Mental illness does not always have an ameliorating effect on the sentence to be imposed. Sometimes, the effect of a mental illness or disorder is to render the offender more likely to offend again and render more significant the factor of specific deterrence. Nevertheless, that does not seem to be the situation in relation to applicant in this appeal.
	
	
	As the foregoing recitation of the psychiatric evidence discloses, the issues associated with mental illness did play a role in the commission of this offence. Even if it were not to have played a role, the mental health issue is an important subjective factor to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	Lastly, the need for extended supervision in the community associated with the mental health issues and issues associated with drug abuse satisfies me that special circumstances exist and a ratio for the non-parole period should be fixed, that is less than the statutory prescription.
	
	
	For all of the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court should issue the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal allowed;
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon Timothy Kelly on 13 June 2014 by Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the District Court, be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence be imposed:
	



	
	For Sequence 6, destroy or damage property, contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, a fixed sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, commencing 3 October 2013 and concluding 2 April 2015;
	
	
	For Sequence 4, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act, a fixed term of imprisonment of two (2) years and nine (9) months, commencing 3 April 2014 and concluding 2 January 2017;
	
	
	For Sequence 5, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a fixed term of imprisonment of two (2) years and nine (9) months, commencing 3 October 2014 and concluding 2 July 2017;
	
	
	For Sequence 7, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a fixed term of imprisonment of two (2) years and nine (9) months, commencing 3 April 2015 and concluding 2 January 2018;
	
	
	For Sequence 2, wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, a non-parole period of four (4) years’ imprisonment, commencing 3 October 2015 and concluding 2 October 2019, with a balance of term of two (2) years and nine (9) months concluding 2 July 2022;
	
	
	For Sequence 3, wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, a non-parole period of four (4) years’ imprisonment, commencing 3 October 2016 and concluding 2 October 2020 with a balance of term of a further four (4) years and three (3) months, concluding 2 January 2025.
	



	
	The overall sentence to be imposed is a head sentence of 11 years’ and three (3) months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7 years’ imprisonment. The applicant will be eligible for parole from 3 October 2020.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J for the reasons his Honour has provided.

	LEEMING JA: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: In seeking leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Hanley SC in the District Court, the applicant complains that he is justifiably aggrieved by the difference in that sentence and sentences imposed upon two co-offenders, Huy Bao Van Huynh and David Harb.
	
	
	The applicant appeared for sentence on 30 January 2015 in relation to an offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled precursor, being pseudoephedrine, contrary to ss 11.5(1) and 307.11(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995. The sentencing judge convicted the applicant and sentenced him to imprisonment for 9 years, to date from 12 February 2013 and expiring on 11 February 2022. A non-parole period (NPP) of 6 years was fixed, which expires on 11 February 2019. (Although expressed by his Honour, in error, as 11 August 2019, it was pointed out during the hearing, and acknowledged by the applicant’s counsel, that the expiry date of the non-parole period was correctly recorded on JusticeLink, and on the warrant of commitment.)
	
	
	The maximum penalty specified for such an offence is 25 years imprisonment, and / or a fine of 5,000 penalty units.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	The conspiracy for which the applicant was sentenced was one hatched between a number of individuals for the importation of large quantities of pseudoephedrine through Sydney International Airport in 2012, under the auspices of corrupt Customs officers and a corrupt baggage handler. Pseudoephedrine is a drug listed as a border controlled precursor.
	
	
	The following account of the facts of the applicant’s crime is drawn from the findings of the sentencing judge, there being no dispute about his Honour’s conclusions in that regard.
	
	
	Although the applicant was convicted of a single offence charged as having taken place between about 1 January 2012 and about 30 June 2012, discussions between the conspirators concerning an illegal importation began in 2010 and 2011, and it is necessary to refer to some of the earlier events to place the offence as charged in its proper context.
	
	
	The conspirators included the applicant, Huynh and Harb, together with Christopher Cranney, Paul Valsamakis, Joseph Harb, and Adrian Lamella. Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella were all Customs officers working at the airport in Border Security roles, with access to confidential intelligence relating to the movement of passengers and goods. David Harb was a baggage handler at the airport.
	
	
	In 2010 Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella had a number of conversations about bringing “gear” into Australia, exploiting their respective roles with the Air Border Security team (“ABS team”) at the airport to that end. David Harb was a friend of Lamella, and he was introduced into the conspiracy through that connection.
	
	
	In 2010 Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella had a number of conversations about getting ""gear"" into Australia. Each acknowledged having done so in the past, and Lamella told Valsamakis that he had a mate in the baggage handling area (Harb) who could assist with any importation by removing drugs from luggage whilst the luggage was being unloaded from aircraft.
	
	
	There was a meeting in late December 2010 between Lamella, Cranney and some others (not including the applicant) and the possibility of importing illicit drugs was further discussed. Although Harb was not present at the meeting, he was told soon after by Lamella that there was a good chance an illegal importation would take place.
	
	
	During the latter half of 2011, Lamella, Valsamakis, Cranney and Harb began planning in earnest for the importation of pseudoephedrine. Huynh, the applicant, and Joseph Harb were to subsequently become involved in obtaining pseudoephedrine and arranging for individuals to act as couriers. Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella exploited their positions within Customs to reduce the risk of the importation being discovered. Steps were taken to ensure that there would be no surveillance of flights on which drugs might travel, and Harb was organised to retrieve the luggage containing the pseudoephedrine from the flight and take the luggage out of the airport.
	
	
	Between July and December 2011, planning for an importation proceeded. The conspirators obtained mobile telephones with false subscriber details with which to communicate, and Customs rosters were coordinated to facilitate the importation. Although not charged over his role in this earlier attempt to import pseudoephedrine, the applicant was involved to the extent of arranging meetings between Lamella and Huynh, with the latter to travel to China to obtain pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	Ultimately, a planned importation for December 2011 did not proceed, with pseudoephedrine obtained by the conspirators in Thailand left there because of increased security at Thai airports.
	
	
	In the days following the aborted importation, the applicant and the other conspirators had discussions about potential dates and arrangements for a future importation. Rosters were considered to identify dates upon which all conspirators were at the airport, with Lamella coordinating between the conspirators located at the airport, and the applicant and Huynh, as to possible dates for importation, obtaining the drug, flights, and couriers to carry the drugs.
	
	
	Sometime during January or February 2012 Huynh obtained pseudoephedrine in Vietnam which was to be brought into Australia on a Thai Airlines flight travelling from Vietnam to Sydney via Bangkok. The flight was due to arrive on a morning when Lamella, Valsamakis and Cranney would all be at work at the airport; Harb was on duty as a baggage handler. The payment to the airport conspirators was to be as high as $100,000.
	
	
	On 23 February 2012 Huynh and the applicant were in contact with each other in a series of intercepted telephone calls in which they discussed ways of raising money. They and Lamella discussed arrangements to identify couriers to carry the drugs, and obtain plane tickets for them.
	
	
	Two couriers were selected and those individuals left Sydney for Ho Ch Minh City on 3 March 2012. Their respective bags on departure from Sydney weighed 11 and 13 kilograms. The bags used by the couriers were identical and each had a green ribbon tied to the handle to facilitate identification of the bags by Harb on return to Sydney. Harb was to collect the bags and take them out of the airport.
	
	
	A bag identical to those used by the couriers was provided by the applicant to Lamella, along with copies of pages from the passports of the couriers with the couriers’ personal details. These items were in turn shown by Lamella to Harb, to aid him in retrieving the drug-laden baggage from the return flights.
	
	
	Harb, Lamella, and the applicant used the falsely subscribed mobile telephones to communicate about the arrangements for the luggage to be removed from the flights and delivered to the applicant. The other conspirators were to facilitate the process.
	
	
	On 8 March 2012, the evening before the importation, Lamella told Harb that he should deliver the bags with the green ribbons to the applicant at the staff car park at Sydney International airport.
	
	
	That same day, the two couriers checked in for return flights to Sydney, with two bags each weighing 28 kilograms. One courier was carrying about 17kg of pseudoephedrine powder in his bag and the other about 15 kilograms, a total gross weight of around 32 kilograms of pseudoephedrine powder. The couriers were to arrive in Sydney the following morning.
	
	
	On 9 March 2012 Harb was working at the airport as a baggage handler; the Customs conspirators were on duty overseeing security with incoming flights. When the first courier arrived on a Thai Airways flight Lamella sent a text message to Harb telling him that everything was ready to go. After the laden baggage cars from the flight were moved into the air side baggage area, Harb located the couriers' bags, put them inside a tub, and drove to an area in the baggage hall where he knew there were no security cameras operating. Harb then sent a text message to Lamella to let him know that he had the bags.
	
	
	The arrangement was for the applicant to take possession of the pseudoephedrine filled bags from Harb, and Harb and the applicant were in contact during the course of the morning about the transfer of the drugs. Huynh was also in telephone contact with the applicant about the collection of the drugs. Coded messages were exchanged between Lamella and the applicant about the drugs and their collection from Harb by the applicant.
	
	
	Other members of the conspiracy used their Customs roles to monitor any risks that might arise as a consequence of surveillance by the authorities.
	
	
	The applicant drove to the airport, using his former wife’s security access card to gain access to the staff car park at the airport. He arrived at the airport at about 8.05 that morning. He was in constant communication with Lamella about the readiness of the bags for collection from Harb.
	
	
	The applicant met with Harb in the staff car park shortly before 9 o’clock. He took the two bags brought into Sydney by the couriers from Harb, putting them into the car he was driving. He then left the car park. Harb returned to work as a baggage handler.
	
	
	Two days later the applicant and Lamella met to discuss arrangements for paying those involved in the importation. The Customs conspirators were unhappy with delay in receiving their money, and Lamella passed this on to the applicant, inquiring from him as to when the money would be paid.
	
	
	On 23 March 2012 the applicant went to an address in Marrickville where Huynh was living. Soon after the applicant sent Lamella a coded text message which indicated that he had the money to pay the Customs conspirators. Lamella was at the time staying at a city hotel, and the applicant went to the hotel to see him. He gave Lamella a plastic bag with cash in it, telling Lamella that the money was the first half of the payment, with the remainder to be paid in a couple of days.
	
	
	On 25 March 2012 Lamella divided the money he had received from the applicant, with $55,000 each to be paid to Cranney and Valsamakis, and $20,000 for Harb. The money was passed on to them, with advice that more would follow.
	
	
	On 30 March 2012 Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella met at a cafe in Beverly Hills and discussed the outstanding payments each were owed. They also discussed organising another importation.
	
	
	The applicant again met with Lamella, on 2 April 2012, to pass on more money as payment to the conspirators. On this occasion he gave Lamella $90,000, being $10,000 less than the expected $100,000. Lamella subsequently gave Harb half of the money provided by the applicant, keeping the other $45,000 for himself. A day or so later Lamella went to the applicant’s home to tell him about the shortfall in the payment. The applicant went inside his house and obtained $10,000 in cash, which he then gave to Lamella.
	
	
	Further importations took place in June 2012. The Customs conspirators monitored rosters and other information to identify possible dates and flights on which drugs could be brought into the country. Lamella met with Harb to discuss possible dates on which an importation could be managed, and passed on the information as to dates to the applicant and Huynh.
	
	
	Ultimately, agreement was reached between the applicant and his co‑conspirators to import about 120 kilograms of pseudoephedrine split across three Thai Airlines flights arriving on the mornings of 4, 5 and 6 June 2012.
	
	
	Huynh made inquiries about obtaining that amount of pseudoephedrine, and the applicant remained in contact with him about his inquiries, passing on the information he received to Lamella. He discussed with Lamella the amount of money that the importation was expected to produce. Lamella subsequently told Harb, Valsamakis and Cranney that each would receive between $350,000 and $380,000 for the June importations.
	
	
	On 9 May 2012 Huynh travelled to Vietnam to obtain the pseudoephedrine. Five couriers had been recruited to travel to Vietnam and bring the drug back to Sydney in their luggage. The couriers were to leave Sydney on Thai Airways flights to Ho Chi Minh City via Bangkok, departing on 28 May 2012. The couriers were each provided with identical hard sided silver trolley suitcases with green luggage tags, money, and mobile telephones to facilitate the importation. It was arranged for the couriers to check the luggage onto the return flights in Vietnam, but leave the airport without collecting it on arrival in Sydney.
	
	
	The applicant and Lamella were in constant communication in May 2012 to discuss the organisation of the importations. The Customs conspirators made arrangements to ensure that each was rostered at the airport on the relevant dates, with steps taken to transfer Lamella to duty with the ABS Team in readiness.
	
	
	On 28 May 2012 Huynh departed Australia for Vietnam for the purpose obtaining the pseudoephedrine to be brought in by the five couriers over 4, 5 and 6 June 2012. Huynh had trouble in Vietnam with his suppliers and additionally one courier had withdrawn from the scheme. The applicant informed Lamella of these developments in a meeting on or about 31 May 2012. Lamella in turn passed this information on to Valsamakis and Harb.
	
	
	Later on 28 May 2012 the applicant met with Lamella, and the pair sent a text message to Huynh in Vietnam. There was an exchange of messages, with Huynh asking questions about how to pack the trolley bags, and the flights to be taken by the couriers. Huynh also referred to the difficulties in obtaining the drug, noting his confidence that the situation would be resolved. The applicant responded to Huynh’s queries with information he was given by Lamella.
	
	
	The applicant and Lamella arranged to meet again the following day.
	
	
	On 1 June 2012 Huynh informed the applicant and Lamella that the difficulties had been resolved and the importation could go ahead as planned.
	
	
	On 1 and 2 June 2012 the five couriers who had been organised for the importations each purchased tickets to travel to Ho Chi Minh City, at a cost of over $21,000. The couriers left the country on 1 and 2 June 2012, checking in the silver trolley suitcases as luggage.
	
	
	The applicant and Lamella met on 2 June 2012 to discuss the specific details of the importations, such as where the applicant would meet Harb to take possession of the suitcases containing pseudoephedrine. The applicant provided Lamella with information from the passports of the couriers so that he might pass it on to Harb.
	
	
	On or about 3 June 2012 the applicant went with Lamella on a drive to identify the locations where the applicant would meet Harb and collect the suitcases. This information was passed on by Lamella to Harb.
	
	
	On 4 June 2012 the first of the couriers arrived in Sydney with a quantity of pseudoephedrine. Valsamakis, Lamella and Cranney were working with border security that day, and took all steps they could to disrupt detection of the importation. Harb was working as a baggage handler, in readiness to collect the couriers’ luggage.
	
	
	The first two couriers arrived on a 7am flight from Ho Chi Minh City via Bangkok. They had between them in the trolley bags some 34 kilograms of pseudoephedrine packed to look like food.
	
	
	Once luggage had been taken off the plane Harb located the couriers’ bags and loaded them onto an empty baggage car, driving them to an area under the arrivals hall which was not covered by security cameras. He left the bags there and sent Lamella a text message to advise him of that. Between 7.33am and 7.38am, Lamella and the applicant exchanged a series of coded text messages, with Lamella advising the applicant that the importation had been successful.
	
	
	After completing his legitimate duties Harb retrieved the couriers' luggage and left the airport with it, driving to the place where it was agreed he would meet the applicant. He handed the bags containing the drugs over to the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant met with Lamella later on 4 June 2012 to discuss the importation for the following day, 5 June 2012.
	
	
	On 5 June 2012 the conspirators were in place at the airport as on the previous day, with the Customs conspirators diverting security from the flight used by the courier expected that day, and Harb ready to collect the luggage containing the drugs.
	
	
	At about 7 o’clock that morning the courier’s flight arrived in Sydney from Ho Chi Minh City. The luggage, containing about 18 kilograms of pseudoephedrine packed to look like food, had been checked in at the airport in Vietnam and was on board. The baggage was unloaded from the plane, and the silver trolley bag was retrieved by Harb. He hid it in an empty baggage can until he had finished unloading the plane.
	
	
	The applicant and Lamella were in communication by means of coded text messages, with the applicant confirming that he was on his way to the prearranged delivery point to collect the drugs from Harb.
	
	
	As soon as Harb could get away from his legitimate duties he left the airport with the bag containing the drugs, sending Lamella a message to advise him that he was on his way to the meeting place. Lamella in turn sent the applicant a message, passing on that information. Harb and the applicant subsequently met, and the applicant took the drugs from Harb and drove away with them. Harb sent Lamella a text message to inform him that “it was all done"" and Lamella informed Cranney and Valsamakis that the importation had been a success.
	
	
	The importation arranged for the following day, 6 June 2012, did not go as well for the conspirators.
	
	
	The Customs conspirators, Valsamakis, Lamella and Cranny, all commenced work expecting to facilitate the arrival of two couriers with luggage containing pseudoephedrine. Harb was on duty as baggage handler to offload the luggage. The applicant was ready to collect it from Harb.
	
	
	However, sometime that morning Lamella and Valsamakis became aware of a Customs investigation into luggage uncollected by passengers from previous days, and a baggage handler who had been discovered removing bags from a flight. A “containment exercise” was arranged by border security officials for that morning to target the Thai Airways flight on which the couriers were to arrive in Sydney, and which was intended to identify any luggage with a similar appearance to that which had gone uncollected by passengers in previous days.
	
	
	Perceiving the risk, Valsamakis and Lamella volunteered to locate the suspect luggage. Valsamakis and Lamella examined documentation relevant to the security operation and recognised the names of the two couriers who were to arrive that morning. Lamella immediately sent Harb a text message warning him to stay away from the Thai Airways flight. He also sent the applicant a warning about the discovery of the importation.
	
	
	Harb disposed of the mobile phone he had been using to liaise with the other conspirators and, when the flight arrived in Sydney from Ho Chi Minh City that morning, he did not involve himself in removing luggage from it. Lamella and Valsamakis attended the baggage area, ostensibly to search the baggage carts for the suspect bags, which they had been told were two silver hard sided bags.
	
	
	Valsamakis located the two silver suitcases. He had Lamella stand in such a way as to obscure the view of security cameras, so that he might remove and hide the airline luggage barcode stickers from the two bags. He saw, however, that one of the bags was additionally identified with a green luggage tag bearing the name of one of the couriers, and realised that the scheme had come undone.
	
	
	He and Lamella placed the two silver trolley bags onto the conveyor belt for collection by another (uncorrupted) Customs officer, so that the bags might be shown to the couriers, who had been detained in the arrivals area.
	
	
	Lamella and Valsamakis subsequently became aware that Customs investigators had footage of Harb removing the drug bags from the Thai Airways flight on 4 June 2014.
	
	
	On examination, the suitcases brought into Sydney by the couriers were found to contain 28.29 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine. One bag contained 11 packages with a total of 20.151 kilograms of powder. Subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the powder contained pseudoephedrine with a purity range of between 67.2% and 72.6%. The pure weight of pseudoephedrine was calculated to be 13.919 kilograms.
	
	
	The second suitcase contained 13 packages to a total of 20.613 kilograms of powder. Subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the powder contained pseudoephedrine with a range of purity between 68.4% and 72%. The pure weight of pseudoephedrine in the bag was calculated to be 14.371 kilograms.
	
	
	Evidence established that 28.29 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine is capable of producing approximately 19.096 kilograms of high grade methylamphetamine hydrochloride. The wholesale value of that drug would be about $4,774,000, and the street level value about $15,276,800.
	
	
	Despite the loss of the imported drugs, Valsamakis and Cranney had told Lamella that they still expected to be paid, and Lamella advised the applicant of that. The applicant responded that he had the money as he had been paid in full on the day of the first importation on 4 June 2012, but the men agreed that the applicant would ""bury the money"", and they would avoid meeting for a time.
	
	
	On 27 June 2012 Lamella and the applicant exchanged coded text messages in which Lamella emphasised that Cranney and Valsamakis wanted their money as soon as possible. Lamella visited Valsamakis at his home and told him that he would meet the applicant the following day to collect the money. The following night the applicant met Lamella and handed over about $380,000 in cash, to be paid to Lamella, Valsamakis, Cranney and Harb. The money was divided so that Lamella and Valsamakis received $100,000 each, Cranney $85,000 and Harb $95,000. There were subsequently disputes amongst Harb and the corrupt Customs officers about underpayment but no further monies were paid by the applicant to the other conspirators.
	
	
	On 18 August 2012 Harb’s brother, Joseph, was arrested and subsequently gave an induced statement implicating some of the conspirators. Lamella was arrested in December and he also gave an induced statement outlining the details of the conspiracy.
	
	
	On 12 February 2013 Harb was arrested. He declined an interview but gave a statement to police. The applicant was also arrested that day. He refused to be interviewed.
	
	
	Huynh was not arrested until October 2013.
	


The Present Application


	
	The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Hanley SC DCJ. The ground advanced is:
	


“The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders Huy Bao Van Huynh and David Harb.”


	
	That ground proceeds upon an implicit acknowledgement that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate: Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251].
	
	
	The applicant and Harb were each sentenced following upon the entry of pleas of guilty. Huynh was separately dealt with by Whitford SC DCJ on 20 November 2015, after being found guilty by a jury at trial. All were sentenced for one count of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor.
	
	
	The three offenders were sentenced upon a common factual basis, his Honour Judge Whitford having found the facts largely in accord with those found by Judge Hanley.
	
	
	The sentences imposed upon each are as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Applicant
			
			
			Harb
			
			
			Hunyh
			
		
		
			
			9 years imprisonment; NPP 6 years
			
			
			5 years 6 months imprisonment; NPP 3 years and 9 months
			
			
			12 years imprisonment; NPP 8 years
			
		
	



	
	The applicant and Harb each had the benefit of a discount of 25% on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed to reflect the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty; Huynh, having taken his trial, did not.
	
	
	Harb was given an additional reduction in sentence to reflect the assistance that he gave to authorities, bringing the total discount applied to the sentence he would otherwise have received to 50%. Neither the applicant nor Huynh provided assistance, and thus neither was entitled to any reduction in sentence in this regard.
	
	
	Each sentencing judge was acutely aware of the parity principle, and each had regard to both it and the sentences imposed upon co-offenders. Hanley SC DCJ could not, of course, give consideration to the sentence imposed upon Huynh, since Harb and the applicant were dealt with before sentence was imposed upon Huynh, but Whitford SC DCJ was both aware of and took into account the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Harb when determining the sentence to be imposed upon Huynh.
	
	
	The applicant complains that the sentence imposed upon him is disproportionate to that imposed upon his fellow conspirators.
	


The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	The applicant argues that the “starting point” of the sentences imposed upon the three offenders is indicative of disproportion, when regard is had to the differences in the respective cases. The undiscounted starting points referred to are 12 years imprisonment for the applicant and 11 years imprisonment for Harb.
	
	
	In relation to the sentence imposed upon Huynh, the applicant asserts that Huynh’s crime was objectively more serious than his, whilst Huynh’s subjective case was markedly less positive than his own. It is contended that these differences should have resulted in a sentence for the applicant which was less than that imposed.
	
	
	As to the sentence imposed upon Harb, whilst the applicant acknowledged that there were features in Harb’s case that would ameliorate the sentence imposed upon him, being his lower position in the hierarchy of the conspiracy, and the onerous conditions he - as an informer - would be subject to in custody, it was submitted that the applicant should have received a lesser sentence than Harb. The applicant contends that the breach of trust inherent in Harb’s participation in the conspiracy should have resulted in a higher starting point for sentence than that for him.
	


The Crown’s Submissions


	
	The Crown submits that the difference in the respective cases of the three offenders provides a proper basis for the differentiation in sentence, such that the sentences are not unduly disproportionate. Whilst the Crown accepts that the applicant may feel aggrieved by his sentence, it is submitted that any grievance is not justified on an objective consideration of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	The Crown contends that Huynh’s criminality was at substantially the same level of gravity as that of the applicant, whilst his subjective case - particularly his abusive and dysfunctional upbringing and his impaired mental health - was such as to properly mitigate sentence to a degree.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown argues that any disparity that may exist cannot be regarded as gross or marked, and thus cannot call for appellate intervention.
	


Consideration


	
	A complaint based upon parity cannot rely upon a simple lack of mathematical equivalence in sentence, and comparison of the numerical length of sentence should never be the sole basis for such a complaint. Attention must be given to the facts and circumstances upon which sentence was assessed, and due allowance must be made for the differing cases of individual offenders. Outcomes will be identical only where the cases are relevantly identical; where there is some relevant difference, outcomes will be different: Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608; [2001] HCA 64 at [65].
	
	
	As was held by the High Court in Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462; [2011] HCA 49 at [28]:
	


“Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ‘a reflection of the notion of equal justice’ and ‘is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice’. It finds expression in the ‘parity principle’ which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ‘equal justice’, which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances” [footnotes omitted].


	
	In the applicant’s case, there were differences in the length of sentence imposed upon him, Huynh, and Harb, but proper attention to the respective cases of each both explains and justifies the differences. A table prepared by the Crown provides a helpful summary account of the cases for each offender, and a copy of it is annexed to this judgment. Its accuracy was not disputed by the applicant.
	
	
	In assessing the sentences to be imposed upon the applicant and Harb respectively, the sentencing judge made a careful and thorough analysis of the criminality of each, and of their respective cases. That analysis was undertaken with the parity principle firmly in mind.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that Harb had played a lesser role in the conspiracy than had the applicant, who was higher placed in the hierarchy. The applicant does not challenge the correctness of that conclusion and, indeed, it would be difficult to do so, given that Harb had no role in the organisation of what was a highly sophisticated offence, doing no more than unloading the couriers’ bags and conveying them to the applicant, at the direction of others. The applicant, by contrast, was intricately involved with the organisation of the offence, including in the provision of bags for the couriers, the movement of the pseudoephedrine once it had left the airport, and the payment of those involved in the conspiracy. His criminality was plainly greater than that of Harb, notwithstanding the breach of trust that applied to Harb’s crime.
	
	
	That conclusion is not affected by the fact that the charge as averred against Harb incorporated a slightly wider time frame, from 1 November 2011 to 30 June 2012, than did the charge against the applicant, because Harb’s role in the conspiracy in late 2011 was very limited, there having been no successful importation of pseudoephedrine. In addition, the amount of pure pseudoephedrine intended to be imported in late 2011 was a little over 3 kilograms, as against the 87 kilograms actually imported during the period of the applicant’s involvement.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Harb were similarly motivated by greed. Whilst the applicant deposed that he intended to apply the profit to payment of a debt, that fact could not reduce the relevance of the financial motivation behind his participation in the conspiracy and, contrary to the applicant’s submission, the sentencing judge did not accept a submission that it did.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was also cognisant of the differing personal circumstances of the applicant and Harb, with Harb’s subjective case being a more positive one than that of the applicant. Harb was a person of good character; the applicant was not, having a prior conviction for supplying a prohibited drug. Harb had given assistance to the authorities and, as a consequence, would experience conditions of custody that were harsher than those that applied to the applicant. Harb had spent the eighteen or so months in custody prior to sentence in conditions of solitary confinement; the applicant had not. Whilst both offenders were found to have good prospects of rehabilitation, Harb’s were more positive than those of the applicant, and his rehabilitation was already underway.
	
	
	Considering all of the features relevant to the determination of the sentences imposed upon the offenders, arguably a differentiation of only a year between the starting point of sentence was generous to the applicant. The disparity is readily explained by the different cases of the applicant and Harb, and is not such that the applicant is justifiably aggrieved. There could be no basis, in any event, upon which to conclude that the difference in sentence is so marked as to warrant intervention.
	
	
	When imposing sentence upon Huynh, the sentencing judge had available to him and considered the remarks on sentence relevant to the applicant, and noted the application of the parity principle.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that Huynh’s role was more critical than the applicant’s, but that conclusion has to be seen in the overall context of the conspiracy, with his Honour finding that the “primary conspirators” - who included the applicant and Huynh - conducted themselves on a basis of equality, albeit playing different roles.
	
	
	That is an important consideration here, where the applicant and Huynh were both principal players in a sophisticated conspiracy. In any conspiracy, the roles played by individual conspirators will differ, but that does not necessarily lead to any material differentiation in the criminality of each member. Each had a part to play, without which the conspiracy could not proceed to achieve its aim. The applicant’s role was different to Huynh’s and, in the conclusion of Whitford SC DCJ, less critical to the conspiracy, but his criminality was not lesser because of that.
	
	
	Huynh had a vital role in travelling overseas to obtain the pseudoephedrine to be brought into the country, but the applicant also had an important role to play in the overall organisation of the conspiracy, acting as a conduit between the airport conspirators and those who ultimately received the drug, and being responsible for payment of the conspirators. The criminality of each was very high.
	
	
	As to the respective subjective cases, the differences between the applicant and Huynh were significant, and it would appear that the sentence imposed upon the latter was ameliorated to an extent by considerations connected with his mental illness and disadvantaged start in life.
	
	
	Huynh, who was six years older than the applicant, had an extensive criminal history for drug related offences, and certainly more extensive than that of the applicant. Whitford SC DCJ referred to that history, placing it in a context of an abusive environment during childhood, and enduring mental illness and dysfunction. His Honour referred to the social, educational, psychological and other disadvantages in Huynh’s background, features which were all taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	Although his Honour did not specifically refer to R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2, he appears to have treated Huynh’s circumstances of disadvantage as lessening his moral responsibility for his crime, as was contemplated by this Court in that case, at [69].
	
	
	The applicant did not have a disadvantaged background. He had grown up in a supportive environment, and enjoyed a sound education, gaining trade qualifications as a plumber, an industry in which he had consistently worked. He had a son to a former marriage and, at the time of sentence, was involved in another significant relationship. The applicant had no issues with his mental health and it would appear that the only real stressor in his life had been the debt he owed, that debt providing the motivation for his crime.
	
	
	The debt had been incurred when the applicant was robbed of an unidentified (but likely illicit) substance he was holding for another individual. When the owner of the lost substance pressed for payment of its value, the applicant’s parents settled the debt by taking out a mortgage on their home. The applicant’s ongoing anxiety was to repay his parents. Clearly, the applicant had not struggled under the heavy disadvantage that underpinned Huynh’s crime.
	
	
	It was open to Whitford SC DCJ to have regard to Huynh’s unfortunate personal circumstances in determining the sentence to be imposed. It was a feature of Huynh’s case which distinguished his circumstances from the applicant’s, and it provided a legitimate basis upon which to differentiate the sentences one from the other.
	
	
	The complaint about parity must be assessed in that light.
	
	
	Having considered all of the features of the cases of the three offenders, I do not conclude that the applicant has established that he has a legitimate or justified basis for any grievance he may feel arising from the differences in the sentence imposed upon him, and those imposed upon Harb and Huynh. Such small differences as exist are readily explained by the differing features of the respective cases.
	
	
	There being no merit in the proposed appeal, I would not grant leave to bring the appeal.
	
	
	The order I propose is:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

		07 November 2016",2016-11-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2863542,R v Droudis (No. 11) [2016] NSWSC 1319,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: Objection is taken on behalf of the Accused, Amirah Droudis, to the tender by the Crown of evidence of conversations involving the Accused and Man Monis, which took place in October 2013. The tendered conversations were recorded pursuant to surveillance device warrants.
	
	
	In the course of argument yesterday, two categories of evidence were addressed. Firstly, there are conversations between the Accused and Monis, recorded by surveillance device on 31 October 2013, where discussion relates to possible circumstances in which the Accused's hair and blood may have been deposited at the Werrington apartment block where the murder occurred. These discussions took place against the background of the service on the Accused, earlier on 31 October 2013, of a Summons to attend Court on 21 November 2013 for the purpose of a police application to obtain forensic samples from her under the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (MFIs 39, 40 and 41).
	
	
	The second category that was discussed yesterday involved conversations between the Accused and Monis recorded by surveillance device on 29 July 2013 and 31 October 2013, and a telephone intercept conversation on 29 July 2013 between the Accused and Anastasia (Sue) Droudis in which discussion takes place as to alibis for Monis and the Accused at the time of the murder of the deceased at Werrington on 21 April 2013 (MFIs 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46). The Accused has given notice of intention to rely on alibi by notice served on the Crown on 20 June 2016.
	
	
	I pause at this stage to note that it has been made clear this morning that it is the joint position of the parties that the second category of material (the alibi material) may be received as evidence in the trial with the question of the use to be made of it, and any directions which ought be given with respect to it, to be considered when all the evidence is in at the trial, including all evidence which bears on alibi.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is not necessary for the Court to give a ruling on that category. I observe, however, that the conclusion that I have reached was that the material should be received, but with the use of it to be considered at a later time. Accordingly, the view of the Court coincides with the view of the parties on that issue.
	
	
	The live issue then, on the present objection, concerns the first category of material (the hair and blood material).
	
	
	The starting point involves the test of relevance in s.55 Evidence Act 1995 for the purpose of admission of evidence. That section provides that evidence is relevant when, if it were accepted, it could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue in the proceedings.
	
	
	The appropriate enquiry, for the purpose of determining relevance under s.55, focuses upon the capability of the evidence to affect the determination or conclusions of the tribunal of fact: R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238 at 270 [145]-[146]. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. For the purposes of assessing this capability, it is assumed that the evidence would be accepted by the tribunal of fact and it is taken at its highest: R v Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214 at [38].
	
	
	Section 55 speaks of a rational effect that is brought about directly or indirectly. This is very broad language and suggests a wide rather than a narrow focus to the enquiry, whether a proffered piece of evidence has the rational potential which s.55 requires: R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 at [19]; R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 9 at [95].
	
	
	With respect to the hair and blood category, the Crown contends that it is capable of incriminating the Accused of the crime of murder. In the course of argument, submissions have been made as to whether the tendered evidence is capable of satisfying the requirements of so-called consciousness of guilt evidence in the form of lies in accordance with the principles in Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193.
	
	
	As Simpson J observed in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; 221 A Crim R 309 at 325 [60], the decision in Edwards v R was primarily concerned with the directions to be given to the jury once the evidence has been admitted and permitted to be used for the purpose of showing consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Simpson J continued at 325 [61]:
	


“The task of the trial Judge, in determining whether the evidence may be used in this way, is to determine whether it would be capable of meeting those tests [identified in Edwards v R with respect to lies]  - that is, whether it would be open to the jury to find affirmatively that it did.”


	
	This trial is a Judge-alone trial. There is no jury. I am asked to determine at this point whether the evidence is capable of being used as evidence of consciousness of guilt so that, if admitted, the Court acting as the tribunal of fact can then utilise it at the fact-finding stage.
	
	
	Post-offence conduct may be capable of constituting evidence of consciousness of guilt in different ways. This goes beyond lies, including, for example, flight, destruction of evidence or creation of a false account. Further examples of post-offence conduct were mentioned by the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35 at [72] and following.
	
	
	To view the present objection through the more narrow filter of the lies principle in Edwards v R may not be entirely apt, but I am prepared to do so for the purpose of this ruling.
	
	
	With respect to the hair and blood discussions between the Accused and Monis, competing submissions have been made. The Crown submits that the Accused and Monis are discussing the possibility of the Accused's blood or hair being at the crime scene in a manner that is damaging to the Accused, indicating a desire to think of an explanation in case forensic evidence is located at the crime scene which pointed to the Accused.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused submits that the conversations were understandable following the service, earlier that day, of the Summons and that what was said may be explained in other ways as being innocent, thereby not pointing to consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	The submissions on behalf of the Accused have included the provision of photographs taken of the Accused the next day, 22 April 2013 (MFI47), which do not appear to disclose any injuries to the hands or those parts of the arms which are visible.
	
	
	It is clear that a discussion between Monis and the Accused about the presence of hair and blood, and whether it may have been left at the crime scene, has a direct link to the crime for which the Accused is on trial. The present question is whether the statements of the Accused contained in these recorded conversations are capable of meeting the requirements for this evidence to be considered by the tribunal of fact as part of its fact-finding process, as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	There are competing arguments from the parties as to the use of the evidence. An example of this, for present purposes, is the Crown argument that in MFI41 (pages 5 and 6), Monis is raising with the Accused the question whether she had bled during a particular incident. The Crown notes that although the Accused said initially, ""I didn't bleed, I bruised"" after Monis said, ""A little bit it did"", the Accused said, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, caused a graze"". And Monis says, ""Even your blood might have been there"".
	
	
	Competing arguments have been put on behalf of the Crown and the Accused as to whether Monis and the Accused were aware at this time (the evening of 31 October 2013) that their conversations were being recorded, and whether that factor played a part in what was being said.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that, as the photographs (MFI47) seem to indicate, there were no visible injuries (insofar as the photographs reveal), so that the Accused did not seem to have suffered any injury that might have bled when observed by police the day after the killing.
	
	
	It seems to me that the very existence of the competing arguments which have been put demonstrates the capacity of this material to be relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt - not whether it should be, but whether it could be. In my view, the arguments which have been put relate to the use of the evidence once admitted, and not its capacity as a threshold question. They address what use a tribunal of fact may make of the evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant to issues in the trial and that the relatively low threshold of capacity to be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt has been met.
	
	
	It will be a separate question, to be considered with all of the evidence, as to whether the evidence should (rather than could) be used in this way. This is a matter for the tribunal of fact to consider by reference to all the evidence, in the manner referred to by the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Baden-Clay at [73]-[77].
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to admit into evidence MFIs 39, 40 and 41.
	
	
	For reasons I have explained, it is not necessary to make any ruling on the alibi material.

		07 November 2016",2016-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2863548,R v Droudis (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 1211,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of the evidence-in-chief of a Crown witness, John Aspros, the Crown has made application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine the witness.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that Mr Aspros should be cross-examined by the Crown about a matter of which it is said he may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge, and about which it appears to the Court he is not in examination-in-chief making a genuine attempt to give evidence, and about what is said to be a prior inconsistent statement: s.38(1)(b) and (c) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	In considering whether the Crown should be granted leave under this provision, it is necessary to have regard not only to the requirements of s.38, but the further requirements of s.192 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	It is appropriate, in the present context, to keep in mind the definition of ""prior inconsistent statement"" in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995. ""Prior inconsistent statement"" is defined as meaning “a previous representation that is inconsistent with evidence given by the witness"". The term ""previous representation"" is also defined in the Dictionary as meaning ""a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced"".
	
	
	In the course of giving a separate judgment on another issue earlier today (R v Droudis (No. 4) [2016] NSWSC 1150), I said something about the relevance of the evidence of Mr Aspros to issues in this trial. The evidence is taken to be of considerable importance by both the Crown and the defence.
	
	
	There is evidence in the trial from Detective Senior Constable Megan Oxley that, on the evening of 21 April 2013, she and another police officer attended premises at Belmore where they spoke to Mr Aspros. Put shortly, it is alleged that in that conversation Mr Aspros said, amongst other things, that he had not seen his sister, the Accused, since ""last Friday at the markets"" (T169-170).
	
	
	The Accused has given notice under s.150 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 of intention to raise alibi that on the day and at the time of the murder, which was in the late afternoon of 21 April 2013 at Werrington, she was at the family premises (at Belmore). As I understand it, the Crown seeks to rely upon the evidence of Mr Aspros to rebut the anticipated alibi evidence to be relied upon by the Accused.
	
	
	Mr Aspros, as I have said, is the brother of the Accused. It is apparent from evidence before the Court from his cousin, Anastasia (Sue) Droudis, and from other material now before the Court as well, that he has some health difficulties. He has suffered from schizophrenia since the mid-1990s.
	
	
	Before the Court, on the present application, are statements of a general practitioner, Dr Richard Sue, dated 10 December 2013 (MFI22) and a certificate of Dr Joanne Ferguson, psychiatrist, dated 25 February 2014 (MFI23). Both medical practitioners attest to Mr Aspros' mental health issues and the treatment which he is receiving for that condition.
	
	
	Both Dr Sue and Dr Ferguson refer to the possibility that Mr Aspros' condition may bear upon his memory and cognitive ability. Dr Sue says that, in his opinion, Mr Aspros appears quite normal in respect of his memory and cognitive ability. He considered he would be a reliable witness assuming he has had his medical treatment. Any evidence he provided, when fully medicated, could be considered reliable, relevant and fair.
	
	
	Dr Ferguson indicated that, in January 2014, she had undertaken specific cognitive testing of Mr Aspros. She expressed the opinion that he would cope with giving testimony in Court. No opinion expressed by her, or indeed by Dr Sue, points to some underlying difficulty of a medical type with Mr Aspros giving reliable evidence.
	
	
	There is, of course, other evidence before the Court from his cousin as to memory issues that she has observed over the years. All that is by way of preamble to the present application.
	
	
	The particular question by the Crown which triggered the present application is as follows (T351.18):
	


“Q. Mr Aspros, prior to police coming to your home, do you remember how long before that it was that you had last seen your sister?

A. Can't remember.”


	
	The Crown made application pointing primarily to notes of a conference held earlier today, 31 August 2016, with Mr Aspros and the Crown legal representatives. The notes, in question and answer form, are MFI24. In those notes, it is said that the Senior Crown Prosecutor asked Mr Aspros, ""When was it before that night that you had last seen your sister?"". Mr Aspros then replied, ""Probably the Friday or Saturday because we go to Flemington Markets”.
	
	
	Prior to that, there had been discussion in the conference with Mr Aspros. The Crown had indicated to him that the night the police saw him was a Sunday night. After Mr Aspros provided the answer which I have set out, there was further discussion as to who was with the Accused when they attended Flemington Markets.
	
	
	I have received extensive material and heard extensive submissions on the s.38 application. It is the case that no prior written statement was sought to be obtained from Mr Aspros about what had been said on the occasion when the police visited the Belmore premises on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	There are a number of documents setting out accounts which Mr Aspros has given. There are investigator's notes of the officer-in-charge, Detective Senior Constable Melanie Staples, dated 18 July 2013 (MFI20). These notes recount a telephone discussion she had with Mr Aspros which included some discussion of what had occurred, and had been said, on the occasion when police visited.
	
	
	Mr Aspros recalled that that occasion had been about a month before. That recollection was faulty, the occasion was some three months before (on 21 April 2013). Apart from that, Mr Aspros did have some recollection of some of the topics discussed on that occasion when the police visited.
	
	
	The next occasion when police spoke to Mr Aspros was on 27 November 2013 when a lengthy record of interview took place (MFI21). He was reminded, in the course of that interview, of what the police notes had asserted he had said on 21 April 2013, and also of what it was asserted that he had said during the telephone discussion with Detective Senior Constable Staples on 18 July 2013.
	
	
	A number of submissions have been made by reference to that record of interview. It was submitted for the Accused that, on some of these issues, Mr Aspros appeared to have a limited recollection, with certain things being suggested to him by the police (in the sense of him being reminded what the 21 April 2013 or the 18 July 2013 notes had said) and with the conversation then flowing. It must be said that there are elements of Mr Aspros being reminded of these matters by police. It is not a statement which, on its face, involved him volunteering things from his memory alone.
	
	
	It is appropriate to turn to the issue at hand. The question is whether there is a prior inconsistent statement, or a foundation under s.38(1)(b) (in the alternative), for Mr Aspros to be cross-examined by the Crown with particular respect to the contrast between what he said in evidence in the question and answer I referred to earlier (at [13]), and what he had said not long before to the Crown representatives (at [14]) in the question and answer contained in MFI24.
	
	
	A number of features bear on this issue. As to the general reliability of Mr Aspros, this is not the time for any detailed examination of that topic. There will, I apprehend, be submissions in due course by reference to the totality of the evidence.
	
	
	I note, however, that the police account of what was said on the evening of 21 April 2013 had Mr Aspros telling the police something about what had happened “last Friday at the market”. Now that topic, and the context of it, would seem to relate to when he had last seen the Accused. That is what the Crown contends in the context. I say no more on that aspect.
	
	
	In the record of interview (MFI21) there is extensive questioning. Police officers, as it happens, make repeated errors asserting that it is the “fish markets”. Mr Aspros demonstrates a capacity to hold his own by correcting the police and saying it was the “Flemington Markets”. That may have some bearing on issues of suggestibility.
	
	
	Most importantly, for present purposes, it seems to me is that there is, on the face of it, a direct contrast between what was said in evidence in this Court this morning by Mr Aspros on the question of when he had last seen his sister (with him indicating an inability to remember), and what he had said not long before outside the Court in this building when discussing the matters with the Crown representatives.
	
	
	I am satisfied in the circumstances that that particular issue involves a prior inconsistent statement for the purpose of s.38(1)(c).
	
	
	With respect to s.38(1)(b), I bear in mind that Mr Aspros has been questioned on these issues on a number of occasions, including a lengthy record of interview. I do keep in mind what the medical evidence indicates about his health difficulties, and the further evidence of his cousin as to the impact on his memory.
	
	
	It seems to me, however, that where there is a clear contrast between what was said in Court and what was said not long before in a discussion with counsel on this issue, a foundation exists as well under s.38(1)(b) on this question. I make it clear, however, that the primary basis for my ruling is the prior inconsistent statement basis.
	
	
	I should indicate that this is not an open-ended grant of leave to the Crown to cross-examine Mr Aspros. This is a grant of leave on a confined topic, which involves a contrast between what he said in MFI24 compared with what he said in evidence in this Court. I am not granting the Crown leave to conduct some broad cross-examination on what was said allegedly to the police by him.
	
	
	Although it has taken a considerable time to resolve this issue, this is a relatively narrow grant of leave which is being ordered.
	
	
	In reaching this conclusion, I have considered issues relevant under s.192 as well. Having done so, I propose to grant the Crown leave under s.38 to cross-examine John Aspros with respect to the particular matters which I have identified in this judgment.

		07 November 2016",2016-08-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2863559,R v Droudis (No. 3) [2016] NSWSC 1553,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown makes application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 for leave to cross-examine a Crown witness, Nigel William Osborne Quiney.
	
	
	Mr Quiney was called in this Judge-alone trial last Wednesday, 24 August 2016. His evidence-in-chief indicated that he was in the vicinity of the premises at 24-30 Parkes Avenue, Werrington on the afternoon of 21 April 2013, the date of the death of the deceased.
	
	
	He gave evidence of observations of a woman in the street. His cross-examination commenced (T151) with Senior Counsel for the Accused putting to Mr Quiney that the last time he (Mr Quiney) saw the woman was when she was still on the roadway. Mr Quiney said, ""Yes, that's correct"", and then he said ""Sorry, no, that's incorrect"" (T151.34). He proceeded to give an account of observing the woman in a vehicle thereafter, and that this vehicle had moved away from the premises at some speed.
	
	
	This unexpected development in the evidence of Mr Quiney led both the Senior Crown Prosecutor and Senior Counsel for the Accused, in due course, to ask that his evidence be deferred. Before that deferral, he was cross-examined and re-examined to an extent.
	
	
	Mr Quiney was asked to return to Court today and he has done so.
	
	
	The Crown indicated at the beginning of proceedings today that it wished to make a s.38 application with respect to Mr Quiney. After some discussion, I determined (in accordance with the defence submission) that the appropriate course was that the cross-examination of Mr Quiney should conclude, with the Crown then to make this application as it has in fact done.
	
	
	The Crown submits that leave should be granted to cross-examine Mr Quiney because evidence given by him is unfavourable to the Crown and that he has made one or more prior inconsistent statements: s.38(1)(a) and (c) Evidence Act 1995. The Crown also applied to ask Mr Quiney questions relevant only to his credibility: s.38(3).
	
	
	The application is opposed by the Accused and I have heard submissions which are contained in the transcript (T215-224).
	
	
	At the outset, it is necessary to bear in mind the principles to be applied on an application such as this. The relevant principles and authorities were summarised in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005 at [9]-[17] and I utilise that summary for present purposes. In that summary, several well-known decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal were cited, including R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474, and R v Parkes [2003] NSWCCA 12; 147 A Crim R 450.
	
	
	The term ""unfavourable"" in s.38(1)(a) does not mean ""adverse"". It means ""not favourable to the party making the application"". It was said in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No 29) at [14]:
	


“The interests of justice, the public interest and the administration of justice may be served by the testing of the evidence of a witness by way of a s.38 examination: R v Le at 487 [68]; R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1298] at [71]. The grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to the jury[or in this case to the trial Judge in a Judge-alone trial]  than would have been the case had the Crown been refused leave to cross-examine. …”

 


	
	As Ipp JA observed in R v Parkes, at 464 [81], [83], this is the very purpose underlying s.38.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to bear in mind, as well, the provisions in s.192 Evidence Act 1995 with respect to discretionary considerations which bear upon an application such as this.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon a number of documents which contain accounts said to have been given by Mr Quiney to police at different times - Constable Buttigieg's diary, with a note on 21 April 2013 (MFI11), Detective Senior Constable Hallam's running sheet entry of statements attributable to Mr Quiney on 24 April 2013 (MFI12), Mr Quiney's statement to the police on 26 April 2013 (MFI10) and a statement of Sergeant Marinello dated 26 August 2016 (MFI13). Add to those, the transcript of the evidence given by Mr Quiney on 24 August 2016 and again today.
	
	
	It is open to the Crown to contend that there are differing statements attributable to Mr Quiney along this chronological pathway with respect to what he saw on 21 April 2013. In addition to the reference by Mr Quiney to the woman whom he said he observed as being in a motor vehicle that hurriedly left the scene, he also indicated for the first time in evidence last Wednesday that the police had shown him certain photographs (T155).
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Quiney may be regarded as an unfavourable witness in that he is not favourable to the party making the application, namely, the Crown.
	
	
	In the defence opening last Monday (T41), reference was made to aspects of Mr Quiney's evidence as being a potential foundation for an argument in support of the defence in this trial. What has happened since then is the addition by Mr Quiney, under cross-examination last Wednesday, of an account that the woman in question was actually in a vehicle that was apparently leaving the scene hurriedly. That aspect and other features to which I have referred warrant a finding that he is unfavourable to the Crown for present purposes.
	
	
	I am satisfied, as well, that the comments or statements attributable to Mr Quiney in the various documents to which I have referred (at [13] above) constitute prior inconsistent statements for the purpose of s.38.
	
	
	What, of course, the end result is with respect to these matters will be a topic to be considered in the light of all the evidence. However, I am satisfied that the Crown has satisfied the threshold requirements of s.38(1)(a) and (c).
	
	
	The Crown has indicated, as well, a desire to cross-examine Mr Quiney more generally on credibility issues. In that respect, the Crown says that these matters spring from Mr Quiney's criminal history (MFI15) and some intelligence reports said to relate to activities of Mr Quiney (MFI16).
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to bear in mind the terms of s.38(3). The Crown may, with the leave of the Court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness' credibility. In this respect, the Court should keep in mind as well s.192 of the Act, which requires the Court to consider whether questioning would be likely to add unduly to the hearing, the extent to which it may be unfair to a party or a witness and the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave is sought. An application under s.38 to cross-examine a witness on issues relating to credibility only calls for particular consideration.
	
	
	The Crown has indicated that it will ultimately seek to submit to the Court at trial, if there is a foundation for it, that there are features of Mr Quiney's past conduct that bear upon his credibility more generally, and his capacity to tell the truth.
	
	
	It has been submitted for the Accused that the Court should take into account Mr Quiney's demeanour in giving evidence up to this point. That is relevant to the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	However, an assessment of the witness' demeanour, and what flows from it, should await a fuller examination by reference to the material as to which he will be cross-examined under s.38.
	
	
	After consideration, I have determined that the Crown ought be permitted to ask Mr Quiney questions on the broader credibility issues relating to MFI15 and MFI16. That said, I will monitor the progress of that phase of the cross-examination to see if there is any aspect of s.192 which is expressly engaged while that questioning occurs.
	
	
	In reaching the conclusions expressed in this judgment, I should indicate that s.38(4) requires questioning under the section to take place before other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the Court otherwise directs. The cross-examination by the Crown will take place effectively after cross-examination on behalf of the Accused. However, the way in which the issue has arisen today (see [6] above) is such that it is appropriate in my view, that the questioning proceed in that order. I will ensure that Mr Ierace SC has an opportunity to further cross-examine Mr Quiney after the Crown has cross-examined under s.38, if he so wishes.
	
	
	Accordingly, I grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Mr Quiney on the matters arising from MFIs 11, 12 and 13 (being prior accounts given by him) and by reference to his statement (MFI10), and the transcript of evidence which he has so far given. Further, I grant leave to cross-examine on credibility issues by reference to MFI15 and MFI16.

		07 November 2016",2016-08-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2863560,Saheli v R [2016] NSWDC 289,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Magistrate Farnan sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 10 June 2016.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He admitted that on the evening of 11 March 2016 at Sydney he did have in his possession a prohibited drug, namely cocaine. The amount of the drug was 0.57 grams. The small quantity of cocaine is 1 gram. The trafficable quantity is 3 grams. The indictable amount is 5 grams. It can be seen, therefore, that the plaintiff had a relatively small amount of the drug upon him, consistent with obtaining the drug for personal use.
	
	
	Her Honour gave the appellant the benefit of s 10 with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 but imposed a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. The appellant on this appeal complains about the length of the s 10 bond.
	
	
	At first blush it appeared to me excessive. At the time of the offence the appellant was 28 years old. At the time of this appeal hearing he is 29 years old. He came before the Local Court as a man of prior good character. He has no criminal convictions at all. His evidence before me is that he had not previously used any prohibited drug. That is consistent with his clean prior record. On Sunday, 13 March 2016, less than 48 hours after the offence, the appellant provided a urine sample to a medical practitioner which was subjected to analysis and was completely negative when tested for opiates, amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites and benzodiazepine. In other words, the plaintiff had been clean of drugs recently, for perhaps as long as a week, or more, consistent with his not having used drugs on 11 March 2016 and consistent with his not previously having been a drug user.
	
	
	The appellant is a man who admits that he acted very foolishly. He had been drinking alcohol for four hours at rate of perhaps two schooners per hour, which indicates that he may have been gravely disinhibited by his alcohol consumption. He succumbed to an offer to experiment, a foolish offer foolishly accepted. He is fortunate in that he did not consume the drug which, of course, had the potential of leading to addiction and ultimately personal ruin.
	
	
	In imposing sentences the Court is concerned with the extent of the criminality of the offender. The offender as I said was disinhibited. He was a man of prior good character. I am persuaded on the evidence that he gave me to today that the prospects of his offending again are extremely remote. In the circumstances I accept that the length of the s 9 bond was too long. I set aside the penalty imposed by the Local Court at the Downing Centre on 10 June 2016.
	
	
	Joseph Saheli, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your prior good character, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of six months from today. The conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [redacted]; or
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of this Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.

		07 November 2016",2016-09-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2863561,R v Droudis (No. 8) [2016] NSWSC 1276,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has called as a witness OK. OK is the son of AK, who has already given evidence in the trial (T241ff).
	
	
	OK was 17 years of age at the time of the events relevant to his evidence (and is thus not identified in this judgment because of s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987).
	
	
	A topic upon which he is asked to give evidence in the trial relates to an occasion, on 21 April 2013, when, together with his parents and the family of Mr Hossein-Noori, he travelled to the Werrington premises of Man Monis, and then spent much of the day with Monis, largely at the Penrith Swimming Pool.
	
	
	OK has been asked by the Crown questions about what happened whilst the group were at the swimming pool. It reached a point where the Crown asked (T466.29):
	


“Q. Do you remember anything about the circumstances in which you came to leave the pool?

A. Oh, yeah, like, yeah, we leaved quickly. 

Q. Why? 

A. After Monis said, 'Let's go', and we packed up quickly and we went out from the pool. 

Q. Did anything happen before Mr Monis said 'Let's go'? 

A. No. 

Q. No? 

A. No.”


	
	At that point, the Crown indicated that application was being made under s.38 Evidence Act 1995. A short time later, the witness left the Court and argument has proceeded in his absence.
	
	
	The Crown has based the application upon s.38(1)(b) and (c) Evidence Act 1995. To place the application in context, it is necessary to say something about the evidence giving rise to the present controversy.
	
	
	OK made two statements to the police concerning the events relevant to this trial. One is dated 30 April 2013 (nine days after the events of 21 April 2013) and the second is dated 5 September 2016 (yesterday). The two statements are together MFI29.
	
	
	The Accused is charged with murdering the deceased at Werrington on 21 August 2013.
	
	
	The suggested relevance of the evidence that has led to this application may be found in the opening address on behalf of the Accused made after the Crown opening. At that point, Mr Ierace SC said (T33.20):
	


“There will be evidence to the effect Monis received a phone call on a mobile while he was at the pool. Immediately after the call he announced that it was time for them all to go. It seems there is no record of that call on the recovered phones. It was not made using known SIM cards, leading to the inference that Monis disposed of that phone and SIM card, leading in turn to the inference the phone call was either from the attacker or persons associated with and assisting the attacker.”


	
	That submission was based upon what appeared in paragraph 12 of OK's first statement made on 30 April 2013. There, OK said:
	


“At the pools, I saw Man answer his phone and I saw him talking to someone. After he finished this phone call, Man looked sad and he said, 'Let's go'. We then left Penrith pools around 4.00pm and we drove from the pool and started heading back to Man's house. We were all in the same cars as when we travelled to the pool. I think we travelled a different way to the way we got to the pool from Man's house.”


	
	In the second statement made yesterday, OK said in paragraphs 11 to 14:
	


“11.    Not long after I returned from getting changed, I was sitting down with my Mum and Dad and Ebrahim. Monis was standing a little bit away from us. This was when I heard his phone make a noise as I mentioned in my first statement. 

12.   I am not sure if it was a phone call or a text message alert, and I am not sure where the phone was when it made a noise. Monis then walked away from the group. I did not pay any attention to where he walked, because at the time I was searching websites on my phone. I did not see him talking on the phone or with the phone to his ear. 

13.   When Monis came back to the group, he was acting different. He was all happy before and it was like he was now sad. This is when he said, 'Let's go'. He was in a hurry to leave. I did not see the phone when he returned to the group. 

14.   This was the point that everyone started to pack up and it was right before we started to let leave. It took us about 5 or 10 minutes to pack up.”


	
	It may be seen that the first statement of OK was considered of such significance to warrant mention in the defence opening, which I have outlined.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the second statement of OK sheds light upon that aspect, in a manner which bears on a significant issue in the trial. The Crown contends that the contents of OK’s second statement raises the prospect that this is a reference to the text message from the deceased to Monis at 3.34 pm, as summarised in Exhibit A at Tab 4(b).
	
	
	I merely record the competing arguments that may be put by reference to the evidence on this topic. This is not the time to weigh them up or attempt any resolution of them. What is sufficiently notable is that there is a significant trial issue in the context of the present application.
	
	
	To my observation, OK appeared tentative while giving evidence. He is now 20 years old but the evidence relates to events when he was only 17 years old. I infer that there is a degree of nervousness on his part, which is understandable for a young man called to give evidence in the Supreme Court in a serious criminal trial.
	
	
	The principles applicable on an application under s.38 are not in doubt and were referred to in an earlier judgment in this trial: R v Droudis (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 1150. The Court must consider whether the threshold for a grant of leave under s.38(1) has been crossed and have regard as well to factors arising under s.192 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	In my view, there is inconsistency between what was said by OK in Court today in his evidence, at the point where the s.38 application was made (see [4] above) and indeed what was said in both of his earlier statements with respect to observations of Monis at the Penrith Swimming Pool with a phone (see [10] and [11] above).
	
	
	The second statement was only made yesterday. That does raise for consideration whether there is an unwillingness on the part of the witness to give evidence along the lines of what he said just one day ago. This may trigger s.38(1)(b) of the Act. Having regard to the witness' nervousness, I am not at this stage satisfied that a s.38(1)(b) foundation has been established. I am, however, satisfied that there are prior inconsistent statements for the purpose of this application.
	
	
	I observe that, if s.38 leave was not granted, the likely way in which events would unfold is that Mr Ierace SC would cross-examine the witness on paragraph 12 of his first statement. That, after all, is the foundation for what was said in his opening address. That may, in turn, provide a basis for the Crown to seek to re-examine on what the witness said at paragraphs 11 to 14 of his second statement. For this issue to arise in that way would give rise to potential complications.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the appropriate way for the issue to proceed is by use of s.38. If leave is granted (and there is a foundation for a grant of leave), the Crown may cross-examine the witness on this topic before cross-examination on behalf of the Accused. This is consistent with s.38(4) of the Act.
	
	
	This is an important issue in the trial. I am satisfied that, to proceed in this way, will fulfil the purposes of s.38. As was said in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005 at [14]:
	


“The interests of justice, the public interest and the administration of justice may be served by the testing of the evidence of a witness by way of a s.38 examination: R v Le at 487 [68]; R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1298] at [71]. The grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to the jury[or in this case to the trial Judge in a Judge-alone trial] than would have been the case had the Crown been refused leave to cross-examine. …”


	
	As Ipp JA observed in R v Parkes [2003] NSWCCA 12; 147 A Crim R 450 at 464 [81], [83], this is the very purpose underlying s.38.
	
	
	I grant the Crown leave under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine OK with respect to the prior inconsistent statements which I have nominated in this judgment.

2863562,R v Droudis (No. 7) [2016] NSWSC 1274,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has called as a witness in its case Sonia Conciatore. Ms Conciatore was a close friend of the deceased. I will not identify the deceased in this judgment as it may serve to identify the two children of her marriage to Man Monis: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	The Crown has adduced evidence from Ms Conciatore of things which were said to her by the deceased over a period of time. Before the topics which have given rise to the present objection, Ms Conciatore has given evidence about what the deceased had told her concerning her relationship with her former husband (Monis), with those matters being sourced to Monis.
	
	
	The Crown has sought to adduce evidence from Ms Conciatore with respect to things which the deceased said to her arising from direct communications between the deceased and the Accused, Amirah Droudis.
	
	
	The statements obtained by police from Ms Conciatore on 22 April 2013 and 14 May 2013 (MFIs 27 and 28 respectively) were in a type of narrative form. Against this background, an objection was indicated before Ms Conciatore entered the witness box to evidence which she may give concerning what the deceased said to her about the deceased's communications with the Accused.
	
	
	It was agreed by counsel that the best way forward was when that point of her examination-in-chief was reached, a voir dire be commenced with the evidence to be led with the witness being asked to give her best recollection, in the first person, of what the deceased told her had been said between the deceased and the Accused.
	
	
	The voir dire took place and submissions have occurred since. During the course of the voir dire, I granted leave to the Crown to allow Ms Conciatore to refresh her memory under s.32 Evidence Act 1995 by reference to parts of her 22 April 2013 statement (MFI27) (T438).
	
	
	The issue presently under consideration is whether certain evidence given by Ms Conciatore may be admitted for the purposes of s.65(2) Evidence Act 1995. This section has been recently considered by the High Court of Australia in Sio v The Queen [2016] HCA 32. Put shortly, the High Court makes clear that it is necessary, where a s.65 issue arises, for the particular representation or representations to be identified with some precision and, secondly, for the requirements of s.65 to be considered separately and not in a compendious way.
	
	
	With those principles in mind, the Crown has identified two representations which are sought to be relied upon under s.65. It is appropriate to bear in mind that these representations should identify the facts which are sought to be proved in an admissible fashion by use of s.65.
	
	
	The first representation arises from the evidence of Ms Conciatore about a conversation, in about January 2013, where the deceased and the Accused were discussing the use of the term ""Mummy"" said to be attributed by the deceased's children to the Accused.
	
	
	The second representation arises from a conversation about two weeks before 21 April 2013, where there is said to have been an argument between the Accused and the deceased about the boys, with the Accused allegedly saying she wanted the boys to “live with Michael” (that is, Monis).
	
	
	The evidence the Crown seeks to adduce from Ms Conciatore concerns her conversation with an “unavailable person” (the deceased) as to what the deceased said that the Accused had said to her.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the Accused advanced an argument that this was in fact second-hand hearsay and attention was drawn to s.62 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I am not presently persuaded that the two alleged representations arise in a setting of second-hand hearsay. Having considered the various persons involved in the chain of communication involved with these conversations, I am satisfied, for present purposes, that it constitutes firsthand hearsay.
	
	
	The terms of s.65 need to be approached, as the High Court said in Sio v The Queen, with each element being applied to the representation under consideration.
	
	
	I commence with the second representation, namely, what is said to have happened about two weeks before the death of the deceased, where there is said to have been an argument with the Accused having said something to the deceased about her wanting the boys to live with Monis.
	
	
	Considering the components of s.65(2), I do not consider that s.65(2)(a) has any application. A question arises as to whether s.65(2)(b) is satisfied. In this respect, Ms Conciatore says that she was told soon after the event in question of the argument involving the Accused allegedly saying that the children should belong with Monis. I note that Ms Conciatore referred to this event in general terms in her statement of 22 April 2013 (MFI27), and said it had occurred about two weeks before.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this representation was made shortly after the asserted fact occurred, and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication. In that regard, I refer generally to the pattern of the deceased's communications with Ms Conciatore where she reported events which had occurred in her life and, in particular, in this period with respect to her past relationship with Monis, the two sons of that relationship and the Accused, who was described as “the girlfriend”.
	
	
	Section 65(2)(c) requires the Court to consider whether the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable. In the circumstances I have just outlined for the purposes of s.65(2)(b), there is a foundation for such a conclusion.
	
	
	I note the submission on behalf of the Accused that there is a video of a particular occasion where persons came together which does not support this claim. I do not consider that aspect can be clearly and completely sheeted home to this event.
	
	
	In any event, the ultimate question of the use that may be made of this evidence, and what factual findings ought be made, will be a matter to be considered in the light of all the evidence.
	
	
	Finally, for the purposes of s.65(2)(d), it is necessary to consider whether the representation was against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and that it was made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable. I am satisfied that these aspects are met with respect to the second representation. I am satisfied, therefore, that the second representation should be admitted and treated as being admissible under s.65 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	As to the first representation, there is a fundamental difficulty. It seems to me that there are, on my understanding of the evidence, two versions given by Ms Conciatore. One of them attributes a conversation with respect to the use of the word ""Mummy"" by the children to Monis. The other appears to attribute that to a conversation with Monis and “the girlfriend” (the Accused). The evidence of Ms Conciatore is uncertain as to the particular timing of that conversation, let alone any clear statement that attributes it to the Accused as opposed to Monis.
	
	
	I note that Ms Conciatore’s statement of 22 April 2013, at paragraphs 13 and 14, does not attribute a representation along the lines of the first representation to the Accused.
	
	
	For the purpose of considering the elements of s.65(2), I state shortly my conclusion that the Court cannot make findings favourable to admission of the first representation by reference to reliability. There are, of course, understandable issues arising with respect to the precise memory of Ms Conciatore as to a number of these events.
	
	
	I do not propose to allow the first representation to be admitted for the purpose of s.65.

2863563,R v Droudis (No. 9) [2016] NSWSC 1299,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: In the course of the evidence-in-chief of the officer-in-charge, Detective Melanie Staples, the Crown is tendering a variety of items for different purposes.
	
	
	The Crown has tendered a letter from the Accused to Man Monis dated 22 April 2014. This letter was located on 15 December 2014 when a search was undertaken of premises at Denman Avenue, Wiley Park, the then premises of the Accused and Monis.
	
	
	The letter has been described accurately by Senior Counsel for the Accused as being a “love letter”, which outlines certain expressions of endearment and also the ongoing efforts of the Accused and her daughter to learn certain religious texts. The Court has been informed that, at the time that this letter was written, Monis was in custody on certain sexual assault charges.
	
	
	The basis of the objection is that the letter is more than one year after the killing of the deceased at Werrington on 21 April 2013. It is submitted it is simply not relevant to any issues in the trial.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the letter is a piece of evidence which sheds light on what is said to be an ongoing relationship between the Accused and Monis that commenced in about 2006. I have allowed evidence to be given of aspects of that relationship in a pretrial decision, which allowed the Crown to adduce evidence of relationship between Monis and the Accused, with that evidence bearing on issues of motive, the state of mind of the Accused and also for tendency purposes.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that the Accused killed the deceased effectively at the behest of Monis. As part of that case, the Crown has sought to adduce evidence of the relationship between the Accused and Monis at various times leading up to the killing of the deceased, and to an extent afterwards.
	
	
	For the purpose of establishing a relationship or a state of mind or a connection of an emotional and religious type between the Accused and Monis over a period of time, particular incidents or events at different times along the way may shed light.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission on behalf of the Accused that there is a type of cut-off point at some time after the killing of the deceased in April 2013.
	
	
	The question is what inferences are available and might be drawn, having regard to pieces of evidence which may be looked at, ultimately, together. In outlining these matters I am not, of course, expressing any concluded view on issues in this trial.
	
	
	The purpose of saying these things is to explain why, in my view, this letter is relevant. If, for example, there had been some piece of evidence which showed the cessation of any relationship between the Accused and Monis, either before the killing or at some time after, that itself may have been relevant. However, this letter forms part of a number of pieces of evidence which the Crown says suggest an ongoing relationship for years before the killing in 2013 and with that relationship ongoing in April 2014.
	
	
	I have considered whether this piece of evidence is too remote to be relevant to the issues in the trial. However, I am satisfied that it is, for the purpose of the relevance test in the Evidence Act 1995, sufficiently connected to the issues in the proceedings as to make it relevant.
	
	
	What use is to be made of it, of course, is a matter for the future to be considered in the light of all the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	I allow the Crown to tender the letter of 22 April 2014 from the Accused to Man Monis.

2863564,R v Droudis (No. 10) [2016] NSWSC 1305,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has tendered seven photographs of Man Monis (MFI36). Objection is taken to the tender of the photographs essentially upon the basis that there is an insufficient nexus between these photographs and the Accused, Amirah Droudis.
	
	
	At the outset, it is acknowledged for the Accused that these photographs form part of a number of items of evidence that were the subject of a ruling which I made on 12 August 2016, admitting evidence on a number of bases, including motive, relationship, state of mind and for tendency purposes.
	
	
	A particular objection, however, is directed to these items which, it is said, ought not be admitted for other reasons relating to the suggested insufficient nexus with the Accused.
	
	
	The evidence on the voir dire indicates that the photographs were taken on 31 July 2014, using a Sony mobile phone, which was seized from the Accused on 15 December 2014, when she was located in a Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle.
	
	
	The photographs were discovered on an M-TECH USB located at the Belmore address of the Accused's family on 16 December 2014.
	
	
	There is evidence on the voir dire that the headband which is being worn by Monis, contains Arabic script which states ""We are your soldiers Mohammed, May Allah honour him and grant him peace"".
	
	
	The photographs were taken in premises at Wiley Park which were occupied by Monis and the Accused in 2014.
	
	
	The photographs depict Monis apparently seated. In a number of the photographs, he is posing with his hands folded, sitting in front of a bookcase. The images depicted in the photographs are inconsistent with them being so-called “selfies” where he himself would have been holding the mobile phone.
	
	
	The defence submission is that it is quite possible that Monis took these photographs himself, using a timer in the mobile phone, so that the Accused herself was not connected with the taking of the photographs.
	
	
	The Crown submits that these photographs are one piece of evidence in a circumstantial case involving many pieces.
	
	
	The question at this point is one of admissibility. It is the case that the Accused is not depicted in the photographs, nor is there direct evidence that she took them. There are, however, a number of factors which may provide a foundation for such a conclusion, bearing in mind that all I am considering at this stage is the admissibility of the evidence, and not what conclusions might be reached with respect to it.
	
	
	As I have said, the photographs were recovered on her mobile phone. The M-TECH USB stick was located in the Belmore premises in December 2014. The photographs were taken in premises which were occupied by the Accused and Monis at the relevant time in 2014.
	
	
	In my view, there is a sufficient nexus, for the purpose of admissibility, between the Accused and the photographs. What conclusions can be reached by reference to the photographs will be an issue to be considered in light of the totality of the evidence in the Crown's circumstantial case.
	
	
	I am satisfied, however, that these photographs (MFI36) ought be admitted and I so rule.

2863565,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Mansouri [2016] NSWLC 17,"Judgment


	
	The defendant Jafar Mansouri has pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent driving occasioning death. That is an offence contrary to s 117(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013. The offence carries with it upon conviction a maximum penalty of 30 penalty units and/or imprisonment for 18 months in the case of a first offence. There is no issue that this offence is a “first offence” within the meaning of the road transport legislation.
	
	
	The defendant was initially charged with the more serious offence of dangerous driving occasioning death. That charge was eventually withdrawn by the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) upon a plea of guilty being entered to the charge that remains before the court.
	
	
	On 18 August 2016 I heard submissions on sentence from Mr Marr of Counsel and from Ms Rowe who appeared on behalf of the Director. Following the taking of those submissions I adjourned the matter until today so that I might more fully consider all of the material that has been put before me.
	


The facts


	
	The charge that the defendant has pleaded guilty to arises out of a fatal motor vehicle accident which occurred between 9.15am and 9.20am on 23 August 2015. At that time the defendant was driving his motor vehicle, a green coloured Mazda sedan, in an easterly direction on Mowbray Road at Chatswood. His 18 year old daughter, Negin, was seated in the front passenger seat of his vehicle. It had been raining and the road was wet. The speed limit was 50km per hour. While travelling near the intersection of Young Street Chatswood the defendant 's vehicle veered onto the incorrect side of the road and into the path of a Jeep four-wheel drive motor vehicle being driven by Richard Drake. Mr Drake took evasive action to avoid the defendant's car. This caused Mr Drake’s vehicle to spin out of control. The defendant attempted to correct his car’s position by steering sharply to the left. The defendant's vehicle over-corrected and he lost control of it, resulting in its front wheels mounting the footpath of Mowbray Road and coming into collision with a female pedestrian who was walking east at the time. That pedestrian was Ms Xiao Ling Zheng and she was 65 years old. The impact of the collision caused Ms Zheng to be forced against a brick fence outside residential premises. Tragically Ms Zheng died at the scene.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts relied on by the Crown effectively provide, so far as I can discern, a summary of the various statements made by witnesses within the prosecution brief of evidence. I do not propose in these reasons to recount all of that evidence. Suffice to say that on a full consideration of the material, the following matters emerge:
	



	
	The roadway was wet from earlier rain and it was sprinkling at the time of the accident. The rain had followed a dry period and the roadway was greasy.
	
	
	The defendant's car, whilst perhaps travelling at a speed marginally in excess of the sign posted speed limit of 50km per hour, was not exceeding the speed limit in any significant way. It is not suggested that excessive speed played any role in the circumstances of the accident.
	
	
	The defendant was screaming and extremely distressed at the scene of the accident and was later transported to the Royal North Shore Hospital for treatment. On admission to hospital blood and urine samples were obtained, both of which returned negative results upon analysis.
	
	
	There is some conflict in the Agreed Facts concerning the tread on the tyres of the defendant's vehicle. Constable Wotherspoon who attended at the scene noted on examination that the rear passenger side tyre had very minimal tread remaining. In contrast, a later examination of the defendant's vehicle by Senior Constable Davenport concluded that there was no issue with the wheels or tyres fitted to the vehicle. The Agreed Facts do not allow me to conclude that there was any defect with the defendant's tyres such as to contribute to the collision, however I was provided with two colour photographs of the tyres. To my lay observation, the tread on the tyres of the defendant's vehicle may fairly be described as somewhat less than optimal, although I must be careful to ascribe significant weight to what is in effect my own “non-expert” assessment.
	


The plea


	
	It was submitted to me that the defendant had offered to plead guilty at an early stage to the charge that remains before the court and that in those circumstances, the full 25% discount on penalty ought to be provided consistent with the principles identified in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. Ms Rowe conceded that the defendant was entitled to such a discount.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	As in any matter it is necessary for me to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. This is to be done in part by having regard to the maximum penalty that has been prescribed by the Parliament. I have already made reference to that. My assessment must also have regard to the degree of negligence involved in the driving. Mr Marr submitted that I would find that the negligence involved in this case is very much at the lower end of objective seriousness. In support of that submission he observed and urged upon me a finding that the defendant's negligence was primarily associated with momentary mismanagement and/or misjudgment. In my view, the offending is properly regarded as being at or just above the mid-range of objective seriousness. Whilst it is true that the defendant was not exceeding the sign posted speed limit in any significant way, that does not mean that the defendant was travelling at a speed that was appropriate in all the circumstances. Further, his failure to manage the prevailing conditions and his motor vehicle in a way that ensured that the vehicle remained in its lane, and did not mount the footpath and strike a pedestrian, involved in all the circumstances a serious departure from the standard of care for others that is expected of an ordinary and prudent driver. Clearly, this offence is a serious one. The fact that Parliament has legislated to provide that a term of imprisonment might be imposed, indicates that the seriousness with which it is to be regarded: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174.
	


The defendant 


	
	A powerful and persuasive subjective case is presented on behalf of the defendant. He is aged 43 years and is married with 4 children aged 18, 17, 6 and 3. He and members of his family report a sad and tragic background which is relevant to the sentencing task I must perform. This relevance derives from the fundamental requirement that justice be individual. The penalty that is finally imposed ought, so far as the court is able, fit both the offence and the defendant. These purposes will often pull in different directions, and the interplay between them “may be complex and on occasion intricate”: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ at [68]. As Grove J observed in R v Todoroski [2010] NSWCCA 75 at [26] (Allsop P and Hislop J agreeing):
	


I note that every offence and every defendant is different and the essential aim of all sentencing is individual justice.

While this observation was made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the context of it considering the utility of comparable cases and statistics, it seems to me that the principle of which it speaks is of universal application to each and every sentencing task. For this reason is it necessary for me to touch upon those issues particular to the defendant in some more detail. Much of this detail came before the court through the tender without objection of two psychological reports prepared by Ms Martha Knox-Haly from the NSW Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors. The first report, although undated, dealt with the period until 14 March 2016. The second report is dated 20 June 2016.


	
	The defendant was born in Iran and trained as an Electrical Engineer. In his early 20s he met his wife, Ramina. In Iran, marriages were arranged by negotiation and were to be kept within the tribe within which a person identified. The defendant and his wife were not from the same tribe and married in the face of significant opposition from his wife’s family. This opposition included the defendant's wife being severely beaten on several occasions by her brothers. Further the defendant's brother was stabbed by one of his wife’s brothers and his father’s home was raided by them.
	
	
	When the defendant's wife was seven months pregnant with their third child, her sister (who had remained supportive of her) was secretly caring for their eldest child, Negin. The defendant's brothers in law discovered the child at her aunt’s home and confronted the aunt. They beat her until she disclosed the defendant and his wife’s address. The brothers in law then attended at the home of the defendant and his wife. The defendant was not home but his wife was. She was beaten so severely that she began to miscarry. She was taken to hospital and it became clear that the baby had died in utero during the beating. A still born baby girl who was named Fatima was delivered via caesarean section. As a consequence of the beating, the defendant's wife not only lost her unborn daughter but also lost the hearing in her left ear. The body of the dead baby girl was given to the defendant and despite his distressed state, he was required to hurriedly bury the child. This meant that appropriate funeral rites for the child were not observed. The defendant still experiences nightmares and significant feelings of guilt as a consequence of these events.
	
	
	After this attack the defendant and his wife were not surprisingly increasingly fearful of his brothers in law, and they moved far away from their family home. On an occasion thereafter, the defendant's youngest daughter was again visiting with her maternal aunt. The defendant's brothers in law again discovered the child and on this occasion the defendant's sister in law was beaten to death. The young child was present in the home while this occurred. It is difficult to comprehend the level of depraved and almost prehistoric brutality to which the defendant and his family were subjected at the hands of members of his wife’s family. It is also difficult to appreciate and understand the impact that such brutality would have on all of their general functioning.
	
	
	Following the murder of his sister in law the defendant and his wife took the view that they could no longer reside in Iran. They concluded, not unreasonably given that to which they had been subjected, that to do so would simply expose all of their family to further risk of significant harm or death. They fled to Indonesia where they remained for six weeks and then from Indonesia journeyed by boat as asylum seekers to Australia over 4 days, in what are described as horrific conditions. There were 130 people on the boat. None of the family could swim and they had not previously seen the ocean. The family found the experience terrifying. The conditions were so cramped that the family were unable to stretch their legs. The boat had no life jackets and with the lack of toilets, passengers had no option but to soil themselves. It is reported that the boat was covered in vomit. On arrival in Australia the family were detained on Christmas Island for 11 months. This detention facility was over crowded, their circumstances were difficult and there were attempts at self-harm by both the defendant who slashed his arms with glass and his then 13 year old son. The incident involving his son involved an attempt at cutting his own throat with shards of glass following an altercation with guards. It cannot be overlooked that this was all occurring against the background of the family’s flight from the wife’s murderous brothers, their ongoing grieving for Fatima and the wife’s sister, and the fact that a new baby had been born. The family was later transferred to a detention centre in Darwin where their circumstances remained bleak. Whilst resident in the Darwin detention centre the defendant's eldest daughter jumped off a building in a suicide attempt and sustained a fractured pelvis. After being transferred to Brisbane because of their severe mental health difficulties, the family were later released into community detention in Sydney in December 2014. Following release into the community the defendant has continued to suffer significant symptoms of depression and remains hyper vigilant around the safety of his family. The family remain on bridging visas awaiting the final resolution of their status in this country. Sadly this defendant and his family have been subjected to significant disadvantage over an extended period, all in circumstances where both he and they have done nothing whatsoever to warrant such treatment.
	
	
	It is against this background that the defendant appears before the court for sentence. Of course, and most importantly, to be added to the difficulty of his circumstances, is the fact that the defendant has been stricken with remorse, grief, guilt and regret as a consequence of the death of Ms Zheng in August 2015. He feels her death deeply and prays daily seeking forgiveness for his role in her death. He wishes he could trade places with her. He has been dangerously suicidal on several occasions since the motor vehicle accident, and has continued to engage in extensive psychological counselling and treatment. It is not in the least surprising that the defendant meets the criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. While the same sentencing principles must apply in every case irrespective of the defendant's membership of a particular ethnic group, I should also have regard to those material facts which exist only by reason of the defendant's membership of that group: Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 per Brennan CJ at 326. This principle has been more recently affirmed by the High Court, so far as it relates to Aboriginal offenders, in Munda v Western Australia (2013) 249 CLR 600. It has equal relevance when dealing with an ethnic group such as those seeking asylum from persecution in a country as rich and bountiful as Australia.
	


Hardship to family


	
	The defendant's children and his wife are each said to have complex mental health needs. The family have no relatives or family support in Australia and the evidence tendered reveals that the entire family are highly reliant on the defendant. The Court was provided with evidence from Settlement Services International and Woodville Alliance (formerly known as Woodville Community Services) in relation to the needs of the family. The document provided by Settlement Services International opines that several members of the family are at high risk of suicide or have trauma-related mental health issues. The family are also suffering from complex grief and loss issues. The children have their own caseworkers through Woodville Alliance. The report from that organisation confirms that the family’s needs are complicated and that each member’s mental health difficulties impact on others. Each of the four children display signs of anxiety and stress and the two older children also suffer from an increased risk of suicide. What each of the reports makes clear is that the defendant is the fulcrum around which the family turns. Without him the entire family’s situation would be even more dire. The stress and anxiety associated with the consequences of the motor vehicle accident and these proceedings, along with the defendant's own compromised mental health has meant that there are real and ongoing risk factors associated with the family’s circumstances. Mr Marr has urged me to have regard to the hardship that might be occasioned to the family by the penalty imposed upon the defendant.
	
	
	The general principle is that hardship to family and dependents may be an unavoidable consequence of a penalty imposed in sentence proceedings and is not to be regarded as a mitigating factor unless such hardship is exceptional. In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that it was only when circumstances were “highly exceptional” and where it would be inhumane to refuse to do so that hardship to others could be taken into account. It is part of the consequence of the duty of judicial officers to impose sentences upon offenders knowing that doing so will cause hardship to innocent parties. The question of whether hardship is truly, wholly or highly exceptional is one in respect of which reasonable minds may sometimes differ. In this case, however, and given all that this family has been subjected to, it is difficult to conceive of a sentencing court coming to a view different to that which I have reached.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the circumstances of the defendant's family are highly exceptional. I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate for me to take into account the hardship to them that might result from any penalty that is imposed upon the defendant.
	


Sentencing principles


	
	In sentencing for the offence of negligent driving occasioning death, the purposes of general deterrence, accountability, punishment and denunciation contained within s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 loom large. Offences such as this are often committed by persons of otherwise good character. The defendant is such a person. The position is however that prior good character is to be given less weight in cases where general deterrence is important, the offence is serious and the offence is one often committed by persons who are otherwise of good character: R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527. As I have earlier referred to, the fact that the Parliament has prescribed a penalty of imprisonment indicates its intention that the offence is to be regarded as a serious one. Further, there have over time been amendments made by the Parliament to the prescribed penalties for the offence so as to increase the maximum term of imprisonment available, and the maximum amount of fine that might be imposed. These increases in penalty mean that courts must reflect the parliamentary intention that more significant penalties ought to be imposed. The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Bonsu v R [2009] NSWCCA 316 (where the court was constituted by Howie J alone) makes it clear that real regard must be paid to the fact that the conduct for which the defendant is being sentenced resulted in the loss of life of another member of the community. His Honour remarked in that case (at [10]):
	


I have difficulty in understanding how s 10A or s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 can be used for such an offence.

I take this to be a clear exhortation as to how sentencing for these matters should be dealt with. Mr Marr submitted that I was not bound by what Justice Howie had said in Bonsu and that his remarks were obiter. He did concede that what his Honour had said was plainly persuasive. I note that a similar submission was made to Judge Henson, Chief Magistrate, in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Pelletier [2014] NSWLC 9. In response to that submission the Chief Magistrate had the following to say (at [52]):

The response of this Court is, and must be, that when the Court of Criminal Appeal expresses a view in relation to consistency on sentencing and identifies a lack of appropriateness in the penalties being imposed, it behoves an inferior court to take heed lest it creates an environment whereby a Crown appeal predicated on inadequacy of sentence becomes an inevitable consequence.

I respectfully agree with the Chief Magistrate. To the extent that Mr Marr submitted that this was a matter that could be dealt with by the imposition of a s 9 bond, I reject his submission.


	
	It is also necessary, consistent with s 3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to “recognise the harm done to the victim and the community”. The tragic reality of the motor vehicle accident in which the defendant was involved in on 23 August 2015 is that a 65 year old lady who was minding her own business and simply walking along a footpath has been killed. She was taken from her family suddenly and in a way which I accept has caused them enormous emotional pain. I have been provided with a Victim Impact Statement from Ms Zheng’s daughter Yu Chen. She describes her mother as a gentle woman who was “the spirit of our family” and says “We will always miss her”. The sudden loss of a loved one is a traumatic and devastating experience and one from which people often struggle to recover, and on behalf of the court and the community I express my heartfelt sympathy to Ms Zheng’s family. The harm which has been done to the victim’s family is an aspect of the harm done to the whole community, and it is appropriate to take that harm into account in determining sentence: Sumpton v R [2016] NSWCCA 162 (per Bellew J at [153], Hoeben CJ at CL and Hall J agreeing). Indeed, in my assessment it is not only appropriate to take such harm into account, it is positively necessary to do so.
	
	
	Mr Marr provided me with sentencing statistics for the offence as maintained by the Judicial Commission. The statistics provided by him for all offenders were for the period July 2013 to December 2015, a sample of 41 cases. A more meaningful consideration of the sentencing statistics for this offence can be garnered by a consideration of the penalties imposed for the same offence under the repealed s 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 for the 4 year period April 2012 to March 2016. The addition of both sets of statistics which cover in totality a period of 4 years provides a total cohort of 111 cases dealt with in the Local Court. An analysis of that total of cases indicates the following disposition of this particular offence during the stated period:
	



	
		
			
			Section 10 Dismissal
			
			
			1.8%
			
		
		
			
			Section 10 Bond
			
			
			9.0%
			
		
		
			
			Section 10 A   
			
			
			1.8%
			
		
		
			
			Fine only
			
			
			5.4%
			
		
		
			
			Section 9 Bond
			
			
			44.2%
			
		
		
			
			Community Service Order
			
			
			6.3%
			
		
		
			
			Suspended sentence
			
			
			19.8%
			
		
		
			
			Intensive Correction Order
			
			
			4.5%
			
		
		
			
			Home Detention
			
			
			2.7%
			
		
		
			
			Prison
			
			
			4.5%
			
		
	


Consistent with authority I will have cautious regard to these statistics: Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225. Sentencing statistics are a means of providing a court with a general indication of sentencing trends and standards and assist in promoting consistency. They are not some type of grid that dictates an outcome. Indeed in considering these particular statistics one is left to ponder as his Honour Magistrate Stewart did in NSW Police v Nash [2016] NSWLC 3 at [20], why it is that in post-Bonsu sentencing, more than half of all offenders are dealt with by sections 10 (either with or without a bond), 10A or 9, or by the imposition of a fine. While all cases are individual these statistics do seem at odds with the guidance provided by Howie J in Bonsu.

Conclusion


	
	This is a troubling and difficult case. Like so many cases of this type, one is left to consider the maxim “There but for the grace of God, go I”. All of us who are licensed to drive motor vehicles have at some time driven carelessly. Fortunately very few have had visited upon us and others, the catastrophic consequences of our carelessness such as are exhibited here. As Judge Henson, Chief Magistrate remarked in DPP v Pelletier (supra) at [43] when considering this issue: “This form of self-evaluation is not something that sits comfortably with the criminal law. Courts are required to apply the law not distort it”. The penalty to be imposed must reflect the tragedy arising from Ms Zheng’s death and must act as a deterrent to others. The message must be sent that if people drive negligently and other members of the community lose their lives, then significant punishments will result. I am of the view that the section 5 threshold has been crossed and that no penalty other than one involving custody ought to be imposed. There is no alternative reasonably available to the court noting that the Pre-Sentence Report indicates that the defendant is not suitable for a community service order. Consistent with R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 I must then determine the length of that sentence. Given my finding that the objective seriousness of the offending is at or just above the mid-range, and after allowing for the 25% discount and the defendant's overwhelming subjective case, I have determined that an appropriate sentence is one of 7 months imprisonment. I must now consider whether there is any alternative to that sentence being served in full time custody. I have concluded that given the defendant's background, his lack of any prior record, his real remorse, his ongoing mental health issues, the deprivation and hardship to which he and his family have been subjected and the hardship that would otherwise devolve to his family, that the sentence to be imposed can appropriately be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied that finalisation of the matter in this way will assist in the rehabilitation of the defendant and will also pay appropriate regard to all of the purposes of sentencing. I have noted and accept that the defendant is unlikely to benefit from Community Corrections supervision and that he has no identified criminogenic factors. I accept that this sentence involves a significant degree of leniency however in my view such leniency is warranted given the highly unusual and compelling subjective factors operating in the defendant's favour. To do otherwise than suspend the defendant's sentence would be to impose a penalty that did not reflect the totality and the humanity of the matter. I wish to also make clear that it is not my intention that the imposition of this penalty should impact adversely upon the defendant's visa status in this country.
	
	
	ORDERS:
	



	
	The defendant is convicted.
	
	
	He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 months. That sentence is to be suspended and the defendant is to be released from custody on condition that he enters into a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 7 months. The conditions of the bond are:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour and appear for sentence if called upon, and
	
	
	To notify the Registrar of this court of any change to his residential address.
	



	
	Further the defendant is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence pursuant to the road transport legislation for the automatic period of 3 years.

		07 November 2016",2016-09-15 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2863566,Hanna v R [2016] NSWDC 292,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence by Magistrate Barko sitting in the Waverley Local Court on 29 June 2016. The appellant was sentenced for six offences. In essence, the appellant was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment commencing on 23 May 2016, the date on which he was taken into custody, with a non‑parole period of seven months. The seven month non‑parole period is to expire on 22 December 2016.
	
	
	The appellant’s criminal history, whilst it might be thought to be long, contains a large number of relatively minor offences. The offences all appear to be related to a problem that the appellant has with addiction to illicit drugs. The drugs which have been mentioned during the course of this appeal are crystal methylamphetamine, or ice, and cannabis. The appellant was in gaol for eight months between 14 August 2015 and 11 April 2016. The first set of offences in respect of that period of imprisonment, were committed in 2014. The second period of that sentence commenced on 12 January 2016 and represented a sentence of nine months with a non‑parole period of three months. The non‑parole period of three months expired on 11 April 2016 when the appellant was released on parole. The current set of offences were committed whilst the offender was on parole on 23 May 2016. The sentences that commenced on 12 January 2016, were for custody of a knife for a second time, in a public place, larceny, possessing implements to enter or drive conveyance, and a further charge of larceny.
	
	
	The offences for which the appellant was sentence by Magistrate Barko, were, one count of possessing implements to drive or enter a conveyance, one count of custody of a knife in a public place, this being the third time that the appellant had committed that offence, and four counts of unlawfully obtaining goods. In respect of each of the unlawfully obtained goods charges, the learned magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment of four months. The maximum term that could be imposed was six months, and, accepting that the appellant pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity, which he did, the maximum that should have been imposed for each offence was four and a half months. When one considers what the goods obtained were, one can understand that the sentences imposed were excessive in the circumstances. He had in his possession, two New South Wales driver’s licences which had been stolen. They belonged to different persons. The third item was a St George Visa Debit Card belonging to a person from whom it had either been taken or misplaced but there was no suggestion that any attempt was ever made by the appellant to use that St George Visa Debit Card or to misuse either of the New South Wales driver’s licences.
	
	
	The fourth count of goods obtained was a large number of silver and “gold” coins, having a total value of $22.60. To go to gaol, for four months for $22.60 is, in this Court’s experience, excessive. The chattel that was the subject of the first charge, that of possessing an implement to enter or drive a conveyance, was a single socket described as being, “silver”, but probably meaning chrome plated, which had an hexagonal end but the edges of which socket were sharp and could be used for smashing windows of motor vehicles. The knife in question was in fact a multi‑tool, containing a number of knife blades amongst other tools probably, and one of the blades when extended could give the tool a total length of 16 centimetres. The appellant was picked up by the police because he acted suspiciously, in their experience, because when he saw them, he walked away from them.
	
	
	Courts are constantly told by Corrective Services that sentencing to imprisonment for less than six months, whilst it may have a punitive effect, does not carry with it any rehabilitative effect, because Corrective Services are unable to offer any courses if the period of custody is less than six months. Here there is a period of custody of seven months but thus far, the appellant has been to a large number of Corrective Services institutions since he has been admitted to the custody of Corrective Services on 24 May 2016. He has been at Parklea Correctional Centre, Kariong Correctional Centre, the Silverwater Metropolitan Correctional Centre, the South Coast Correctional Centre, the Bathurst Correctional Centre and the Oberon Correctional Centre, and has recently been returned to the Bathurst Correctional Centre, no doubt in order to facilitate his being transported to Sydney for the hearing of this appeal. In other words, little if any, rehabilitation could have been performed between 24 May 2016 and today’s date, 19 September 2016, a period of four months almost.
	
	
	I am afraid that the current sentence, although perhaps constructed with the best of intentions, will not offer any rehabilitation to the current offender. Objectively, the sentences are severe and will not provide to the appellant any rehabilitation. What he really needs is rehabilitation from his illicit drug addiction. Through his counsel, he tells me that he realises this, as do his parents with whom he lives. On his release from custody, he will seek his own drug rehabilitation regime if none can be provided to him by Community Corrections whilst at liberty, and furthermore, his parents have insisted that he engage in drug rehabilitation as a condition of staying with them. He has also been offered an apprenticeship as an electrician which, together with drug rehabilitation, would put the appellant on the track to becoming a valued and worthwhile member of our community.
	
	
	I have formed the view that I should allow the appellant to be released from custody after four months and that he shall spend the following eight months on parole, in the expectation that he engage in drug rehabilitation. I am also of the view that the longer sentence should be imposed, not for the crime of possessing implements to enter or driver a conveyance, but rather the offence of having a custody of a knife in a public place, that being the third time on which that offence had been committed.
	
	
	For those reasons, I set aside the sentence passed by the Local Court at Waverley on 29 June 2016 in respect of sequence 1. In lieu thereof, I sentence the appellant to imprisonment for four months, commencing on 23 May 2016 and expiring on 22 September 2016.
	
	
	I set aside the sentence imposed by the Local Court at Waverley on 29 June 2016, in respect of sequence 5. I sentence the appellant to imprisonment for 12 months. I fix a non‑parole period of four months, commencing on 23 May 2016 and expiring on 22 September 2016. The further period of imprisonment is eight months which will expire on 22 May 2017. It is a condition of the offender’s release on parole that he obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service, with regard to alcohol and other drug rehabilitation, counselling and testing, including attending any residential rehabilitation course that may be offered to him.
	
	
	Any other orders sought?
	
	
	JAEGER: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I confirm the rest of the sentences.

		08 November 2016",2016-09-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2863567,R v Droudis (No. 12) [2016] NSWSC 1330,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has tendered a statement dated 18 December 2013 of Sergeant Phillip Buchardt (MFI9), and an Eagle.i Investigator's Note said to have been created by Sergeant Buchardt on 22 May 2013 (MFI8). Objection has been taken on behalf of the Accused to the tender of these documents.
	
	
	The statement of Sergeant Buchardt relates to an occasion on the evening of 21 April 2013 when he and Senior Constable Megan Cox (now Oxley) attended premises at Belmore, and spoke to John Aspros, the brother of the Accused. Both Senior Constable Oxley (T165ff) and John Aspros (T341ff) have given evidence in the trial of this event.
	
	
	The Court has given several interlocutory judgments on issues concerning Mr Aspros and his evidence: R v Droudis (No. 4) [2016] NSWSC 1150; R v Droudis (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 1211; R v Droudis (No. 6) [2016] NSWSC 1263.
	
	
	Sergeant Buchardt is seriously ill and is not in a position to attend Court to give evidence (Exhibit AG). It is common ground that Sergeant Buchardt is “unavailable” for the purpose of s.65 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender MFIs 8 and 9 to establish what Mr Aspros said to police on the evening of 21 April 2013 and, in particular, that part of Sergeant Buchardt's statement where he states that during this conversation, Mr Aspros was asked words to the effect, ""How long is it since you've seen Anastasia?"", and Mr Aspros replied to the effect, ""The last time I saw her was last Friday, at the market”.
	
	
	The Crown seeks, under s.65(2), that the hearsay rule not apply to Sergeant Buchardt's account that Mr Aspros said this on 21 April 2013.
	
	
	An issue arose as to whether the asserted fact contained in the tendered representation constituted first or second-hand hearsay. The Crown seeks to tender the evidence as truth of the fact that Mr Aspros said words to the effect, ""The last time I saw her was last Friday, at the market”. I accept that this tender involves first-hand hearsay. It concerns the personal knowledge of Sergeant Buchardt of an asserted fact. His knowledge is based upon what he saw and heard at the time when Mr Aspros spoke to him: s.62(1) and (2) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	In Sio v The Queen [2016] HCA 32, the High Court of Australia said at [55]:
	


“It is evident that ss.62 and 65(1) are concerned to relax the exclusionary effect of the hearsay rule in relation to an assertion of a fact by a person who had personal knowledge of that fact. These provisions proceed on the assumption that the asserted fact is relevant to the case of the party seeking to adduce evidence of the representation asserting the fact.”


	
	Their Honours emphasised in Sio v The Queen, at [56]-[57], that when the provision speaks of a “representation”, it speaks of the particular representation that asserts a relevant fact sought to be proved. It was emphasised (at [57]) that identification is required of the particular representation to be adduced as evidence as proof of the fact.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the tender in this case satisfied the requirements of s.65(2)(b) or (c). It was submitted for the Accused that neither requirement was met in this case.
	
	
	The subparagraphs of s.65(2) are expressed in the alternative. As to s.65(2)(b), I note that Sergeant Buchardt made a record of what was said by Mr Aspros in shorter form in the Eagle.i Investigator’s Note of 22 May 2013 (MFI8). This was made about one month after the event. The circumstances in which that note was made make it, in my view, unlikely that the representation is a fabrication. It is appropriate to take into account, in this respect, the notebook entry of Senior Constable Oxley made on the evening of 21 April 2013 (part Exhibit AH). I am satisfied that the requirements of s.65(2)(b) have been met.
	
	
	As to s.65(2)(c), I am satisfied as well that the representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable. In this regard, I take into account as well the notebook entry of Senior Constable Oxley and her evidence on this aspect.
	
	
	The effect of this ruling is that the statement and Investigator's Note of Sergeant Buchardt will be admitted. In particular, the hearsay rule will not apply (under s.65(2)) to the evidence of Sergeant Buchardt as to what Mr Aspros said to him about the last time he (Mr Aspros) saw the Accused. That evidence will be admitted as truth of the fact that Mr Aspros said words to that effect to Sergeant Buchardt on this occasion.
	
	
	MFIs 8 and 9 will be admitted into evidence on this basis.

		07 November 2016",2016-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2863568,Barris v R [2016] NSWDC 291,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence passed by Magistrate Richardson sitting in the Local Court at Sutherland on 19 May 2016. The appellant was charged with an offence contrary to s 54(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013. The formal charge was that on 24 March 2016 at Rockdale he did drive a motor vehicle on a road during a period of disqualification, he being a person who was disqualified from holding a driver’s licence. The appellant pleaded guilty to that offence but at the time of sentence was unrepresented. He was sentenced to imprisonment for four months.
	
	
	The appellant’s driving record is, putting it in very blunt terms, appalling. He has previously been disqualified from driving on a number of occasions, including disqualifications imposed by the courts. He was disqualified from driving by the Downing Centre Local Court on 6 March 2013 following upon a conviction for a mid-range PCA offence. He was also disqualified from driving by a sentence passed by the Blacktown Local Court on 17 March 2014. He was also disqualified from driving for a further offence of driving whilst disqualified by the Local Court at Kogarah on 6 May 2014. The appellant then drove a motor vehicle on a public street on 24 March 2016 prior to his last disqualification period expiring.
	
	
	The appellant, however, gives extenuating circumstances for the circumstances of his driving whilst disqualified. On the morning of 24 March 2016 he, together with a driver, drove a truck to a mechanic’s workshop on West Botany Street at Rockdale for service and to obtain a pink slip inspection certificate because the registration was probably overdue. Later in the day he received a phone call from the repairer indicating that the truck was ready to be collected ahead of schedule. At the time the appellant was buying groceries at a supermarket using a bicycle as his means of transport. He then drove to the mechanic’s workshop, placed his bicycle in the back of the truck, placed his groceries in the front cabin of the truck and proceeded to drive along West Botany Street back to his place of work when he was pulled over by the police moments after leaving the mechanic’s workshop. He admitted that he was driving whilst unlicensed and that he was driving whilst the vehicle had not yet been re‑registered or reinsured. Police described him at the time as a “moron” and perhaps with the benefit of hindsight he would so describe himself.
	
	
	For this repeated breach of court imposed disqualification periods I am confident that the appellant realises that the courts have little option but to sentence to imprisonment. The only problem in the current matter is that the appellant is a sole parent, sole guardian and carer of a son, and has been for the last four years. There was no suggestion that his son’s mother is a person who could now care for him, bearing in mind that for the last four years the appellant has looked after his now eight year old son by himself.
	
	
	In a letter addressed to the presiding magistrate at the Sutherland Local Court the appellant explained his personal circumstances completely and adequately. Since the appellant appeared before the Local Court he has again gone to Community Corrections and obtained a report saying that he can now reliably nominate one day each week to perform community service work should the Court sentence him to a community service order.
	
	
	Some form of custodial sentence is appropriate. A community service order is an alternative to full-time custody and indeed an alternative to other forms of custody. A community service order will bring home to the appellant the fact that he must pay for his crimes against the community and since it must necessarily be pursued over a long period of time will reinforce in his mind the need to stay away from cars and other forms of transport whilst disqualified.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the sentence passed by the Local Court at Sutherland on 19 May 2016. I am satisfied on the matters referred to in s 86 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have had regard to the contents of an assessment report which states that the offender is suitable for community work. Andrew Barris, I sentence you to 200 hours community service. You are to report to the community service organiser at Hurstville within seven days.
	
	
	You are disqualified from driving for two years from the last date. There is nothing I can do about that, Mr Barris.

 1.
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 There were two related actions heard together. The first was a criminal revision brought by the petitioners. The petitioners were SM Summit Holdings Ltd and Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd. SM Summit Holdings (Summit Holdings) is a holding company listed on the SESDAQ. Summit CD Manufacture (Summit CD) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Summit Holdings. Summit CD carries on the business of manufacturing and replicating Compact Discs (CDs). The CDs include audio CDs, video CDs and CD-ROMs. The second action was a criminal motion where the counsel for Business Software Alliance (BSA) made an application to the High Court for an order that BSA be allowed to make copies of documents seized pursuant to a search warrant granted on 12 August 1997, and for the delivery by Summit Holdings and Summit CD ofcopies of various documents enumerated in the notice of the motion. I shall first address the criminal revision.
 2.
 Criminal Revision No 15 of 1997 
 
The complainants were representatives from Business Software Alliance. Very little information has been made available about BSA other than that it is a company incorporated in the United States of America, and is set up as a watchdog to combat software piracy. Its members comprise the leading software companies, including Microsoft Inc, Adobe Systems Inc and Autodesk Inc. BSA is not registered with the Registry of Companies in Singapore; only its representative office in Singapore is registered with the Trade Development Board. On 8 August 1997, a representative from BSA made a complaint against Summit Holdings and Summit CD of alleged copyright and trade mark infringements before the magistrate Shireen Tan, and applied for two search warrants in respect of the premises of Summit Holdings and Summit CD. Both Summit Holdings and Summit CD have their premises at 45 Ubi Road 1, Singapore. The magistrate granted two search warrants: (1) search warrant no 132/97 pursuant to s 62 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) (the trade marks warrant) and (2) search warrant no 236A/97 pursuant to s 136(9) Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Ed) (the copyright warrant).
 3.On 12 August 1997, at about 2pm, a raid was conducted at the premises by representatives of BSA, police officers, and solicitors from the law firm of Alban Tay Mahtani and de Silva, numbering about 35. There was no resistance. The staff of Summit Holdings and Summit CD let them in. On the same day at about 11pm, while the raid was still going on, the representatives of BSA and their solicitors decided to apply for a search warrant to search and seize the documents discovered. They appeared before GP Selvam J at his residence and the learned judge granted the search warrant pursuant to s 61 CPC (the third warrant). The raid continued all the way until about 5.10 am on the following morning.
 4.The raid yielded only five CD-ROMs alleged to contain copyright infringing programmes, a stamper and two glass masters alleged to be used for the purposes of replicating CD-ROMs. In addition, a large quantity of documents was seized. They included internal memoranda of the staff, minutes and notes of meetings, invoices, sales orders and a log-book. A list recording some of the petitioners` customers which was allegedly downloaded from the computer system of the petitioners and was seized.
 5.On 29 August 1997, the Attorney General`s Chambers granted a fiat to counsel for the respondents, Mr VK Rajah SC and Mr Kenneth Tan SC, to defend the proceedings brought in the criminal revision.
 6.The petitioners applied to the High Court to quash the three search warrants. After hearing counsel for both sides, I quashed the third warrant and dismissed the application in relation to the first and second warrants. I now set out my grounds.
 7.I would make a preliminary point on the manner in which the searches were carried out. All the search warrants executed in this case gave rise to some considerable concern and I would to draw this matter to the attention of theappropriate authorities. The manner in which the search warrants were executed is not relevant to the present proceedings which concern the validity of the search warrants. However, during the course of the hearing, extensive complaints were made as to the manner in which they were executed, and this is something which ought to be addressed. This is an unsatisfactory case and the origin of the case arose from a situation which is regrettably not uncommon. In many such cases, similar complaints are made as to the manner in which the search warrants are executed. It would lead to an intolerable situation if further checks are not put in place in both the issue and execution of search warrants. This case also illustrates the drawbacks of the existing practice of relying on the criminal process as a means to enforce intellectual property rights. If the copyright and trade mark owners had proceeded on their civil remedies only, and applied for an Anton Piller order as a means to obtain incriminating evidence, various safeguards would have been available not only in the Supreme Court Practice Directions, but also in existing case law.
 8.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
BSA became suspicious that the Summit group of companies was involved in software piracy and instructed HS Intellectual Property Services, a firm of private investigators, to conduct investigations into the activities of Summit Holdings and Summit CD. In addition, BSA also received information from two former employees of Summit CD that Summit CD was manufacturing counterfeit CD-ROMs which infringed the copyright and trademarks belonging to the BSA members. The two employees were Pan Wen Hui (Pan), an operator with Summit CD from July 1995 to September 1996, and Shi Jian Chuan (Shi), an operator with Summit CD from April 1996 to April 1997, who was replicating CD-ROMs and was later appointed as a Quality Control Auditor. Both employees were no longer with Summit CD at the time of their complaints.
 9.The prosecution alleged that the modus operandi was as follows: Summit CD, under contracts with certain shady customers, notably those who had previous convictions for software piracy, would manufacture masters from the masters provided by the customers. A master is the original computer programme from which copies are made. The master is read by the machines and the computer programmes contained in them are ultimately impressed onto a metal disc known as a stamper. The stamper is like a mould which can be used to replicate CD-ROMs. A master can also be duplicated into another master. All the CD-ROMs manufactured pursuant to legitimate contracts would be impressed with three identification codes: the bar code, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI) Code and the Summit code (the SM code) for the purpose of identification of the manufacturer. However, for customers engaged in the counterfeiting of CD-ROMs, on their request, Summit CD would manufacture masters which were specially constructed, such that the CD-ROMs which were replicated from the masters would not bear the SM code. Neither would the infringing copies contain the other codes. This would then make it very difficult to trace the origins of the counterfeit CDs to the petitioners. The period of counterfeiting was alleged to go as far as back as 1995.
 10.On the part of BSA, to verify its suspicions, a private investigator from HSIntellectual Property Services called Jimmy Chew Chong Poh met Tan Siang Yong, the assistant general manager of Summit Holdings on 16 April 1997, and asked him to manufacture a master for each of eight various masters of CD-ROMs which Jimmy Chew handed over. Unknown to Tan Siang Yong, four of the CD-ROMs contained programmes which infringed the copyright and trademark of Microsoft, Autodesk and Adobe. The price of the masters to be produced was agreed at $500 per master. On 19 April 1997, the private investigator met Tan Siang Yong to collect the masters at the premises of Summit Holdings and paid $4,000 for all the masters.
 11.Pan and Shi in turn handed over to BSA a computer diskette which contained a list of Summit`s customers. They claimed that, in the case of Summit`s legitimate customers, the list showed that their orders would be accompanied by the relevant Summit code, which would be impressed on the CD-ROM when manufactured. However, in the case of the other customers who were known retailers of counterfeit software, their orders would not be accompanied by any Summit code. For this category of customers, their manufactured masters were classified as `C` category.
 12.On 8 August 1997, Lee Cross, managing director for the Asia-Pacific of BSA, on behalf of BSA, filed a complaint before a magistrate, alleging that the senior management of Summit CD and Summit Holdings engaged in the large scale manufacture of counterfeit CD-ROMs and hence contravened s 136 Copyright Act and s 62 Trade Marks Act. Supporting the complaint were the statutory declarations of Jimmy Chew, Pan and Shi. The contents of the complaints and the statutory declarations were important and I shall set them out.
 13.The statutory declaration of Jimmy Chew set out the details of the transaction between himself and Tan Siang Yong. He deposed that he met Tan Siang Yong at the premises of Summit Holdings on 16 April 1997 and he entered into a contract with Tan Siang Yong for Summit CD to replicate eight different counterfeit masters of CD-ROMs. He did not tell Tan Siang Yong that they were counterfeit masters. The price was agreed at $4,000 for all the eight masters. The masters had serial numbers 0123 to 0127, and 1123 to 1125 and the same serial numbers were to be imprinted on the replicated CDs. Three days later, Tan Siang Yong handed to Jimmy Chew the eight masters which had been manufactured, and also returned the eight masters he had been given. The agreed price was paid by Jimmy Chew. These CDs were handed over to a representative of BSA and were subsequently confirmed to contain infringing copies of programmes belonging to Adobe, Autodesk and Microsoft. A letter from BSA confirming that the masters were counterfeit products was annexed to the complaint.
 14.Pan and Shi deposed in their statutory declarations as to how they came into possession of information that the petitioners were involved in software piracy. Pan deposed that, during the course of his employment, he saw a large number of counterfeit software titles and counterfeit CD-ROM compilation titles (which are compilations of various programmes found on CDs), and a large number of pornographic video CDs. Shi deposed that, during the course of his employment, he saw that Summit CD was manufacturing masters for counterfeit CD-ROMs. In addition, he saw a large amount of pornography and pirated video CDs andmovies. The masters for the pirated CD-ROMs would be replicated on the machines which did not contain an IFPI code. All the illegitimate CD-ROM production were classified as category `C`. In or around September 1996, when the IFPI conducted inspection visits of the factory at Summit CD, all the workers were told to cease production of CDs in category `C`. Once the inspection visits were over, the replication of pirated CD-ROMs resumed. Shi also deposed that he copied onto a floppy disk one of the documents containing a list of the customers, and the masters produced for the customers, from a computer at the premises. This was annexed to his statutory declaration. Shi`s account of the circumstances of his leaving Summit CD was very scanty. He only said that he informed the company in March 1997 that he wanted to resign but the company refused to let him leave. The computer department then transferred him to the computer department to persuade him to stay. Eventually, when Summit CD realized that he was determined to leave, he was allowed to resign and leave on 30 April 1997.
 15.On the basis of the complaints and the three statutory declarations, the magistrate granted the first and second search warrants pursuant to s 62 CPC and s 136(9) Copyright Act.
 16.
 The petitioners` case 
 
The petitioners denied that they had been engaged in copyright and trademark related offences. They denied that the transaction between Tan Siang Yong and Jimmy Chew had ever taken place. Counsel for the petitioners listed the extensive checks and controls that existed in the operations of Summit CD to ensure that they did not inadvertently infringe copyright belonging to any software companies.
 17.There was no dispute that the petitioners had a category `C` classification of CDs which they manufactured at all material times. However, they denied that the category was utilised for manufacturing counterfeit CDs. They contended that they have categories `A`, `B` and `C` CD-ROMs. Category `A` CD-ROMs have the SM and the IFPI codes and they are manufactured for the large international customers. Category `B` CD-ROMs are for the smaller customers. The `C` category of CD-ROMs are recordings of poor quality and the customers are either first-time customers or poor paymasters.
 18.There is no requirement in law as to the necessity of imprinting all CD-ROMs with the IFPI code or the code of the manufacturer.
 19.The petitioners therefore challenged the validity of all three search warrants on various grounds.
 20.
 The issues in the criminal revision 
 
I shall set out the main issues before the court in determining whether the two warrants granted by the magistrate and the third warrant granted by GP Selvam J were valid. First, whether the information that was laid before the magistrate, and in particular the three statutory declarations, was sufficient to constitute reasonable cause to justify the granting of the search warrants under s 62 CPC and s 136(9) Copyright Act. Secondly, whether the third warrant was validly grantedby a High Court judge, and, if so, whether the information before the High Court judge was sufficient to constitute reasonable cause. I shall also consider whether the analogous duty on the part of the applicants in ex parte applications in civil proceedings applies equally to making complaints before the magistrate. Thirdly, in the event that any or all of the search warrants are quashed, whether the police are obliged to return all the items and documents seized.
 21.
 The copyright warrant and the trade mark warrant 
 
The material parts of the copyright warrant issued pursuant to s 136(9) Copyright Act provided as follows: 
To the Commissioner of Police of the Republic of Singapore and Inspector Wilfred Adrian Nathan, Inspector Mak Kum Kay, Inspector Linda Lee Sok Ying, Inspector Lim Kim Choo, Inspector Segathesan Kannapan and all other persons in the attached list, Whereas information has been laid (or complaint has been made) before me of the commission (or suspected commission) of the offence of s 136 of the Copyright Act, and it has been made to appear to me that the production of the articles specified in the schedule below is essential to the inquiry now being made (or about to be made) into the said offence (or suspected offence): This is to authorise and require you to search for and seize the said articles specified in the schedule and any storage medium containing infringing copies as set out in the schedule and any plates or contrivance used or intended to be used for making infringing copies of the programs as set out in the schedule below in 45, Ubi Road 1, Singapore 408696 and, if found, to produce the same forthwith before the subordinate court at Havelock Square returning this warrant with an indorsement certifying what you have done under it, immediately upon its execution.
 22.The material provisions in the trade mark warrant issued pursuant to s 62 CPC were as follows:
To the Commissioner of Police of the Republic of Singapore and Inspector Segathesan Kannapan , Inspector Linda Lee Sok Ying, Inspector Mak Kum Kay, Inspector Wilfred Adrian Nathan, Inspector Lim Kim Choo, and to all persons in the attached list, Whereas I have received information and on due inquiry thereupon had I have been led to believe that 45, Ubi Road 1, Singapore 408696 (the premises) is manufacturing and dealing in products infringing the Registered Trade Marks `Autodesk`, `Autocad`, `Adobe`, `Adobe Premier` and `Microsoft` (the trade marks) and therefore contravening ss 70, 72 and 73 of the Trade Marks Act. This is to authorise and require you to enter the said premises with such assistance as shall be required and to use if necessary reasonable force for that purpose and to search every part of the said premises and to seize and take possession of any goods to which the counterfeit trade marks are applied to, documents including electronic and/or computer data whether stored in a computer system, CD-ROM, diskette, server or otherwise howsoever and the medium in which such documents and/or data is stored and which is the subject of an offence or offences under the Trade Marks Act, and forthwith to bring them before a magistrate`s court or to guard them on the spot until the offender is taken before a magistrate`s court or otherwise to dispose thereof in some place of safety; returning this warrant immediately upon its execution with an indorsement certifying what you have done thereunder.
 23.A identical list of products of `Adobe`, `Autodesk`, `Microsoft` was attached to each of the search warrants.
 24.Section 136(9) Copyright Act provides that: 
If information is given upon oath to a Magistrate that there is reasonable cause for suspecting that there are in any house, premises, vessel or other place any infringing copies of a work or other subject-matter in which copyright subsists (or any plate or contrivance used or intended to be used for making such infringing copies or capable of being used for the purpose of making such infringing copies) by means of or in relation to which any offence under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) has been committed, he may issue a warrant under his hand by virtue of which any police officer named or referred to in the warrant may enter the house, premises, vessel or other place and search for and seize any such copy, plate or contrivance...
 25.Section 62 CPC provides that:
If a Magistrate`s Court upon information and after such inquiry as it thinks necessary has reason to believe that any place is used -
(a) for the deposit or sale of stolen property or of property unlawfully obtained or of goods in respect of which an offence has been committed under sections 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74 of the Trade Marks Act ...; the Court may by warrant authorise the person to whom it is directed to:
(i) enter that place with such assistance as may be required; 
(ii) search it in the manner, if any, specified in the warrant; 
(iii) take possession of any goods, property, documents, seals, stamps, coins or trade marks found in it which he reasonably suspects to be the subject of an offence committed under sections 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74 of the Trade Marks Act ... or to be stolen, unlawfully obtained, forged, false or counterfeit and also of any such instruments and materials as aforesaid;
 ...
 26.What the magistrate had before her was the complaint by Lee Cross, the three statutory declarations by Jimmy Chew, Pan and Shi, as well as a document which was allegedly printed from the computer server system of the petitioners and supplied by Shi.
 27.
 Validity of the search warrants 
 
Under s 136(9) of the Copyright Act, there must be reasonable cause for suspecting that there are in the premises infringing copies of CDs in which copyright subsists by means of or in relation to which an offence under s 136(1), (2), (3) or (4) has been committed. In the case of s 62 CPC, the requirement is that the magistrate has upon information after inquiry and reason to believe that a place is used for the sale or storage of goods in respect of which a trade mark offence has been committed. The question is whether on the basis of the information before the magistrate, she was entitled to grant the two search warrants.
 28.There is a distinction between the two tests: one under s 136(9) Copyright Act and one under s 62 CPC. Suspicion is of a lower order than belief. It is curious why the standards for trade mark and copyright offences differ since, in every case of an alleged intellectual property offence, both provisions will inevitably be called into play. There is no reason why one should receive more extensive protection than the other. However, on the facts, this may not be a significant point since the same facts usually disclose whether there are offences committed together under the Trade Marks Act or Copyright Act.
 29.It is undisputed that the test whether the words `has reasonable cause to believe` or `reasonable cause to suspect` mean the existence of reasonable grounds or reasonable cause as the case may be at the time is an objective one: 
 Nakkuda Ali v MF de S Jayaratne 
 
[1951] AC 66
; 
 IRC v Rossminster 
 
[1980] AC 952
.
 30.I now address the question of what amounts to reasonable cause to believe or reasonable cause to suspect. This is the problem of reconciling the two competing and conflicting public interests, viz that offences involving infringement of intellectual property rights should be detected and punished, and that the right of the individual to the protection of the law from unjustified interference with his private property should be upheld. It is clear that `reasonable cause` is less than showing what is required under s 189 CPC, as interpreted in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
; [1980_1981] SLR 73. Section 189(1) provides that, at the close of the prosecution case, the court has to call the accused to enter on his defence if it finds that a case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction. In 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, Lord Diplock held at p 52 that:
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1) [now s 189(1)]. Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such argument sand comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
 31.Haw Tua Tau has been affirmed in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Ng Theng Shuang v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
. At the stage of the application for a search warrant, when no charges are not even brought against the accused, it is inappropriate for the test to be pitched at the Haw Tua Tau level, which is the test to be taken at the close of a prosecution case. However, the magistrate in exercising discretion cannot simply accept the statement of the complainant or informant as true unquestioningly.
 32.In 
 Shaaban bin Hussein v Chong Fook Kam 
 
[1970] AC 942
, Lord Devlin held that at p 949:
There is another distinction between reasonable suspicion and prima facie proof. Prima facie proof consists of admissible evidence. Suspicion can take into account matters that could not be put in evidence at all. ... Suspicion can take into account also matters which, though admissible, could not form part of a prima facie case ...
 33.It is clear that reasonable cause may take into account matters which could not be put into evidence at all or matters which, although admissible, would not on their own prove the case. The reasonable cause must appear from the information.
 34.The material information before the magistrate at the time of the issue of thesearch warrants comprised the three statutory declarations and the list of documents purportedly obtained from the premises of Summit CD. The statutory declarations of Pan and Shi were unsatisfactory in many respects. The statutory declaration of Pan did not set out the circumstances of his leaving Summit CD. It merely stated his period of employment in Summit CD. It subsequently transpired that Pan was in fact dismissed from Summit CD for dishonesty; he had forged the death certificate of his grandfather in order to obtain leave to return to China. Pan did not deny the forgery in his affidavit. In the case of Shi, his statutory declaration was very scanty as to why he left the employment of Summit CD. The petitioners alleged that they had allowed Shi to terminate his employment before the contractual period came to an end because he was diagnosed as having a mental illness. In an affidavit filed in response to the allegations made by the petitioners in the petition, Shi deposed that he was unhappy generally with his employment as an operator rather than as an engineer, he suffered from insomnia and had consulted a social worker and a psychiatrist who recommended that Summit CD allow him to resign.
 35.Irrespective of the various versions of the circumstances in which Pan and Shi left the employment of Summit CD, it remained that the magistrate was not fully apprised of the fact that both of them left Summit CD under unhappy circumstances. Potentially the two former employees would have a grudge against their employers since their leaving was acrimonious. This fact would have been very relevant, and perhaps even decisive, at the time when the magistrate had to consider whether the two informants were to be believed. In determining whether a reasonable belief exists in respect of the offences, it is necessary for the magistrate to assess the veracity or credibility of the deponents of the evidence. The petitioners argued that there was a duty of full and frank disclosure on the part of the complainants, relying on 
 R v Curran and Torney 
 [1983] 2 VR 133, a decision of McGarrie J and on Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry and Seizure (1986) at pp 90-91.
 36.In civil proceedings, the ex parte interlocutory applications before the judge in the case of Anton Piller and Mareva orders require the counsel for the applicants to put forward all material facts, including facts which are not in their favour. Ex parte proceedings are an exception to the general rule that the other side which is going to be affected by any ruling made has to be heard. Failure to do so can lead to the setting aside of the order irrespective of the merits of the case: see eg 
 Bengawan Solo v Season Confectionery 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 617
. However, the position taken in 
 R v Curran and Torney 
 has not been followed in Federal Court decisions in 
 Lego Australia v Paraggio 
 (1994) 124 ALR 225, and in 
 Flanagan & Ors; Robert Charles Howard & Bruno Grollo v Commrs of Australia Federal Police & Ors 
 (8 January 1996) (unreported). In Lego Australia, it was held that there was no requirement to make full and frank disclosure in the ex parte application for the search warrants if this was not imposed by statute. The question of validity of search warrants is one of statutory construction and public law. The reason given is that the criminal process is different from the pursuance of the private interest. In the criminal process, the source of the information to the police may have to be protected, and it is difficult for the police to show that the information is reliable when they wish for various reasons to keep the identity of the informant confidential or when they it wish to withhold evidence tending to reveal the identity of the informant. The duty of full and frank disclosure is therefore not imposed save where the legislation imposes such a duty. Lego Australia left open the issue whether a warrant would be set aside, as in any other administrative decision where there has been fraud or misrepresentation.
 37.The petitioners rely on two Canadian cases, 
 R v Latimer 
 (7 March 1997) (unreported) (Lexis Transcript) and 
 R v Ryckman 
 (5 December 1996) (unreported) (Lexis Transcript). The latter case is more concerned with the sufficiency of the evidence and does not advance their case very much further. In 
 Latimer 
, the court quashed the search warrant on the ground that the representations in the `information to obtain a search warrant` were misleading and incorrect and did not represent the actual state of knowledge of the officer at the time he swore the information. However, Latimer can be distinguished; under the Canadian Narcotic Act, the officer has to indicate to the judge that there is narcotic before the search warrant is issued. The officer had deliberately given misleading information to the judge as to the tip which he received from the informers and the court quashed the search warrant. In such cases, it is incumbent for the officer to ascertain his facts before the search warrant is granted.
 38.On the other hand, this can lead to an unsatisfactory state of affairs. In the present proceedings, it was quite clear that the criminal process was used to obtain evidence for pending civil proceedings; these were de facto civil proceedings. It must be recognised that it is very different when police officers and other law enforcement officers apply for a search warrant instead of private complainants. In the case of law enforcement officers, they are generally perceived by the courts to be neutral. The same cannot be said of private individuals making complaints. The very rationale for full and frank disclosure in civil proceedings would apply with equal force. If the terms of the provisions are reconsidered by Parliament, it may be desirable that Parliament impose a duty of full and frank disclosure in cases where search warrants are sought by private complainants.
 39.Even if there was no duty of full and frank disclosure imposed in the application for a search warrant, the question remained whether the magistrate should have inquired further into the reliability of the two deponents, and if necessary questioned the deponents under oath. On the face of the two statutory declarations, questions were raised as to their inherent reliability. The document which Shi claimed to have been printed from the computer server of Summit CD purported to show that the petitioners were involved in large scale counterfeiting of CD-ROMs, in that the illegitimate customers would not bear the IFPI code or the SM code. But it was nowhere deposed in his statutory declaration or the complaint that there was a requirement for CD manufacturers to do so on all CD-ROMs. In fact there was no such requirement. This case was on the borderline, and on balance I was of the view that the two statutory declarations and the document would constitute sufficient information for the magistrate to act accordingly.
 40.
 The statutory declaration of Jimmy Chew 
 
I had considerable misgivings over the way in which the private investigatorJimmy Chew went around procuring his evidence. This was a case where the creativity of the private investigator knew no bounds in trying to secure a conviction. He freely admitted in his statutory declaration that he in effect procured an offence on the part of the petitioners. The petitioners in fact disputed the very existence of the transaction between him and Tan Siang Yong. It was impossible to decide on the affidavit evidence whether the alleged transaction did indeed take place. In my view, a magistrate or any court hearing an application for a search warrant should not have accepted his evidence. There was really no justification for a search warrant to be granted on that account. What Jimmy Chew did in procuring the infringement of the copyright or trade mark was tantamount to a criminal offence under the relevant legislation. What was more alarming was that BSA had been advised by their solicitors to rely on his evidence to support a complaint. The solicitors should have shown greater circumspection.
 41.This was not the usual case of entrapment in the form of a trap purchase, where a law enforcement officer who is out to trap a seller of counterfeit products pretends to be a genuine purchaser and purchases a counterfeit product. In such a case the illegality is only in relation to the means of proof of the offence already committed. What Jimmy Chew did here was to bring eight counterfeit masters and ask the petitioners to replicate them. The petitioners did in fact replicate the masters and, on that basis, the complaint was made that the petitioners were engaged in counterfeiting CDs. This was a clear case where the illegality preceded the crime and was designed to bring about the commission of the crime. Worse still, there was no allegation that Tan Siang Yong was told by Jimmy Chew that the masters were counterfeit and that he still chose to proceed to manufacture the masters.
 42.The petitioners naturally objected strongly to the manner in which the evidence was procured. The prosecution relied on 
 R v Sang 
 
[1980] AC 402
 and 
 Kuruma v R 
 
[1955] AC 197
 to argue that entrapment was not a defence under Singapore law. In addition they relied on 
 Heng Lee Handbags & Anor v PP 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 760
. However, Sang is not of universal application in all cases of illegally obtained evidence. In my opinion Sang has been cited too frequently by the prosecution in an attempt to admit any evidence which is illegally or improperly obtained without any real consideration as to its underlying principles. There are several distinguishing features between Sang and the present case. First, as alluded to earlier, this was not a typical case of illegality in obtaining the evidence of a crime already committed but a case where the illegality procured the very offence. Secondly, Sang was a decision involving the alleged illegality on the part of the police or law enforcement officers; but this was a case of an illegality on the part of a private investigator. Thirdly, Sang concerned the admissibility of evidence, not whether one was entitled to retain the evidence after an illegal search warrant. It was unfortunate that there was no full argument presented to the court on this point in Heng Lee Handbags.
 43.Sang and the line of Singapore cases following Sang (eg 
 PP v Rozman bin Jusoh and Razali bin Mat Zin 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 317
, 
 Ajmer Singh v PP 
 
[1986] SLR 454
, 
 Chan Chi Pun v PP 
[1994] 2 SLR 61
; 
 How Poh Sun v PP 
 
[1991] SLR 220
) have held that entrapment is not a substantive defence to a charge of a criminal offence. This is not surprising since it is a central thesis of our criminal law that aperson who voluntarily, and with the necessary intent, commits all the elements of a criminal offence is guilty of that offence, regardless of whether he was induced to act by another, whether a private citizen or a law enforcement officer. And that is so even if the inducement involved criminal conduct on the part of the law enforcement officer. Where that is so, the result is not that the induced person is not guilty of the crime. It is that the law enforcement officer is also guilty of an offence.
 44.That does not dispose of the matter since a question arises as to whether the court has a discretion to exclude evidence which is obtained by unlawful means. Lord Goddard CJ in Kuruma held that:
No doubt in a criminal case the judge always has a discretion to disallow evidence if the strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly against the accused. This was emphasised in the case before this board of 
 Noor Mohammed v Regem
 and in the recent case in the House of Lords, Harris v Director of Public Prosecutions. If, for instance, some admission of some piece of evidence, eg, a document, had been obtained from a defendant by a trick, no doubt the judge might properly rule it out.
 45.After Sang, at common law, the position is that, outside confessions and evidence analogous to confessions, there is no discretion to exclude relevant evidence because it is obtained illegally prior to trial. Lord Diplock in Sang, reinterpreting the expansive dicta of Lord Goddard CJ in Kuruma, held that outside of confession, the court has no general discretion to exclude evidence obtained after the commission of the offence if it would operate unfairly against the accused. The court only has a discretion to exclude relevant evidence where the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value, and where the evidence is tantamount to a self-incriminatory admission which was obtained from the defendant, after the offence was committed. The criteria for exclusion is not that it is obtained illegally but improperly due to trickery, violating the accused`s privilege against self-incrimination. The court is not concerned with the means of obtaining the evidence.
 46.Lord Diplock in Sang said:
It is no part of a judge`s function to exercise disciplinary powers over the police or prosecution as respects the way in which evidence to be used at the trial is obtained by them. If it was obtained illegally there will be a remedy in civil law; if it was obtained legally but in breach of the rules of conduct for the police, this is a matter for the appropriate disciplinary authority to deal with. What the judge at the trial is concerned with is not how the evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution has been obtained but with how it is used by the prosecution at the trial ...
 
I would accordingly answer the question certified in terms which have been suggested by my noble and learned friend, Viscount Dilhorne, in the course of our deliberations on this case. (1) A trial judge in a criminal trial has always a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if in his opinion its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. (2) Save with regard to admissions and confessions and generally with regard to evidence obtained from the accused after commission of the offence, he has no discretion to refuse to admit relevant admissible evidence on the ground that it was obtained by improper or unfair means. The court is not concerned with how it was obtained. It is no ground for the exercise of discretion to exclude that the evidence was obtained as the result of the activities of an agent provocateur.
 47.In England the position was changed when s 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1978 was enacted. Section 78 provided that `the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it`. In 
 R v Khan 
 [1996] 3 All ER 289 the House of Lords, in the leading judgment by Lord Nolan, accepted that, under s 78, the court could have regard to the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, including whether there was a breach of relevant law or convention, in determining whether the breach has an effect on the fairness of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the case law subsequent to s 78 has held firmly that it is not the court`s function to discipline the police.
 48.With respect, Lord Diplock was right when he held that it is not the business of the court to discipline the police. While the court should not condone illegality on the part of law enforcement officers, the exclusion of evidence is completely inappropriate in a trial. By saying that, I do not under-estimate the importance of judicial integrity. Judicial integrity is important since the public would lose respect for the court as a dispenser of justice if it is seen to condone illegality, but judicial integrity is undermined when the public perceives that factually guilty people are getting away with serious crimes because of a trivial breach of legislation.
 49.Even in England after the enactment of s 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the courts do not exclude all forms of evidence obtained by trickery. In 
 R v Christou 
 
[1992] QB 979
, a post s 78 decision, the police acted undercover to recover stolen property and purported to be shady jewellers willing to buy stolen property. They set up a shop for the selling and buying of jewellery. Discreetly sited cameras and sound equipment recorded all that occurred over the counter. The operation was a success and the cameras clearly identified the property on the counter and the vendors who produced it, as well as the incriminating conversations they had with the police officers. The accused challenged the admissibility on the ground that the evidence was obtained by trickery. Lord Taylor CJ held that:
... the trick was not applied to the appellants; they voluntarily applied themselves to the trick. It is not every trick producing evidence against an accused which results in unfairness.
 50.It is implicit in the judgments of Sang and Christou that the law has to recognise that it cannot unduly hamper the police in their work of investigation and certain crimes can only be detected by the use of some sort of deception. In addition in Christou, there is no element of targeting at a specific offender.
 51.In Sang, the accused was charged with conspiring with others to utter counterfeit United States banknotes knowing them to be forged and with intent to defraud. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the accused applied to the court to hold a voir dire so that it might consider whether the involvement of the accused in the offence charged arose out of the activities of an agent provocateur. He hoped to establish that he had been induced to commit the offence by an informeracting on the instructions of the police and that, but for such persuasion, the accused would not have committed the offence. The informer believed that the accused dealt in forged banknotes and told the accused that he knew of a safe buyer of forged banknotes and that he would arrange for this buyer to get in touch with the accused by telephone. All this was done on the instructions of the police. The buyer (who could have been the police officer) contacted the accused who then went to the rendezvous carrying a large number of forged dollar banknotes and walked straight into a police trap.
 52.It can be seen immediately that Sang is distinguishable from the present case. There is a distinction between the case where police conduct has merely induced the accused person to commit the offence which he has committed (as in Sang) and the case where the illegal police conduct itself constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence. The present situation falls in the latter category, albeit the illegal conduct is that of a private investigator rather than a law enforcement officer. Such a distinction was drawn in the recent Australian High Court decision in 
 Ridgeway v R 
 (1995) 129 ALR 41. Different tests apply for both. In the former category, it is a case where the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is likely to prevail over other considerations, and the exclusion of evidence would in fact undermine judicial integrity in allowing such alleged offenders get away. In the latter category, the illegality and the threat to the rule of law which it involves assume a particularly malignant aspect. If the petitioners are ultimately charged with committing an offence under the Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act for replicating the eight masters, not only were the counterfeit masters supplied but the actual making of the counterfeit CDs had been organised by the private investigator for the purpose of obtaining the conviction of the person to whom they were supplied. In addition, there was no allegation that Tan Siang Yong, acting on behalf of Summit Holdings or Summit CD, actually knew that the masters were infringing copies. There was no representation by Jimmy Chew to that effect. It was regrettable that BSA as a reputable organisation could sanction such conduct on the part of the private investigators. The integrity of the administration of criminal justice would require that such evidence be excluded.
 53.More importantly, the evidence of Jimmy Chew, if it was the only evidence before the magistrate, was in any case insufficient to justify the granting of the search warrant. At most, the evidence showed that the management of Summit Holdings, or Summit CD, was reckless as to whether the CDs or the masters which they were asked to replicate were actually infringing copies. It also showed that there was an absence of a comprehensive procedure in their premises for the detection of counterfeit CDs. Jimmy Chew did not allege that he had told Tan Siang Yong that the masters were in fact pirated. The evidence of Jimmy Chew did not reveal that in the premises there were products infringing the copyright or registered trade marks of the various software companies in the premises. In the application for the two warrants, the magistrate must have reason to believe or suspect that there are in the premises the infringing articles and a search warrant should be granted on that basis to search and seize such articles. It is one thing to say that one is reckless or does not care whether he is reproducing infringing copies of CD-ROMs, and it is another to say that he is engaged in the business ofcounterfeiting CD-ROMs and therefore there must be a large number of infringing products in the premises.
 54.The adoption of such a distinction in the mode of illegally procured evidence does not mean that we should adopt wholesale the position taken in the High Court of Australia in 
 Ridgeway v R and in Bunning v Cross 
 (1978) 19 ALR 641 or the approach taken by the Supreme Court in Canada in 
 Collins v R 
 (1987) 38 DLR (4th ed) 508. The Canadian approach is based on s 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and has held that the court is to perform a balancing exercise, in determining whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The disrepute will result from the admission of illegally obtained evidence, if the admission would deprive the accused of a fair hearing, or from judicial condonation of unacceptable conduct by the law enforcement agencies. On the other hand, disrepute may result if evidence is excluded. The long-term consequences of the regular admission or exclusion of this type of evidence on the repute of the administration of justice is considered. The standard is pegged at a reasonable person test. The Canadian approach is similar to the Australian approach in 
 Bunning v Cross 
. In that case, it was held that the trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on public policy grounds in circumstances where it has been obtained by unlawful conduct on the part of the police. In exercising the discretion, the trial judge must engage in a balancing process to resolve the conflict between the goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval being given to the unlawful conduct of the law enforcement officer.
 55.In the Canadian and the Australian approaches, the rationale is founded on the need for the courts to protect the integrity of their processes as well as the need to exercise judicial control over the police. However, both of these approaches are completely unworkable in practice. While they attempt to identify the policies, they stop short at articulating clearly which way the discretion ought to be exercised. In 
 Bunning v Cross 
, the guidelines laid down are: (i) whether there was a deliberate disregard of the law; (ii) the cogency of the evidence where the illegality was not deliberate; (iii) ease with which the law might have been complied with in procuring the evidence in question; (iv) the nature of the offence; (v) the policy of parliament as appears from the enactment constituting the offence. With respect to the seriousness of offence, it was emphasised that driving under the influence of alcohol was a serious offence, as it jeopardised the lives of the users of the highway, and this pointed towards the admission of the evidence. However, there was no indication as to what amounted to a serious offence. It is equally plausible to argue that, since drunken driving is a serious offence, it is important to obey the law strictly in obtaining the evidence. The criticism is that, without a clear principled approach, the use of discretion can practically justify any result which the trial judge wishes to reach, and would be a fertile source of grounds of appeal.
 56.This is further illustrated by Ridgeway. In Ridgeway, the majority of the High Court extended the 
 Bunning v Cross 
 principles to the case where evidence of an offence is procured by the illegal conduct of the law enforcement officer. The majority held that the serious illegality of the law enforcement officers, coupled with selective prosecution, weighed heavily in favour of exclusion. If the disciplinary approach is carried through, surely the court would have granted a stay of proceedings, yet the court was content to allow the prosecution to continue to proceed the accused under the state law, where there was no need to rely on its own illegality./PTEXT>
 57.The second point on which Sang can be distinguished here is that this is a case where the private investigator embarks on a course of conduct that is an offence under the law, as opposed to a law enforcement officer. There is no public interest in the members of the public undertaking such conduct. In such cases, the focus should then be on whether this is the sort of conduct which the courts would sanction. The mode of obtaining such evidence cannot possibly be justified. Summit CD was suspected of software piracy and what the private investigator did was to procure Summit CD to infringe the copyright and trade marks, and then to use this to obtain the warrants. There was no evidence that, if this self-help remedy was not done, there was no other way to find out whether the offences were committed./PTEXT>
 58.I shall now briefly dispose of the alternative submission by the petitioners that the petitioners` act of infringement by manufacturing the eight masters for Jimmy Chew was done with the consent of the relevant proprietors of the trade mark and owners of the copyright, and hence no offence was disclosed under the relevant legislation. This contention was plainly untenable. The relevant copyright and trade mark holders never gave consent to Summit CD to make the masters since they wanted Jimmy Chew to entrap Summit so as to find out if Summit was engaged in software piracy. If the defence of consent was valid, it would efectively make agent provocateur a substantive defence. Trap purchases are made by investigators to secure evidence of infringement and it is untenable to argue that the intellectual property rights holders have given consent to the sale of infringing articles to the agent provocateurs and hence Summit CD are not guilty of an offence./PTEXT>
 59.The other short point is that I accept that trade marks exist in respect of masters, stampers and CD-ROMs. The trade mark of Microsoft, Adobe and Autocad is registered for computer programmes. Section 2(1)(a) Trade Marks Act provides that `trade mark` means:
except in relation to a defensive or certification trade mark, a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate, a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services and a person who has the right, either as proprietor or as registered user, to use the mark, whether with or without an indication of the identity of that person.
 Section 2(2) provides:
References in this Act to (a) the use of a trade mark shall be construed as references to the use of a printed or other visual representation of the mark ...
 60.I accept counsel`s argument that the trademarks in computer programmes exist even though they exist in electronic form. When a CD-ROM is run on the computer, the trade mark appears on the screen and this is a visual representation of the mark within s 2(2); this mark is used in relation to the computer. Thestampers and masters are used to replicate the CD-ROMs. The computer programmes are etched on the stampers and masters for the manufacture of CD-ROMs. Hence even though the masters and stampers cannot be played, the trade marks do exist in relation to the masters and stampers.
 61.An analogy can be drawn from video cassettes in 
 Esquire Electronics v Roopanand Brothers 
 [1991] RPC 425. In that case the Supreme Court of South Africa, in construing s 2 of the Trade Marks Act 62 of 1963 which is identical in material respects to our s 2 of the Trade Marks Act, held that the trade mark that exists in the pre-recorded video tapes is infringed when unauthorised copies are made on other cassette tapes. It does not matter that the trade mark is only visible when the video cassette is played on the video player. The image that appears on the television screen when the video is played on a video player is a visual representation of the mark and is a use in relation to pre-recorded video cassettes.
 62.I shall address the third distinguishing feature between this case and Sang, viz that this is a case of an application to quash a search warrant, not a case of admissibility of evidence, in relation to the third warrant.
 63.
 Execution of the copyright and trade mark warrants - determining their proper scope 
 
The petitioners argued that the trade mark warrant was issued in excess of jurisdiction because it authorised the seizure of articles not within the ambit of s 62 CPC. On examination of the trade mark warrant, I was satisfied that it fell within s 62; it authorised the seizure of goods to which the counterfeit trade marks were applied, and `documents including electronic and/or computer data whether stored in a computer system ... which is [sic] the subject of an offence under the Trade Marks Act`. The search warrant was plainly directed at documents which themselves contravene the Trade Marks Act, including documents stored in the computer system, CD-ROM, diskette, server or in any other medium. The search warrant did not cover documents which were required only as evidence, whether directly or indirectly, of any possible contravention by the petitioners of the Trade Marks Act.
 64.The same conclusion equally applied to the copyright warrant, which authorised the seizure of articles and storage medium containing infringing copies and any plates or contrivance used for making infringing copies.
 65.That was not the end of the matter. The further question was whether the seizure of all the items purportedly under the two warrants was in fact justified. This was important in the light of my conclusion that the first two warrants would stand and the third would be quashed for want of jurisdiction. The petitioners had argued that the documents actually seized pursuant to the two search warrants were not authorised by the warrant.
 66.The items seized exclusively under the Trade Marks warrant comprised: . one stamper and one CD master; one set of work order forms; one data verification systems checking report book.
 Only five pieces of CD-ROMs were seized exclusively under the copyright warrant.
 67.The following items were seized under both the two warrants: . two glass masters with their accompanying order sheets; one logbook on process for polishing; two production log books; seven empty stamper boxes; two mastering log sheets work orders; twenty-seven glass mastering log sheets; sales orders of allegedly infringing articles.
 68.It was not in doubt that the five CD-ROMs which allegedly infringed the copyright of the members of BSA fell within the copyright warrant. There was also no doubt that the stamper and master were covered by the trade mark and copyright warrants since they were alleged to be items used for the purposes of manufacturing counterfeit CDs. What was more difficult was all the documents seized pursuant to both the trade mark and the copyright warrants. These included the log books, work orders, sales orders and invoices. In TYPE=""ITAL"">Lance Court Furnishings v PP 
[1993] 3 SLR 969
, Kan Ting Chiu JC held, in relation to a s 139(6) Copyright Act warrant:
The scope of the warrants also comes under criticism. The warrants authorised the seizure of not only the infringing fabrics, but also `documents relating to the infringement of Anju/ Woodridge Inc`s copyright`. Section 136(9) empowers a magistrate to order the seizure of infringing copies of any matter in which copyright subsists and the plates and contrivances used or intended to be used in the making of such infringing copies but not documents. Documents may be seized if they are in themselves the copyright infringement, eg pirated copies of literary works. Documents evidencing infringement without forming part of the infringement, eg production, sale or stock records, do not come under the ambit of s 136(9) and should not be seizeable under a warrant issued under that provision.
 69.Counsel for the prosecution conceded that the reasoning in Lance Court would apply to the trade mark warrant as well. Section 62 does not provide for the seizure of documents evidencing trade mark infringement which do not form part of the infringement. Instead counsel for the prosecution argued that Lance Court should be reconsidered by this court, and s 136(9) Copyright Act and s 62 CPC should be interpreted in such a way that they allow for the seizure of documents which are directly connected with the infringing copies.
 70.The prosecution relied on TYPE=""ITAL"">Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
[1985] QB 881
, TYPE=""ITAL"">Frank Truman Export v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1977] 3 All ER 431, and TYPE=""ITAL"">Chic Fashions (West Wales) v Jones [1968] 1 All ER 229 on implied powers of search and seizure. These cases were decided at common law, prior to the enactment of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
 71.The first case was TYPE=""ITAL"">Chic Fashions v Jones where Lord Denning held that, although the search warrant expressly authorised the police to search for stolen clothes made by a named company, the police were justified in seizing stolen clothes made by other companies. Lord Denning MR traced the history of the extension of the implied powers of the police through 
 Price v Messenger 
 (1800) 2 Bos & P 158, 
 Crozier v Cundey 
 (1827) 6 B & C 232, 
 Pringle v Bremner and Stirling 
 (1867) 5 Macph 55 and in 
 Dillon v O`Brien and Davies 
 (1887) 16 Cox CC 245, and said:
I see no reason why goods should be more sacred than persons. In my opinion, when a constable enters a house by virtue of a search warrant for stolen goods, he may seize not only the goods which he reasonably believes to be covered by the warrant, but also any other goods which he believes on reasonable grounds to have been stolen and to be material evidence on a charge of stealing or receiving against the person in possession of them or anyone associated with him. Test it this way. suppose the constable does not find the goods mentioned in the warrant, but finds other goods which he reasonably believes to be stolen. Is he to quit the premises and go back to the magistrate and ask for another search warrant to cover these other goods? If he went away, I should imagine that, in nine cases out of ten, by the time when he came back with a warrant, these other goods would have disappeared. The true owner would not recover them. The evidence of the crime would have been lost. That would be to favour thieves and to discourage honest men. Even If it should turn out that the constable was mistaken and that the other goods were not stolen at all, nevertheless, so long as he acted reasonable and did not retain them longer than necessary, he is protected.
 72.
 Chic Fashions 
 was extended in 
 Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 and in 
 Frank Truman Eport v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 to cover documents evidencing the commission of the offence. In 
 Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
, a search warrant was issued under s 16 Forgery Act 1913, for the search and seizure of forged documents which were believed to be found on the plaintiff`s premises. The police officers executing the raid seized the documents in bulk, which were examined at the police station. All the documents were returned after examination at the police station. The plaintiff brought an action for trespass to goods. One of the two issues that arose was whether the authority conferred on the police by the search warrant justified them in seizing the documents.
 73.Section 16 of the Forgery Act 1913 provides that: `(1) If it shall be made to appear by information on oath before a justice of the peace that there is reasonable cause to believe that any person has in his custody or possession without lawful authority or excuse ... (d) any forged document, seal or die; ... the justice may grant a warrant to search for the same; and if the same shall be found on search, it shall be lawful to seize it and carry it before a justice of the county or place in which the warrant was issued ...`. It was clear that a literal reading s 16 of the Forgery Act only provided the seizure of the documents which were actually forged.
 74.In that case, Slade J rejected the literal reading of s 16, holding that it would lead to the absurd conclusion that the police would not have been entitled to take away documents which they reasonably believed to contain forged material, or material that could be of evidential value in the proceedings for fraud, unless theyhad first satisfied themselves that each and every document might be forged, or of such evidential value in other criminal proceedings against the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal took the view that the police were entitled to seize documents which they reasonably believed to be forged or would be of evidential value in other criminal proceedings. On the facts, however, a properly directed jury would have found that the police took away some documents without considering their relevance and, therefore, in relation those documents, the police were guilty of trespass to goods.
 75.A more instructive case was 
 Frank Truman Eport v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
. Again it was a case under s 16 Forgery Act 1913; the police obtained a search warrant under the Act and obtained documents from a solicitor`s office with his consent. The documents consisted of: (1) documents alleged to be forgeries, (2) invoices alleged to be evidence that the documents in (1) were forged; (3) documents alleged to be material evidence of a charge of conspiracy. Swanwick J held that all three types of documents were lawfully seized within the search warrant. (1) was clearly covered by the warrant which was for the express purpose of seizing and retaining any forged document. As for (2), the police had implied power to seize and retain anything which they had reasonable grounds for believing might be material evidence in a prosecution under the 1913 Act, relying on Lord Denning`s judgment in 
 Chic Fashions (West Wales) v Jones 
.
 76.Swanwick J said:
Left to myself, I would hold that not only is the Forgery Act 1913 a criminal statue, but s 16 is restrictive of common law rights, and that it must, therefore, be strictly construed ... The document in the second category is not a forged document. I would, therefore, hold that it does not fall within the statute and that both the second and third categories must be judged on the basis of the balance of public policy and the extent of police powers when lawfully on the premises and in the circumstances of the case.
 
However I feel constrained to follow the guidance of the Court of Appeal in 
 Chic Fashions (West Wales) v Jones
 and in 
 Ghani v Jones
...
 
I find it difficult to see how this result [in 
 Chic Fashions v Jones
] was achieved except by some implied extension of the owners under the warrant. In 
 Pringle v Bremmer and Stirling
 the extension was to other matters tending to prove that the goods were stolen. I feel constrained by these authorities to apply this test to the one document in the second category, whether privileged or not. I therefore refuse relief in respect also of this document.
 77.Hence it can be seen that the English case law has been willing to extend the powers under the search warrants, to include seizure of items or documents which were reasonably thought to be evidence of the crimes of the same offence. 
 Frank Truman Export v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 goes as far as to hold that the implied powers cover documents which are evidence of a different offence, but this is not the case in the present proceedings.
 78.
 Chic Fashions 
 was applied in 
 Re Kah Wai Video 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 459
 where Edgar Joseph Jr J held that, by virtue of an implied extension of powers under the warrant, the police authorities were authorised to seize the articles not listed in the copyright search warrant. Those articles comprised the video cassette recorders, customer cards, programme list, boosters, and other equipment allegedly used to do illegal duplication of video tapes.
 79.There was a superficial attraction in counsel for the respondents` argument. He argued that that enforcement of intellectual property rights must be viewed in the eyes of what he called a reasonable law enforcement officer would do in the circumstances. A reasonable law enforcement officer (be it the a police officer or a representative of BSA) would want evidence in relation to infringement; mere seizure of infringing articles would not be sufficient to show the scale of infringement. He would want invoices, delivery orders and sale orders to prove that infringement had taken place. The provisions of the CPC would not give carte blanche powers to seize whatever he wanted but they could not be read so restrictively so as to tie the hands of a reasonable law enforcement officer and render the CPC a charter for pirates. If the law enforcement officer went beyond what he was entitled to seize, he was liable for trespass as happened in Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner.
 80.Nevertheless I had some reservation in applying the English cases. The reason was that our CPC does make a distinction between the provisions on seizure of documents (s 61 CPC) and seizure of articles (s 62 CPC), unlike the English legislation. Re Kah Wai relied on Kuruma to justify its reliance on Frank Truman. However Kuruma was only relevant after we had decided that whether the seizure of evidence was illegal, being not authorised by the warrant.
 81.Taking the respondents` argument to its logical conclusion, viz that all documents evidencing the petitioners` contravention of the trade mark offences would fall within the ambit of s 62, it effectively rendered s 61 CPC redundant. Great care must to be taken to see that this result was in fact Parliament`s intention. In fact, a close examination would indicate that it could not be Parliament`s intention. Section 62 provides, inter alia, for additional powers in connection with the search of places suspected of being used for containing counterfeited trade marks. Section 62 also allows the taking into custody of any person found in such a place and suspected to have been privy to the deposit, sale of such property`. This power is not in s 61. Section 61 only covers documents. As it can be shown, it is a more difficult task to convince the court under s 61 that a search is necessary for the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding. The burden under s 61 is higher than showing that the search is necessary for investigation. The upshot of the matter is that under the legislative scheme, it is incumbent on the applicants to adduce evidence why the general search warrant is required under s 61 for the purposes of the trial or other proceeding. On this reading, the English decisions on the implied powers of search and seizure are not relevant.
 82.As such, the dicta of Kan JC in Lance Court was correct. The same must apply in the case of s 139(6) of the Copyright Act which covers only the infringing copies of the work or subject-matter in which copyright subsists. Any search warrant for documents in relation to the copyright offence can only be sought for under s 61 CPC, which requires a higher burden to be placed on the applicants.
 83.The inevitable conclusion was that only the five CD-ROMs, one stamper, one CD master and two glass masters seized fell within the copyright and trademark warrants and the rest of the items fell outside the warrants.
 84.
 The third warrant 
 
The circumstances in which the third warrant was obtained were nothing short of deplorable. The raid on the premises of Summit Holdings and Summit CD at 45 Ubi Road 1, began at 2pm, and continued all the way into the night and through it. During the raid, the raiding party came across some allegedly incriminating documents. They decided to apply for a third warrant. It was late at night when the decision was taken. No explanation was given as to why the decision was made at such a late stage. The solicitors for BSA made an application for a further search warrant to GP Selvam J by calling at his residence at about 11pm. GP Selvam J granted the third search warrant pursuant to s 61 of the CPC.
 85.The terms of the third search warrant were as follows:
To the Commissioner of Police and other police officers and others in attached list.
 
Whereas information has been laid before me of the commission or suspected commission of the offence under s 136 Copyright Act and s 73 Trade Marks Act, and it has been made to appear to me that the production of the articles specified in the schedule below is essential to the inquiry now being made or about to be made into the said offence or suspected offence. This is to authorise and require you to search for the said articles specified in the schedule below in the premises known as 45 Ubi Road 1, Summit Building, Singapore 408696, and, if found, to produce the same forthwith before the [] court at [] returning this warrant with an indorsement certifying what you have done under it, immediately upon its execution.
 
Given under my hand and the seal of the court, this day of 12 August 1997.
 86.Attached to the search warrant was a list of the raiding party, which was identical to the list attached to the first two warrants. The search warrant was signed by GP Selvam J with a note that `seal to be affixed tomorrow 13 August 1997`. There was a schedule of articles attached listed: . All invoices, sales order and other documents relating to the sale of CD-ROMs or computer products to PLL Computer, Ivan Yee, Power Multivision and/or Hardware House; all documents relating to the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of category `C` CD ROMs; all documents, minutes of meetings and/or internal memorandums relating to the production of category `C` CD ROMs or computer products; minutes of sales and production meeting held on 1 April 1996 memorandum dated 19 October 1996 entitled `General Discussion on Production Options`; and memorandum dated 2 October 1996 entitled `Control over Multimedia Orders`.
 87.What was important was that it transpired that GP Selvam J had directed the parties to treat the warrant he issued as a subordinate courts warrant. This meant that he purported to sit as a magistrate. The question then arose as to whether he had the power to sit as a magistrate in the subordinate courts and to issue orders as a magistrate.
 88.There is no provision in the legislation which provides that a High Court Judge is ex officio a magistrate or a district judge. In contrast, under s 9(5) Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) every person appointed to be or to act as adistrict judge shall be ex officio a magistrate. Section 7(3) CPC provides that every district court shall have in the exercise of its jurisdiction all the powers which belong to and are exercised by a magistrate`s court. In 
 PP v Nyu Tiong Lam 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 273
, the High Court in a criminal revision set out the ways to determine whether the jurisdiction invoked is that of a magistrate`s court or a district court.
 89.Section 10 Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) provides that: . Every proceeding in the High Court and all business arising thereout shall, except as otherwise provided by any written law for the time being in force, be heard and disposed of before a single Judge. A Judge may, subject to Rules of Court, exercise in court or in chambers all or any part of the jurisdiction vested in the High Court, in all such causes and matters and in all such proceedings in any causes or matters as might formerly have been heard in court or in chambers respectively by a single Judge, or as may be directed or authorised to be so heard by Rules of Court for the time being in force.
 90.In my view, as the legislation has not provided that the jurisdiction of the magistrate`s court is exercisable by a High Court judge, s 10(2) provides that the judge of the High Court only has powers to exercise the powers conferred on the High Court. In the absence of express provision, it is not open to imply that a High Court judge has the capacity or power to sit as a magistrate. There is no necessary implication that, in conferring the powers of the High Court judge, Parliament must have impliedly conferred the power to sit in the subordinate courts.
 91.The historical explanation over the distinction between the superior court of record and the inferior court does not support the argument that the High Court judge has implied powers to sit in the inferior court. The High Court as a superior court of record has unlimited jurisdiction, and an action that may be brought in an inferior court prima facie can also be brought in the High Court, since the High Court cannot be deprived of its ascendancy by showing that some other court could have entertained the particular action: 10 Halsbury`s Laws of England para 713. If the action is brought before the High Court Judge, that action will be considered to be heard in the High Court, as opposed to the inferior court which could also have heard the action. A decision of the High Court judge will then be treated as a decision of the High Court in its original jurisdiction.
 92.Hence what GP Selvam J purported to do when he directed that the search warrant issued by him was to be treated as a subordinate courts warrant was for him to sit as a magistrate. He had no power as a High Court judge to sit as a magistrate. The inevitable conclusion was that whatever orders he purported to issue in his capacity as a magistrate were null and void. The third warrant must be quashed on that ground alone. All the documents seized pursuant to the third warrant must necessarily be returned.
 93.This holding effectively put the third warrant to an end. However, the very able counsel offered extensive arguments on some other issues which I ought to address in this judgment. In the course of submissions, counsel for the petitioners argued extensively that, if the order of GP Selvam J was to be taken as a High Court order (contrary to my holding), for offences in respect of the Trade Marks Act and Copyright Act, the only provisions which govern the issue of the search warrants are in s 62 CPC and s 136(9) Copyright Act. No recourse can possibly bemade to s 61(1) CPC, relying on 
 Lance Court Furnishings v PP 
 [1993] SLR 969. Hence, as s 62(2) CPC and s 136(9) provide that the search warrant is to be issued by a magistrate, not by the High Court, it follows that the third warrant could not have been granted by the High Court.
 94.The petitioners relied heavily on the argument that both s 62 CPC and s 136(9) Copyright Act are specific provisions governing the issuance of search warrants in these offences, and recourse to the general provision for search warrants under s 61 would render the two provisions redundant. Counsel for the petitioners argued that this was reinforced by s 136(9) Copyright Act which came into force after the CPC.
 95.(a) (a) any court has reason to believe that a person to whom a summons under section 58 or a requisition under section 59(1) has been or might be addressed will not or would not produce the document or other thing as required by the summons or requisition;(b) (b) that document or other thing is not known to the court to be in the possession of any person; or(c) (c) the court considers that the purposes of justice or of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code will be served by a general search or inspection,Section 61 CPC provides that:
(1) Where -
 
it may issue a search warrant, and the person to whom the warrant is directed may search or inspect in accordance with the warrant and with this Code.
 96.The scope of ss 61 and 62 are different. As held in 
 Lance Court Furnishings 
, s 62 is confined to stolen property, property unlawfully obtained, counterfeited property contravening the relevant sections under the Trade Marks Act. Section 61 is not so restricted to such items but includes documents. Section 62 also entitles the taking into custody any person found in such a place and suspected to have been privy to the deposit, sale of such property; this power is not found in s 61.
 97.The crucial difference between ss 61 and 62 lies in the preconditions as to when the search warrants can be issued. The prosecution sought to rely on s 61(c). It must be noted that s 61(c) is framed widely, that `the purposes of justice or of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code will be served`. However s 61(c) does not provide for something which the court may do for the purposes of investigation. Tan Yock Lin in Criminal Procedure (1997) at Ch IV para 503 argues that:
The general search warrant may be issued for the purposes of justice. Therefore, it may be issued for the purposes of investigation, for the securing and preservation of evidence of a crime cannot (sic) but serve the purposes of justice.
 98.With respect, s 61(c) is not meant to cover investigation. In comparison, s 58 provides that the court may issue a summons whenever it `considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding`. `Investigation` is omitted from s 62 and it is clear that the legislature did not provide under s 62(c)for an investigation: see Sohoni`s Code of Criminal Procedure (19th Ed, 1990) Vol 1, at p 396-7. The reason for the omission is that the police have been given an independent power to search under s 125 CPC in the course of investigation of an offence. Plainly s 61 CPC cannot be used to justify a search warrant for investigation, much less for the purpose of a fishing expedition.
 99.The result is that in most cases applications for trade mark or copyright search warrants have to be made under s 62 CPC or s 136(9) Copyright Act. Section 61 can only be invoked when there is a summons made under s 58 or a requisition under s 59. My above conclusion is fortified by an examination of the provisions of s 61. Clearly all the sub-sections of s 61 have to be considered. Sections 61(a) and (b) relate to the case where a summons under s 58 or a requisition under s 59(1) has or may be issued and `any court` has reason to believe that the person to whom the summons is addressed will not produce it or that document is not known to be in the possession of any person. Under s 61(c), the words `any court` must refer back to s 61(a), ie (c) is limited to the situation where a summons under s 58 or a requisition under s 59(1) has been or will be made, and the purposes of justice or of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding will be served by a general search. There is no suggestion that any s 58 summons is issued prior to the obtaining of any of the search warrants.
 100.In any event, the evidence before the learned judge, it was clearly insufficient to justify the granting of the third warrant. All that was before him was that the raiding party had gone into the premises of the petitioners; they had not discovered any material articles or items that could properly fall within the first two warrants but had instead found allegedly incriminating documentary evidence not covered under s 61 CPC. What the applicants for the third warrant were trying to do was to go on a fishing expedition. This is clearly not allowed under s 61 CPC.
 101.Counsel for the prosecution sought to retrospectively justify the third search warrant from the documentary evidence that was ultimately seized. He argued that the documents were still admissible in justifying the grant of the search warrant in the first place, relying on Sang and Heng Lee Handbags for the proposition. This wide proposition was untenable. Heng Lee Handbags does not cover the case where the search warrants are quashed on the basis of want of jurisdiction; rather it is the case where the magistrate hearing the case ought not to exercise his discretion to grant the search warrants because the facts before him were very sketchy. However the raid carried out uncovered counterfeit items and Rubin J held that he was entitled to take into account the evidence obtained after the raid to justify the granting of the raid in the first place. Heng Lee Handbags cannot apply where the search warrants are quashed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the issuing authority.
 102.
 Evidence obtained pursuant to search warrants that are quashed 
 
The remaining issue was what happens to the seized documentary evidence which was outside the scope of the first two warrants and all the items seized under the third warrant which is quashed. Counsel for the prosecution went on to make a startling proposition that, notwithstanding that evidence is obtained pursuant to a search warrant that is quashed for whatsoever reason, i.e. theevidence being illegally obtained, and accepting that the seizure of the items is invalid, the court nevertheless has a discretion to order that the prosecution be entitled to retain the evidence. This was a most extraordinary proposition, and he sought to rely on 
 Heng Lee Handbags 
 and 
 Re Kah Wai Video 
, and by extending Sang. I doubted whether Heng Lee Handbags should be followed. The remarks made by Rubin J were only obiter as he had already decided that the search warrants should not be quashed. With great respect to Rubin J, he failed to consider that there is a distinction between admissibility of evidence and retention of evidence pursuant to illegally obtained search warrants. At the stage of admissibility, it is inappropriate to exclude the evidence as a remedy. The evidence has already been obtained. The compensation for the wrong should be confined to and limited to that occasioned by the wrong. To return to the status quo is awkward where the evidence obtained increases the probability of conviction of guilt, and thus protects the public from crime.
 103.It is different when the court considers whether the evidence should be returned on the quashing of the search warrant. Where a search warrant is quashed, the search warrant was invalidly issued and hence there was never any statutory authority given to the police or the complainants to conduct a raid on the premises.
 104.Counsel for the prosecution argued that the court should protect the interests of the State by allowing retention by the State. However, it is not the business of the court to preserve evidence for the State to prosecute. The interest of the State is not equivalent to the interest of justice, as counsel seemed to contend. Also, it puts the court in an impossible position as to how the court is going to decide to exercise its discretion in determining which evidence should be retained, and which should be returned, for the purposes of a possible prosecution. The charges have not even been framed at this stage.
 105.The petitioners relied on 
 R v Chief Constable of Lancashire, ex p Parker 
 
[1993] QB 577
; 
[1993] 2 WLR 428
. In that case, the search warrants were validly issued but the execution of the search warrants was carried out in breach of ss 15 and 16 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and this deprived the police of any authority to retain the seized articles. The court rejected the application of Sang, holding that Sang was a case dealing with admissibility. Sang did not give any support for the proposition that the police have a general right to retain unlawfully seized material as against its owner for use as evidence.
 106.I did not find assistance in the Canadian cases of 
 Lagiorgia v R 
 (1987) 35 CCC (3d) 445 and 
 R v Carroll 
 (1989) 47 CCC (3d) 263, which adopted a form of discretionary approach in deciding whether evidence ought to be returned to the owners. This balancing approach with no clear guidelines either way in the exercise of the discretion would be difficult to adopt. The Canadian decisions were based on s 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982, in respect of which we have no corresponding provisions, and the law of evidence in Canada has been substantially influenced by the enactment of the Charter.
 107.
 Safeguards in the criminal process 
 
This case has given me much concern. No one would wish that any of thosewho engage in software piracy and manufacturing of counterfeit CDs should go free. They should be found out and brought to justice. But it is fundamental in our law that the means which are adopted to this end should be lawful means. The manner in which the raid was conducted was deplorable and must be condemned.
 108.The raid was carried out on 12 August 1997 at 2pm, and did not end until the next day 13 August 1997 at about 5.10am. It appeared that only five allegedly counterfeit CDs were seized in the entire exercise and there were no attempts made by counsel to show that those five counterfeit CDs were indeed manufactured by the petitioners. Much of what was seized comprised documents, including internal memoranda, cash invoices and copies of sales orders for CD-ROMs. Counsel for the prosecution argued that the documents are incriminating. Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the documents have to be read in the light of other documents. At this stage, since the third warrant had to be quashed for want of jurisdiction, it is unnecessary for me to go into the contents of the documents.
 109.109 However, I would allude to the manner in which the raid was conducted. The list of people in the raiding party amounted to 35 in number. The raiding party comprised police officers, representatives from BSA and solicitors acting for BSA. The raiding party was accompanied by a crew from the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) which was stationed outside the premises of the petitioners. The only purpose was to provide publicity for the raid, and this was largely achieved when the share prices of Summit Holdings plunged the next day. In addition, after the lengthy raid, press conferences were held to give details as to the outcome of the raid. Under the existing legislation, there was unfortunately nothing to prevent BSA and its member companies from going to the media.
 110.What was more objectionable was that the raiding party locked up some of the factory workers in the rooms in the premises when the raid was conducted, although the actual period of imprisonment was largely disputed. One would have thought that the raiding party was accompanied by police officers who were neutral and would check the over-zealousness of some of the members of the raiding party. This was not so. The affidavits filed by the two police officers, Inspector Mak Kum Kay and Senior Investigation Officer Segathesan s/o Kannapan, disputed the petitioners` account of events. However, the form and language in which the affidavits were drafted unfortunately gave rise to some concern on my part as to whether they were in fact in the language of the deponents. These affidavits were very well drafted, and counsel for the prosecution quite properly confirmed that they had been vetted by the Attorney General`s Chambers. Certainly in all instances of raids, tension is inevitably caused by the raiding parties and in the present case the petitioners were naturally shocked and upset by the way their staff were treated. But there are limits as to what a raiding party is entitled to do in a legal system in which one is presumed to be innocent until shown otherwise.
 111.In addition, not all the documents that were seized from the premises of the petitioners were acknowledged with police acknowledgment slips. There was some dispute over the authenticity of a document obtained from the computer server of the petitioners; this document was alleged to be taken from the premisesof the petitioners but no acknowledgment slip could be produced for it. If a detailed list of documents was prepared as to what had been taken and such a list had been checked with the petitioners, such disputes would not have arisen. After all, the raid lasted some 15 hours.
 112.The raiding party included representatives of BSA, who could hardly be expected to be objective. The solicitors of BSA were also in the raiding party, and, while solicitors are officers of the court and are expected to act in a fair and impartial way, this case unhappily showed that this is no safeguard against excessive behaviour. I also see that there is a correlation between the behaviour of solicitors in cases where a local firm of solicitors is engaged by a small corporation to make complaints and apply for search warrants, and behaviour of solicitors who are given the opportunity to act for very reputable and powerful clients, as in this case.
 113.In addition, on the return date before the magistrate, the documents and items seized were not produced before the magistrate. I have read the transcript of proceedings before the magistrate on the return date on 14 August 1997 which shows some considerable confusion as to whether the police or BSA`s solicitors were in possession of the documents or items seized.
 114.In contrast to the application for an Anton Piller order, various safeguards are placed in the execution of the order: see Supreme Court Practice Direction (1997 Ed). The purpose of an Anton Piller order is to prevent the defendant destroying incriminating evidence prior to an impending trial. Undertakings as to damages have to be given by the applicants in the event that it turns out later that the Anton Piller order should not have been granted. The execution of the Anton Piller order is supervised by a supervising solicitor and carried out in his presence. The supervising solicitor is an experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the procedures in Anton Piller orders. Possible abuses in the case of Anton Piller orders have been judicially noted in 
 Universal Themosensors v Hibben 
 [1992] 3 All ER 257 and in 
 Columbia Picture Industries v Robinson 
 [1986] 3 All ER 338 and guidelines have evolved as a result. In many respects, search warrants are similar to Anton Piller orders except that they it involve the criminal process. There is room for a review of the whole process, and for directions to be given that the evidence seized be retained by a neutral party, and not by the complainants or by their solicitors. The way ahead must be to include in the criminal process, some of the safeguards in the manner in which Anton Piller orders are obtained.
 115.
 The criminal motion 
 
Mr Kenneth Tan and Mr VK Rajah had been granted a fiat from the Public Prosecutor only to defend the proceedings brought in the criminal revision for the search warrants to be quashed. They did not have a fiat from the Public Prosecutor to proceed with the prosecution of the petitioners. They made an application for an order that their solicitors be allowed to make copies of documents, and an application that Summit Holdings and Summit CD deliver up the following documents: . copies of all invoices during the period August 1995 to August 1997 issued to the following category `C` customers: Ivan Yee, Ivan Multivision, PLL Computer, Power Multivision, ASK Trading; copies of the warranties and indemnities signed by the above category `C` customers; a copy of each CD-ROM produced for the above category `C` customers.
 These two applications were made pursuant to s 58 CPC.
 116.Since I have found that the third search warrant should be quashed for want of jurisdiction, it followed that all the documents seized under the third search warrant would have to be returned, including their copies, and there is no possibility of the court allowing BSA to make copies of the documents seized. The same principle applies in respect of documents seized that fall outside the scope of the first two warrants. They would have to be returned.
 117.The application for the delivery up and production of the enumerated documents was made pursuant to s 58 CPC. In 
 PP v IC Automation 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 249
, the court held that s 58 CPC only related to documents which were clearly specified. It is clear that a fishing expedition is prohibited under s 58. Here BSA was embarking on a classic fishing expedition; it could not enumerate the specific documents that it required, other than a general reference to invoices, warranties and indemnities during the specified period by the customers. This application was doomed to fail.
 118.
 Orders 
 
In the result I directed that the two warrants (132 of 1997 and 236A of 1997) issued by the magistrate were valid and would stand. But all the documents (and copies) seized pursuant to the two warrants, namely, the two production log-books for the incoming master recording, the log book on process for polishing, all sales orders, invoices, glass master order sheets, mastering log sheets work orders, glass mastering log sheets, seven empty stamper boxes, the checking report book, and the list of Summit CD`s customers allegedly downloaded from the petitioners` computer server were ordered to be returned forthwith to the petitioners within 24 hours from the making of the order. The result was the respondents were only allowed to keep the stamper, the CD master seized under the trade marks warrant, the five CD-ROMs seized pursuant to the copyright warrant, and two glass masters seized pursuant to the two warrants. I quashed the warrant to search issued by GP Selvam J dated 12 August 1997 and ordered the return of all the items seized pursuant to the third warrant, similarly within 24 hours from the making of the order.
 119.The criminal motion was dismissed.
 120.I indicated that the result of these applications do not affect the final determination as to the admissibility of any documents when tendered in evidence in subsequent proceedings, whether civil or criminal.

The first appellant was charged with two counts of aiding and abetting one Sadako Okada (Okada) to fraudulently use as genuine, a forged document, namely one Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd bank draft valued at [bull ]1.27 trillion, by presenting it to the Union Bank of Switzerland on 14 February 1996 and to the Republic National Bank of New York on 15 February 1996, for the purpose of opening an account and crediting the said sum into the account, pursuant to s 467 read with ss 471 and 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.The second, third, and fourth appellants and one Heng Bah Bee (Heng) were charged with two counts of conspiracy to assist Okada in the abovementioned offences, pursuant to s 467 read with ss 471 and 109 of the Penal Code.
 3.The first and second appellants were sentenced to 48 months` imprisonment on each charge. The third and fourth appellants were sentenced to 54 months` imprisonment on each charge, and Heng was sentenced to 60 months` imprisonment on each charge. The sentences on both charges for all the appellants and Heng were to run concurrently.
 4.On 17 August 1996, Okada was convicted of three offences under s 467 of the Penal Code. She was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each of the charges, with two of the sentences to run consecutively. Whilst serving her sentence, Okada passed away in Changi Prison in March 1997.
 5.The appellants appealed against their convictions and sentences. At the conclusion of the appeal, I dismissed their appeals against conviction but varied the sentences. I now give my reasons for so doing.
 
 The prosecution`s case
PK Goh`s testimony
 6.According to one PK Goh (Goh), who was a prosecution witness, he met the third appellant (Chao) some two years back when he was helping a friend in business. Sometime in December 1995, Chao faxed Goh a bank draft, written in Japanese, as well as a translation of that draft in English. The bank draft was drawn on the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and had a face value of [bull ]1.27 trillion.
 7.Chao asked Goh to assist him to look for a bank to encash or discount the draft. Goh was shocked when he first saw the huge amount on the draft. Chao informed him that the draft was genuine and that it belonged to the daughter of a former emperor of Japan.
 8.On 23 January 1996, the fourth appellant (Hsiao) and Chao came to Singapore to see if they could help the owner of the draft to encash it. Goh was introduced to Hsiao for the first time then. He also met the second appellant (Shudo) and Okada, who was the owner of the draft and the alleged daughter of a former emperor of Japan.
 9.Goh introduced Chao and Hsiao to Heng who he thought could help Okada to encash the draft. Thereafter, Hsiao and Chao left Singapore. Sometime later, Heng informed Goh that he wanted to meet Okada. Hsiao came to Singapore again with Okada on 14 February 1996 and she was introduced to Heng.
 Visit to the Union Bank of Switzerland
 10.Charles Ng (Charles), head of marketing at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) testified that at the end of January 1996, Heng called him to enquire about opening an account at UBS. At a subsequent meeting with Charles, Heng claimed to be a former senior officer at the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and a director of a public-listed company. Heng told Charles that he would introduce a Japanese business associate to open an account at UBS. Charles knew that Heng was not a customer of UBS and did not have any previous dealings with UBS.
 11.In early February 1996, Heng brought Hsiao to attend a second meeting with Charles, to enquire about opening an account at UBS and about its banking services. Lena Ho (Lena), an officer of UBS, was also present at this meeting. Charles and Lena were shown a copy of the bank draft and were informed that the person who would be opening an account was a Japanese lady related to the Japanese royal family.
 12.Heng arranged for another meeting on 14 February 1996 at UBS. This time, Heng, Hsiao, Okada and Shudo met Charles and Lena. According to Charles and Lena, the discussions were led mainly by Heng and Hsiao, while Shudo translated for Okada. Charles was told that the account would be opened in Okada`s name and was shown the draft (P12) with a face value of [bull ]1.27 trillion, drawn on the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB). Documents (P14, P17 and P18) were also tendered by Okada and the accused persons to prove that Okada was the owner of the draft, P12.
 13.Charles was told that the money for the draft came from the Emperor Showa`s fund and that Okada would like the draft cleared. Once it was cleared, further instructions would be given as to the use of the funds. Charles noticed that the amount on the draft was large and there was no payee`s name on it. This was the first time that he had come across such a draft.
 14.Charles then verified the draft with the head of private banking who told him that `there was no such draft`. Charles then informed the accused persons that UBS could not clear the draft and advised them to return to the issuing bank, DKB, to get it cleared. Heng and Hsiao tried to persuade Charles and Lena to accept the draft but were unsuccessful.
 15.A few days later, Heng called Lena to ask why UBS would not accept the draft. Lena said that it was not the bank`s policy to accept a draft which did not have a payee`s name. To this, Heng retorted that the American Express Bank could accept the draft. Thereafter, nothing more was heard at UBS from Heng or the appellants regarding the bank draft.
 Visit to the Republic National Bank of New York
 16.The appellants had also attempted to encash the draft at the Republic National Bank of New York (RNB). Stephanie Chan (Stephanie), assistant vice-president of private banking at RNB, testified that in early February 1996, Heng called her to find out about RNB`s private banking services and about share investments, and went to see her the following day.
 17.On 14 February 1996, Heng called Stephanie again, this time to arrange a meeting, as he would be bringing investors from Japan and Taiwan, including a person related to the Japanese imperial family. The next day, Heng, Hsiao, Chao, Shudo and Okada went to RNB. Okada was introduced to Stephanie as the former daughter of the late Emperor Showa of Japan. Stephanie observed that the discussions were led mainly by Hsiao and Heng, with Shudo doing the translations for Okada. Stephanie was told that Okada wanted to transfer some funds out from Japan to Singapore as most Japanese banks were having financial problems.
 18.Okada then signed an account opening form and presented the bank draft to Stephanie. This was the first time Stephanie had seen such a draft as there was no bearer`s name and she did not know how she would be able to verify it. However she decided to retain the draft for further checks and for clearance, and issued Okada an acknowledgment of receipt. She was told that the draft was to be encashed and the money credited into Okada`s account. Once that was completed, she was to contact Heng.
 19.Stephanie handed the draft to John Hanson, the general manager of RNB, who duly passed it on to Daniel Teo, the compliance officer, for verification. Daniel Teo contacted DKB in Tokyo and was informed by them that they had never issued such a draft. DKB subsequently confirmed this in writing on 14 March 1996. Stephanie then called Heng to inform him that the draft was invalid to which Heng replied that that was `impossible`.
 20.On 11 March 1996, Heng called Stephanie and informed her that DKB and the Central Bank of Japan had corresponded with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in respect of the draft. Meanwhile, John Hanson notified MAS of the matter and sent to MAS copies of the bank draft and the documents furnished by Okada and her entourage.
 21.On 12 March 1996, Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Okada arrived at RNB for a meeting which had been arranged by Heng. At the meeting, Heng produced a document entitled `Irrevocable Instruction` (P27). It contained instructions to transfer 15% of the value of the draft to Hsiao`s account which he had opened at UBS, once the draft was successfully encashed. Thereafter, officers from the Commercial Affairs Department moved in and detained the group members. Shudo and the first appellant (""Nomura"") were detained later on.
 Sadako Okada`s evidence
 22.Okada claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of the late Emperor Showa, also known as Emperor Hirohito, and that the Emperor had bequeathed his wealth to her upon his demise. The funds for the bank draft came from a fund of [bull ]13.97 trillion known as the Sadako Okada Fund. Okada alleged that on 6 October 1989, there was a theft at DKB. As a result, the documents evidencing this fund and her identity were stolen. Moreover, there were altogether 11 bank drafts for [bull ]1.27 trillion each (of which P12 was one) but she had been cheated of the other ten by DKB. P12 was received by her on 19 May 1989.
 23.Okada testified that she wanted to convene an open hearing in the USA with regard to the theft of the funds and documents at DKB but needed some money for her expenses. She had no funds and thus consulted Hsiao who informed her that she would need about [bull ]2.5 million for her expenses. Okada then approached Nomura whom she had known for eight years and borrowed a sum of about [bull ]4 million from him.
 24.On 30 January 1996, Okada came to Singapore with the draft, P12, accompanied by Shudo, with the view of obtaining a loan to fund her trip to the USA. They went to the American Express Bank and presented P12 to the bank officer but the draft was rejected. Okada came to Singapore again on 14 February 1996 on the representation from Hsiao that she could obtain a loan from one Shao Shuk Tei who was living in Singapore. Hsiao said that Shao Shuk Tei had remitted the funds into an account at UBS for the purpose of providing the loan.
 25.According to Okada, Hsiao and Heng dominated the discussion on 14 February at UBS. At the end of the meeting, Okada was puzzled as to why she had been brought to the bank as the issue of the loan was not raised and Shao Shuk Tei was not present to lend her the money.
 26.Similarly, on 15 February, another meeting at RNB turned out to be fruitless as the loan issue was not mentioned. Again, Heng did most of the talking at RNB. On 5 or 6 March, Hsiao asked Okada to come to Singapore again, as he was arranging with the Central Bank of Japan, DKB and other banks to move the [bull ]1.27 trillion. Okada was told to wait in Singapore for the transfer of the funds from DKB, and was also informed by Hsiao that P12 had been successfully encashed.
 27.All along, Okada maintained that she did not intend to convert the draft into cash or to open an account, but had merely wanted the draft to be confirmed in Singapore. This was contrary to what she had maintained in her statement to the CAD, in which she stated that she had gone to UBS and RNB to open an account and to deposit the draft.
 Evidence on the authenticity of the bank draft, P12
 28.The bank draft, P12, was sent to the Department of Scientific Services to verify its authenticity. Yap Bei Sing (Yap), the Senior Scientific Officer, did a comparison between P12 and a genuine DKB bank draft (P32). P32 had been obtained from DKB in Japan at the request of the CAD for the purpose of this investigation. Based on his observations Yap concluded that P12 was a forgery.
 29.Under ultra-violet light, P12 gave out a blue colour whereas P32 did not produce any fluorescence. This showed that different types of paper had been used. Yap also found that P32 displayed a clear, sharp and well-defined offset and letter press printing quality, whereas P12 was of a laser colour photocopy printing quality, except for three features. These three features were the figures representing the face value of the bank draft, the yen symbol and the symbol that resembled `X`. Moreover, under the microscope, the scanning lines of a laser photocopier could be detected on P12.
 30.Hakujun Tamaki (Tamaki), who was a senior assistant manager of DKB in Singapore, was also called to testify for the prosecution on the authenticity of P12. Tamaki had been working with DKB in Japan since 1990 and claimed that he was familiar with local and foreign bank drafts issued by DKB. In July 1996, he went to Japan to procure from DKB a colour photograph of a genuine DKB draft (P33) bearing serial number A 144451. P33 was issued on 18 May 1989, and had the same serial number as P12, except that P33 had already been presented for payment on 30 May 1989.
 31.According to Tamaki, P12 was not issued by DKB for the following reasons. First, the printing fonts used in P12 for the face value was different from that used for DKB bank drafts. All DKB branches used the same printing font for the face value when issuing bank drafts. Second, there would be a printed heart-shaped symbol at the end of the printed face value. This was missing from P12. Third, all DKB drafts had a security feature in the form of the characters `DKB` in the background of the draft. In P12, these characters were not clearly visible to the eye. Fourth, the numeral zero and the symbol for `Yen` were slanted to one side in the genuine draft whereas in P12 both were straight.
 32.Tamaki also commented that, while it was common for DKB to issue bank drafts to payees marked `bearer`, it was very unusual for such a draft to be issued for a sum of [bull ]1.27 trillion. Moreover, bank drafts which were meant to be cleared in Japan would be written in Japanese, and could not be cleared overseas. For drafts to be cleared overseas, they would have to be written in the local language of that country. Tamaki was of the view that P33 and P12 were very similar, in that both bore the same date, serial number, seal and signatory, and it was possible that whoever had made P12 had seen P33.
 33.Tamaki was also asked about exh P20, which purported to be a certificate of deposit issued by DKB to Okada whereby DKB confirmed that they were holding a deposit of [bull ]1.27 trillion in her account. Tamaki testified that DKB did not issue such documents and that he had never seen such a document before.
 34.
 Hsiao Li Tung`s defence
Hsiao, a Taiwanese national, is a retired colonel and currently a businessman. In gist, he claimed that he had merely acted as an intermediary, introducing Okada to the banks, and that he did not know whether P12 was genuine or not. He claimed that it was a common practice for businessmen to introduce banks to potential customers or investors.
 35.Hsiao expressed some doubts over P12 as it had been issued seven years ago and yet had not been encashed earlier. Okada explained that P12 was part of a fund of [bull ]13.97 trillion which belonged to her, and which she had not thought of using until she needed it for the purpose of the public hearing in the USA. Hsiao alleged that he had repeatedly told Okada that the authenticity of P12 had to be verified by the bank. Okada agreed and said that she would bear the expenses, including his, to verify the draft.
 36.Okada told Hsiao that she did not want to present the draft in Japan as she was afraid that the Japanese banks might confiscate it. As Okada had explained earlier, there were initially 11 bank drafts, each for the same value, and ten of them had been confiscated by DKB. Okada did not wish to return to DKB to encash P12 as she was afraid that this draft would also be confiscated by DKB.
 37.In any event, Hsiao did not see fit to ask Okada whether she had any money in her DKB account in Japan for P12 to have been issued. Hsiao explained that, when he was in Japan, he had made enquiries about the authenticity of P12 and had been informed that it was genuine. Moreover, Okada had also informed him that she had written to DKB head office in Japan to enquire about P12 but had not received a reply. According to Okada, there was a law in Japan which stated that, if no reply was given, this meant that the party receiving the enquiry had given an affirmative answer. Hsiao claimed that it was not until he arrived in Singapore that he was told that P12 was forged.
 38.Hsiao decided to assist Okada as she had intended to donate some of the funds in P12 to charitable and non-profit organisations and he felt that he would be contributing to something meaningful. He claimed that he did not seek any personal gain from this. In fact, he had initially tried to obtain for Okada a loan by using P12 as collateral, but was unsuccessful and only thereafter did he suggest to Okada to encash P12.
 39.Hsiao claimed that he had accompanied Okada and Chao to Singapore on 23 January 1996 for the purpose of verifying P12. However, he later changed his story and claimed that they came to Singapore with the intention of encashing P12. He also admitted that he had informed Charles Ng that Okada intended to deposit P12 at UBS. Contrary to Charles`s, Lena`s and Stephanie`s claims, Hsiao maintained that he had not actively participated in the discussions at UBS and RNB but merely made the introductions.
 40.Before Hsiao returned to Taiwan on 16 February 1996, Okada was very pleased that she had been able to open an account in Singapore, and showed him two letters entitled `Consent to Distribution` (P50, P51). These two documents evinced her intention to give 2% of P12 to Shudo and 3% of P12 to Heng, as a reward for their help.
 41.Okada also signed an `Irrevocable Instruction` (P27) in which it was stated that 15% of the proceeds from P12 would be transferred to Hsiao`s account. According to Hsiao, Okada wanted him to use this money to compensate Taiwanese nationals who died during the Second World War and for the setting up of international clubs in Singapore and Japan. However, in his statement made to the CAD, Hsiao claimed that two-thirds of that P27 was to be used to set up a factory.
 42.
 Heng Bah Bee`s defence
Heng is a Singaporean and runs a manufacturing business. On or about 27 January 1996, he was introduced by PK Goh to Hsiao, who in turn introduced him to Okada. Heng was told that Okada was a Japanese princess who wanted to open a bank account in Singapore. He thought that both Okada and Hsiao wanted to open an account in Singapore for the purpose of investment.
 43.Heng claimed that he had merely acted as an introducer when he recommended Okada and Hsiao to UBS and RNB. He explained that, to be an introducer, one must be of good character and must be known by the bank or have had some previous dealings with them. Heng claimed that most foreign banks in Singapore would know him as he had once given a lunch talk to members of the Bankers Association.
 44.Heng denied that he knew P12 was a forgery. Although he had never seen such a huge amount on a bank draft before, this did not arouse his suspicion as Hsiao had informed him that Okada, the owner of P12, was a Japanese princess. He was also not perturbed by the fact that the draft was seven years old, as he felt that it was up to the bank to authenticate it. After all, he had no interest in the encashment of P12 and, as such, did not question its authenticity.
 45.According to Heng, Hsiao informed him that 3% of the proceeds of P12 was to be used for investment purposes. As such, Heng and Okada signed a document, P39, in which Okada agreed to give Heng 3% of P12, for these investment purposes. Heng claimed that he did not know of the contents of P39 when he first signed it as it was written in Japanese and it was not until the trial that he understood `investment`, as explained by Hsiao, to mean the setting-up of international clubs in Singapore.
 46.Heng had also prepared a document (P53), instructing UBS to transfer [bull ]38.1 billion from Hsiao`s account at UBS to Heng`s wife`s account. Heng alleged that the money would be in the account of an investment company and that he would be the trustee for the money. However, Heng did not elaborate on the types of investments which the company would undertake.
 47.
 Chao Ping Yuan`s defence
Chao testified that he had known Hsiao since 1992 or 1993. Sometime in November 1995, he met Okada for the first time. In January 1996, Hsiao approached him and asked if he had any friends in Singapore who could assist in the `collection` of P12, which belonged to Okada. By collection, Chao referred to the procedure of opening a bank account, confirming P12, transferring the funds from the issuing bank to the receiving bank and crediting the amount of P12 into the owner`s account.
 48.Chao then contacted PK Goh in Singapore and faxed a copy of P12 to him. In early January 1996, Chao and Hsiao made a trip to Singapore and Goh introduced them to Heng. Thereafter, Chao and Hsiao returned to Taiwan. On 29 January 1996, Chao received some instructions from Hsiao by phone, and was told to fax them together with another document P74 to Heng. In gist, Heng was instructed to look for a bank to accept the draft P12 and to make the necessary arrangements for the encashment of P12. Heng was also to find out how long it would take before P12 would be encashed and, in order to protect Heng`s interest, Okada would be made to sign an irrevocable instruction to pay 3% of the proceeds of P12 to Heng.
 49.Another set of instructions (P55) was also sent to Heng by Chao upon Hsiao`s instructions. P55 consisted of a time frame which Heng had to follow in respect of the clearance of the bank draft. A further letter, P56, was also faxed to Heng on 7 March 1996. Again, this letter contained instructions relating to the encashment of P12. Oddly enough, Chao had also appended his bank account number and details on P56. However, he explained that it was to show his sincerity in doing business with Heng, as he did not know Heng well. This way, Heng could check on Chao`s creditworthiness with the bank if he was in doubt.
 50.All in all, Chao denied that he was involved in any conspiracy to assist Okada to defraud the banks. He claimed to be ignorant of the details relating to the encashment of P12 and had no knowledge of the trips that were made by the others to UBS and RNB in February 1996. He stated that he was merely following Hsiao`s instructions and helping him to liaise with Heng. Moreover, he believed P12 to be genuine and was not surprised by the large amount reflected on P12 as he had once seen a bank draft for US$2 trillion.
 51.
 Shudo Seiji`s defence
Shudo first saw P12 with Hsiao sometime in December 1995. At that time, Shudo already knew of Okada`s background. He also knew that she had previously been questioned by the Japanese police for attempting to deposit a forged [bull ]45 billion bank draft purportedly issued by the Taiyo Kobe Bank in Japan on 13 April 1989.
 52.Shudo believed that Okada was the daughter of the late Emperor Showa and that P12 was genuine. Okada told him that she wanted to convert P12 into cash to be used after the public hearing in the USA had ended. Okada also informed him that she had approached American Express Bank who had told her that P12 was genuine. However, she explained that she could not open an account at the American Express Bank as there was an opening fee of US$200,000 and she did not have the funds.
 53.Okada further said that, since he was interested in continuing education, she would make an investment in him and would transfer a sum of money from the proceeds of P12 to him for `educational, development and scientific purposes`. Shudo`s defence was that he was merely an interpreter acting under the instructions of Okada, and did not do anything beyond the scope of his job as such. In fact, he charged Okada an interpretation fee of US$400 to US$500 per document. However, despite his claim that he was merely an interpreter, Shudo had drafted a document, P38, which Okada was made to sign, and in which it was stated that he would receive 2% of the proceeds of P12. In any event, he maintained that he was not aware that Hsiao had asked Heng to prepare a document to transfer 15% of the proceeds of P12 to Hsiao.
 54.
 Nomura Taiji`s defence
Nomura was first introduced to Okada by one Sohara Kado in February or March 1992. Sohara was described as a priest and a member of the Japanese imperial family, being the illegitimate son of Prince Chichibunomiya, the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito. Sohara wanted to establish whether Okada was truly the daughter of the Emperor Showa.
 55.Nomura subsequently met up with Okada on numerous occasions and claimed that over time he came to believe that she was indeed the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Hirohito. First, Okada wore a 16-petalled chrysanthemum emblem, which indicated that she was connected to the Japanese imperial family, as only members of the imperial family were allowed to wear that emblem. Second, Okada`s name card and her letterhead bore the imperial family`s insignia of the 16-petalled chrysanthemum.
 56.Third, Okada had shown Nomura a letter written and signed by one Uehara Takako, the mistress of the then chairman of DKB, Mr Miyazaki, which in effect stated that Uehara believed that Okada was the daughter of Emperor Hirohito. Nomura was also informed by Okada that she had previously been investigated and questioned at length by the American Embassy in Tokyo as to her Imperial background and they were satisfied that she was the real daughter of the Emperor Showa. Nomura was also shown a collection of name cards of important and powerful people in Japan who had visited her at her residence.
 57.By then, Nomura already knew of the infamous incident when Okada was arrested by the police in Japan for trying to deposit a forged bank draft of [bull ]45 million although she was subsequently released without being charged with any offence. Nomura was shown a newspaper report of the incident by Okada herself. Okada maintained that the draft was genuine, although Nomura never asked her why it had not been cleared.
 58.Sometime at the end of 1995, Okada called him and asked for a loan of [bull ]1 million as she wanted to go to the USA to hold a public hearing as she alleged that her father`s will was in the hands of President Clinton. Nomura made a gift of [bull ]1 million to her for this purpose. In January 1996, Nomura gave Okada another [bull ]2 million for her expenses.
 59.It was Nomura`s evidence that he had no part in Okada`s decision to go to Singapore, and all Okada told him was that she was going to UBS in Singapore to `confirm` the draft, to prove that she was the daughter of the Emperor Showa. In fact, Nomura did not even know that Okada had made a trip to the American Express Bank in Singapore sometime in late January or early February 1996. Okada explained to him that she did not wish to confirm the draft in any bank in Japan for fear that the draft would be confiscated. In any event, Nomura did not know that she wanted to encash P12.
 60.In early February 1996, Okada showed him a list of persons whom she intended to reward for their assistance, and Nomura was one of them. Subsequently, on 11 March 1996, Nomura accompanied Okada to Singapore upon her invitation. He decided to accompany her as he was concerned for her safety and at the same time he wanted to do some sightseeing. Whilst in Singapore, Nomura did not accompany Okada to UBS or RNB.
 61.
 The decision below
The prosecution had applied to impeach Okada`s credit, based on the inconsistencies in her testimony in court with her evidence given in her statement to the CAD. Okada did not challenge the admissibility of this statement and accepted that it had been made voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise. The trial judge found that Okada had given numerous and conflicting reasons for the discrepancies in her testimony and ruled in favour of the prosecution`s application that her credit be impeached.
 62.However, the trial judge was mindful that, although Okada`s credit had been impeached, the parts of the statement which were inconsistent with Okada`s testimony, and which were used to impeach her credit, could be used as evidence of the facts under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). The trial judge accepted as evidence of the fact that Okada had intended to go to UBS and RNB to deposit and encash P12.
 63.In assessing Okada`s evidence, the trial judge also took into account the opinion of Dr Chan Khim Yew, the consultant psychiatrist with the Changi Prison Service, who had interviewed Okada on a few occasions and diagnosed that she was suffering from some features of delusional disorder of the grandiose type. A delusion, in psychiatry, was a false belief that was held in the face of incontrovertible or overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Dr Chan stated that there was a relatively encapsulated system of beliefs centring on Okada owning vast sums of money left to her by Emperor Hirohito. At the end of the day, the trial judge treated Okada`s evidence with the greatest caution and scepticism, and attached no weight to it.
 64.In any event, even without Okada`s testimony, there was other evidence to show that all the accused persons were guilty as charged. The trial judge found that Hsiao, Heng, Shudo and Chao were not reliable and truthful witnesses and that they had reason to believe that P12 was a forgery, based on certain remarks made by them in their statements to the CAD, which they conceded were made voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise, and based on their conduct leading up to their attempts to encash P12 at UBS and RNB. The trial judge concluded that the sum total of their evidence showed that there was a conspiracy amongst Hsiao, Heng, Shudo and Chao to assist Okada to encash P12.
 65.As for Nomura, the trial judge found that he had reason to believe that P12 was a forgery, based on the fact that Nomura himself had expressed some doubts over the existence of such a bank draft, and on the contradictory answers given in cross-examination, amongst other things. The trial judge observed that anyone with Nomura`s level of intelligence (Nomura being a university graduate) would have been suspicious of Okada, given the ostentatious status that she claimed for herself and the large sum of money that she claimed to have. The trial judge also found that Nomura knew that Okada would encash P12. All in all, the trial judge concluded that Nomura was not a credible witness.
 66.
 The issues on appeal
Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Shudo were charged with conspiracy to assist, and Nomura was charged with aiding and abetting Okada in the offence of using as genuine a forged document under ss 471 and 109 of the Penal Code. Section 471 states: 
Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document, shall be punished in the same manner as if he had forged such document.
 Under s 467, the offence of forgery of a valuable security is punishable with imprisonment for life, or for a term which may extend to ten years, and in addition the offender can be liable to a fine.
 67.All the appellants appealed against conviction and sentence. Heng, however, had chosen not to appeal. As such, the main issues which I had to consider were whether: (a). P12 was a forgery;
 (b). the accused persons knew or had reason to believe that P12 was a forgery;
 (c). in the case of Hsiao, Chao and Shudo, there was a conspiracy among them to aid Okada in using P12;
 (d). in the case of Nomura, he had aided and abetted Okada; and
 (e). the sentences were manifestly excessive.
 68.
 Was the bank draft (P12) a forgery?
The evidence was clear and uncontroverted that P12 was indeed a forgery. There was more than ample evidence to prove this. First, Yap Bei Seng from the Department of Scientific Services had examined P12 and compared it with a genuine draft issued by DKB. As an expert witness, he had concluded that P12 was a forgery. I find no reason to doubt Yap`s finding.
 69.Second, Hakujun Tamaki, a Senior Assistant Manager of the Bills Department of DKB in Singapore also opined that P12 was not a bank draft issued by DKB. Third, Daniel Teo, the Compliance Officer from RNB testified that he had conducted checks with DKB in Tokyo, and was informed by them that they had never issued such a draft. This was confirmed in writing by DKB Japan on 14 March 1996.
 70.
 Did Hsiao know or have reason to believe that P12 was forged?
The test of knowledge has been comprehensively defined in a dearth of cases. In 
PP v Koo Pui Fong
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 266
 , I stated at p 271A that 
it would be reasonable to say that a person `knows` a certain fact if he is aware that it exists or is almost certain that it exists or will exist or occur. Thus knowledge entails a high degree of certainty.
 71.Further, I explained in 
Chiaw Wai Onn v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 445
  that if it could be shown that the appellant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious, then it could be inferred from the circumstances that he had the requisite guilty knowledge. In 
 PP v Koo Pui Fong 
, I also explained that the concept of wilful blindness 
does not introduce a new state of mind to that of knowing (see 
R v Griffiths
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 14
). It is simply a reformulation of actual knowledge. It seems to me that it is wholly in keeping with common sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred. Thus, I fully agree with the passage of Lord Bridge in 
Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd
 
[1986] 83 Cr App R 155
 at p 164:
 
` it is always open to the tribunal of fact, when knowledge on the part of a defendant is required to be proved, to base a finding of knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion confirmed.`
 72.As to what is sufficient to constitute a `reason to believe`, 
Koh Hak Boon v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 427
  laid down the test as follows: 
It is apparent from the cases that `reason to believe` involves a lesser degree of conviction than certainty and a higher one than speculation
 
Whether or not a person had `reason to believe` certain property was stolen for the purposes of ss 411 and 414 is a test to be applied by the court, but from the perspective of the accused person. It must relate to the standards of belief of a reasonable man and not to those of any particular accused person, since the legislature could hardly have intended that, ceteris paribus, a conviction might depend on whether the accused reasons like a cretin or a genius. However, some element of subjectivity must be involved, because what might be apparent to a person with specialized knowledge of a certain field might not be apparent to a layman of even very high intelligence The logical conclusion was that the court must assume the 
 position
 of the actual individual involved (ie including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man.
 73.Applying the above passages to the present facts, it was clear that Hsiao had the requisite knowledge, or must have at least known that P12 was forged. First, Hsiao himself stated that, when he first saw P12, he was surprised by the huge amount and made known to Okada his doubts. As the draft was issued seven years ago he asked her why she had not encashed it. One of the reasons given by her was that she did not want to present P12 to a bank in Japan as she was afraid that the bank might confiscate it. Any reasonable and sensible person would have enquired as to why P12 would be confiscated by a Japanese bank, unless there were something suspicious or strange circumstances surrounding the bank draft.
 74.Second, although Hsiao subsequently said that he was satisfied that the draft was genuine, his explanation for dispelling his doubts was unsatisfactory. According to him, he had advised Okada to write to DKB in Japan to obtain a confirmation of P12. Okada wrote to DKB but DKB did not reply. Okada then told Hsiao that there was a law in Japan which stated that if there was no reply, that meant that DKB had accepted the draft to be genuine.
 75.Undoubtedly Hsiao is man of vast and varied experience. He is a retired colonel, having served in the Taiwanese army, and currently a member of various non-governmental organisations and a businessman. I was not convinced that a man of his experience and knowledge would have accepted Okada`s words without an express confirmation from DKB.
 76.As the trial judge rightly pointed out, if DKB had indeed confirmed by their silence that P12 had been issued by them and that it was genuine, there would have been no reason for Okada to send two more letters to DKB. I would add that if DKB had indeed accepted P12 as genuine, there would be no need for Okada to travel abroad to confirm the draft again and to encash it when she could have done so in Japan.
 77.Third, Hsiao admitted that he was familiar with bank drafts issued by Japanese banks and that this was not the first time he had seen a DKB draft. He also admitted that he was aware that, to encash P12, the issuing bank had to verify the draft. His testimony revealed that he knew that he had his doubts about the authenticity of P12 and that its verification was important to confirm whether the draft was genuine or not.
 78.Yet, his actions belied his words. If he knew that only the issuing bank, which was in Japan, could verify the draft, it would seem odd for him to come to Singapore to do so. Hsiao also had doubts over Okada`s ownership of the funds that were allegedly deposited in DKB, yet he chose not to enquire whether she had any money in her DKB account for P12 to be encashed.
 79.Hsiao was evasive when questioned about whether there was a plan to encash P12. At first, he maintained that he merely wanted to confirm or verify P12`s authenticity. However, when pressed further, he admitted that he had intended to convert P12 into cash and had conveyed his intention to Charles Ng of UBS. His evasive and often contradictory evidence suggested that he was trying to distance himself from the criminal activity.
 80.It was evident from the above instances that Hsiao had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want his suspicions confirmed. Moreover, apart from finding that he had the requisite mens rea, it was apparent to me that Hsiao had played an active role in helping Okada to encash P12.
 81.The evidence of PK Goh, Lena Ho and Stephanie Chan showed that Hsiao participated actively both before and during the meetings at the banks and that he was not an innocent bystander as he made himself out to be. At times, Hsiao and Heng would lead the discussions at the banks without consulting Okada. It was also clear from Lena`s and Stephanie`s evidence that the purpose of the visit to the banks was to encash P12. I agreed with the trial judge that there was no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Lena and Stephanie, as they were independent witnesses with no reason to lie.
 82.In fact, Hsiao did more than just assist Okada to encash P12. He had handsome incentives for ensuring the encashment of P12. The distribution agreements, P37, P38 and P39, dated 15 February 1996, showed that Hsiao, Shudo and Heng had made an agreement with Okada to distribute part of the funds to themselves once P12 was encashed.
 83.There was also the `Irrevocable Instruction` (P27) dated 12 March 1996 which stated that 15% of the face value of P12 was to be transferred to Hsiao`s personal account at UBS. Initially Hsiao feigned ignorance by claiming that he did not know the reason for drafting P27. Later on, Hsiao alleged that the money would be used to compensate Taiwanese war victims and for the setting up of international clubs. However, there was nothing in P27, P37 or any of the other documents to show that the money was for these purposes. As such, there was no restriction on how Hsiao could use the money once it was transferred into his account.
 84.In addition, there was also the incriminating fax, P56, in which Hsiao and Chao instructed Heng to transfer the money once they had obtained it, to a Swiss bank `via the fastest possible way so that it would not be frozen together with Sadako Okada`s own funds`. All in all, I was satisfied that the trial judge was correct in finding that Hsiao had the requisite knowledge and had played an active role in abetting Okada to attempt to encash P12.
 85.
 Was Shudo guilty?
Shudo`s defence was that he was merely an interpreter acting under Okada`s instructions and that he believed P12 to be genuine. In his statement to the CAD, he admitted that he knew that Okada had tried unsuccessfully to encash P12 at DKB in Japan. Okada said that DKB had refused to accept P12 as she could not prove that she was the daughter of Emperor Hirohito and, in any event, the bank had dissipated all her money.
 86.Shudo also admitted that had P12 been genuine, DKB would not have been concerned about whether Okada was really the daughter of Emperor Hirohito. However, Shudo then ludicrously suggested that, if the draft was cashed in Singapore, DKB in Japan would have to accept the draft and pay out the sum even if they did not acknowledge that draft in Japan.
 87.It was difficult to believe that Shudo, a well-educated man, with a master`s degree and in the process of getting his doctorate, as well as managing an export company, would so readily accept Okada`s wild and fanciful claims to be the daughter of the Emperor Showa, without doing any independent research into her background.
 88.In fact, when cross-examined, Shudo admitted that he suspected that P12 was not genuine and it may have been a photocopy duplicate given by DKB to Okada. He also knew that Okada was in substance not a rich woman, as he readily stated that she did not have any money apart from her pension, which she spent only on daily necessities.
 89.It was also pertinent to note that Shudo was aware that Okada had previously tried to deposit a forged [bull ]45 billion draft in Japan and had been detained by the police for questioning. In light of all the above facts, the only irresistible conclusion which could be drawn was that Shudo knew that P12 was forged.
 90.As for his participation in the offences, Shudo was clearly acting beyond his role as interpreter. It was Shudo`s own testimony that Okada had informed him that she wanted to encash P12 and the proceeds from there would be used after the conclusion of the public hearing in the USA. Shudo then consulted Hsiao on the procedure for encashment. Shudo had also translated P12, P37, P38, P39 and the certificate of deposit, P18, into English and these documents were presented by Okada to UBS and RNB when she attempted to encash the draft. His involvement with these documents indicated his in-depth knowledge of how the funds in P12 would be distributed. He was also present at the meetings at UBS and RNB.
 91.In addition, Okada had signed the letter of consent to distribution, P38, giving Shudo 2% of P12, which amounted to [yen ]25.4 billion. Shudo claimed that Okada had given him the money because he liked to study and that the funds would be held on trust for educational, development and scientific purposes. Yet, there was nothing on the face of P38 to show that the funds were for such purposes, nor that Shudo would be the trustee of such a fund.
 92.All in all, I could not help but agree with the trial judge that Shudo was not a reliable and truthful witness. It was clear that he had taken advantage of Okada`s deluded state of mind for his own benefit and gain.
 93.
 Was Chao guilty?
As with Hsiao, I was extremely doubtful of Chao`s claim that he was unaware that P12 was forged. It was clear that Chao had his doubts about the funds purportedly comprised in P12. He knew that Okada did not have the assets to back up P12 when, in his fax to Heng dated 7 February 1996 (P56), he stated: `Besides this bank draft, Okada has no other assets and [sic] worthless, further more she was unable to explain the usage of the fund.`
 94.Moreover, the fact that the draft was issued seven years ago should have aroused his suspicion. I doubted that Chao or any other reasonable man in his position would have been satisfied that P12 was genuine, merely by relying on Okada`s own claim that she was the illegitimate daughter of the Emperor Showa, given that the sum in the draft was so exorbitant and that he did not know nor had chosen to enquire about her background or her assets.
 95.Although Chao was not present during Okada`s visits to UBS and RNB, I was nevertheless satisfied that he had actively participated in the entire scheme. PK Goh had testified that it was Chao who had approached Goh and asked Goh to recommend someone to help in encashing P12. Chao admitted that he knew that Okada, Hsiao and Shudo would be making a trip to Singapore to request Heng to introduce them to a bank. He was also aware that P12 was to be encashed in Singapore and that it was subsequently handed over to RNB.
 96.In fact, on 29 January 1996, prior to Okada`s visits to UBS and RNB, Chao had faxed to Heng P54, which was the schedule for depositing P12. In P54, Heng was instructed to look for a bank which could accept the bank draft, to carry out the necessary procedures for acceptance of the draft and to revert back to him on the arrangements. It was also stipulated in P54 that there would be a 3% remuneration and that Okada would sign an `Irrevocable Instruction`.
 97.In addition, P56, another letter faxed by Chao to Heng on 7 March 1996, after P12 had been received by RNB, showed that Chao had instructed Heng on what to do with the money once P12 was accepted and cleared. For instance, there were instructions that the money had to be transferred to a `Swiss bank via fastest possible way so that it would not be frozen together with Sadako Okada`s own funds. You are clever people, there is no need for me to explain further.` It was also stated in P56 that `Besides this bank draft, Okada has no other funds and [sic] worthless, further more she was unable to explain the usage of the fund.`
 98.Strangely, at the bottom of P56, Chao appended the details of his Taiwanese bank account. I found Chao`s explanation, that he wanted to show his sincerity in doing business with Heng as he did not know him well, to be quite absurd, given that Chao was in a business venture with Heng and there was no reason for Heng to want to check his creditworthiness.
 99.It was clear that Chao`s faxes, P54, P55 and P56, were very telling of his, Heng`s and Hsiao`s intention to enrich themselves by fleecing Okada of part of her money and to dissipate the funds before they could be traced. Moreover, Chao admitted in his statement to the CAD officer that he would be rewarded if the transaction to encash P12 succeeded. I was satisfied that, in the light of the evidence, Chao was not merely following Hsiao`s instructions but was in fact instrumental in getting the parties together to assist Okada to encash P12.
 100.
 Heng`s participation
Although Heng has not appealed against his conviction and sentence, it would nonetheless be appropriate to deal briefly with his participation in the offences in order to obtain a complete picture of the entire conspiracy scheme. Heng claimed that he was acting as a mere introducer when he recommended Okada and Hsiao to the banks. He stated that, to be an introducer, one should be known by the bank and should be of good character. Yet his words contradicted his actions.
 101.Charles and Lena from UBS had never met him prior to this, neither Stephanie from RNB. There was no evidence that he had previously held an account with either of the banks. According to Charles and Stephanie, Heng introduced himself as a former officer of DBS and an ex-director of a company called Bonvest. Heng later admitted that he had never been an officer with DBS or a director of Bonvest. More pertinently, Heng was an undischarged bankrupt when he made the introductions at UBS and RNB, but he did not inform them of this. Given Heng`s deception, the trial judge thus found that he was not an honest and credible witness.
 102.Heng also said that, although he had never seen such a huge sum before, he was not the least suspicious as he had been informed by Hsiao that the draft belonged to a Japanese princess. He was not concerned that the draft was seven years old as he felt that it would be for the bank to authenticate. In any event, he claimed to have no interest in the encashment of P12. Again, his conduct suggested otherwise.
 103.It was Heng who had made the enquiries before arranging for the meetings at UBS and RNB. According to Charles and Stephanie, Heng and Hsiao dominated the meetings at the banks. After the meeting at UBS, Charles was to contact Okada through Heng. When UBS refused to accept P12, it was Heng who tried to persuade them otherwise. Similarly at RNB, Heng was acting as intermediary between Okada and Stephanie.
 104.In addition, P54, P55 and P56 were all faxed by Chao to Heng detailing how the entire scheme would be executed. Another piece of damning evidence was P39, the letter of `Consent to Distribution` which was signed by Okada on 15 February 1996, whereby Okada consented to transferring 3% of the proceeds of P12 to Heng`s account. All these led to the trial judge`s conclusion that it was apparent that Heng was engaged in the conspiracy with Hsiao, Shudo and Chao right from the outset.
 105.
 The elements of conspiracy
In 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , it was held that the essence of conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement would take place in private such that direct evidence of it would rarely be available. Moreover, there is no requirement in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other`s company throughout or at all.
 106.A conspiracy may be proved by oral or circumstantial evidence, as well as the conduct of the accused both before and after the alleged commission of the crime - 
Vinit Sopon & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 226
 . As I stated in 
 PP v Yeo Choon Poh 
 at p 873H: 
One method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
 107.As for the element of mens rea as an ingredient in aiding and abetting and in conspiracy, Lord Goddard CJ in 
Johnson v Youden & Ors
 
[1950] 1 KB 544
 at p 546 explained: 
Before a person can be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence he must at least know the essential matters which constitute that offence. He need not actually know that an offence has been committed, because he may not know that the facts constitute an offence and ignorance of the law is not a defence. If a person knows all the facts and is assisting another person to do certain things, and it turns out that the doing of those things constitutes an offence, the person who is assisting is guilty of aiding and abetting that offence, because to allow him to say, `I knew of all those facts but I did not know that an offence was committed,` would be allowing him to set up ignorance of the law as a defence.
 108.In 
Churchill v Walton
 
[1967] 1 All ER 497
, Viscount Dilhorne in the House of Lords further propounded at p 500 as follows: 
As has often been said, the offence of conspiracy is the making of an agreement to do an unlawful act. It is the character and content of the agreement that matters, and the accused`s knowledge of what in fact has been done is relevant if it throws light on that. Proof of a conspiracy in most cases depends on inferences to be drawn from the conduct of the parties.
 
The definition of it is simply an agreement to do an unlawful act It does not matter how prosaic the unlawful act may be or how ignorant the conspirators may be of the fact that the act is prohibited by the statutory provision.
 109.Viscount Dilhorne also approved of the passage by Lord Goddard CJ in 
 Johnson v Youden & Ors 
 (cited above), and added: 
I would say that mens rea is only an essential ingredient in conspiracy insofar as there must be an intention to be a party to an agreement to do an unlawful act; that knowledge of the law on the part of the accused is immaterial, and that knowledge of the facts is only material insofar as such knowledge throws a light on what was agreed. In cases of this kind, it is desirable to avoid the use of the phrase `mens rea`, which is capable of different meanings, and to concentrate on the terms or effect of the agreement made by the alleged conspirators. The question is `What did they agree to do?` If what they agreed to do was, on the facts known to them, an unlawful act, they are guilty of conspiracy and cannot excuse themselves by saying that, owing to their ignorance of the law, they did not realise that such an act was a crime. If, on the facts known to them, what they agreed to do was lawful, they are not rendered artificially guilty by the existence of other facts, not known to them, giving a different and criminal quality to the act agreed on.
 110.Thus, in essence, although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details. However, they must at least be aware of the general purpose of the plot and that plot must be unlawful. The test of guilt is not what was the object of the accused, but whether having regard to the immediate object of the instigation or conspiracy, the act done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and commonsense, the abettor must have seen as foreseeable - see 
 The Penal Law of India 
 by Sir Hari Singh Gour at p 945.
 111.Based on the above principles, I was satisfied that the trial judge had rightly concluded that there was a conspiracy amongst Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Shudo to assist Okada to encash P12. There was clear evidence that they all knew or had reason to believe that P12 was forged and that Okada intended to encash it at a bank in Singapore. It was irrelevant that, at the time the conspiracy was hatched, they did not know of the exact bank at which Okada was intending to encash P12, nor was it necessary that they should have been informed of all the details of the common design. All in all, the trial judge rightly summed up the conspiracy as follows: 
There was first the introduction of Okada to Hsiao in mid-November 1995. Shudo was also introduced to Okada at about the same time. There was also the evidence that Shudo had prepared the translations for P12 and P20. It was Hsiao who suggested that Okada come to Singapore to encash P12. Chao shared the same office as Hsiao and was responsible for introducing Heng to the others. Chao also corresponded with Heng pursuant to Hsiao`s instructions concerning the schedule for depositing P12 and the withdrawal of funds thereafter (P54 and P55). Heng was tasked to make enquiries concerning the opening of accounts at the UBS and the RNB. Chao, Hsiao and Shudo accompanied Okada when she came to Singapore for the first time in January 1996. Hsiao, Shudo and Heng had prepared agreements with Okada to distribute the funds once they were received (P37 to P39). Hsiao and Heng drafted `irrevocable instructions` to transfer the funds (P27, P52 and P53). Hsiao, Shudo and Heng accompanied Okada on her visits to the UBS and the RNB and played prominent roles in the discussions with the bank officers. It was clear to my mind that the first four accused engaged with one other in a conspiracy to assist Okada.
 112.
 Was Nomura guilty?
I was satisfied that the trial judge was correct in coming to the conclusion that Nomura knew or must have known that P12 was a forgery. Nomura said that he first met Okada sometime in February or March 1992 whereupon she introduced herself as the daughter of Emperor Hirohito. Okada told him that she had once been arrested by the police in Japan when she tried to encash a [bull ]45 billion bank draft issued on 13 April 1989 by the Taiyo Kobe Bank in Japan but subsequently no charges were filed against her. Okada however maintained that the [bull ]45 billion draft was genuine.
 113.It was strange that Nomura did not then ask Okada why the [bull ]45 billion draft was not cleared. The fact that Okada had previously tried unsuccessfully to encash a draft which turned out to be forged should have put Nomura, a university graduate, on the alert that P12 may similarly be suspect. Moreover, if the Taiyo Kobe bank draft had indeed been genuine, there would have been no reason for Okada to ask Nomura to lend her money to go to the USA to convene a public hearing, as she would have more than sufficient funds to pay for her trip. On the contrary, Nomura gave Okada [bull ]4 million without asking any questions and without expecting anything in return.
 114.In any event, it was Nomura`s own evidence that he was doubtful if a bank draft of such a large amount as in P12 could exist. When he first saw P12, he was not sure if it was genuine or not. Moreover, Nomura admitted that he did not necessarily believe everything that was told to him by Okada.
 115.Nomura was also informed by Okada that she had no confidence in the banks in Japan and did not wish to encash P12 there for fear that the draft would be taken away. As such, she wanted the draft to be confirmed overseas to prove her true identity. However, Nomura further added that had he doubted the authenticity of P12, he would have immediately checked with the bank concerned. It is clear from this statement that Nomura knew that the only bank which could confirm P12 was the issuing DKB bank in Japan. If so, how could he possibly believe that Okada could confirm P12 overseas if she could not have done it in Japan?
 116.It was pertinent to note that Nomura knew that the person who had handed Okada the [bull ]45 billion bank draft was the same person who had given her P12, namely one Sawa Tsunashi. This fact should have aroused his suspicion. Strangely, in light of this, Nomura claimed that he became more convinced that the Taiyo Kobe draft was genuine, despite several newspaper reports in Japan (which Nomura had seen) which had stated otherwise! I could not but agree with the trial judge that Nomura`s attitude went against the face of reason and that the only irresistible inference one could arrive at was that Nomura must have had reason to believe that P12 was forged.
 117.In addition, Nomura also admitted that Sohara, an alleged member of the imperial family, had wanted him to establish the true identity of Okada. Nomura was thus aware that he had to conduct independent investigations into Okada`s claims, yet he did not do so. I found it difficult to believe that a person of his educational background and experience would have blindly accepted Okada`s claims without any independent verification or research. In fact, in cross-examination, Nomura admitted that Okada was not recognised as a member of the Japanese imperial family.
 118.As the trial judge rightly put it: 
anyone with Nomura`s level of intelligence would have been suspicious of Okada given the ostentatious status she claimed for herself and the large sum of money that she claimed to have. Nomura was portraying himself to be a naive man who believed wholeheartedly all the reasons given by Okada herself that she was a princess. Given his educational level, he was turning a blind eye to the suspicious circumstances. The fact that Sohara, an alleged member of the imperial family, was not even sure that Okada was a princess and had sought his assistance on her identity spoke volumes for itself.
 119.The line of cross-examination revealed that all along Nomura had doubted Okada`s claim to be the daughter of Emperor Hirohito as well as the genuineness of P12. On the one hand, he claimed to believe that Okada was the daughter of Emperor Hirohito; on the other hand, he stated that he was not sure but said that the confirmation of P12 would prove her identity. Yet, P12 was a seven year old bearer draft without a payee`s name and which Okada was afraid to encash in Japan.
 120.The next issue which I had to consider was whether Nomura`s acts were sufficient to constitute aiding and abetting Okada in the commission of the principal offences. Nomura claimed that he had not taken any part in Okada`s decision to go to Singapore and all that he had done was to give her some money and to accompany her on her final trip to Singapore. Thus, unlike Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Shudo, his degree of participation was not substantial.
 121.Section 107 of the Penal Code states that a person abets the doing of a thing if he instigates any person to do that thing. In 
Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 , it was stated that the act of aiding is not confined only to an act carried out or executed at the time of the commission of the principal act. The act of aiding might take place before the principal act, so long as it was carried out in order to facilitate the commission of the offence and did in fact facilitate the commission thereof.
 122.In 
R v Bainbridge
 
[1960] 1 QB 129
, a bank was broken into by means of oxygen cutting equipment. It was later found that the equipment had been purchased by the appellant some six weeks earlier. He was charged with being accessory before the fact to office-breaking, the case against him being that he had bought the equipment on behalf of the thieves with full knowledge that it was to be used for the purposes of breaking and entering premises. The appellant admitted that he had suspected that the equipment was wanted for something illegal, but denied that he had knowledge that it was to be used for any such purpose as it was used. The trial judge found that he had aided and abetted the thieves. In dismissing the appeal, Lord Parker CJ stated at p 133: 
The court fully appreciates that it is not enough that it should be shown that a man knows that some illegal venture is intended. To take this case, it would not be enough if he knew - he says he only suspected - that the equipment was going to be used to dispose of stolen property. That would not be enough. Equally, this court is quite satisfied that it is unnecessary that knowledge of the particular crime which was in fact committed should be shown to his knowledge to have been intended, and by `particular crime` I am using the words in the same way in which Mr Simpson used them, namely, on a particular date and particular premises.
 123.Lord Parker further added, quoting from a passage in 
 Foster`s Crown Cases 
 (3rd Ed, 1809) at p 369 that: 
If the principal totally and substantially varieth, if being solicited to commit a felony of one kind he wilfully and knowingly committeth a felony of another, he will stand single in that offence, and the person soliciting will not be involved in his guilt. For on his part it was no more than a fruitless ineffectual temptation,` the converse, of course, being that if the principal does not totally and substantially vary the advice or help and does not wilfully and knowingly commit a different form of felony altogether, the man who has advised or helped, aided or abetted, will be guilty as an accessory before the fact.
 124.In the above case, the appellant was convicted as he had bought the oxygen cutting equipment for the principal offenders with the knowledge that it would be used for a crime of the type in question, namely for the purpose of breaking into premises to steal.
 125.Returning to the present scenario, I observed that on the first two occasions (ie on 30 December 1995 and 22 January 1996), Nomura had given Okada money. Nomura was led by Okada to believe that the money was for her trip to the USA to convene a public hearing, and not for the purposes of coming to Singapore to encash P12. According to Nomura, he was not aware that Okada had used the money to come to Singapore. In the circumstances, those two acts could not amount to acts of aiding and abetting in the commission of the offence, as the help extended by Nomura was for a different (and innocent) purpose other than what was eventually carried out by Okada.
 126.However, when Nomura subsequently gave Okada a further [bull ]2 million on 11 February 1996, he knew that Okada wanted it for the purposes of coming to Singapore to encash P12. This was admitted by Nomura in his statement to the CAD. Just a few days before that, Okada informed Nomura that he was one of the people whom she intended to reward for his assistance. This was evidenced by a handwritten note by Nomura (P40), which contained a list of persons whom Okada had intended to reward, and in which it was stated that Nomura would himself obtain [bull ]2 billion. Nomura claimed that he had compiled the list of persons in P40 `for fun`.
 127.I did not believe that Nomura would have compiled P40 for the `fun` of it. No doubt, having heard that he would stand to gain from his assistance to Okada, this must have prompted him to give a further [bull ]2 million to her in February, as well as to make the necessary travel and accommodation arrangements and to accompany her to Singapore. His actions went towards showing that he wanted to help Okada in whatever way possible to ensure that she would indeed come to Singapore to encash P12, as it was now in his interest to ensure that P12 would be encashed.
 128.In my opinion, the above acts were carried out in order to facilitate the commission of the offences and did in fact facilitate their commission. Without Nomura`s financial backing, Okada would have been unable to travel to Singapore to attempt to encash P12. Nomura also aided Okada by accompanying her to Singapore and settled the necessary travel and accommodation arrangements for her. As stated by Lord Parker CJ in 
 R v Bainbridge 
, it was irrelevant whether Nomura knew of Okada`s visit to RNB or to any specific bank, so long as he knew that his assistance was rendered to enable Okada to encash P12 in Singapore.
 129.Thus, I was of the view that the offences against Nomura had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although he did not participate as actively as Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Shudo, nevertheless I was satisfied that his participation was such that it was sufficient to constitute acts which were carried out in order to facilitate the commission of the offences and did in fact facilitate the commission of them.

 Conclusion
The role of the appellate court has been consistently defined in numerous cases. In 
PP v Hla Win
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
 , the Court of Appeal stated that an appellate court would not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge had seen and observed when giving evidence, unless the findings were clearly against the weight of the evidence and insupportable. The appellate court should generally defer to the conclusion which the trial judge had formed on findings of fact, including a finding of inferential fact of knowledge, based on the credibility of witnesses.
 131.Having examined the entire matter, I was not minded to disturb the trial judge`s findings that all the appellants were unreliable and untruthful witnesses. I was also satisfied that there was ample evidence to show that all the appellants knew or must have had reason to believe that P12 was forged and that Okada had intended to make use of the forgery, by attempting to encash P12. At the very least, they had deliberately refrained from making the necessary enquiries on whether Okada was indeed a Japanese princess or whether P12 was genuine, and thus, had deliberately shut their eyes to the obvious. The appellants had merely played along with Okada`s fantasies and got in on the scam in the hope of making a killing each.
 132.As such, I dismissed all the appeals against conviction.
 133.
 Sentences
The maximum punishment provided for an offence under s 471 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for life, or for a term which may extend to ten years, and the offender is also liable to a fine.
 134.In deciding the appropriate number of years of imprisonment, the trial judge had taken into account that the amount was astronomical and would have caused severe financial problems for DKB had the accused persons been able to pull off their stunt. There was also a great deal of planning and organisation among Hsiao, Heng, Chao and Shudo. As such, the trial judge thought that a severe punishment was appropriate and sentenced Hsiao and Chao to 54 months on each charge with both sentences to run concurrently. Shudo and Nomura were sentenced to 48 months on each charge with both sentences to run concurrently.
 135.I agreed with the trial judge that the amount of the loss which could have resulted was an important factor to be taken into account in determining the severity of the sentences. However, it is not in every case that the sentence should reflect proportionately to the amount of the loss which could result to the victim. In this case, given that the amount was so astronomical, I would have thought that the appellants would have known better than to try to pull a stunt like this and think that they could get away with it. I thought that the scam was so ridiculous and absurd that it would never have succeeded in any event, and I felt that this had to be taken into account in determining the sentences for the appellants.
 136.As such, I reduced Chao`s and Hsiao`s sentences for each charge to 30 months to be concurrent, and Nomura`s and Shudo`s sentences on each charge to 24 months, also to be concurrent. I should stress that this was not meant to encourage would be offenders and potential criminals to try more daring stunts and take higher risks in the hope that their absurdity and foolishness will save them from heavier penalties.",1998-01-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW JC
 
 The charges
The appellant was charged in the court below on one count of committing an obscene act, an offence contrary to s 294(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224), and nine counts for insult of modesty, contrary to s 509 of the Penal Code. Altogether, there were ten charges and they arose out of five separate incidents involving six students from Nan Hua Primary School.
 2.In so far as relevant, s 294(a) of the Penal Code states: 
Whoever, to the annoyance of others - 
(a) does any obscene act in any public place;
 
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine, or with both.
 Section 509 of the Penal Code states: 
Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
 3.At the end of the trial, the appellant was convicted on all ten charges. For the charge under s 294(a) of the Penal Code, he was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment. For the nine charges under s 509 of the Penal Code, he was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment for each count; three of which were to run consecutively (ie the fourth, fifth and ninth charges) while the rest ran concurrently with the ninth charge. All in all, the appellant was sentenced to a total of three months` imprisonment.
 4.The appellant appealed against his convictions only. At the end of the hearing on 7 July 1998, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 5.
 The background
The events which led to the ten charges were as follows. Around mid-April 1997 at about 1.30pm, PW 4 and PW 5 were on their way to a bookstore at Clementi Interchange after school. While crossing the street via an overhead pedestrian bridge, the appellant was seen walking towards them from the opposite direction. The appellant`s trouser zipper was open, and he was holding his private part and masturbating at the same time. PW 4 was irritated by what he saw. He told his parents when he returned home, but nothing was done.
 6.A few months later, PW 4 related the incident to his school principal who had received similar complaints about a `flasher`. She proceeded to make an announcement asking anyone who had seen the `flasher` to go to her office. Following this, 15 students were brought to the Clementi police station on 7 August 1997 to identify the potential culprit.
 7.PW 4 was able to positively identify the appellant during the identification parade, and this led to the charge under s 294(a) of the Penal Code.
 8.The other incidents leading to the remaining nine charges under s 509 of the Penal Code were of a similar nature. The only difference was that they involved five female schoolgirls. They are PW 1, PW 2, PW 3, PW 5 and PW 7. On all these occasions, the appellant had either squeezed his private part or indecently exposed himself to his victims. I shall allude to these incidents shortly.
 9.It would be pertinent to narrate how the appellant came to be apprehended. Some time in July 1997, PW 1 was with her schoolmate PW 7 as they walked from school to a shop at block 407 at Clementi Avenue 1 to buy tidbits when they saw the appellant also walking towards the shop. Both schoolgirls had been victims of the appellant when he previously insulted their modesty. The two girls quickly went into the shop. The appellant was seen to leave the shop after making a purchase. PW 7 and another schoolmate, one Xiao Ting, decided to tail the appellant while PW 1 telephoned the police. As she waited for the police to arrive, PW 1 told the `aunty` at the shop that the appellant had previously exposed himself. The `aunty` then told her that one of her customers was his neighbour and gave the address of the appellant. PW 1, however, was unable to recall the unit number of the flat, although she remembered the block number as block 406.
 10.PW 7 and Xiao Ting subsequently returned to the shop, having lost track of the appellant. When the police came, PW 1 described the appellant to the police and followed them to block 406. They were unable to find the appellant and returned to the shop. The police left for their patrol car. At this point, PW 7 and PW 1 saw the appellant walking towards the shop. They hid at the back of the shop and PW 1 heard the appellant asking the `aunty` if there were two girls who made a report to the police. The `aunty` denied knowledge. Quickly, PW 7 went to the car park to get the policemen who were about to drive away. They apprehended the appellant and brought him back to the police station.
 11.The defence raised at trial was one of wrong identification, and the appellant elected to remain silent. No defence witnesses were called.
 12.
 The decision below
In reaching her decision, the trial judge held as follows: 
39 The five female victims in this case had alleged that the accused had exposed himself or squeezed his penis at the material times and place. He had in addition spoken to them while exposing himself thus drawing their attention to his acts. 
40 At the end of the trial I had no reason to doubt the evidence of all the victims with regard to the incidents encountered by them. The victims were straightforward and forthright while giving their evidence. It was not alleged by the defence that the victims had conspired against the accused to fix him up. The accused was in fact not known to them. The victims were all students at Nan H[u]a Primary School at the relevant time. They had since the commencement of the trial gone to different secondary schools. Although they had difficulty remembering the dates of the incidents, they were very certain about their encounter with the accused. 
41 On all the occasions the accused was alleged to have either exposed himself or squeezed his penis, the victims were leaving their schools in pairs. The details provided by the victims eg the accused`s attire, the location where the offence took place, the actual act done by the accused were consistent.
 13.Although the defence was one of wrong identification, the validity of the identification parade was not challenged. The trial judge therefore agreed with the prosecution that this meant the defence had accepted that the identification parade was fair, free from doubt and that the accused was properly identified by his victims. All the six victims named in the 10 charges had picked out the appellant during the identification parade. Of the six, only PW 5 conceded that she was not 100% certain during the identification parade. Further, three of the victims, PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 had encountered the appellant more than once. The accused had also spoken to them on all these occasions, and as such, they had a greater opportunity of observing him.
 14.It was also noted that, at the end of the prosecution`s case, the appellant had chosen to remain silent. The learned judge thus held that the accused`s failure to give evidence was an additional factor in the court`s consideration of the accused guilt. Accordingly, the court was satisfied that the charges against the accused had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 15.
 Issues in the appeal
In my view, the main issue in this appeal concerned the identity of the offender. There was never any allegation of fabrication or collusion by the students. There was never any denial that the incidents actually took place. Therefore, the critical question was whether the trial judge had erred in accepting the victims` identification of the appellant as the man who had indecently exposed himself and committed the obscene act.
 
 The appeal
Identification evidence
 16.The main ground of contention in the appeal was that the dates set out in the charges were wrong, and hence the appellant could not have committed the offences. In particular, it was pointed that with regard to some of the charges, the appellant was either at his workplace or in camp on reservist training. Moreover, it was submitted that, based on the information given to the police, the appellant had supposedly indecently exposed himself to 15 students. In fact, 15 students had been called by the police for the identification parade. Yet, only five of them had identified the appellant at the identification parade. And of these five, it was contended that only three identifications were of any value.
 17.It was also contended that the trial judge appeared to have wanted the appellant to enter the witness box to testify that he could not have been at the places where he was alleged to have committed the offences on the dates and times mentioned. This, it was said, was contrary to the usual burden of proof.
 18.I found the arguments set out untenable. First, the discrepancies as to the dates and time of the offences were not material in my view. I noted that the last offending act took place some time in April 1997. The appellant was apprehended on 19 July 1997, and the identification parade took place only on 7 August 1997. The present charges were thus framed some four months after the offending incidents. The passage of time had probably rendered it difficult for the victims to pin-point the exact dates and times of the offences, although they were very certain of their unpleasant encounters. That was why the trial judge allowed the prosecution to amend the dates of four of the charges.
 19.However, what was in my view crucial was whether the appellant had been properly identified by his victims as the person who committed the offences. In this respect, there was never any allegation of collusion by the students, nor that the identification parade was improperly carried out. Besides, if the appellant was relying on the defence of alibi, he should have testified as to his whereabouts. Yet, he chose to remain silent with an expectation that the court would draw inferences in his favour.
 20.I should add that it was irrelevant that only five out of 15 students were able to positively identify the appellant at the identification parade. The point was that, so long as the court was satisfied with the evidence and identification by the victims named in the charges, the fact that the other nine students could not identify the appellant would be of no consequence since they were not involved in these incidents mentioned in the charges.
 21.Turning then to the evidence given by the six victims named in the charges, the trial judge had assessed them to be credible and honest witnesses. There was no reason for them to lie nor collude against the appellant. I shall now briefly go through the identification evidence of these six students, all of whom were below 13 years of age at the material time.
 22.First, there is PW 1 who testified that she had seen the appellant squeezing his private part on three occasions. The first time, she was with PW 2. When she first saw the appellant, he was just four metres away and walking towards them in the opposite direction. As he walked past them, he said, `Here girls, I show you something but don`t tell anyone`. PW 1 said that she was able to take a good look at him because he was quite near when he walked past. The second time, she was with PW 7 when the appellant squeezed his private part and said, `Little girls, it`s dangerous for you to walk home alone.` But before he could unzip his trousers, a group of people came and he walked away. Again, PW 1 said she could see and observe the appellant clearly who was only two metres away. The third time, PW 1 was with PW 3 when they saw the appellant walking towards them in the opposite direction just two metres away. The appellant`s trousers were already unzipped and he was squeezing his private part. As he walked past, he said to them, `Little girls, don`t tell anyone.` PW 1 said that she was able to see the appellant clearly as he was very near. On all three occasions, he had spoken to her. The final encounter was the day when PW 1 saw the appellant entering the shop whereupon she called the police. At the identification parade on 7 August 1997, PW 1 was very certain as she picked out the appellant from the line-up.
 23.Second, there is PW 2 who testified that the appellant had exposed himself twice to her. She was with PW 1 the first time, and with PW 3 the second time. On both occasions, the appellant was walking towards her. Apart from these two incidents, PW 2 said that there were a few times she caught sight of the appellant. After the second incident, she told her teacher and her father brought her to lodge a police report. At the identification parade, she picked out the appellant correctly.
 24.Third, there is PW 3 who testified that she saw the appellant exposing himself indecently twice. The first time, she was with PW 2. The second time, she was with PW 1 and was able to see the appellant very clearly as he was just three to four metres away. He was even beside them when he uttered the following words to them, `I show you all, don`t tell anyone.` At the identification parade, she correctly picked out the appellant as the culprit.
 25.Fourth, there is PW 4 who was the only male victim. He gave evidence that he was with his female classmate, PW 5, when he saw the appellant. PW 4 testified that he was five to six metres away when the incident occurred. The appellant had unzipped his trousers, and he was masturbating himself with his hand. PW 4 said that he could see the appellant clearly because he was quite near. He also testified that the appellant mumbled something to PW 5 when he walked past her but he could not hear what was said. At the identification parade, PW 4 picked out the appellant as the man who had exposed himself.
 26.Fifth, there is PW 5 who was with PW 4 at the material time. She said that when she saw him on the overhead bridge walking towards them in the opposite direction, he was about two to three metres away. She was able to see him clearly because he was in front of her. And when the appellant brushed past her, she looked at him from head to toe and saw his exposed private part. He said in English, `Hey little girl, big big huh?` Subsequently, PW 5 went to the identification parade on 7 August 1997. She said she was initially very sure that she had picked out the culprit, and this was confirmed by one ASP Steve Tan. But when told by ASP Tan that she had to be 100% sure, she hesitated as she was afraid to be wrong. Notwithstanding her uncertainty, there was no reason to doubt that the appellant was the man she saw because PW 4, who was with her at the material time, had also positively identified the appellant as the culprit.
 27.Finally, there is PW 7 who was with PW 1 when she first saw the appellant. She said that she saw the appellant squeezing his private part but he did not unzip his trousers due to the presence of a group of people walking towards them. She testified that she was able to observe him for one to two minutes, hence she was able to take a good look at him. The next time she saw the appellant was the day when he was apprehended. At the identification parade, PW 7 correctly picked out the appellant.
 28.Hence, on the evidence given by these six witnesses, there was nothing to show that they had wrongly identified the appellant. They were proximate to him when the incidents happened such that they could even hear him speak, and they had the opportunity to observe and take a good look at him in bright daylight. The appellant had spoken to them, and he was either in full frontal view as he walked towards his victims from the opposite direction or at their side when he walked next to them. Some of them had even seen him more than once and could in fact recognise him (that was how the appellant was eventually caught). Thus, any argument that the victims caught only fleeting glimpses of the appellant was quite unsustainable.
 29.It may also be noted that the ten charges actually related to five incidents, and each incident was being witnessed by two students. In other words, the identification of the appellant in each of these incidents were made and supported by two witnesses. In 
R v Tyler & Ors
 
[1993] 96 Cr App R 332
, it was said that identification by two witnesses carries more weight than by one alone. In my view, this is common sense since honest witnesses do not tend to make the same mistakes especially when the identification procedures are properly carried out and there had been no opportunity for innocent contamination. Thus, I saw no reason to doubt the quality of the identification evidence here.
 30.Moreover, the modus operandi of the `flasher` as described by these witnesses were similar. He operated in the same vicinity and would usually go near his victims with his trousers unzipped to expose himself. He would also usually say words of the same effect to his victims. Such evidence showed that the offending acts were committed by the same person, thus strengthening the prosecution`s case against the appellant.
 31.I was conscious that defence counsel had relied on the prosecution evidence of one Mashhud bin Keling (the appellant`s supervisor) to suggest that the appellant was in camp undergoing reservist training between 24 February 1997 and 5 March 1997. Hence, he could not have committed the offences on 28 February 1997 as reflected in two of the charges. It was also suggested that, on other occasions, the appellant was at his place of work and could not have been at the crime scene.
 32.However, the mere fact that the appellant was on reservist duty did not mean that he could not have booked out of camp (if indeed it was even in-camp training) and be at the scene of crime. The appellant should have testified to his whereabouts or produce his reservist card to confirm the date of his reservist service. In this regard, the second illustration to s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) states: 
B wishes the court to believe that at the time in question he was elsewhere. He must prove it.
 33.In my opinion, the prosecution`s evidence (based on the evidence of the six victims) had sufficiently established the appellant`s presence at the crime scene for there to be a case to answer. Hence, if the defence was one of alibi, I took the view that s 105 would operate such that the appellant must bear the evidential burden of production (and 
 not 
 the legal burden of persuasion which is on a balance of probabilities) to raise the issue of alibi. In 
Syed Abdul Aziz v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 534
 , the Court of Appeal stated as follows at p 543: 
It was also submitted that the learned trial judges had misapplied the burden of proof on the prosecution when the defence of alibi is raised. The burden of proving the guilt of an accused is with the prosecution. Where the accused raises an alibi, the burden of proving the alibi is on the accused but this is only an evidential burden and all that the defence has to do is to raise a reasonable doubt (see 
Yau Heng Fang v PP
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 335
 ; 
Illian & Anor v PP
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 421
 ). The learned trial judges have in their grounds specifically referred to 
Woolmington v DPP
 
[1935] AC 462
 and to the duty on the prosecution to prove the prisoners` guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Although the learned judges did not say so in so many words, it is clear to us that they accepted that in order to raise an alibi the defence need only raise a reasonable doubt. We therefore reject the submission that the learned trial judges had misapplied the burden of proof.
 34.Therefore, the prosecution would still retain the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, with the result that an acquittal must follow from reasonable doubt that the appellant might have been elsewhere at the material time. However, on the facts here, I did not think that there was sufficient evidence to raise the necessary reasonable doubt for an acquittal.
 35.
 Adverse inference
Counsel for the appellant next argued that the trial judge should not have refused to admit the evidence of the appellant which took the form of a statement to the police. To this point, it could simply be said that the appellant should have testified to allow himself to be cross-examined on the stand and have the veracity of his account tested. He should not be allowed to keep silent and yet have his evidence admitted through the backdoor of a statement tendered to the court. Further, there was compelling reason not to allow the statement to be admitted until the appellant gave evidence, and that was to prevent tailoring of the defence evidence: see 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
 .
 36.Finally, it was submitted that the trial judge had erred in drawing an adverse inference from the appellant`s refusal to testify. Counsel had made the unmeritorious argument that the appellant was represented at trial and it must be manifest to the court that the appellant was acting on the advice of counsel. Hence, the court should not draw any adverse inference.
 37.My riposte would be that the appellant must be presumed to have been properly advised by his counsel of the consequences of keeping silent. Despite this, he had on his own free will elected not to testify. Hence, there were no grounds for complaint now that adverse inferences were drawn. However, if counsel was suggesting that his client had been advised by him not to testify without being fully appraised of the consequences, then counsel was opening himself up to a charge of incompetence. Surely, in a criminal trial, the accused`s refusal to testify may carry dire consequences in terms of adverse inferences. The law is settled here, and I will not belabour the point: see 
PP v Tse Nathan
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 870
 . Suffice to say that it is counsel`s duty to impress the possible consequences upon the client when advising him whether to remain silent or not.
 38.In my view, the trial judge had not applied the wrong approach at the close of the prosecution`s case. She had rightly considered that there was a prima facie case on the evidence and called for the defence. The defence did not call any witnesses, not even the accused himself. Hence, there was nothing to rebut the prosecution`s case.
 39.The only question remaining was whether the prosecution had proved the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, it was quite right to consider the appellant`s silence as yet another factor to be considered in the circumstances, bearing in mind that his defence appeared to be that he was not at the crime scene at all. A short passage from the judgment of our Court of Appeal in 
Oh Laye Koh v PP
 
[1995] 1 CLAS 142
 reinforced this point at p 147: 
[T]he trial judge was at liberty to draw any inferences 
 as may appear proper
 from the failure of the appellant to give evidence on oath, including the ultimate adverse inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. In 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
, Lord Diplock observes that it would be hopeless to expect jurors or judges, as reasonable men, to refrain from drawing inferences from the accused failure to exercise his right to give evidence, including inferences adverse to the accused. After all, it is only the accused who is in a position to contradict the evidence of the prosecution on matters that are peculiarly within his own knowledge [such as an alibi] or to displace a natural inference as to his mental attitude at the time of the alleged offence that, in the absence of some other explanation, would properly be drawn by any reasonable person from his conduct at that time
. Lord Diplock went on to observe at p 53:
 
`What inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused`s refusal to give evidence depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary common-sense [Emphasis added.]`
 40.In any event, even if no adverse inference had be drawn, I was satisfied that the identification evidence was accurate and hence sufficient to convict the appellant of the offences.
 41.On the totality of the evidence, I did not see any compelling reason to overturn the trial judge`s findings especially when she had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of these brave young witnesses as they recounted their repulsive encounters in court.
 42.
 Conclusion
For the reasons cited, I found the appellant`s case to be without merit and completely hopeless. Accordingly, the appeal against his convictions was dismissed.",1998-08-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:
1          The plaintiff in this action is Chew Kim Kee. She claims damages against the defendant, Kertar & Co, for breach of duty as her advocate and solicitor in the conduct of the plaintiff’s appeal against the decision of District Judge Kathryn Low. The decision, which was handed down on 21 September 1999, pertains to the division of matrimonial assets (“the Order”). At the material time, the sole proprietor of the defendant firm was Kertar Singh s/o Guljar Singh (“Kertar”).
2          As it appears from the terms of the pleadings and Opening Statement, the plaintiff’s case was put on a much wider footing than what was, eventually, argued in the closing submissions. A number of particulars of breach of duty in contract and in tort related to matters and events prior to 21 September 1999. In the course of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Leonard Loo, confirmed that the complaint is not about the defendant’s general conduct as the plaintiff’s advocate and solicitor in the divorce proceedings and ancillary matters prior to 21 September 1999. Thereafter, the case proceeded on what I may state broadly as being a failure to advise on an appeal against the Order, and for not filing a notice of appeal, contrary to the plaintiff’s instructions.
3          The plaintiff engaged the defendant in September 1997 as her advocate and solicitor to institute matrimonial proceedings against her husband. The husband initially contested the petition and filed a cross-petition. Eventually, a decree 
nisi
 on the plaintiff’s petition was granted, uncontested, on 8 October 1998. The ancillary matters, 
ie
 maintenance and division of matrimonial assets, were heard before the district judge. Her overall award to the plaintiff was worth $1.6m.
4          The events giving rise to this action occurred in September and October 1999. What transpired on 21 and 22 September 1999, after the district judge handed down her decision, was a matter of dispute at the trial. It is convenient to summarise the respective positions of the parties.
5          I begin with a summary of the plaintiff’s position. On the evening of 21 September 1999, Kertar informed the plaintiff, orally and briefly, that she had been awarded $1.6m, which included a 35% share of the matrimonial home. No other details of the Order were told to her. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with the decision of the district judge. She felt that it was not a fair decision as the husband was given the lion’s share of the matrimonial assets. In that very same telephone conversation, she informed Kertar that she wished to appeal against the Order. But Kertar tried to impress upon her that the Order was fair and asked that she accept it. She was unwilling to do so, and in her affidavit of evidence-in chief stated that she had “informed him to appeal”. She told him, “I want to appeal.” Separately, the plaintiff, on 22 September 1999, informed Sharanjit Kaur d/o Sarjit Singh (“Sharanjit”), a legal assistant of the defendant firm who was handling the day-to-day care and conduct of the plaintiff’s file, of her dissatisfaction with the decision and that she wanted to appeal against it.
6          On 5 October 1999, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff. She was informed that the firm would be applying to court to be discharged as her solicitor on record. No application for discharge was filed as the plaintiff appointed a new firm of solicitors, Thomas Tham & Co. They notified the defendant, on 19 October 1999, that they had taken over the conduct of the matter. A notice of change of solicitors was filed and served on 22 November 1999. The plaintiff paid the defendant’s professional fees on 5 November 1999, but the defendant waited until 17 November 1999 to release the files to Thomas Tham & Co. All files were handed over by 31 December 1999. The handover of files was well after the deadline for filing the appeal.
7          The deadline for the appeal was 5 October 1999, but the defendant had not apprised the plaintiff of it. She learnt about the deadline from Thomas Tham & Co. As a result of the defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff lost her right to appeal against the Order.
8          Some of the relevant particulars of breach of duty alleged against the defendant in her pleadings are:
(a)        the defendant had not advised the plaintiff whether or not to appeal against the Order;
(b)        the defendant was told that the plaintiff wanted to appeal against the Order, but the defendant did not do anything about it;
(c)        the defendant did not advise the plaintiff of the deadline for the appeal; and
(d)        the defendant caused or permitted the plaintiff’s appeal to be time barred under the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed).
9          I now move on to summarise the defendant’s position. The plaintiff was informed of the outcome of the hearing by telephone on 21 September 1999 itself – first by Sharanjit, after the outcome was known, when Sharanjit returned the plaintiff’s persistent calls to her handphone even during the hearing and later on, in the evening, when Kertar conveyed the terms of the Order to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had not expressed or given any indication that she was dissatisfied with the outcome of the hearing to any of them. Neither did Kertar nor Sharanjit sense any dissatisfaction on the plaintiff’s part when they each spoke to the plaintiff. According to Kertar, she sounded relieved after he had explained the terms of the Order to her. In that conversation, he also informed her of additional legal costs if she were to buy over the husband’s share of the matrimonial property. He turned down her suggestion that the conveyancing fees be a part of the agreed fees of $50,000. Under the terms of the Order, the plaintiff was to receive $100,000 within a month of the Order and the plaintiff was concerned that if the defendant deducted the agreed fees and conveyancing fees from that amount, there would hardly be any money left. The plaintiff appeared unhappy with the defendant’s proposal to deduct the agreed fees of $50,000 from the $100,000. She did not say she wanted to appeal or give instructions to appeal.
10        On the following day, 22 September 1999, the plaintiff turned up at the defendant’s office without an appointment. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff stated that she had gone to the defendant’s office at Kertar’s request for a meeting at 10.00am. Whilst waiting for Kertar, she flipped through a copy of the husband’s fourth affidavit filed on 25 August 1999, used by Sharanjit at the hearing. It was then that she noticed, to her horror, that missing from the copy in hand were tele-banking statements showing some deposits. The defendant said that the plaintiff caused a scene when she walked out of the defendant’s office with Sharanjit’s copy of the husband’s fourth affidavit, despite protests from the defendant’s staff. It is not disputed that the plaintiff had, without permission, taken away the affidavit. Neither Kertar nor Sharanjit were in the office at that time.
11        After learning of the incident, Kertar later that same day telephoned the plaintiff. During this telephone conversation, the plaintiff made various scurrilous allegations against Sharanjit. She accused the latter of deliberately removing from the affidavit, tele-banking statements that showed some large deposits. She claimed that she would have obtained a higher award had the statements with those entries not been removed. Kertar told the plaintiff that if she was unhappy, she could appeal against the Order and she had 14 days to do so. She could also engage another firm to act for her if she did not want the defendant to act on her behalf. On hearing that, the plaintiff promptly informed Kertar that she no longer wanted him to be her lawyer.
12        The defendant said that at no time did the plaintiff inform Kertar or Sharanjit that she wanted to appeal against the Order and that the defendant was to appeal on her behalf. As far as the defendant was concerned, the solicitor and client relationship had ended on 22 September 1999. The defendant was under no duty to advise her on the appeal or to file the notice of appeal on her behalf.
13        Under the Rules of Court, a notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days of the order – in this case, by 5 October 1999. It is not disputed that the defendant did not file a notice of appeal by 5 October 1999 or at all.
14        It is common ground that one of the obligations of an advocate and solicitor in carrying out his retainer is to exercise the care and skill of a competent practitioner in the discharge of his duties: 
Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp
 
[1979] Ch 384
 at 403. The Court of Appeal in 
Chong Yeo & Partners v Guan Ming Hardware & Engineering Pte Ltd
 
[1997] 2 SLR 729
 iterated the principle with reference to the advocate and solicitor’s obligation to observe the Rules of Court (at [63]):
For a breach of that duty of care to have occurred, the appellants must have, on the balance of probabilities, omitted to do a thing which a reasonably competent advocate and solicitor in their position would have done: 
Godefroy v Dalton
 [(1830) 6 Bing 460; 130 ER 1357]
.
 Such a reasonably competent advocate and solicitor must comply with all rules of court to protect his client’s interests.
15        The precise content of the duty of reasonable skill and care will depend on the circumstances of each case. There can be no doubt that an advocate and solicitor will be in breach of duty if he does not carry out, in a timely manner, his client’s instructions to appeal. He is also under a duty to warn the client of the deadline for appealing and about the effect of a failure to file a timely notice of appeal. These duties are predicated on there being in existence a solicitor and client relationship stemming from the advocate and solicitor’s retainer or, alternatively and independent of the contract, a relationship of proximity brought about by the retainer sufficient to found a duty of care in negligence. In this case, the duties of care in contract and in tort are not only concurrent, they are co-extensive and hence overlap, so much so that a finding that the retainer had terminated will simultaneously resolve the duty of care question in contract and in tort.
16        I shall categorise the main issue as whether or not the relationship of solicitor and client had ended by 5 October 1999. The defendant’s case is that the relationship had ended on 22 September 1999 as the plaintiff had terminated the services of the defendant as her advocate and solicitor in the matter on that day. The plaintiff, in her written testimony, stated that it was the defendant who did not want to act for her and not the other way around. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Chelva Rajah SC, argues that notwithstanding the dispute as to who did the discharging, the fact that the defendant was discharged during the telephone conversation of 22 September 1999 from acting as the plaintiff’s advocate and solicitor cannot be disputed. Mr Loo took the point that the withdrawal by Kertar was ineffective as the defendant could only determine the retainer for good reason and upon reasonable notice. Both conditions had not been satisfied and the defendant remained the plaintiff’s advocate and solicitor until Thomas Tham & Co filed a notice of change of solicitors and served the notice on 22 November 1999.
17        The outcome of this case is not dependent on whether it was the plaintiff or the defendant who had terminated the retainer. An analysis of whether or not good reason and reasonable notice were given is unnecessary. It is common ground that a client may terminate the retainer at any time and for any reason. It is the defendant’s case that the plaintiff discharged the firm on 22 September 1999 and that the retainer, therefore, came to an end immediately on that day. On the plaintiff’s evidence, it was the defendant who did not want to act. It is trite law that a repudiation of the retainer will put to an end the defendant’s duty if it has been accepted by the other party to the agreement. It is clear from the undisputed evidence that the plaintiff had accepted the repudiation. I find that the plaintiff had by conduct accepted that the relationship of solicitor and client had come to an end on 22 September 1999. Her acceptance brought to a conclusion the contract of retainer and any co-extensive duty of care in tort. On any version of the events argued for by each side, the claim must fail and the action be dismissed.
18        On the same day, 
ie
 22 September 1999, the plaintiff contacted the husband’s solicitors, Lim & Associates, and expressly informed them that the defendant no longer represented her. She again, on two other separate occasions, namely on 24 and 30 September 1999, contacted them about the same thing. The defendant had received a letter dated 30 September 1999 from Lim & Associates to the same effect. Sharanjit testified that she had taken a call on the evening of 22 September 1999 or the next day, from the lawyer handling the matter for the husband, namely Alvin Sim of Lim & Associates. Mr Sim informed her that the plaintiff had contacted his firm and had told them that the defendant no longer acted for the plaintiff and the $100,000 due to the plaintiff was to be sent to her directly. When they spoke, Sharanjit confirmed with Alvin Sim her understanding that the plaintiff had terminated the defendant’s services. Indeed, on 15 October 1999, the sum of $100,000 was sent by Lim & Associates directly to the plaintiff.
19        The plaintiff did not deny contacting Lim & Associates on all three occasions. She admitted that it was only on 30 September 1999 that she told Lim & Associates that the defendant no longer acted for her and to direct future correspondence to her. I reject as incredible and far-fetched her evidence that her two earlier calls to Lim & Associates on 22 and 24 September 1999 were to seek their assistance to get the defendant to handle her appeal properly. The plain truth is that the plaintiff had accepted the end of the solicitor and client relationship, at the very latest on 30 September 1999, and this piece of evidence weighs heavily against her.
20        Consistent with that position, she then took the next step by instructing a new firm of solicitors to represent her. Four days after receipt of the sum of $100,000 due to her under the Order, on 19 October 1999, the plaintiff’s new firm of solicitors, Thomas Tham & Co, wrote to the defendant for the plaintiff’s files. Another piece of evidence that is consistent with the plaintiff’s acceptance of the termination of services is her own testimony that Kertar had informed her that he would leave her files at the reception counter for her collection. She then enlisted the assistance of her friend, Low Lip Toon, to contact Kertar to collect the files. The omission of the defendant to confirm with Lim & Associates, in writing, that the former no longer acted for the plaintiff is, in my view, not fatal in the light of countervailing evidence before me.
21        The defendant’s evidence is that after the telephone conversation on 22 September 1999, the plaintiff dealt directly with her former husband’s solicitors; she stopped coming to the defendant’s office and did not speak to Kertar or Sharanjit again. The defendant did not receive any instructions from the plaintiff to carry out any act on behalf of the plaintiff. Save for approving the draft order of court prepared by the husband’s lawyers and returning it under cover of a letter dated 6 October 1999, the defendant did nothing for the plaintiff. Sharanjit had explained in cross-examination that she had not drawn up the draft order of court as the defendant was no longer representing the plaintiff. Kertar himself said that by then, he had taken over the file from Sharanjit as he was under the impression that the plaintiff would be engaging a new firm of solicitors and was waiting in anticipation to hear from the new firm of solicitors. Subsequently, on 5 October 1999, he sent what appears to be a pre-application letter which explained the breakdown of the relationship and gave notice of the defendant’s intention to file the necessary discharge application to remove the firm as solicitor on the record of the court.
22        In the course of the trial, a reason which Mr Loo cited for saying the retainer had not been terminated was that there was no order to discharge the firm as solicitor on record. There is no merit in his submission. The legal position of the advocate and solicitor whose name still remained on the record after termination of the retainer is clearly explained by Goff LJ in 
Gamlen Chemical Co (UK) Ltd v Rochem Ltd
 
[1980] 1 WLR 614
 at 623
That leaves the third head of the argument which is this: that having regard to the latter part of Ord 67, r 6(1) [our O 64 r 5(1)], the appellants necessarily continued as the solicitors for the defendants for all purposes, no order having been obtained on their summons and, therefore, the steps referred to in the earlier part of the order of necessity not having been taken. Mr Bueno relies on the words
… shall, subject to the foregoing provisions of this Order, be considered the solicitor of the party till the final conclusion of the cause or matter, whether in the High Court or Court of Appeal.
In my judgment, however, that rule is not dealing with the relationship between the solicitor on the record and his client, but the position as between other parties to the litigation and the client; they being entitled, until the appropriate steps have been taken to change the record, to regard the solicitor as being still the solicitor, and to serve him with pleadings, notices and so forth.
I think that must be the right conclusion for two reasons: first, the opening words of the order refer to a solicitor who has ceased to act, so that the argument would mean that the latter part of the order was inconsistent with the former; and secondly, the qualifications which I have read under the headings (a), (b) and (c) [of Ord 67, r 6(1)] show quite clearly that the order is dealing only with matters of procedure.
23        Templeman LJ (at 626) said:
Mr Bueno submitted that, as a matter of law, the appellants would only have discharged themselves if they had proceeded with the summons and obtained an order under Ord 67, r 6.
That rule [r 6(1)] has been read and analysed by Goff LJ and I agree that it governs the position as between the litigants and third parties but has nothing to do with the position as between a client and his own solicitor. The rule plainly implied that a summons will be taken out and an order will be made after the solicitors have ceased to act, and the provisos to the rule make clear its object, which is to safeguard third parties. It is not a rule which is appropriate to prevent the ending of the relationship of solicitor and client as between them, before an order is made under the rule.
24        For completeness, I would mention that as a matter of law, approving the draft order was something the defendant, as solicitor on the record of the court, was authorised to do: see 
Halsbury’s Laws of England,
 vol 44(1), (4th Ed Reissue, 1995) at para 134
.
 As between the defendant and the plaintiff, the retainer had come to an end on 22 September 1999. The defendant was no longer obliged, assuming the defendant was told that the plaintiff wanted to appeal against the Order, to keep the appeal alive by timely lodgement of a notice of appeal or to protect time in some other manner. It would place an intolerable burden on an advocate and solicitor if it were otherwise. The advocate and solicitor will find himself between a rock and a hard place. The prudent thing to do would be to take steps to remove the firm’s name from the court’s record as soon as possible.
25        The other issues on breach of duty would only arise if I had reached the opposite conclusion on the main point that the solicitor and client relationship had ended on 22 September 1999. However, I shall only concentrate on findings of fact and avoid unnecessary conclusions of law.
26        The plaintiff is a 63-year-old housewife. She has little formal education. She had, at the trial, the assistance of an interpreter. She understands and reads simple English. Sharanjit does not speak or understand Hokkien and, therefore speaks to the plaintiff in simple English which she clearly understands. I would mention that on a few occasions in cross-examination, the plaintiff answered in English without the questions being translated. The plaintiff tried to portray herself as uneducated or a housewife of limited education who left everything to her lawyer who had let her down. She was, as with any other new divorcee, anxious about the division of matrimonial assets. But she was far from being the helpless housewife. She would drop in at the defendant’s office without an appointment almost every other day to see her lawyers. There is evidence from Sharanjit that the plaintiff was able to calculate, and had calculated, the husband’s net worth and knew exactly what she wanted out of the failed marriage for herself and even her pet dog. I think she is a shrewd person.
27        The plaintiff is an unsatisfactory and unreliable witness. Her testimony lacked candour. In making this assessment, I have considered her educational background. If matters contained in correspondence were not to her advantage, she would deny receiving the correspondence or deny having given the instructions written by her lawyers to others or contained in her lawyers’ letter to her. Her refusal to answer straightforward questions on material aspects of her case did not help her.
28        Kertar was a police officer before he read law and qualified as a lawyer. Kertar is able to converse in Hokkien and spoke to the plaintiff in Hokkien. He was not particularly disciplined and meticulous in keeping attendance notes to record the gist of his conversations with the plaintiff nor did he confirm in writing what was said and agreed in conversation. That sloppiness has exposed his firm to the plaintiff’s accusations. In any event, duty of care must not be judged with the benefit of hindsight but in the light of the circumstances at the time the conduct in question occurred.
29        There is little agreement between the parties as to what it was, exactly, that the plaintiff and Kertar said during the two telephone conversations on 21 and 22 September 1999. However, after observing each of these witnesses give evidence over several days, with substantial cross-examination, I have reached the conclusion that where the evidence conflicts, I prefer the evidence of Kertar. I accepted his version of events only after evaluating the reliability of the testimony in the light of any objective facts, documents, the overall probabilities and other surrounding circumstances. The evidence of Sharanjit also points against the plaintiff’s version of events. I shall come to that later.
30        As I have stated, there is conflict in the evidence as to whether the plaintiff had given instructions to appeal. When she suspected that Sharanjit had deliberately removed vital evidence from an affidavit that would, in her mind, have enabled her to obtain a higher award, it would have been natural for her to lose confidence and trust in her solicitor. As a matter of common experience, without trust and confidence, she would not have wanted the defendant to appeal on her behalf. Coupled with what was apparently a confrontational conversation, I find it inherently improbable that she would have asked the defendant to appeal on her behalf.
31        At the same time, Kertar, being quite naturally offended by her scurrilous accusations, which needless to say, was an affront to and slur on the reputation and integrity of his firm and colleague, would not want to continue to act for her. It is his evidence that he told her that if she was unhappy because Sharanjit had deliberately removed evidence, she could engage another lawyer and appeal against the Order. On hearing that, the plaintiff promptly told him that she no longer wanted him to be her lawyer. In my view, it is plausible, judged in the light of the exchanges, the desire to sever the solicitor and client relationship was mutual. Her subsequent conduct, as I have narrated, is consistent with that analysis.
32        Before me, the plaintiff maintained that Sharanjit was lying. This accusation, in my view, has not been made out. She also could not substantiate her allegations or rebut counsel’s cross-examination on the missing tele-banking statements. Sharanjit, who left the firm in May 2002, testified on behalf of the defendant. She was the case handler and her knowledge of the matters was precise and definite. I found her to be a steady witness. She gave her evidence in a fair, moderate and convincing way. She testified that she was not in the office the morning of 22 September 1999 and she did not see or speak to the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff could not have met and spoken to her about wanting to appeal against the Order. The last time she spoke to the plaintiff was on 21 September 1999. The first time she heard that the plaintiff had terminated the services of the defendant was when Kertar told her about it on 22 September 1999. The next occasion was when Alvin Sim of Lim & Associates telephoned her on the evening of 22 September 1999 or the next day, to check if there was any truth in the plaintiff’s statement to his office that the defendant no longer represented her. Sharanjit confirmed with Alvin Sim her understanding that this would be the case. When questioned why she did not verify what she was told by Kertar, her response was incisive. To her, there was nothing to verify. Kertar was her boss and she regarded his message as her superior’s instructions to her. 
33        In argument, Mr Loo said that the message book produced by Sharanjit which showed that someone had called when she was out is hearsay and inadmissible evidence as the maker of the note was not called. In my judgment, the message book was relied on not to prove the truth of the contents of the messages, but that the message book was maintained by her secretary and the two messages were typical messages her secretary or receptionist would take down whenever she was out of the office. It is her evidence that she received the two messages.
34        In their letter dated 19 October 1999, Thomas Tham & Co informed the defendant that they had taken over the conduct of the matter. The defendant’s letter in reply, dated 20 October 1999, pointed out that the matter had been concluded in that judgment had been given by District Judge Kathryn Low on 21 September 1999. That statement is significant for the reason that it is consistent with and supports the defendant’s version.
35        From my analysis of the evidence, I am convinced that the plaintiff was satisfied with the overall award of $1.6m. The evidence shows that Kertar and Sharanjit were of the view that the Order, which gave her in monetary terms $1.6m, was a favourable outcome for the plaintiff. During mediation, the husband had offered in monetary terms a sum of $1.2m whereas the plaintiff was prepared to accept $1.4m. Contrary to her counsel’s submission, in my view, she obtained advice from Thomas Tham & Co on an appeal not because she was plainly dissatisfied with the Order. She saw them to either allay or confirm her suspicion that Sharanjit had deliberately removed crucial evidence from an affidavit. The plaintiff had said to Kertar that if Sharanjit had not removed the evidence, she would have obtained a larger award. It was this suspicion that sparked off the events that followed. Her alleged “dissatisfaction” was borne out of suspicion that something had gone wrong because of what Sharanjit had allegedly done. Kertar had explained in answer to Mr Loo’s cross-examination that he raised the topic of an appeal because the plaintiff had complained about Sharanjit’s action. He said:
[1]
She made an allegation against Sharanjit and that is why I told her [that] if she is dissatisfied she could appeal against [the] Order of Court and if she wishes she could get another lawyer to do it.
36        She went to Thomas Tham & Co. She wanted them to review the evidence. Thomas Tham & Co went through the evidence put before the court including the husband’s fourth affidavit filed on 25 August 1999 and the written submissions presented on her behalf. She was told by Thomas Tham & Co that the alleged missing deposit entries were put before the district judge. This is what Thomas Tham & Co wrote in their letter dated 6 October 1999:
[I]t appears that all the evidences [
sic
] on the Respondent’s financial position during the time that he was working as a partner in Design Link Architects and finally, as a sole proprietor of TAA Architects were brought forth before the courts at the ancillary hearing of 21st September 1999, reasons being that the evidence of TAA Architect’s Bank of China’s monthly statements from June 1996 to July 1999 were exhibited in the Respondent’s affidavit dated 25.8.99 [the fourth affidavit]. Further, the huge sums which you had disputed therein were highlighted by Mr Yap Teong Liang in his written submissions filed to the Court and which we believe were considered by the Court when it arrived at its decision at the said hearing.
As such, we are of the opinion that you may not succeed in appealing against the Order of Court dated 21 September 1999 based on the above reason unless you can prove that the Court has in arriving at its decision erred in law and facts.
Satisfied that there was nothing to her suspicion, the plaintiff decided not to proceed further. Thomas Tham & Co confirmed her instructions in their letter.
37        Mr Rajah submits that the plaintiff’s whole case lacks credibility. He pointed out that it was never the plaintiff’s case that she had wanted to appeal against the Order and had told the defendant to do so, until she amended her pleadings two weeks before the start of the trial. Prior to that, her case had always been that Kertar had failed to advise her whether or not to appeal against the Order. I agree with Mr Rajah’s submission that this late amendment is telling and tended to undermine the veracity of her testimony that she had asked the defendant to appeal on her behalf. If what she says is true, it would have been raised by the plaintiff’s new solicitors, Thomas Tham & Co, as early as December 1999 and not several years later. I reject as fanciful her testimony that Thomas Tham & Co did not sue the defendant because of the friendship between Thomas Tham and Kertar. There is no evidence of such friendship. Neither was there evidence that she gave Thomas Tham & Co those instructions nor that they disobeyed her instructions or had declined to act.
38        I am satisfied and I find on a balance of probabilities that both Kertar and Sharanjit were never told about the plaintiff’s intention to appeal or that she wanted the defendant to appeal on her behalf. Moreover, I accept Kertar’s evidence that he had informed her on 22 September 1999 that she had 14 days to appeal. I accept his recollection of this conversation. He explained that he could remember his conversation with the plaintiff for two reasons. It was the first time anyone had made the serious allegations, which the plaintiff did, against the firm and a colleague. It was also the first time an incident of the sort described had taken place in his office. The plaintiff had not challenged Kertar’s evidence that she was told that she could go elsewhere if she did not want the defendant to act for her. That conversation allowed for a reasonable time for substitution of a new firm of solicitors. It is clear from her subsequent actions that the plaintiff was well aware beforehand that she had to appoint a new firm of solicitors. She had apparently chosen to wait until she received the money due to her first. The plaintiff proffered no explanation as to why she had not done anything earlier.
39        I pause to mention Mr Loo’s attempt to make a distinction between oral and written advice. It has been argued that no written advice was given to the plaintiff on whether or not to appeal against the Order. Although it is desirable for an advocate and solicitor to advise in writing rather than orally, it is not necessary as a matter of law to do so: 
Harwood v Taylor Vinters
 
[2003] TLR 191
. It seems convenient to communicate the defendant’s advice orally in the circumstances of this case where the plaintiff has little formal education and speaks Hokkien.
40        I agree with Mr Rajah that the allegation that the plaintiff was not advised whether or not to appeal turns the allegation on its head, especially with the assertion that the plaintiff had requested the defendant to appeal against the Order. Under cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that her real complaint is that Kertar did not file the appeal on her behalf. She had to agree with counsel that the absence of an advice on an appeal did not prevent her from deciding whether to appeal.
41        Even if I were to have accepted the plaintiff’s version of events, that would not be enough to further the plaintiff’s cause. I am not persuaded that there was a causal link between the alleged breach of duty and the alleged loss, 
ie
 the loss of opportunity to appeal. The loss alleged cannot be made out. There is the matter of the plaintiff not appointing new solicitors on time and her own decision not to appeal.
42        In a letter dated 6 December 1999, Thomas Tham & Co advised the plaintiff that she had little prospect of succeeding if she appealed. They also confirmed her instructions that she did not wish to appeal. Their advice envisaged an appeal on the merits and they proceeded to so advise her based on the evidence before the district judge and written submissions put forward on the plaintiff’s behalf. Nowhere in the letter did they suggest making an application to extend time to file a notice of appeal. The plaintiff’s allegation that the real reason why Thomas Tham & Co had advised against an appeal was because the time limit to lodge an appeal had expired is not borne out in the letter. She was aware that time to appeal had expired. Yet she did not pursue the matter there and then. Having seen the plaintiff in the witness box, I formed the impression that she was a person with a mind and will of her own. She would have pressed on with an application for extension of time to file a notice of appeal if, indeed, she was as dissatisfied with the decision as she had claimed. She was not the sort of person to give up quietly. I have already said that having allayed her suspicion, she had no reason to re-open the award which she proceeded to act on. It transpired that she exercised the option and bought over the other 65% share of the matrimonial home. She subsequently resold the property in March 2001 for $1.4m, making a little profit along the way.
43        For all those reasons, the plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs.

 Background 
 
You, B3 Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi M/20 years NRIC No: S7528146C are charged that you, on or about the 13th day of May 1995 at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, together with Soh Chin Leong and Zulkifli Bin Abdul Samad, all of you being Police National Servicemen attached to the Central Narcotics Bureau, Singapore, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, voluntarily caused hurt to one Foo Lai Heng for the purpose of extorting from the said Foo Lai Heng a confession that he had committed the offence of consuming a controlled drug, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 330 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with section 34 of the same Code.
The appellant was sentenced to four years` imprisonment. He originally appealed against both conviction and sentence, but subsequently elected to proceed with his appeal against sentence only. I allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence to three years` imprisonment. I now set out my reasons for doing so. Although the appeal was directed solely at the question of sentence, it may be pertinent to have regard to the evidence adduced below.
 The case for the prosecution 
As stated in the charge, the appellant was a Police National Serviceman attached to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at the material time. The offence took place in the course of the performance of his duties at the Woodlands Checkpoint. He was alleged to have caused hurt to one Foo Lai Heng (Foo), a Malaysian who had tested positive for drugs after having undergone a urine test. Foo affirmatively identified the appellant as one of three officers who assaulted him after the results of the urine test were obtained.
Foo testified that the appellant had asked him whether he consumed drugs. Foo denied this, but he claimed he had consumed liquor. The appellant told him not to lie. Foo then told the appellant that he was sick and had consumed some cough mixture. Before he could finish, the appellant began to beat him up, hitting his face and certain parts of his body. Two other officers then entered the room. Foo was again told not to lie and asked whether he had consumed drugs. When he requested another urine sample, all three officers beat him up. On being left alone with the appellant once again, the appellant told him that if he did not admit to having taken drugs, he would beat him up more seriously. Foo eventually admitted taking drugs as he was afraid that he would not be able to withstand being beaten up by all three of them.
The other two officers who allegedly assaulted Foo were named in the charge and produced as prosecution witnesses. They were Soh Chin Leong (PW2) and Zulikilfi bin Abdul Samad (PW3). At the outset, all three officers had been jointly charged with having committed an offence contrary to s 330 of the Penal Code. PW2 and PW3 eventually pleaded guilty and they were each sentenced to 3 years` imprisonment. PW2 testified that he could not remember whether the appellant had assaulted Foo. PW3, however, stated that all three of them beat Foo up. However, he could not remember exactly how the assault took place. He did not notice how the appellant beat Foo.
A medical report from the Singapore General Hospital on Foo`s condition after he alleged assault was admitted in evidence. This showed that he had localised right chest tenderness, mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of the right thigh and a 2 cm bruise on his right cheek.
 The statements 
The prosecution sought to admit two statements made by the appellant. The first (exh P3) was admitted without objections from the appellant. The second (exh P5) was admitted after a voir dire to determine its voluntariness. The material portion of the first statement P3, insofar as it incriminates the appellant, states:
Ã‰ I proceeded to ask [Foo] when he smoked Heroine (sic). [Foo] answered that he did not take any drug but he consumed some beer. I was very angry as I discovered that [Foo] was not truthful as beer did not contain heroine (sic). I then slapped [Foo] on his right cheek.
The appellant claimed that the second statement was involuntarily made. He alleged that the recording officer, one Osman Ahmed (PW5), had threatened him with detention for 48 hours. He also claimed that PW5 had raised his hand as if to assault him, and had told him that he would not be charged in court. Thus, he alleged that the statement was given under threat and inducement.
At the conclusion of the voir dire, the district judge was satisfied that the second statement had been voluntarily made. In the second statement, the relevant inculpatory statements were as follows: 
It is true that I saw SC Zul and VC Soh Chin Leong beat up [Foo] at the Woodlands Checkpoint on 13 May 95 when he denied taking drugs. 
 I too joined in beating up [Foo], but I only slapped him a few times
. Ã‰ [Foo] admitted to me because I told him that if he did not admit to taking drugs, then, SC Zul and VC Soh Chin Leong would come in and continue beating him. It is because he was afraid that he would be again beaten up by SC Zul and VC Soh Chin Leong that he admitted to me that he took drugs. In fact it was SC Zul and VC Soh Chin Leong who beat up [Foo] to get him to admit to taking drugs. 
 I only lightly slapped [Foo] on that day.
 [Emphasis added.]
 The defence 
In court, the appellant conceded that he did slap Foo once. He maintained that the main culprits were PW2 and PW3. He stated:
When I spoke to [Foo], he did not look at me but looked elsewhere. It was as if he did not respect me. I stood up and slapped him because he was rude towards me. I asked him once again if he consumed drugs and he said no.
Ã‰
After I sat down, I suddenly saw them beating Foo. By them I mean Soh and Zul. I do not know why they beat him as they were speaking in Chinese. Soh and Zul then went out of the room. When Soh and Zul beat up Foo, I did not join them. I can`t remember how they beat Foo. When I slapped Foo, I used my hand. I slapped him on the left side of his face. I slapped him once.
Ã‰
Besides the earlier incident where I slapped him, I did not lay my hands on Foo. The reason I slapped him was because he was rude and ignored me. I did not slapped (sic) him because I wanted him to confess that he had taken drugs.
The crux of his defence was that he did not assault Foo in order to get him to confess to having consumed drugs. He slapped Foo only because the latter was rude to him. The appellant`s defence was rejected by the district judge, who found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. The district judge sentenced the appellant to four years` imprisonment. He stated:
I considered the circumstances of this case as well as the mitigation plea advanced on his behalf. I was of the view that this was a very serious charge. Law enforcement officers should not go overboard in carrying out their duties. More so in this case when the urine test was positive and there was really no necessity for these officers to obtain a confession. The excuses given by the accused for his actions were flimsy and inadequate. I also noted that the other co-accused person were both sentenced to 3 years` imprisonment after they pleaded guilty to similar charges.
 The appeal 
On appeal against sentence, counsel for the appellant raised two main arguments. First, he contended that the sentence of four years` imprisonment was manifestly excessive in itself. He urged this court to consider the fact that the exact form of the assault on Foo was not clearly established. At the highest, the evidence only showed that the appellant had slapped Foo a few times.
The district judge did not make any clear finding as to the precise form of the assault from the appellant. In my opinion, this was immaterial. The charges against all three officers averred that they had acted in furtherance of their common intention. All that was necessary was evidence of common intention which existed among them to cause hurt to Foo and to extort a confession from him. In furtherance of that common intention, hurt was caused. It follows that each officer would be liable Oin the same manner as if the act were done by him alone`: s 34 Penal Code. Thus, the fact that the appellant may have inflicted a less serious form of assault did not necessarily furnish a basis by itself for a lighter sentence.
Counsel`s second submission was that the sentence was inconsistent with the three-year imprisonment terms imposed on his accomplices, PW2 and PW3. Counsel argued that PW2 and PW3 had in fact been more culpable, since they assaulted Foo both before and after he had admitted consuming drugs. As such, the offences committed by PW2 and PW3 were Oaggravated`. It was also submitted that the mere fact that the appellant claimed trial should not be held against him, relying on 
 Kuek Ah Lek v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 252
. Finally, counsel pointed out the fact that PW3 had pleaded guilty only on the morning of the appellant`s trial.
I was conscious that the district judge was not referred to any precedents to guide him in sentencing. Similarly, no sentencing precedents were cited before me. As such, it may be useful to examine some of the relevant considerations in imposing sentences for offences of this nature.
The principal object of s 330 is to prevent torture by the police (
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (23rd Ed) 1988, p 1285). This appears to be supported by the illustrations to the section, all three of which mention torture by law enforcement officers. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that s 330 need not be limited by the illustrations. Plainly, it refers to any person who causes hurt to extort a confession and is not confined to law enforcement officers (
 R v SAH Alsagoff 
 (1946) 2 MC 191 at p 197).
For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that where police officers are found guilty of having caused hurt to extort a confession, this would constitute an aggravating factor. It is wholly immaterial whether the offence or misconduct in respect of which the confession was sought was actually committed by the victim (
 R v Nim Chand Mokerjee 
 (1873) 20 WR (Cr) 41). The causing of hurt in such circumstances merits deterrent punishment (
 Lal Muhammad v Emperor 
 (1936) 37 Cr LJ 811).
In sentencing an offender who has contravened s 330, the following broad considerations should be kept in mind:
(a) ) the nature and severity of the hurt caused; 
(b) ) whether any weapons were used; 
(c) ) whether the assault took place by way of premeditated group action; 
(d) ) the nature and gravity of the offence in respect of which the confession was sought; 
(e) ) whether the offenders were law enforcement officers
The offence in respect of which Foo could have been charged was (presumably) one of consumption of a controlled drug, contrary to s 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). This carries a maximum punishment of ten years` imprisonment or $20,000 fine, or both. In the present case, aggravating circumstances were evidently present. The offenders were all police officers. They acted in furtherance of their common intention to voluntarily cause hurt to extort a confession. In doing so, they lost sight of one of the key purposes of their appointment, which was to uphold standards of law and order. Clearly, a deterrent sentence was warranted.
Turning to consider counsel`s submissions, I was of the view that only one argument was of any real merit. This was the point that there would be a serious dichotomy between the appellant`s sentence and that of his accomplices if the district judge`s sentence were to be upheld. After all, PW3 had pleaded guilty only on the morning when the appellant`s trial commenced. PW3 was sentenced to three years` imprisonment. PW2 received a similar sentence. Unfortunately, it was unclear when PW2 had pleaded guilty.
I took the view that it would not be in the interests of justice and fairness to impose a term of four years` imprisonment on the appellant. As I have suggested in 
 Kuek Ah Lek`s 
 case, the mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating factor. There may yet be no additional aggravating circumstance if the accused does not unnecessarily prolong his trial. In the present case, I noted that the appellant`s trial was concluded within three days. There was no suggestion that he had unnecessarily prolonged his trial.
Contrary to counsel`s submissions, I saw no indication that the district judge had expressly considered the fact of claiming trial to be an aggravating factor. On the other hand, it is accepted that an accused who pleads guilty may usually expect a Odiscount` in sentence, relative to the sentence which may be imposed on an accused who elects to claim trial. It appeared to me that the district judge may have maintained a distinction in the sentences because he was conscious of adhering to the principle that a Odiscount` should be given for a plea of guilt. However, this presupposes that there was a sentencing tariff for offences under s 330. As far as I have been able to discern, no such tariff exists. Moreover, there is no rigid rule in sentencing which dictates that a Odiscount` should invariably be ordered in every case. The circumstances of each case have to be considered. Given that PW3 pleaded guilty and was sentenced on the first day of the appellant`s trial itself, there was no compelling reason for preserving a distinction between his sentence and that of the appellant. In the premises, I reduced the appellant`s sentence to three years` imprisonment, in keeping with the sentences imposed on his accomplices.
I should add that s 329 of the Penal Code may appear analogous to s 330 in some ways, insofar as both offences involve the common elements of causing hurt and intention to extort. However, it must be noted that s 329 deals specifically with the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort property or to constrain to the commission of an illegal act. The maximum punishment under s 329 is life imprisonment, or ten years. In addition, a fine or caning may be imposed. In contrast, the maximum punishment prescribed under s 330 of the Penal Code is seven years` imprisonment and a fine may also be imposed. As such, precedents or tariff sentences in relation to s 329 clearly cannot be applied without discrimination to a s 330 offence.
I noted that the tariff sentence for a s 329 offence was three years` imprisonment. This suggests that the tariff sentence in respect of a s 330 offence should be somewhat lower. I would venture to suggest that a Obenchmark` sentence of, say, two years` imprisonment may be appropriate in respect of Onon-aggravated` s 330 offences eg cases where minimal hurt was caused, or where law enforcement officers were not involved. However, where aggravating circumstances exist, as the facts in the present case demonstrated, it would not be inappropriate to take 30 months` imprisonment as a starting point in sentencing.

 The charge
The appellant was charged and convicted in the court below for the following offence:
 
You,
 
 
 
Chiaw Wai Onn, 32 years
 
 
 
NRIC No S1604147E
 
 
 
are charged that you, sometime in July 1993, at a warehouse in Penjuru Road, Singapore, did abet one Poon Peng Huat in the commission of an offence, to wit, the said Poon Peng Huat voluntarily assisted in disposing of 640 pieces of `Hewlett Packard` computers valued at $1,855,072 which he knew to be stolen property, by intentionally aiding the said Poon Peng Huat by providing him with cash to acquire the stolen computers which offence was committed by the said Poon Peng Huat in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 414 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
In so far as relevant, s 414 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states as follows:
 
Whoever voluntarily assists in concealing or disposing of or making away with property which he 
 knows or has reason to believe
 to be stolen property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both; ... [Italics mine.]
 
 
 
And s 109 of the Penal Code states:
 
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to 12 months` imprisonment. He appealed against both his conviction and sentence.
The appeal came before me on 13 February 1997. At the end of the hearing, I dismissed it. I now give my reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case was this: there was a plan between one Aw Boon Hui (Aw) and one Lee Peng Wah, also known as Pui Kia, to steal a container of 640 computers from Pasir Panjang Distripark (PPD). Pui Kia subsequently approached Poon Peng Huat (Poon) to buy the stolen computers. Poon in turn approached one James Lam Chun Meng (James) and one Peter Yeo Hwee Hua (Peter) to arrange for the disposal of the computers.
Poon, however, did not have sufficient funds to purchase all the computers. Thus, he approached the appellant who loaned him a total of $80,000 to make the purchase. The case against the appellant was that he knew all along that the money was meant to buy stolen computers. In fact, he put up the money jointly with Poon, and he later received a share of the profit.
In order to prove the appellant`s guilty knowledge and involvement, the following evidence was adduced. Aw testified that he met Pui Kia some time in July 1993 to discuss about the theft of a container loaded with computers. Aw was then a driver of containers at PPD, and his role was to truck the container out of PPD. For his efforts, Pui Kia agreed to pay Aw $50,000.
On the day of the theft, the appellant picked Poon up from the latter`s shop in Ang Mo Kio, and they went together to the World Trade Centre (WTC) in the appellant`s blue Audi car. The $70,000 cash loan from the appellant, together with Poon`s own money, was kept in the glove compartment.
When they arrived at the WTC, the appellant and Poon went together to the cafeteria located on the second floor. There they met James and Peter. The prosecution contended that the appellant was present throughout the meeting when Poon asked Peter and James to look for a warehouse and discussed about the sale of the computers. A warehouse address, together with a drawing of the route to it, was then handed to Poon by either Peter or James.
After the meeting at the cafeteria, the appellant and Poon proceeded downstairs to the WTC car park to wait for Aw and Pui Kia. Aw wanted to see the cash first before he stole the container, and so Pui Kia had to drive him to the arranged location to view it. The prosecution contended that the appellant showed Aw the money upon his arrival. Thereafter, Aw and Pui Kia left together and headed towards PPD, while the appellant and Poon proceeded to Pasir Panjang hawker centre.
Pui Kia subsequently joined the appellant and Poon at the hawker centre, and they waited for Aw`s call. Aw finally contacted Pui Kia on the handphone to inform him that the container of computers had been successfully driven out of PPD. The three of them left at this point to meet Aw who had parked a trailer loaded with a container alongside a main road. When they met up, Pui Kia alighted from the appellant`s car and boarded the trailer while the appellant drove Poon to a warehouse in Clementi, with the trailer following behind. Upon arriving at the warehouse, Poon was dropped off, and the appellant left to buy cigarettes. But, as it turned out, there was no more space in the warehouse. It was decided that the stolen computers would be brought to another warehouse in Penjuru Road.
The appellant was eventually contacted and informed of the change of location, and he subsequently arrived at the Penjuru warehouse to watch the unstuffing of the computers. After the computers were unloaded, Aw and Pui Kia went into the blue Audi car. The prosecution contended that the appellant was the one who counted the cash and handed it to Pui Kia. Pui Kia, in turn, gave Aw $50,000 in $1,000 bills, and they both left the car after this. The appellant then drove Poon back to his shop in Ang Mo Kio. On their way back, Poon allegedly asked for another $10,000 from the appellant because he had miscalculated the amount. The appellant handed Poon the $10,000 as requested on the following day. Therefore, all in all, the appellant extended a sum of $80,000 to Poon.
After about one or two weeks, the appellant confirmed that he received $140,000 from Poon, even though he had loaned him only $80,000. $120,000 was in cash while the rest was in the form of a cheque. However, the appellant requested that he be paid in cash. Two days later, Poon paid the remaining $20,000 in cash to the appellant. The prosecution contended that this excess $60,000 was the appellant`s share of the profit in the criminal enterprise.
Since then, Poon, Pui Kia, Aw, James and Peter have all been convicted for their participation in the theft.
 The defence
The crux of the defence was that the money handed by the appellant to Poon was a loan. The appellant did not know that it was to be used to buy stolen goods. The appellant also testified that Poon and he were good friends who helped each other out when they were in financial difficulties.
The defence was that, some time in 1993, Poon had asked the appellant for a loan of $70,000. Although three weeks before that, Poon had borrowed another $60,000 and the debt was still outstanding, the appellant loaned the $70,000 in cash without asking what it was for.
As to the appellant`s presence at the WTC and the warehouse, the appellant explained that Poon`s car had broken down on the day in question. When he delivered the money to Poon`s shop in Ang Mo Kio, Poon asked for a lift to the WTC. The appellant agreed.
Upon arrival at the WTC, Poon invited the appellant to join him at the cafeteria on the second level since he was still early for his appointment. A while later, Poon`s clients arrived and the appellant was asked by Poon to wait while he joined his clients at another table. The appellant testified that he waited and sat alone about 8.8m away from the rest. Poon later introduced his clients, namely, James and Peter, to the appellant. A short conversation ensued about the appellant`s business, but there was no mention of computers. After that, Poon asked the appellant to leave with him.
The appellant and Poon returned to their car at the WTC car park. Pui Kia and Aw arrived shortly, whereupon Poon asked the appellant for the money in the glove compartment. The appellant handed the money to Poon who proceeded to show it to Aw and Pui Kia. All this time, the appellant claimed that he was inside the car. Thereafter, Poon told the appellant that he could leave if he was not free. However, the appellant suggested going for lunch instead, and they left together for the Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre.
While they were having their meal at the hawker centre, Pui Kia appeared. Poon went over to speak to him initially. Shortly afterwards, they joined the appellant at the table. They chatted about car prices, but there was no mention of computers. Pui Kia`s handphone then rang and Poon asked the appellant if he knew the way to a warehouse in Clementi. The appellant answered in the affirmative, and Poon asked to be driven there. The appellant obliged without asking further, and Pui Kia and Poon got into his car.
The three of them were travelling along Pasir Panjang Road on their way to the Clementi warehouse when Poon asked the appellant to stop in front of a trailer parked alongside the road. Pui Kia alighted from the car and got into the trailer. At this point, the appellant claimed that he asked Poon what was inside the container. Poon told him that it was `insurance claimed cargo`. The appellant testified that he took that to mean that the seller was able to claim insurance for goods which were damaged in one way or another whilst on the way to the buyer, and these goods could therefore be sold at a lower price after claiming insurance.
As the appellant and Poon continued their journey to the Clementi warehouse, the appellant claimed that he received a call from his company to check on colour proofing. Hence, he told Poon that he had something else on and would have to leave after dropping him off at the warehouse.
Back at his company, the appellant received a telephone call on his handphone from Poon who had apparently forgotten to take out the money from the glove compartment. The appellant went to check and found the money still there, so he agreed to bring the money over to Poon after he had settled his business at his company. Poon then informed him that the location of the warehouse had been changed to Penjuru Road and asked the appellant, who said he was familiar with the area, to meet him there.
About ten minutes after Poon`s telephone call, the appellant left for Penjuru warehouse. On his way there, the appellant claimed that he called Poon to find out the unit number of the warehouse. When he arrived, he found Poon waiting for him at the entrance of the building. The appellant claimed to have told Poon that he needed to go to the toilet and that the money was inside the car. So, he simply handed the car keys to Poon. When he came out of the toilet, Poon apparently said it was time to go and requested for a lift back to his shop in Ang Mo Kio. The appellant obliged. He denied meeting anyone else at Penjuru warehouse or making payment to anyone.
On their way back to Poon`s shop, Poon said that he had miscalculated his sums and asked for another $10,000. The appellant agreed to the additional loan and handed Poon the money the next day.
About two weeks later, Poon returned $140,000 to the appellant. $80,000 was allegedly for the most recent loan, while $60,000 was for an earlier loan. However, like the $70,000 cash loan, there was no documentary proof of this earlier loan.
The appellant maintained that, if he had known that Poon was buying stolen goods, he would not have loaned him the money, nor would he have driven him to the WTC and the warehouse.
 The decision below
Two voir dires were held to ascertain the admissibility of the long statements made by Poon and the appellant after allegations of police improprieties. The trial judge concluded that these statements were made voluntarily and accepted those parts which incriminated the appellant. He also ruled that the appellant`s credit was impeached due to material discrepancies between his testimony in court and his long statement.
The trial judge further considered the surreptitious circumstances surrounding the theft of the computers. In particular, he noted that the loan of $70,000 was in cash without any documentary proof of the money given. The appellant was also coincidentally present throughout the scene from start to finish and was repaid $140,000, an extra $60,000 from what was loaned to Poon. The appellant`s explanation that this $60,000 was for an earlier loan was rejected by the court.
Accordingly, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the charge against the appellant had been made out.
 Issues in the appeal
The defence did not dispute that the appellant knew that the money he loaned to Poon was intended for the purchase of the contents in the container. This was also evident from the following exchange:
 
 
Q: Did you know that Poon Peng Huat was buying over those computers at that time? 
 
A: My guess at that time was that Poon intended to purchase the contents in the container and to resell to another buyer. 
 
 
 
Q: When you brought the money to Poon at Penjuru Road warehouse, did you at that time guess or believe that he was asking you to bring the money to pay for the goods? 
 
A: I did guess so.
  
 
 
Thus, the only issue in this appeal concerned the mens rea of the appellant: whether he had 
 knowledge 
 or had 
 reason to believe 
 that the computers inside the container were stolen property.
 The appeal
Knowledge that property was stolen
The evidence which pointed to the appellant`s involvement in the theft and delivery of the computers was overwhelming. Based simply on the evidence of Aw and Poon, as well as the circumstances surrounding the theft, I concluded that the evidence gave rise to the irresistible inference of the appellant`s requisite knowledge that the computers were stolen.
The defence rested principally on the fact that the appellant was never told that the computers were stolen. He never even suspected that they were stolen. His presence at the various places on the day of the theft was explained as purely fortuitous. In effect, he had obliged Poon by driving him around because the latter`s car had broken down.
I first dealt with the circumstances surrounding the theft and delivery of the computers. It will be recalled that the appellant had advanced $70,000 in cash to Poon. There were no documents to evidence such a loan. The appellant claimed he never even asked Poon what the money was for. Since the money requested was in cash, and that this was the first time that Poon borrowed such a large sum, I thought the appellant`s suspicion would have at least been aroused, even if he did not know the precise use for the money.
Then, there was the appellant`s presence throughout the day at various places which pointed to his complicity. I accepted that presence at the scene per se was insufficient to prove knowledge or intention. But such a proposition must undoubtedly be dependent on the factual matrix.
The appellant`s version of his presence could be broken down into the following stages: (a). He had gone to hand a loan of $70,000 in cash to Poon at his shop. He did not know the purpose of the loan. At the shop, Poon, whose car had broken down, requested for a lift to the WTC to meet his `clients`. The appellant obliged. Upon arrival at the WTC, he decided to follow Poon to the cafeteria where, unbeknown to him, Poon met up with his two `clients` and sat at another table to discuss their plan about the storage of the stolen goods. The appellant was only asked to go over to join them after their discussion when he was introduced to these two men.
 (b). Poon and he subsequently went downstairs to the car park. Poon had arranged to meet two other men, Aw and Pui Kia, who unbeknown to the appellant were fellow accomplices to the theft. There, at the car park, the cash was shown in the appellant`s presence to these men.
 (c). After that, the appellant fetched Poon to the hawker centre to have lunch. Pui Kia joined them at the hawker centre, and when he received a call on the handphone, all three of them proceeded in the appellant`s car to the Clementi warehouse. The appellant claimed to be ignorant of the reason for going to the warehouse, and said he was merely obliging Poon by fetching him there.
 (d). As they were travelling along Pasir Panjang Road, the appellant was asked to pull over in front of a trailer which was parked alongside the road. Unbeknown to him again, this trailer contained the stolen goods. At this point, Pui Kia got out of the car and boarded the trailer which followed the appellant`s car to the Clementi warehouse. The appellant then claimed that he had to settle some business affairs in his company and so he left after dropping Poon off at the warehouse.
 (e). Curiously, Poon forgot to take the cash which was still left inside the appellant`s car, even though that was the very reason for meeting the appellant in the first place. Poon therefore telephoned the appellant, who again obliged by driving to the Penjuru warehouse, where the unstuffing was taking place, to deliver the money.
 (f). After the stolen goods had been unstuffed at the warehouse, the appellant drove Poon back to his shop.
 
 
The appellant`s defence was to steadfastly maintain that he did not know that the goods were stolen. But, the question was whether this denial was credible in view of his presence throughout the criminal enterprise.
The appellant`s explanation essentially amounted to this. His presence during the theft was coincidental. Poon`s car had coincidentally broken down on the day in question when he delivered $70,000 in cash to him. The appellant, who was coincidentally free that day, agreed to fetch Poon around. Poon, of course, had coincidentally arranged to meet all his fellow accomplices on that day; this was to discuss the disposal and the storage of the stolen property and to allow the viewing of the cash. It was also coincidental that Poon forgot to take the money out from the car, although that was the very reason for meeting the appellant in the first place. Thus, he had to recall the appellant to deliver the money at the very place where the stolen goods were unstuffed! The whole sequence of theft had therefore coincidentally unfolded before the appellant`s eyes, from the time the stolen goods were trucked out of PPD until the time of unstuffing at the Penjuru warehouse.
I could not but be incredulous of the appellant`s account. The sheer coincidences were inexplicable. Moreover, if he was not a party involved in some way or another with the theft, it was inconceivable that the other participants would have readily agreed to his presence at every stage of the criminal enterprise from the planning to its execution.
Aw had also testified that, after the unstuffing at the Penjuru warehouse, he entered a blue car to collect his dues and the money was handed over by the driver of the car. Unfortunately, Aw was unable to remember who the driver was. However, the evidence revealed that the appellant drove a blue Audi car.
On the circumstantial evidence alone, I concluded that there was sufficient basis to reach the inevitable and inexorable conclusion that the appellant was a participant in the criminal activity. The appellant`s presence at all the relevant stages of the theft went beyond mere presence, but indicated that he was well aware of the theft and was an active participant. I found his explanation that his presence was purely fortuitous `not in the least probable`: see 
Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 723
  and 
Miller v Minister of Pensions
 
[1947] 2 All ER 372
 ; [1947] WN 241. And, in so far as the law is concerned, the appellant`s guilt need not be proved beyond a shadow of doubt, but beyond a reasonable doubt. I had no hesitation in finding that the prosecution had discharged this burden.
I did not think it was necessary to go so far as to prove that Poon had expressly told the appellant that the computers were stolen property. Even if I had accepted that the appellant was never informed as such, it seemed to me that he must have known that there was a criminal enterprise going on. If it could be shown that the appellant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious, then it could be inferred from the present circumstances that he had the requisite guilty knowledge.
In 
PP v Koo Pui Fong
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 266
  , this court stated, at p 271, as follows:
 
This concept of wilful blindness does not introduce a new state of mind to that of knowing (see 
R v Griffiths
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 14
 ). It is simply a reformulation of actual knowledge. It seems to me that it is wholly in keeping with common sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred. Thus, I fully agree with the following passage of Lord Bridge in 
Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd
 
[1986] 83 Cr App R 155
 at p 164:
 
 
 
`... it is always open to the tribunal of fact, when knowledge on the part of a defendant is required to be proved, to base a finding of knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion confirmed.`
 
 
 
The appellant said he asked Poon what the goods were and was told that they were `claiming insurance cargo`. Even if Poon did in fact misrepresent to him the nature of the goods, I was convinced that the appellant had clearly shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from making further inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want his suspicions confirmed. No doubt, merely being put on inquiry or a mere suspicion is not to be equated automatically with knowledge. However, where the facts obviously point to one result, and the accused must have appreciated it but shuts his eyes to the truth, then together with the other evidence adduced, this can form a very compelling part of the evidence to infer the requisite guilty knowledge. Thus, if a man says to himself, `Despite all that I have seen and heard, I refuse to accept what my brain tells me is obvious`, it is an absurdity to say that he does not have the relevant knowledge simply because he chooses to practise Nelsonian blindness and delude himself.
Reverting to the facts here, the request for a large loan in cash, the private discussion which Poon allegedly had with his `clients`, the viewing of the cash at the WTC car park, the sudden change of vehicle by Pui Kia from the appellant`s car to the trailer along the road, the change of location of the warehouse and the delivery of the money at the Penjuru warehouse would, collectively, have raised a strong suspicion that all was not innocent. But, the appellant chose to turn a blind eye. Coupled with his presence at every stage of the theft and the other evidence, the irresistible inference arising from his wilful blindness in the circumstances was that he had the relevant guilty knowledge.
This finding of guilty knowledge was reinforced by the fact that, about two weeks later, the appellant received $140,000 for the loans he allegedly extended. The explanation during the trial that the amount in excess of the $80,000 loan was meant to discharge a previous loan must have been an afterthought. There was never any mention of it until the trial. The inference must be that the excess sum was in fact his share of the profit from the theft, and the appellant must have known that the computers were stolen.
In any case, even if knowledge could not be inferred, the mens rea for a s 414 charge would still be constituted under the alternative limb that the appellant had `reason to believe` that the computers were stolen. The requirement here would be lower than actual knowledge.
In 
Koh Hak Boon v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 427
  , this court stated, at p 430:
 
It is apparent from the cases that `reason to believe` involves a lesser degree of conviction than certainty and a higher one than speculation ...
 
 
 
Whether or not a person had `reason to believe` certain property was stolen property for the purposes of ss 411 and 414 is a test to be applied by the court, but from the perspective of the accused person. It must relate to the standards of belief of a reasonable man and not to those of any particular accused person, since the legislature could hardly have intended that, ceteris paribus, a conviction might depend on whether the accused reasons like a cretin or a genius. However, some element of subjectivity must be involved, because what might be apparent to a person with specialized knowledge of a certain field might not be apparent to a layman of even very high intelligence. ... The logical conclusion was that the court must assume the 
 position
 of the actual individual involved (ie including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man.
 
 
 
Applying the above test to the present set of facts, I concluded that the appellant would have had reason to believe that the goods were stolen. The fact that the initial loan of $70,000 was requested to be made in cash, the meetings Poon had with the other accomplices in the appellant`s presence and the manner the deal was conducted all added up to the appellant`s guilty mens rea.
Having considered the evidence as I did, there was no need to go through the matters that were raised in the two voir dires. In reaching my finding, I placed no reliance on the police statements given by Poon and the appellant. The surrounding circumstances of this case, without more, already left me in no doubt that the appellant possessed the necessary mens rea to constitute the offence. In any event, these police statements, if indeed admissible as ruled by the trial judge, would only serve to fortify my conclusions.
 The sentence
In sentencing the appellant to 12 months` imprisonment, the trial judge took into account the fact that the appellant was a first time offender, the delay of about two years in the investigation and prosecution of the appellant and, finally, the sentences that were passed on the other accomplices.
Poon was sentenced to five years` corrective training, but he faced three charges; one under s 414, one under s 379A for theft of the trailer and one under s 411 which related to other stolen goods. The last two charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. As for Peter, he was sentenced to three years` imprisonment. He also faced three charges but the only charge relating to the present case was under s 411. His remaining two charges were in relation to other stolen goods and were taken into consideration. As for James, he was sentenced to three years` imprisonment. He faced three charges under s 411, but only one of them related to the present case. The remaining two charges involving other stolen goods were taken into consideration. Finally, Aw was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to one charge of theft of the container and another charge for theft of the trailer.
However, the appellant`s sentence of 12 months` imprisonment appeared inadequate to me. First, I was minded by the fact that the value of the property stolen amounted to more than $1.8m. Second, there was no mention of any restitution being made. Therefore, I decided to impose an additional fine of $80,000 on the appellant, and I made the pronouncement in court accordingly.
However, I realised later on the same day that, in so doing, I had exceeded the maximum limit of $10,000 as provided for in s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC): see also 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 885
  . I immediately recalled the appellant to appear before me in open court. And, in the presence of his counsel and the deputy public prosecutor, I revoked my earlier order of a $80,000 fine and enhanced his imprisonment term by six months. The appellant would thus have to serve a sentence of 18 months` imprisonment.
 Power to alter or review judgment
By substituting the sentence, a legal point was raised concerning whether the High Court in its criminal appellate capacity could alter the judgment, which necessarily included the sentence. I thought it would be appropriate and useful for me now to set out the basis for such a power.
Section 217 of the CPC, which appears to be the relevant provision here, states:
 
 
(1) No court 
 other than the High Court 
, when it has recorded its judgment, shall alter or review the same. 
 
(2) A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other mistakes may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
One possible construction of s 217 which I considered was that the High Court could alter or review its own judgment at any time provided it involved a clerical error; however, where it was any other mistake, the rectification could be made only before the High Court rose for the day. This was the view taken by the Malaysian Supreme Court in 
Lorraine Phylis Cohen & Anor v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 288
  . There the court dealt with the materially similar s 278 of the CPC (FMS Cap 6) which provides:
 
No court, other than a High Court, having once recorded its judgment, shall alter or review the same; provided that a clerical error may be rectified at any time, and that any other mistake may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.
 
 
 
Lee Hun Hoe CJ thus held at p 289 as follows:
 
 
 The High Court may be able to alter or review its judgment before the court rises for the day
 but not when the second judgment was written some 15 months after the first judgment was delivered. We do not think in such a situation s 278 confers jurisdiction on a judge to deliver a second judgment to supplement a first judgment. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
There was also strong dicta by the local Court of Appeal in 
Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 396
  which stated that the High Court could alter its judgment even after recording the same, although it did not go on to elaborate on the operation of s 217(2) or how it affected s 217(1). Wee Chong Jin CJ, delivering judgment for the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 408 as follows:
 
Our decision on the issue of jurisdiction is sufficient to dispose of all three matters before us. However, we think it useful to deal with a legal point raised in these proceedings.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
A plain reading of the section shows that the High Court can alter or review its judgment. There is no reason to compel a restrictive interpretation, especially since we are concerned with a superior court of record, which is also the highest court of trial in criminal cases. We must give effect to the plain meaning of the words in the section. To ignore the words `other than the High Court` would be to render them otiose. In our opinion, s 216 CPC [now the present s 217] gives sanction to Lai Kew Chai J to alter the fine. It was necessary for him to do so to correct a mistake as to the maximum fine that could be imposed.
 
 
 
In the light of what we think is the true scope of s 216, cases that held a court to be functus officio immediately after sentencing can have no application in this present case.
 
 
 
The court further ruled that there was no impropriety in the alteration having been made in chambers and in the appellants` absence since their counsel were present with the deputy public prosecutors. The court also found that it was not objectionable per se to have the amendment done in chambers. The important consideration was whether the appellants or their counsel were present. Moreover, the alteration in the sentence resulted in the reduction of the fine from $10,000 to $5,000. Hence, there was no detriment or prejudice to either of the appellants.
To support the High Court`s power of alteration and review, reference was made in that case to the English judges of assize, the predecessor of the Crown Court, who possessed a power at common law to vary or rescind their orders within the period of the then current assize. Suffice it to say that such an analogy must be viewed cautiously since a judge of assize would be akin to a High Court judge exercising original jurisdiction, and not appellate jurisdiction.
With respect, I did not think that the reasoning in 
 Wong Hong Toy 
 formed the only basis to conclude that Lai Kew Chai J was able to do what he did. And, since it was dicta of the Court of Appeal, it was with great deference that I departed from a similar reasoning. But essentially, I would not disagree that Lai Kew Chai J was empowered to alter the sentence, although my grounds for saying so were different.
As a preliminary observation, I noted that our present s 217 of the CPC has remained substantially the same since it appeared in the CPC in 1900 as s 266. Section 266 of the CPC in 1900 stated as follows:
 
No Court other than the Supreme Court when it has recorded its judgment shall alter or review the same. 
 Provided that
 a clerical error may be rectified at any time and that any other mistake may be rectified at any time before the Court rises for the day. [Italics mine.]
 
 
 
The section was subsequently divided into two limbs in the 1920 reprint of the revised edition of the 1910 CPC. However, in the process, the words `
 Provided that 
` were omitted which, in my mind, would have thrown considerable light on the true scope of the present section. Section 217 now consists of two sub-sections in largely the same terms as s 266. But, I did not think that s 217 in any way removed the proviso that was intended by the legislature in 1900. Taking this to be the position, it would be right to assume that s 217 is substantively similar to s 266. Indeed, having looked at the present s 278 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6), I noticed that the words `provided for` were still being preserved.
Thus, it was evident to me that subsection (2) of s 217 was meant as a proviso, even though the words `
 provided that 
` were deleted. The effect of an excepting or qualifying proviso, according to the ordinary rules of construction, is to except out of the preceding portion of the enactment, or to qualify something enacted therein which but for the proviso would be within it. Such a proviso cannot be construed as enlarging the scope of an enactment when it can be fairly and properly construed without attributing to it that effect: see 
Duncan v Dixon
 
[1890] 44 Ch D 211
 , 
Corp of the City of Toronto v A-G for Canada
 
[1946] AC 32
 and 
Mullins v Treasurer of the County of Surrey
 
[1880] 5 QBD 170
 . These propositions are fairly settled rules of construction. Hence, it would be incorrect to treat s 217(2) as if it were an independent enacting clause.
The implication was this: if s 217(2) was a proviso, then what was it a proviso to?
Turning to s 217(1), the not-too-happily phrased `
 other than the High Court 
` would, at first sight, seem to suggest that the section allowed the High Court to alter or review its judgment. To say that s 217 gave such a sanction would mean that the legislature had deliberately legislated in a negative manner to confer a power of alteration on the High Court, followed by a proviso. In this case, s 217(2) would be a qualifying proviso. The logical consequence of this construction meant that the lower court could, 
 at no time 
, alter or review its own judgment once the same had been recorded, be it a clerical error or otherwise. This was because, as I have said earlier, a proviso could not stand on its own and must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stood as a proviso. And, under such a construction, that principal matter only concerned the High Court`s power of alteration or review.
On the other hand, to say that s 217(2) was a proviso only in relation to the subordinate courts, but not the High Court, would mean that the latter was free to make substantive alterations at any time. In this case, s 217(2) would be an excepting proviso to the prohibition against alteration of judgments by subordinate courts. But, such a construction left the High Court`s power of alteration unqualified. Effectively, the High Court would never be functus officio since, in theory, there would be nothing to prevent a third or a fourth judgment to supplement an earlier judgment. This, surely, would strike at the very core of the principle of finality.
Therefore, upon a true construction of s 217, I did not think that it attempted any substantive enactment with regard to the High Court. In this respect, I entirely agreed with what was stated by Petheram CJ, and concurred by the full bench, in 
 Re Gibbons 
 14 ILR (Cal) 42 at p 47. There, the court had to deal with the somewhat similar s 369 of the Indian CPC (Act X of 1882) which stated that `
 no Court, other than a High Court, when it has signed its judgment, shall alter or review the same, except as provided in s 395 or to correct a clerical error 
.` The learned Chief Justice held as follows:
 
In my opinion the effect of the words `other than a High Court` is precisely the same as if in place of them the legislature had at the end of the section added these words, `this section does not apply to the High Court.` There is no substantive enactment in that section with reference to the High Court, and all it does is to reserve the powers which existed in the High Court before, so that they are in no degree taken away. What the powers of the High Court were before it is unnecessary to consider, but whatever they were, they were reserved and they were in the same position after this section was passed as they had been in before; and inasmuch as it is not shown to us that, before the passing of this section, any power of revision existed in the High Court, that section did not, in my opinion, create any such power, and therefore it appears that this section does not help the applicant.

PP v Heng You Nang
 
 [1949] MLJ 285 
 , per Spenser-Wilkinson J at p 288 and 
Ooi Sim Yim v PP
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 88
  .
Based on this approach, s 217(1) would lay down a general prohibition against alteration of judgments by the subordinate courts. And s 217(2) was an excepting proviso to this prohibition by prescribing the limited circumstances in which the subordinate courts could alter or review their judgments. In my view, the entire section might be read as if it did not apply to the High Court at all.
The question was thus narrowed to this: if the High Court in its appellate capacity did not derive its power of alteration from s 217, then where did such a power come from?
It could be said that the High Court abides by the slip rule, and it has an inherent power to correct mistakes in its records when it involves accidental slips or omissions: 
Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris v Officer-In-Charge, Pudu Prison
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 72
  . A similar power is expressly conferred on the High Court acting in its civil jurisdiction by virtue of O 20 r 11 of the Rules of Court. However, I did not think that such a power of alteration, be it inherent or otherwise, was similar to that conferred by s 217(2).
The difference was obvious. Under s 217(2), `A clerical error may be rectified at any time and 
 any other mistakes 
 may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.` It was apparent that `any other mistakes` here were more than clerical mistakes, since the latter category was already covered by the previous phrase. Thus, in 
Monteiro v PP
 
 
[1964] MLJ 338
  , it was held that the failure by the learned President to hear the defence before pronouncement of conviction was not fatal as the court had not arisen for the day. Under s 272 of the Criminal Procedure Code (SS Cap 21) (which was the equivalent of our s 217), it was open to the court there to call on defence counsel after such a finding, but before sentence, to make his submissions to alter such a finding if necessary. To this extent, the case illustrated that rectifications under s 217 could go beyond mere accidental slips and omissions, the only restriction being that it must be corrected before the court rose for the day.
Unfortunately, the case did not go on further to explain the meaning of the phrase `rises for the day`. And, there appeared to be a dearth of cases as to what the phrase meant. In today`s context, this could mean that the court rose when it had heard all the cases scheduled for the day. My reservation against this construction was that it seemed all too fortuitous that the time limit for alteration of judgments should depend on the number of cases or appeals scheduled for that day. Neither did it seem right if the phrase meant the conclusion of the individual case. The words `for the day` disposed of such a construction. Moreover, I did not see how non-clerical mistakes could ever in practice be rectified since, based on either of these constructions, there would be no realistic opportunity or time for the court`s attention to be drawn to such mistakes.
Thus I was more inclined to construe that the court rose for the day only when it ceased to sit for business. This would be the natural and ordinary meaning. So, even if a judge retired into chambers after hearing, the court would not effectively cease its business for the day because the judge could still convene a hearing if necessary. Consequently, in practical terms, a court only rose for the day when the working day for the court had ended. This purposive construction would afford the judge a realistic opportunity to know of and correct any non-clerical mistake in the judgment without unduly offending the principle of finality. The limited time period within which a non-clerical mistake might be rectified ensured that the accused would not suffer any real detriment. I might also add, for the sake of prudence, that the accused or his counsel should be present to avoid any allegation of prejudice or impropriety.
Having reached the view that s 217 was not a substantive enactment in respect of the High Court, it seemed redundant to discuss its scope at such length. However, the relevance would at once be apparent because I proceeded to conclude that the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction must necessarily have whatever powers which the lower courts possessed. I rested this proposition on the high authority of the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  . That was a case which concerned whether the High Court had power to amend a charge in its appellate capacity when the CPC did not expressly provide for it. LP Thean JA, delivering the unanimous decision for the court at p 412, stated as follows:
 
The question still remains whether it is implicit in s 256(b) of the CPC that the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has the power to amend the charge. If a literal and strict construction is adopted, it is clear that the High Court has no such power. However, such a construction would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. Further, the High Court has the revisionary powers under ss 266-268 of the CPC. In view of these extensive express powers, it is inconceivable that it was the intention of the legislature that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, should not have the power to amend the charge preferred against the accused and set the record straight. A more purposive construction should in our view be adopted. We think that such power is by necessary implication implied in s 256(b).
 
 
 
By parity of reasoning, the powers conferred on the lower courts by s 217 must, by implication, also be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity. It should be borne in mind that, apart from the CPC, s 27 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) also expressly states that the High Court shall have general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts.
Consequently, this court had the requisite power in altering the sentence of the appellant in the instant case, even though it was a substantive mistake, because it had not arisen for the day when the rectification was made. On this approach, it was also apparent that Lai Kew Chai J had the necessary powers to reduce the fine in the case of 
 Wong Hong Toy 
since the mistake there was rectified before the court rose for the day.
I would add, however, that this power to alter or review existed only because this court was acting in an appellate capacity. As regards the High Court acting in an original jurisdiction, I did not think it was necessary in the present case to consider what the position would be.
Even if I was wrong in my view, and that the dicta in 
 Wong Hong Toy 
 represented the true position at law, I would still be empowered to substitute a six-month imprisonment term after my order of a $80,000 fine. Since I was not functus officio, I could alter the sentence. And, on the facts of the present case, no real detriment or prejudice would have occurred. The substitution of the sentence took place on the very same day in the afternoon, even before the appellant was taken back to prison. It was not as if he had already begun serving his sentence and was told later that his imprisonment term had been enhanced. Moreover, the appellant, his counsel and the deputy public prosecutor were all present in open court when the sentence was substituted. So there could be no allegation of impropriety.
 Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, the appeal against conviction was without merit. As for the appeal against sentence, I enhanced the appellant`s imprisonment term to 18 months, after having substituted a six-month imprisonment term for an earlier order of a $80,000 fine. Such a power of alteration was implied since this court was acting in its appellate capacity.
Accordingly I dismissed both appeals.",1997-06-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The charges
The appellant was tried on two charges of drug trafficking:
 
1st charge
 
 
 
that he on or about 3 October 1996, between 5.20pm and 5.40pm in Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by transporting 3,449g of opium containing not less than 53.93g of morphine from the vicinity of Block 327 Yishun Ring Road to Punggol Road in a taxi bearing registration number SHA 9327L without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and that he thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
2nd charge
 
 
 
that he on or about 3 October 1996 at about 7.15pm at apartment Block 327 Yishun Ring Road [num ]02-1310, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking 13,956.1g of opium containing not less than 111.66g of morphine at the said apartment without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and he thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
He was tried before the learned judicial commissioner Amarjeet Singh, convicted on both charges and sentenced to death.
 The facts
On 3 October 1996 at about 12.30pm, Inspector Ang Choe Seng of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) instructed his subordinate Sgt Ng Chin Huat to gather a team of officers and conduct surveillance on the appellant at Blk 8 Hougang Avenue 3. Sgt Ng and five officers then departed for Hougang Avenue 3. They arrived at about 1.30pm and waited there until approximately 4.45pm. The appellant was then observed leaving the block of flats where, according to him, he was playing a game of mahjong with some friends. The appellant boarded a taxi which took him to his residence at Blk 327 Yishun Ring Road where he alighted at about 5.15pm. The taxi then parked at the foot of the block of flats. Approximately five minutes later, the appellant was observed entering the same taxi carrying a green cloth bag. The CNB officers tailed the taxi as it travelled along Yishun Central, Yishun Avenue 2, Lentor Avenue, Seletar Expressway and Tampines Expressway. The taxi then left the expressway and filtered off onto Punggol Road. It was intercepted by the CNB officers along Punggol Road at about 5.40pm.
The appellant was seated in the front passenger seat and had the green cloth bag between his feet. The CNB officers seized the green cloth bag which contained two plastic bags each containing a bundle wrapped in white masking tape. Each bundle contained a black sticky substance.
The appellant was brought back to his home, a 4-room HDB flat, where a large aluminium pot and four smaller containers (three plastic tubs and one small aluminium pot) were found kept in kitchen cabinets. The large aluminum pot contained eight plastic packets of a black sticky substance. One of the plastic tubs and the smaller aluminium pot were filled with the black sticky substance while the remaining two plastic tubs were empty but for what appeared to be some remnants of the substance. Dr Lui Chi Pang, scientific officer with the Department of Scientific Services, testified that at the bottom of the filled smaller containers were lumps which from a visual inspection appeared to be banana pulp and sweet potatoes although he did not carry out any scientific analysis of those substances.
The black sticky substance in all the containers was analysed by Dr Lui and found to be raw opium, a Class A controlled drug. The two packages found on the appellant which were the subject of the first charge contained 3,449g of raw opium with not less that 53.93g of morphine. The opium seized in the flat amounted to 13,956.1g. Only the contents of two packets recovered from the large aluminium pot were analysed for morphine and found to contain 59.83g and 51.83g of morphine respectively. Under the Second Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (`the Act`), the unauthorised traffic in more than 1,200g of opium containing more than 30g of morphine is punishable with death.
The appellant`s defence was that he intended to use the opium to prepare medicinal plasters to treat sprains, dislocations and rheumatic conditions. He said he was from China and had come to Singapore in 1958 at the age of 15 to join his father who had arrived earlier. His ancestors had a knowledge of medicine and that knowledge was passed down to him in China and built on after he arrived in Singapore. From 1958 to 1961, the appellant said he worked in a Chinese Medical Hall called Lam Chee Seng at 124 Cross Street. The defence produced seven manuals handwritten in the Chinese language which the appellant said were written by his great great grandfather. The manuals were recovered from the appellant`s flat. According to him, the manuals were passed down to him, as the eldest son, when he married in 1971. He said he had a special interest in injuries like sprains, bruises and traumatic injuries.
One of the manuals was entitled `Secret Instruction On The Complete Study And Explanation Of Chinese Massage, Internal And External Injuries And Blood Circulation`. Attention was drawn to a particular entry which read - `Plaster Prescription to Treat: Traumatic Injuries, Rheumatism and Ostalgia`. The manual stated that the opium should be buried under the `Toh Pit` tree for 20 days `to enhance the efficacy of the medicine, then mixed with peeled bananas and sweet potatoes for ten days and thereafter blended with Chinese herbs, namely, Chuan Noi, Cha Hu, Kwee Kee, Gu Chit and Toh Tong. The appellant had written out to the investigating officer the method of preparation described above from memory and this was substantively similar to the instructions in the manual. He had also described the procedure for the preparation of the plasters in his s 121 and s 122(6) statements which were produced before the court below. The appellant explained that burying the opium under the particular kind of tree would help dissipate the `heaty` property of the opium. Letting the opium stand with the sweet potatoes and bananas would enable the latter to absorb the qualities of the opium that would be used to cure the bone conditions he sought to treat. The appellant said that, on the day of his arrest, he was bringing the two bundles of opium found in the green bag for burial under a `Toh Pit` tree which was located in a field next to the fish pond along Punggol Road.
The herbs mentioned above were recovered from the appellant`s home contained in bottles and packets either as powders or in root form.
Inspector S Gopalakrishnan, the investigating officer, wrote to the Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution and the Singapore Chinese Physicians` Association seeking information on the poultice that the appellant prepared. In particular, he asked:
 
Is this mixture a known Chinese traditional herbal poultice?Is this poultice being used in Singapore or even in China?
 
 
 
If such a traditional poultice exists, is it used to treat rheumatism, sprained or dislocated limbs as stated?
 
 
 
The Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution replied that the particular poultice was probably prepared from personal experience as it was not to be found in Chinese medical books and was not commonly practised in China. The letter went on to describe the individual components of the poultice. From their analysis of these components, the writers of the letter were of the opinion that the poultice might help for rheumatism, sprain or dislocated limbs due to their individual properties as described in the texts on Chinese medicine. As to Inspector Gopalakrishnan`s question in a subsequent letter whether burial under the `Toh Pit` tree and mixing with sweet potatoes and bananas was a common practice, the Institution replied that it had no knowledge of such a practice among its members.
The Singapore Chinese Physicians` Association replied that opium and the herbs used by the appellant fell within the purview of Chinese traditional medicine, although they emphasised that opium and Chuan Noi were controlled substances and as such their members did not use them. While the medicinal plasters were not sold openly in the market, they could be used for the treatment of rheumatism, sprains or dislocations. Pertaining to Inspector Gopalakrishnan`s subsequent query as to the practice of burying and mixing with bananas and sweet potatoes, the Association replied that a traditional method of steeping traditional Chinese medicine was to remove the toxicity of drugs or to change the properties of drugs by way of burying them in the soil. They also said that the method of mixing with sweet potatoes and peeled bananas could be a folk method on which they were unable to comment.
The appellant said that his father prepared the opium plasters from time to time up to his death in the latter half of 1992. He did not know if his father treated anyone with them or, if he did, who they were. He said however, that his father had occasion to treat himself. The appellant said that when he needed plasters, for example when his workers sustained injuries, he would obtain them from his father. When his father passed away, he left behind `a large quantity` of opium which he had already buried under the `Toh Pit` tree and was then taken out. The appellant used this quantity of opium to continue making the plasters. He said, however, that he ran out of opium sometime in February or March 1995 and between April 1995 and June 1996, when people approached him for plasters, he would inform them that he had run out of them. However, his father had told him that, if he ran out of opium, he could obtain it from red-light areas. This was why, according to him, he visited Rowell Road in July 1996, that is, to procure some more opium to produce his plasters which were in demand. There he obtained three bundles of opium at $830 each from a Burmese Chinese man who was hawking Chinese medicines. According to the appellant, he did not ask how heavy the bundles were. As to why he purchased that particular quantity of opium, the appellant said that the Burmese Chinese man only had those three bundles. The Burmese Chinese man told him that, if he needed more opium, he could be found in the same area around the third week of every month. The appellant returned to the same place in August and met up again with this Burmese Chinese man to buy more opium. He obtained another five packets of opium although these packets were smaller and cost only $750 each. His reason for buying such a large quantity was because he was of the view that opium was difficult to come by even if one had the money to buy it. Also, news of the efficacy of the plasters would spread among the construction site workers so quickly that there would be a great demand for them. In fact, the amount of opium he had would not last very long. Furthermore, the plasters once prepared could be kept for a lengthy period of time without going bad. All one had to do was to warm the plaster near a flame and the substance, hardened over time, would be sticky once again and suitable for application.
According to the appellant`s s 121 statement, he buried a first lot of opium under the `Toh Pit` tree in Punggol on 28 August 1996 (the statement says 26 August 1996 but he corrected this in court). He retrieved this lot of opium three weeks later on or about 20 September 1996 and placed them in the small aluminium pot and a plastic tub over sweet potatoes and bananas. The mixture was to stand for eight to 14 days before it was mixed with the Chinese herbs. The mixture was therefore still in this state when he was arrested on 3 October 1996. On the day of his arrest, he was on his way to bury another lot of opium.
The appellant was asked by the trial judge why, if the plasters were in such high demand, he did nothing to prepare them for two months after purchasing the opium in July 1996. After all, he had run out of plasters in April 1995 and for more than a year until July 1996 had no opium with which to prepare the plasters. After obtaining the opium in the later part of July 1996, he waited about a month before he buried the first lot of opium. The appellant explained that he was waiting for a particular type of fragrant sweet potato to become available before he proceeded. This was only available around 20 August 1996. He gave a description of this variety of potato when asked by the trial judge. The appellant was also asked by the trial judge why he did not bury the entire quantity of the first batch of opium that he obtained from the Burmese Chinese national in July 1996. The appellant explained that he did not bring the whole lot to bury because he had to sun the opium first. He believed that sunning the opium dispelled the `qi` or toxicity from the opium. He used two of the four containers for sunning the opium and the other two containers for the sweet potatoes and bananas.
The appellant`s children, Ng Boon Yau, Ng Chor Hoon and Ng Chor Yau testified as prosecution witnesses. They gave evidence that their father had treated them in the past with his medicinal plasters. Boon Yau was treated seven to eight years ago for an injury to his right shoulder blade. Chor Hoon was treated for a sprained ankle two or three years ago and Chor Yau was treated two years ago for an injury to his right leg. According to the children, the appellant could frequently be observed mixing herbs and sunning them. They were not familiar however with the herbs or ingredients used by the appellant.
The defence also called three witnesses to testify that they had been treated for various traumatic injuries by the appellant using his specially prepared plasters. The first, Mark Wong Kwok Wah, is a trained engineer and presently General Manager of VSL (S) Pte Ltd. Wong had occasion to work with the appellant over the years on various construction projects in which the appellant would perform subcontracting services. He said he had heard of the appellant`s background in Chinese medicine from the time they first worked together in 1986. However, in 1989, he had an accident and suffered from recurring pain which Western medicine did not seem to be able to cure. In 1992 or 1993, he met the appellant who, having observed him limping, offered him some of his plasters. He said that the plasters were `typical Chinese plasters for rheumatism` and what was commonly known as `tie tau`. After applying the plasters, Wong said that he made a full recovery and the pain did not recur. Wong said that he had seen some of the appellant`s workers, who apparently were old men, using the plasters on their bodies. When he asked the appellant what the paste was, the appellant said that it was a `secret of the family`.
The next witness was one Ko Peng Chun, a subcontractor who had known the appellant for about 30 years, having first met him in Brunei when they worked on the same project. Two years earlier, Ko had sprained his back badly. According to him, he could not get up. At his request, the appellant massaged his back. The appellant also applied a plaster on it. The appellant also provided him with several plasters which he applied to his back himself. He too got better after the appellant`s treatment. He did not know what was in the plaster except that it was blackish and had a strong smell.
The third witness for the defence was Goh Heng Guan, a fishmonger who became acquainted with the appellant at a coffeeshop in Hougang which they both frequented. Goh explained that, as a result of his constant contact with ice, he suffered rheumatic pains in his knee which he said was alleviated after having used the plasters provided by the appellant.
Inspector Gopalakrishnan testified that he had on 9 October 1996 brought the appellant to the site of the `Toh Pit` tree under which the appellant had said that he had previously buried the two packets of opium and where he was intending to bury the two packets he was apprehended with. The tree was located in a low lying wasteland covered with vegetation and was swampy. Some wooden structures were located on the land which Inspector Gopalakrishnan said were abandoned pig farms. Inspector Gopalakrishnan first brought the appellant to where the latter said he had previously walked to the tree from Punggol Road. The Inspector said that the spot which the appellant pointed to under the Toh Pit tree was inaccessible because there was no path, the vegetation was very thick and it was muddy and swampy. According to the Inspector, he asked the appellant to lead the way but the appellant did not. The appellant gave a slightly different account of the events that transpired. He said that he was not asked to lead the way at all, because, if he had been told to do so, he as a prisoner would have complied. He said that Inspector Gopalakrishnan took a step into sinking mud and decided not to proceed any further. Using a telephoto lens, the police photographer took some close-up photographs of the `Toh Pit` tree. After that, Inspector Gopalakrishnan drove onto Punggol Road to try and access the tree from an alternative point. This was, however, also unsuccessful because their paths were blocked by thick vegetation, fencing and a big concrete drain.
The defence produced meteorological reports showing that the specific area in Punggol experienced daily rainfall in the period between 2 and 9 October 1996. Moderate rainfall was experienced on 2 and 3 October 1996. From 4 October 1996 to 9 October 1996, the report said that the area experienced daily moderate to heavy showers with lightning and thunder.
Furthermore, Boon Yau and Jessie Chua, the appellant`s daughter-in-law, introduced fresh photographic evidence of the site. These photographs were taken during the trial period and showed Boon Yau walking through the allegedly impassable swamp to the tree in question.
 The finding below
The trial judge identified three issues for his consideration. First, was the appellant versed in traditional Chinese medicine? Secondly, was his intention that the opium would ultimately be used by drug addicts or was it, as he claimed, to manufacture medicinal plasters? Thirdly, if it were for the latter purpose, was the appellant nevertheless guilty of the offence as a matter of law? He found for the appellant on the first two issues. However, he held that, even so, the appellant fell under the definition of `trafficking` under the Act.
 The appeal
Issues of fact - the appellant`s purpose for the opium
The prosecution had contended at the trial that the appellant was transporting the opium on the day of his arrest not for the purpose of burial under the `Toh Pit` tree but to deliver it to an unknown third party at the end of that journey. The trial judge held that the appellant had knowledge of Chinese traditional medicine and was transporting the opium in the taxi for burial under the `Toh Pit` tree in the wasteland along Punggol Road for the purpose of preparing medicinal plasters. The prosecution in this appeal maintained that this finding of the trial judge was erroneous.
The trial judge based his finding on the following evidence. The appellant, while in custody, was able to recite from memory the ingredients and instructions for the preparation of the medicinal plasters as found in the relevant manual. He had furthermore given the same consistent story in his statements to the investigating officer throughout. The herbs used as ingredients in the plasters were also recovered in some form or other from the appellant`s flat. There was evidence from the appellant`s children that their father was in the habit of sunning Chinese herbs outside the kitchen window and along the corridor outside the flat. The trial judge referred to the replies to Inspector Gopalakrishnan`s queries by the two Chinese medical associations which gave a certain amount of credibility to the defence. It might further be added that the defence had called three independent witnesses whose credibility was not seriously challenged by the prosecution and who testified that they had been personally treated by the appellant with his medicinal plasters. One of them, Wong, also testified that he had seen the workers under the appellant`s charge sporting the plasters.
As to the second issue of fact, namely, whether the opium the appellant was in possession of was meant to be supplied to drug addicts or whether he intended to use it only to produce plasters, the trial judge accepted that the appellant`s intention was to produce the plasters. The trial judge rejected the submissions of the prosecution to the contrary. He relied on his first finding that the appellant had knowledge of Chinese medicine and accepted the appellant`s testimony that, on the day of his arrest, he was not transporting the drugs to some unknown third party in Punggol as contended by the prosecution. The trial judge noted that the `Toh Pit` tree had been classified as a medicinal plant in medical literature and was used for curative purposes. He also refused to draw any inferences against the appellant based on Inspector Gopalakrishnan`s evidence that the appellant had declined to lead the way to the `Toh Pit` tree. The trial judge said that the appellant must have sensibly refused to do so having observed the Inspector`s foot sinking into the mud. The prosecution`s contention that this showed that access to the tree was impossible was also rejected in the face of the evidence adduced by the defence as to the rainfall in that area during the relevant time as well as the photographs of Boon Yau walking to the `Toh Pit` tree. We add the following observations in this context. The `Toh Pit` tree is described by Associate Professor Wee Yeow Chin in his book `
 A Guide to Medicinal Plants 
` (published by the Singapore Science Centre) as a shrub of wasteland. From the notes of evidence, we learnt that the `Toh Pit tree` was not actually very sizeable. The particular `tree` under which the appellant intended to bury the opium was next to the fish pond some distance away from Punggol Road into the vegetated wasteland. It was not readily identifiable from the roadside by the naked eye. The photographs adduced in evidence of the particular tree in question were taken using a telephoto lens. As the trial judge pointed out, unless the appellant had actually physically been to the tree before his arrest, it was unlikely that he would have known of its existence.
The trial judge noted that the dates on which the appellant said that he purchased the opium were not challenged by the prosecution. He thought it unlikely that, if the appellant were trafficking in raw opium without any intention of using it to make medicinal plasters, he would still have almost the entire quantity of opium purchased nearly two months after he had first bought it. Furthermore, if his modus operandi was to mix the opium with sweet potatoes and bananas to make the opium more bulky for sale and he was conveying the two packets of opium in the taxi to some unknown third party for sale, the prosecution had not explained why the opium which the appellant was carrying in the taxi was not so adulterated.
As for the inconsistencies in the appellant`s s 121 and s 122(6) statements, the trial judge thought they were the result of inaccurate recording under a heavy line of questioning.
In our view, the trial judge`s finding was clearly supported by strong evidence. The two issues of fact as identified by the trial judge were mutually reinforcing. The fact that the appellant had knowledge of Chinese medicine, and practised it, made his explanation for what he intended to do with the opium more credible. Before us, the DPP has attempted to reopen these issues. We do not see the necessity of delving into the details of his lengthy submissions on this point. Suffice it to say that it was an onerous task which he took upon himself trying to overturn findings of fact by the trial judge. In our judgment, these findings were clearly supported by the evidence and the DPP`s arguments failed to convince us that we should depart from them.
Issue of law - were the appellant`s actions nevertheless `trafficking`
We move on then to the third issue identified by the trial judge, namely, whether the intended use of the opium by the appellant nevertheless constituted the offence of trafficking. The opium in his flat was for the purpose of preparing medicinal plasters. The opium in the taxi was also for that purpose. The appellant admitted that he would either sell or give these plasters to his friends, acquaintances or his family members. In the first charge, the appellant was physically bringing the opium to the `Toh Pit` tree for burial in the course of preparing it for its ultimate purpose which was for use as an ingredient in the medicinal plasters. In the second charge, the appellant was in possession of the opium in the flat for the purpose of preparing those plasters. The question that falls to be answered in both charges is whether that purpose, which is the same in respect of both charges, would bring the physical acts of transporting and possession out of the definition of trafficking as found in the Act.
 The decision below
On the face of it, the definition of `trafficking` in s 2 of the Act would seem to preclude any such argument. If the conduct of an accused falls within the description of any one of the heptad of verbs, the literal effect of the definition in s 2 would seem to make him guilty of trafficking. Indeed, this was the position taken by the trial judge.
The trial judge took as his starting point the policy underlying the Misuse of Drugs legislation which he explained was for the strict control of the movement of controlled drugs. He noted that Parliament had realised the potentially beneficial effects of some controlled drugs and had arranged for their licit use `within a strictly controlled scientific, medical and administrative regime.` According to the trial judge (at para 11 of his grounds of decision):
 
Both the preamble of the Act and the schematic structure of the Act and its regulations thereunder show that unauthorised possession, user and dealing of the various drugs in the Act including opium is prohibited unless authorised.
 
 
 
The trial judge went on to consider the exempting provisions of the regulations and their application in the present case:
 
The Regulations, therefore, enlarged from time to time, make it very clear which classes of persons are authorised to possess and supply the controlled drugs including the circumstances under which they are authorised to do so. R4(1) requires a licence issued by the Minister amongst other things before the possession of a controlled drug becomes lawful. R5 creates the exceptional category of persons who have authority to possess a controlled drug without a licence. R7 restricts the manufacture and supply of controlled drugs to specified persons such as for example pharmacists, hospital staff in charge of dispensing medicines and such others. Parliament`s intention was therefore strictly to allow only possession and movement of controlled drugs and their dispensation as structurally allowed under the Act and its Regulations.
 
 
 
In my opinion, the accused clearly does not fall within any of the Regulations. R6(2) and (3) also do not apply to the accused as he is not of the professional status declared in the sub-Regulations nor authorised to act by them. R 6(1) is also inapplicable. Although the accused fits within the generic description of `Any person`, however such person must administer the drugs, meaning `medicinal opium`, made or manufactured strictly within the definition of that phrase. Once the medicinal opium is made or manufactured in compliance with the definition of `medicinal opium`, its administration by any person is logically acceptable under the Regulations because the administration of such medicinal opium with a miniscule quantity of morphine is safe.
 
 
 
The trial judge further held that the Act did not take into account the purposes for which the drug was used: 
 
The potential beneficial effect of the drug or drug mixed, diluted or dissolved with non-controlled herbs and having perceived curative or curative properties is an irrelevant consideration in enforcing the Act unless the drug is in lawful possession and its adaptation for medicinal use is made in strict compliance with the Act and its Regulations which is not the case here.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
... The Act, in short, neither recognises the intended beneficial purpose which the appellant said he was going to put the opium to nor acts of trafficking in it such as selling, giving, administering etc unless the same is in accordance with the Act and its regulations. The Act distinguishes only controlled from uncontrolled drugs and where the activity is controlled, authorised from unauthorised acts.
 
 
 
In relation to the meaning of `trafficking`, the term `administer` carried a `wide connotation` and the trial judge construed it to mean `the giving to or applying a drug to a person by injection, through internal consumption, orally as well as by inhalation or by way of 
 external application 
.` So long as this was being done, the purpose of performing these acts, be they beneficient or harmful in nature, was irrelevant.
It is clear that the trial judge took a very literal interpretation of the s 2 definition of `trafficking`. This was in turn influenced by his views on Parliament`s intentions in providing specific exemptions from the offence creating sections in the Act and in the Regulations. Ultimately, he took a strict approach in holding that where possession or one of the acts of trafficking was concerned, the only activity not attracting liability under the Act was what was specifically exempted under the Regulations.
 The appeal
The central issue raised in this appeal therefore is the definition of `trafficking`. As previously mentioned, the trial judge took a literal approach to this question. Before us, the DPP argued that, even if the definition attributed to the term `administer` by the trial judge was wrong, the appellant by his own admission was `selling` or `giving` the opium in the form of medicinal plasters. As also mentioned previously, the crucial issue was whether the appellant`s avowed purpose for the opium took his actions out of the meaning of `trafficking`.
Although there are no authorities directly on point, in the seminal case of 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  ; [1980-1981] SLR 48, the Privy Council declined to interpret the s 2 definition of `trafficking` literally. It was stated by their Lordships that the mere physical conveyance of drugs is not `transporting` under s 2 if it is not accompanied by the ultimate purpose that the drugs be distributed (see also 
Tan Meng Jee v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 422
  ). The underlying rationale of these cases is that, if the law does not give these verbs such an interpretation, there is no distinction between drug dealers and drug addicts engaged in the physical transporting of drugs, the one for distribution and the other for his own consumption. The following passage from the opinion of the Privy Council bears repetition:
 
In their Lordships` view the immediate context of the verb `transport`, to which attention has been drawn, attracts the maxim 
 noscitur a sociis
. This, and the fact that it appears in the definition of the verb to `traffic` of which the natural meaning in the context of trafficking in goods involves dealings between two parties at least, and that the evident purpose of the Act is to distinguish between dealers in drugs and the unfortunate addicts who are their victims, all combine to make it clear that `transport` is not used in the sense of mere conveying or carrying or moving from one place to another but in the sense of doing so to promote the distribution of the drug to another. Supplying or distributing addictive drugs to others is the evil against which s 3 [our present s 5] with its draconian penalties is directed.
 
 
 
Lord Diplock was influenced into arriving at the above conclusion, inter alia, by the `natural meaning` of the verb `traffic` and the `evident purpose` of the Act which was to distinguish between dealers in drugs and their addict victims and whose draconian penalty was directed at those who supply or distribute addictive drugs to others. The Act after all provides for a separate and less serious offence of possession under s 8 thus acknowledging the qualitative difference between the acts of `trafficking` and acts of `possession`.
Perhaps another example to illustrate why the courts should not invariably adopt a literal approach concerns the term `administer`. The plain meaning of this term need not envisage the transfer of the drug to another person. The appellant could administer the drug to himself and on the face of the s 2 definition, this would be considered `trafficking` as well. The obvious absurdity of such a result precludes its occurrence. Yet another example is the case where a person is arrested outside a neighbourhood police post with the controlled drugs and he manages to rebut the presumption in s 17 by establishing that his intent was to surrender the drugs to the authorities. Surely in such a case that person is not in the act of `giving` the drugs in the sense used by the s 2 definition? The point is that the application of the plain meaning of the s 2 definition of `trafficking` can, and in certain circumstances must, be construed in the light of the purpose of the legislation to avoid injustice.
The s 2 definition is drafted broadly to maximise the efficacy of the Act in controlling drug trafficking. Nevertheless, 
 Ong Ah Chuan 
 and the line of cases following it which have recognised the defence of self-consumption show that the courts have in that context refused to take the definition on its face. There are distinctions to be drawn between certain acts, which although they may be described by the same verbs in s 2, nevertheless take place within different factual contexts. These distinctions, if drawn, are not inconsistent with the purpose of the legislation. In fact, they are inherent in the legislation itself, if not expressly stated, and certainly can be identified in the debates preceding the passing of the legislation. The courts have been alive to this. By interpreting the legislation to reflect these distinctions, the courts, rather than defeating the intention of Parliament, are instead ensuring that the legislation operates in a manner conforming with its object. Borrowing the words of Dube J in 
 R v Rosseau 
 70 CCC (3d) 445, `it is not necessary to sacrifice the object pursued by Parliament on the altar of formalism.`
Counsel for the appellant very helpfully provided us with the relevant Parliamentary debates in his bundle. At the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill when it was first introduced, the then Minister for Health and Home Affairs Mr Chua Sian Chin stated (16 February 1973 Col 415 and 416):
 
Though we may not have drug trafficking and drug addiction to the same degree as, for instance, in the United States, we have here some quite big-time traffickers and their peddlers moving around the Republic selling their evil goods and corrupting the lives of all those who succumb to them.
 
 
 
They and their trade must be stopped. To do this effectively, heavy penalties have to be provided for trafficking.
 
 
 
The Minister then went on to introduce the portions of the Bill which enacted the presumption in the present s 17 and the penalties for trafficking Class A drugs - 20 years` imprisonment or $40,000 fine or both and ten strokes of the rotan. As is well known, two years later in 1975, Parliament introduced the death penalty for the trafficking of over 15g of heroin and 30g of morphine. In 1989, the death penalty was extended to the offence of trafficking in cannabis, opium and cocaine, the penalty that the appellant in this case faces.
The Ministerial speeches, Members` speeches and Ministerial replies at each of the debates concerning the introduction of the Act and its amendments are replete with references to the need to control the spread of the addictive use of drugs and the `international traffic which supplies such demands` by using severe penalties to deal with the so-called merchants of death who ply their evil trade.
Parliament, as the trial judge correctly pointed out, had `foreseen the need for a very strict control on the possession and movement of drugs to Singapore and also within it.` However, in our opinion, this does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that what the appellant was guilty of doing was `trafficking`. That he was in possession of a controlled drug and therefore guilty of an offence under s 8 of the Act is, in our opinion, not in doubt. However, whether he was engaged in `trafficking` is an altogether different question. It is clear to us that the appellant does not fall within the class of offenders which Parliament had in mind when it enacted s 5 of the Act. The opium in the appellant`s possession was never meant or even remotely contemplated to be used in a manner associated with drug addiction. On the incontrovertible evidence before us, it can be categorically stated that he was never associated in any way with the `evil trade` in narcotics. Such a result as arrived at by the trial judge is furthermore not dictated by the legislation. As discussed above, the authorities show that the courts have previously refrained from a literal interpretation of the s 2 definition. Although not directly on point, those cases show that there are situations where it would be unduly formalistic to apply the Act literally especially in view of its avowed purpose and the draconian sanction for trafficking. In our opinion, the present case is one such situation.
We do not think that the structure of the Act and the Regulations promulgated pursuant to s 43 thereunder preclude this result. As already stated above, the trial judge took the position that, where an act fell under s 2 (and it must be remembered that he took a very wide interpretation as to what was covered by this), what had not been expressly authorised under the regulations necessarily fell to be punished under the Act. It seems that the trial judge felt compelled to adopt this wide interpretation of s 2 based on his views on the relationship between the Act and the Regulations.
As evident from the arguments above, there are instances where an action, although not covered by the regulations and amounting to an offence under s 8, nevertheless does not constitute the offence of 
 trafficking 
. We share the trial judge`s view that, quite apart from the use of drugs, the movement of drugs itself was intended to be controlled by the Act. However, with respect, we think that adopting the proposition that what was not authorised by the Regulations must amount to trafficking goes too far. The Regulations, in our opinion, do not legislate on the breadth and narrowness of the definition of `trafficking`.
The argument could be made that, if purpose was an element to be taken into account, then it would be unnecessary to have the regulations exempting, inter alia, medical practitioners. After all, surely health care professionals in the course of their duties have no intention that the drugs they prescribe or administer be used for addictive purposes. In our opinion, the Regulations operate to avoid any doubt in specified situations commonly occurring in daily life where the use for controlled drugs are legitimate and the people involved in the provision of such care should not be in doubt as to whether their actions attract the undoubtedly severe penalties of the Act. The existence of the regulations cannot therefore preclude the defence raised by the appellant on this ground.
It is important to realise that an appellant hoping to rely on such a defence faces the heavy burden of bringing his case within the unique factual matrix of the present case. First, it is important to note that the evidence shows that the appellant never revealed the ingredients of his medicinal poultice to the persons he treated with it. In fact, in response to a question by Mark Wong to him, Wong testified that the appellant said it was a secret of the family. Secondly, that the evidence shows that the appellant was a person who practised traditional Chinese medicine is unassailable. Thirdly, on the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the appellant could have at any time reasonably contemplated the use of the opium in his possession for addictive purposes by third parties. Finally, our finding does not detract from the fact that the appellant is still guilty of an offence under s 8 of the Act.
In our judgment, it is clear beyond doubt that the appellant`s conduct should not attract the disapprobation that is reserved for the drug dealers who exploit the vulnerability of addicts and who spread the poison of narcotic addiction in society. The dangers associated with the appellant`s possession of drugs, eg that they could inadvertently fall into the wrong hands, are under the scheme of the Act to be punishable under s 8 and not s 5. In our opinion, it is unarguable that Parliament did not intend that the legislation operate in such a way as held by the trial judge and contended for by the prosecution. These interpretations are unduly formalistic and pay undue deference to the letter of the law, not its object.
Accordingly, we allow the appeal and order that the appellant`s conviction for trafficking be substituted by one for possession.
We turn next to the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the appellant. We invited counsel at the close of the hearing to file written submissions on the appropriate sentence, if we were to convict the appellant for the offence of possession. The DPP has submitted that a deterrent sentence is called for in the present case. He has argued in his written submissions that the appellant had a large quantity of opium in his possession and that he was paid handsomely for his medicinal plasters. He has also argued that this particular type of offence, while easy to commit, is extremely difficult to detect and involves the utilisation of enourmous resources on the part of the CNB. Furthermore, it is argued that the appellant must have known that he was violating the law by having in his possession this opium. Also, the opium was ultimately being put into circulation albeit in the form of medicinal plasters.
We have not been impressed with the argument that the sentence should reflect the difficulty in detecting such offences. That is so only where the sentence will have a general deterrent effect. However, the facts of this case are so unique that we seriously doubt whether there are many persons who are in the position of the appellant and who would therefore be influenced in their actions by this judgment. We do not think that there is any purpose to be served in making the appellant an example. An example to whom? Furthermore, our courts have never shied from making it clear that those in the drug trade will ordinarily not attract any sympathy for their actions. We do not think that this case detracts from that position in any way.
However, there is no doubt that the appellant was found with a large quantity of drugs. The court has to take this into account, especially since the danger, if the drugs should fall into the wrong hands, is that much more excacerbated. In our opinion, any sentence should be severe enough to have the effect of deterring the appellant from such conduct in the future.
On the other hand, counsel for the appellant has reiterated in his written submissions that the appellant`s purpose was always the bona fide treatment of specific medical conditions. Counsel has pointed out that it was unlikely that the opium in the medicinal plasters could be used for addictive purposes, something the DPP disputes. In our judgment, the purpose for which the opium was used goes to mitigate the gravity of the appellant`s conduct. The danger that the opium once in its plaster form could be used for addictive purposes without the appellant`s knowledge is furthermore attenuated by the fact that the appellant never told his patients what the contents of the plasters were and warned that they were for external application only.
Counsel for the appellant has also pointed out that after an initial bout of panic on being apprehended in the taxi, the appellant was most cooperative with the authorities. We think that this is borne out by the facts. All the evidence regarding the investigations, especially the recording of statements, show the appellant to have been forthright about what he had been doing. Ultimately, the real contentious aspect of this case was not one of fact but one of law. We therefore took this in favour of the appellant. We also took in his favour his clean record and his good character.
In view of all the circumstances, and we must stress again the unique nature of these circumstances, we sentence the appellant to two years` imprisonment with effect from 3 October 1996 and a fine of $10,000 or in default another three months` imprisonment on each charge, the terms to be served concurrently.",1997-08-18 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The first and second appellants were originally tried with one Nor Azman bin Mustaffa (`Nor Azman`) in the High Court for having in their possession 392.66g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Misuse of Drugs Act`). On 4 September 1998, Nor Azman`s charge was amended and he was charged with abetting the two appellants by conspiring with them to traffic in not less than 14.99g of diamorphine. He pleaded guilty to the amended charge and two other drug-related charges, and was sentenced to a total of 28 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The first and second appellants claimed trial to the following charge: 
 
That you,
 
 
 
 
1 Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin,
 
2 Mohd Noor bin Bayasin
 
 
 
between 7 to 9 March 1998, at Block 150 Bedok Reservoir Road [num ]01-1727, Singapore, in furtherance of a common intention, you had in your possession, for the purpose of trafficking 1 pail, 1 basin and 36 packets of substance containing not less than 392.66 grams of diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and s 34 of the Penal Code and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
On 16 October 1998, the learned judicial commissioner convicted both appellants as charged and passed the mandatory sentence of death. The appellants appealed against their conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
 
 
The crux of the prosecution`s case was that the second appellant, in furtherance of his common intention with the first appellant, acted to put the first appellant in possession of the drugs from 7 to 9 March 1998. The drugs were first kept in a flat at 89B TG Mansion, Lorong H, Telok Kurau. The appellants wanted the drugs to be transported to a shop, unit [num ]01-1727 Blk 150 Bedok Reservoir Road, which was rented by both the appellants. On 7 March 1998, both appellants kept in contact with each other via telephone as to the mode of transport. Pursuant to their agreement, the second appellant transported the drugs from 89B TG Mansion, Lorong H, Telok Kurau, to unit [num ]01-1727 Blk 150 Bedok Reservoir Road. The first appellant was waiting there when the drugs arrived. Both appellants repacked the drugs into plastic bags using a weighing scale and electric heat sealer. The drugs were kept in the unit from 7 March until 9 March 1998 when they were seized by CNB officers.
The prosecution relied on the Statement of Agreed Facts pursuant to s 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`), two statements made by the first appellant which were challenged, statements admitted under s 371 of the CPC and oral testimony.
The statement of agreed facts said that, on 9 March 1998, a party of four CNB officers arrested the first appellant at the carpark of Blk 125 Bedok Reservoir Road. They were Senior Staff Sergeant Ronnie See (`SS/Sgt See`), Sergeant Chen Koi Shen (`Sgt Chen`), Sergeant Mohd Najid bin Hj Sairi (`Sgt Najid`) and Corporal Chong Wee Loong (`Cpl Chong`). The first appellant was seated in his car, a Honda Accord bearing licence plate no EV2024T. He initially tried to escape when he saw the officers but was caught after a short chase. A body search was conducted on him and the CNB officers found a pager, a handphone, two bunches of keys, a key by itself, a wallet containing S$254 and RM34, cash of S$82 and some coins.
At about 7pm, Insp S Krishnan (`Insp Krishnan`) arrived with two other CNB officers. The whole group together with the first appellant then left the carpark at Blk 125 Bedok Reservoir Road and proceeded to Blk 150 Bedok Reservoir Road. The CNB officers led the first appellant to unit [num ]01-1727 Blk 150, Bedok Reservoir Road, which housed a hair dressing saloon known as `Hairview & Face Creation`. That unit was actually sub-divided into two units both bearing the same unit number, and one of the units had been rented to the first appellant (`the shop`) since March 1997, with the saloon continuing to operate in the other unit. The first appellant had informed the owners of the premises that he was in the wedding decoration business and introduced the second appellant to them as his business partner. The first appellant paid the rental for the shop ($1,400 per month) from March 1997 to February 1998, and was given the key to the door of the shop. When the CNB officers led the first appellant to the front entrance of the saloon, they tried to use one of the keys seized from him to open the door but were unsuccessful. One of the officers then tried the key on the door of the adjoining unit (the shop) and managed to open it.
There were many decorations and props in the shop. There was also a colourful sports bag with the word `Offendal` on the floor. Inside were 11 packets of powdery substance. The CNB officers searched the shop and found a big cardboard carton near the sink. In this carton was a smaller cardboard carton sealed with masking tape and some plastic flowers. In the smaller cardboard carton, the officers found 25 packets of granular substance. These 36 packets formed the subject matter of the charge.
In addition, the CNB officers found a black trash bag near the sports bag. In the trash bag was a transparent plastic pail with two basins. The pail and one of the basins contained a yellow granular substance. These were also the subject matter of the charge.
Meanwhile, at about 6.45pm on the same day, another team of CNB officers was waiting to ambush the second appellant at the carpark of Blk 128 Bedok Reservoir Road. They arrested the second appellant as he was coming out of a blue panel van, licence plate no YG5693J. The van was registered in the name of the first appellant. A search was conducted at the residence of the second appellant, unit [num ]11-1087 Blk 125 Bedok Reservoir Road, at about 8.30pm.
At about 9pm, the CNB officers brought the second appellant to the shop. The first appellant had already been arrested. Officers from the Scene of Crime Unit were taking photographs of the exhibits. SS/Sgt See then left with his team and the first appellant whilst another team left with the second appellant. Both teams arrived at 19 Dafne street. The Investigating Officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Wong Wah Yan (`SS/Sgt Wong`), was already present. SS/Sgt See used a key which had been seized from the first appellant earlier to unlock the padlock on the gate of 19 Dafne Street. A search was conducted. The Investigating Officer and another officer together with the second appellant then left for the Major Investigations Branch (`MIB`) Building at Outram Road. At about 11.30pm, SS/Sgt See and his team brought the first appellant to his residence, unit [num ]06-202 Blk 155 Simei Road, and conducted a search.
On the same day, at about 8.30pm, a third team of CNB officers raided 89B TG Mansion, Lorong H, Telok Kurau. 89B TG Mansion had been rented by the first appellant for $1,900 per month from 16 February 1998. The landlord did not enter the flat during the period of the tenancy, from February to March 1998. The officers found a weighing scale, improvised pipes, one roll of aluminium foil, one stack of white envelopes and some empty plastic sachets on the computer table. On the floor were a red pail containing long glass tubes, improvised glass pipes, two spoons believed to be stained with drugs, one glass cutter, one rubber tube and two plastic lighters. There was also a grey pail containing a bowl, a plastic container and three spoons. All the items were seized and taken to the MIB Building.
At the MIB Building, the first appellant and the exhibits seized from him were handed over to the Investigating Officer. The two appellants were sent for their pre-statement medical examination. SS/Sgt See and two officers left the MIB Building together with the first appellant. After the medical examination, the first appellant was brought to the Investigating Officer and handed over to him at about 4.10am. At about 4.45am the Investigating Officer handed the first appellant back to SS/Sgt See and his officers to be brought to Alexandra Hospital for his post-statement medical examination. After that medical examination, they brought the first appellant to the CID lock-up.
It was agreed that the 36 packets, the pail and the basin found in the shop contained not less than 392.66g of diamorphine, the subject matter of the charge against the appellants. In addition a brown envelope containing a packet of drugs found in the carton (exh C23a) and the carton (exh C) were sent for fingerprint examination. The fingerprint found on the underside of the envelope matched the fingerprint specimen of the second appellant. The other fingerprint found on the carton was a poor mark and could not be identified.
The second appellant had allowed one Rashidah bte Ishak, a freelance Muslim wedding service co-ordinator, to store her decoration materials at the shop for $200 per month. She was not given a key to the shop. On 8 March 1998, at about 9am, she met the second appellant at the shop when she went there to collect some of her materials. She had telephoned him the day before to make the appointment. Her things were stored between the front entrance and a wooden cabinet which stood in the middle of the shop. Hence she did not have to go beyond the wooden cabinet when she was in the shop. Whilst she was in the shop, the second appellant was positioned near the cabinet. She was in the shop for only a short while and left after retrieving her things. The second appellant remained in the shop.
The statement of Kamariah bte Osman (`Kamariah`), the wife of the second appellant, was admitted by consent of all the parties. In her statement, she said that her husband and the first appellant had been partners in Seri DÃ©cor & Services since November 1996, a business providing decorations for Muslim weddings. They used the shop to store the decorations. Mdm Kamisah, the first appellant`s wife, kept the business accounts, though the bank account was in her (Kamariah`s) and the second appellant`s names. Mdm Kamisah kept the bank account book and whenever money had to be withdrawn, she would hand it over to the second appellant and Kamariah. As far as Kamariah was aware, Nor Azman was not a partner in the business.
On 9 March 1998, Kamariah was on medical leave. That morning, while she was at home, the second appellant told her that Nor Azman wanted to meet him at the shop. They had intended to go to Tampines to buy children`s clothes, but the second appellant asked her to accompany him to the shop first. She agreed. They proceeded to the shop in the second appellant`s van. When they arrived at the shop, Nor Azman was already waiting outside the entrance. The second appellant unlocked the door to the shop and both of them went inside. Kamariah did not join them but went to a nearby provision shop. About 10 minutes later, both men came out of the shop. Nor Azman left and both she and the second appellant headed towards Tampines.
The second appellant made two statements on 19 March 1998 and 20 March 1998 (P76A and P77A respectively) when he was in custody at the MIB Building. It was agreed that the two statements were voluntary. The combined effect of the two statements was as follows: 
(a) The first and second appellants were partners in a Malay bridal dais decoration business. The first appellant dealt with the owner of the shop at Blk 150 regarding the tenancy of the shop although both of them did go to look at it. The shop was rented to them at $1,400 a month. The only entrance to the shop was by the front as the back entrance was sealed. The key to that entrance was held only by the two appellants and one An`nuar Bai.
(b) The second appellant became acquainted with Nor Azman through the first appellant in January 1998 at the shop. Nor Azman wanted to join them in their decoration business and the second appellant did not object. However he did not see Nor Azman helping out in the business nor had he received any monetary contribution from him towards the business.
(c) Shortly thereafter, the second appellant found out that the first appellant and Nor Azman had rented a house at 19 Dafne Street. He believed that it was rented in the name of the first appellant, who told him that they had rented 19 Dafne Street in order to store their decorations when he moved out of the shop at Blk 150.
(d) On 6 March 1998, the first appellant called him and said he wanted to move all the drugs from 89B TG Mansion to the shop. He initially objected but the first appellant insisted that it was an emergency and said that it was only temporary.
(e) When the second appellant arrived at 89B TG Mansion, Nor Azman was in the apartment. The second appellant saw three sports bags, the carton and the black plastic bag of containers. The first appellant called him on the telephone and asked him whether it was safe and suggested calling their mutual friend Salim to fetch him to the shop. The first appellant said that he would call Salim. Nor Azman then left TG Mansion.
(f) About an hour later, Salim arrived at 89B TG Mansion. He assisted the second appellant in bringing down the three sports bags, the carton and the plastic bag of containers. They loaded all the things in a blue twin-cab lorry and Salim drove him to the shop. At the shop, the second appellant took a trolley and used it to ferry the things into the shop. The first appellant helped him to carry the carton of heroin and placed it into another bigger carton near the sealed exit at the rear of the shop. The three bags were placed near a table in the middle of the shop. The plastic bag containing the two containers was placed near the sports bag. In the shop, the first appellant suggested that they place 50 `batu` or packets into a carton. Both of them then emptied two sports bags and some from the third bag to make up 50 batu. All 50 were placed into a carton.
(g) On the evening of 7 March 1998, the second appellant returned to the shop. At the carpark behind the shop, he saw the first appellant, his wife and their daughter at their car. The second appellant went into the shop and collected some of the decorations. He saw the black trash bag and a sports bag. He did not check the whereabouts of the two empty sports bags or the carton containing the 25 packets as it did not occur to him to do so.
(h) On 8 March 1998, the second appellant went to the shop again to bring certain decorations for storage. He did not see anyone in the shop. He did not pay attention to the sports bag or the trash bag as he was pre-occupied with storing the decorations.
(i) On 9 March 1998, Nor Azman telephoned the second appellant and said that he needed to go to the shop. They arranged to meet at the entrance to the shop where the second appellant would give him the key to the shop. The second appellant arrived at the shop at about 11am. He unlocked the door but did not enter the shop. Nor Azman arrived about five minutes later and the second appellant gave the key to him. They both went inside the shop and the second appellant asked Nor Azman for $500 which the latter gave without any hesitation. The second appellant did not inspect anything in the premises.
 Decision on the first voir dire 
 
The first statement (P73) concerned answers given by the first appellant to Insp Krishnan`s questions on the day of his arrest in the shop. Insp Krishnan testified that he recorded this statement between 7.20pm and 7.50pm. The first appellant alleged that the statement was not given voluntarily on three grounds. First, that Sgt Najid had punched him once after detaining him; second, that at the car park of Blk 122, SS/Sgt See interrogated him to the point of oppression; and third, that he was told to sign the statement although Sgt Najid did not read back the statement to him or invite him to make any amendments or deletions to the statement before signing.
The first appellant alleged that after he was arrested at the carpark of Blk 125, the CNB officers brought him to Blk 122 which was a quieter place. SS/Sgt See told the first appellant that he should not hide anything as they had already arrested all the others. Among other questions, he asked the first appellant where the second appellant was. The questioning took more than an hour in the presence of three CNB officers. The first appellant was afraid and his mind was muddled. He was afraid as he had been assaulted earlier and feared further assaults. He was also under the influence of the drug known as `Ice`.
The first appellant was then brought to the shop. Insp Krishnan asked him in Malay whether there was anything inside. The first appellant said `yes`. It did not occur to him that the Malay word `barang` for things was meant to refer to drugs. He thought that Insp Krishnan was referring to all the decorations inside the ship. When he said that the things were his, he meant the decorations and not the drugs.
When the officers found the drugs in the shop, the first appellant felt a mixture of confusion and fear. He started crying because he had been forced to say things. He told Insp Krishnan, `please don`t hit me` although he had not been assaulted outside the shop. When Sgt Najid told him to sign in the pocket book, he simply did as he was told without understanding what was being said or what he was signing. In relation to his first signature, he could not recall whether he had been invited to make corrections before he signed; and Sgt Najid did not so invite him for his second signature. He merely obeyed instructions and when told to sign and write his name and identity card number, he did so.
At the pre-statement medical examination, the first appellant told the doctor about the pain his chest. He did not dare to tell the truth - that he had been assaulted by Sgt Najid - as three CNB officers were standing behind him in the consultation room. He therefore told the doctor that he had felt the pain since about a week ago. Similarly, he did not dare to tell the truth to the doctor conducting the post-statement medical examination as the three CNB officers were standing behind him. He feared further assaults in the lock-up if he told the truth.
In cross-examination, the first appellant said that Sgt Najid did not push him when he caught up with him after chasing him. Instead, Sgt Najid body-locked him by gripping him with both arms around his body, then handcuffed him and punched him from the front. The first appellant then saw Cpl Chong running towards them from behind. Asked how many times Sgt Najid had punched him, the first appellant said that he could not remember but believed it was once and that Sgt Najid was very angry and thus used quite a bit of force when he delivered the punch. The first appellant crouched in pain at the blow but by the time Cpl Chong caught up with them was already standing upright. At the carpark of Blk 122, SS/Sgt See questioned him through Sgt Najid as to why he had run when he saw the officers. He did not reply. Numerous other questions were asked but he did not reply to most of them. Sgt Najid did not react or assault him when he kept quiet. However, SS/Sgt See gesticulated with his hands and demanded an answer. He looked angry. His tone and expression appeared threatening to the first appellant who felt afraid and bewildered as there were so many questions. SS/Sgt See used some threatening words but the first appellant could not remember what they were.
At the shop, when asked which key fitted the padlock at the rear entrance to the saloon, the first appellant replied that he did not have the key for the padlock. At the front entrance of the saloon, he was again asked which key would open the door to the saloon and again he replied that he did not have the key. Inside the shop, when Insp Krishnan questioned the first appellant, his voice was loud and threatening. After the drugs were found, he cried because he was afraid that he would be beaten up again. He asked Insp Krishnan not to hit him. Insp Krishnan then told his officers not to hit the first appellant but still looked threatening and even fiercer than before. He reiterated his position that he thought the word `barang` or `things` in Insp Krishnan`s first question was a reference to the decorative items and not the drugs.
The learned judicial commissioner disbelieved the first appellant`s allegation that Sgt Najid had punched him. If he was punched on the front of his body and he had chest pain because of that punch, the punch must have landed on his chest and that fact could not have escaped him. It was thus baffling that he could not even remember which part of his body received the punch. If the first appellant felt any pain in his chest, that was in all probability caused by Sgt Najid body-locking him after the chase. There would obviously have been some sort of struggle as the handcuffs were put on hurriedly; that explained why Cpl Chong had to tighten the handcuffs when he caught up with them. The learned judicial commissioner thus accepted the evidence of Sgt Najid and Cpl Chong that no assault of any sort had taken place when they apprehended the first appellant. In any case, Dr Ng Chee Keong and Dr Ganesan Naidu, the doctors who examined him less than 12 hours after the alleged assault, found no visible signs of assault.
Much was made of the fact that none of the members of the arresting team mentioned the move from Blk 125 to Blk 122. It was true that the officers had omitted to mention the move but the learned judicial commissioner saw nothing sinister in the shift of location. An operation was still in progress in that area and it was perfectly logical to instruct the team to move away from Blk 125, the second appellant`s place of residence, so that other suspects would not be alerted to the presence of the CNB. In any event, if all that the officers did was to look angry and fierce and use threatening words, they could have done so quite inconspicuously in their car at Blk 125. Further, if SS/Sgt See intended to force answers out of the first appellant, it was inexplicably inconsistent of him to allow the first appellant to remain silent to so many of the questions. It was also illogical for SS/Sgt See to warn the first appellant that he should not hide anything because they had already arrested all the others and yet ask him where his friends were. The first appellant could not even recall what threatening words were used by SS/Sgt See. Even if the latter did look fierce or frightening, however, that would not per se amount to a threat within the meaning of s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`the Evidence Act`). Anyway, the first appellant clearly could not have been intimidated as he consciously refused to respond to many questions.
The first appellant also alleged that, when he was outside the shop, he felt intimidated as there were many CNB officers. The learned judicial commissioner failed to see how being in the presence of the officers who were not doing him any harm or abusing him in any way could amount to a threat or inducement rendering any subsequent confession involuntary. Again, in any event, it was clear that the first appellant was not intimidated as he could still say technically correct things such as not possessing the keys to the padlock or door of the saloon when he knew that the officers meant the keys to the shop. The learned judicial commissioner also found that the first appellant was not confused about Insp Krishnan`s question as to whether there were things in the shop. His story that he was under the impression that Insp Krishnan was inquiring about wedding decoration items was patently untrue in the context. The first appellant, who had bolted on seeing four men staring at him, assuming rightly that they were CNB officers, could not, after searches on his body and car had been conducted, possibly believe that the officers were now interested in wedding decorations. The rest of the first appellant`s testimony was also inconsistent. For instance, he claimed that he cried because he had been forced to say something. Yet his evidence was that he was not asked any more questions and therefore did answer any. He testified that when he was asked questions and did not answer them, there was no response from Insp Krishnan. This was not the expected conduct of a man out to frighten a suspect into confessing. The learned judicial commissioner found that his answers were evasive and inconsistent only because he tried to string together a story.
As for the allegation that he was only told to sign the statement and that Sgt Najid did not read back the statement to him or invite him to make any amendments or deletions before signing, Insp Krishnan testified that he asked the first appellant some questions in Malay and recorded them in his pocket diary. He then requested Sgt Najid to read to the first appellant what had been recorded. Sgt Najid told the first appellant that he was going to read in Malay the matters recorded and that he was permitted to make additions or deletions. He also told the first appellant that if he agreed with what was recorded, he could sign under the recorded matters. Throughout the reading back, Sgt Najid clarified the words used with Insp Krishnan. He agreed that what he had told the first appellant was not recorded in the pocket diary. Sgt Najid also acted as an interpreter for Insp Krishnan while the latter was reading the answers given by the first appellant. Sgt Najid testified that the first appellant was able to understand what was being said to him as he (the first appellant) had told him so. He said to Sgt Najid, `I understand, Sir` in Malay. During the recording of the statement in the shop, he did not appear confused or emotional but he did cry.
The learned judicial commissioner had no doubt that Insp Krishnan and Sgt Najid had spoken the truth about the events in the shop and that the statement had been properly recorded from the first appellant, and admitted the questions and answers as P73 accordingly.
Insp Krishnan testified to the following exchange between himself and the first appellant during the recording of the first statement: 
Q1: Ada barang? (Any things?)
 
A1: Ada. Di dalam bag. (Yes. Inside the bag.)
Insp Krishnan testified that the first appellant then used his chin to point at a purple bag with the word `Offendal` printed on it. Insp Krishnan then asked: 
Q2: Siapa punya? (Whose is it?)
 
A2: Saya punya. (It is mine.)
 
Q3: Barang apa di dalam bag? (What things are inside the bag?)
 
A3: Drug, heroin.
 
Q4: Berapa banyak? (How many?)
 
A4: Ada 20 kilo, semua besar besar punya. (There are 20 kilos, all big ones.)
Insp Krishnan testified that whilst speaking to the first appellant, he recorded the questions and answers in his pocket diary. At about 7.25pm, he asked Sgt Najid to read the questions and answers which he had recorded to the first appellant in Malay. Sgt Najid did so accordingly, and also told the first appellant that if he did not agree with what was on the record, he could make changes. If he agreed, he could sign under what was recorded. The first appellant signed in the pocket diary under what was recorded.
After that, Insp Krishnan testified that the first appellant began crying. He then asked him how he had packed the drugs in the packets and he said it was with the sealer and weighing scale.
Subsequently, Cpl Chong and another officer found a large cardboard carton with a smaller carton inside. Insp Krishnan opened the smaller carton and saw several packets containing a granular substance. He asked the first appellant the following questions, again in Malay: 
Q1: Apa itu? (What is it?)
 
A1: Sama. Heroin. (The same. Heroin.)
 
Q2: Siapa punya? (Whose is it?)
 
A2: Saya punya. (It is mine.)
 
Q3: Berapa di dalam peti? (How many inside the box?)
 
A3: Saya ingat 20 packets. (I think there are 20 packets.)
The above questions and answers were recorded by Insp Krishnan. Subsequently, Insp Krishnan saw Sgt Najid removing a black sheet covering three containers. There were some folded newspapers covering the top container. On removing the folded newspapers, there was an empty red plastic basin inside a larger light blue enamel basin which was in turn inside a larger transparent plastic pail. Both the basins contained a yellowish granular substance. Insp Krishnan asked the first appellant the following questions, again in Malay: 
Q4: Ini siapa punya? (Whose is this?)
 
A4: They are all mine.
 The second voir dire 
 
This concerned the first appellant`s second statement recorded by SS/Sgt Wong with the assistance of an interpreter at the MIB Building on 11 March 1998 at about 5.30pm (P75A). The appellant alleged that this statement was involuntary for the following reasons. First, that SS/Sgt Wong told him that if he told the true story, there would be hope; second, that ASP Adam Fashehuddin (`ASP Adam`) and DSP S Vijakumar (`DSP Vijakumar`) gave him the impression that if he co-operated, there was a hope for him; third, that the interpreter interpreted the whole cautioned statement to the first appellant and this induced fear in him; and fourth, that during the recording, SS/Sgt Wong told him that if he did not continue to give a statement, he would not be allowed to see his wife and children.
The second appellant testified that after he had given his urine specimen at CNB headquarters on 10 March 1998, he was brought to the MIB Building and handed over to SS/Sgt Wong in his room. He asked SS/Sgt Wong whether he had any chance in his case. SS/Sgt Wong told him to tell the true story and that he had hope. He was then escorted to ASP Adam`s room by Sgt Najid. He did not ask to see ASP Adam as he did not know him at all. The first appellant was then handcuffed to a chair in the room. DSP Vijakumar entered the room and was introduced to him by ASP Adam as the `orang besar`, ie the top man of MIB. DSP Vijakumar then asked him where Nor Azman was and many other questions. ASP Adam told him to tell the truth to the Investigating Officer. He did ask ASP Adam about his case but could not remember what the answer was. A CPC s 122(6) statement was then taken from him after the interpreter explained the charge and the notice of warning to him.
On 11 March 1998, he was brought to SS/Sgt Wong for the recording of the impugned statement. The interpreter read the charge and the notice of warning to him again. She then explained the previous statement. When the first appellant heard this, he felt fearful as he knew that he would be hanged. The interpreter explained that the punishment was death by hanging. The first appellant said that, after listening to all this, he felt that he had to disclose the truth. At one stage of the recording he felt fed-up when the Investigating Officer repeated the same questions and told the latter so. SS/Sgt Wong told him that he had to continue or he would not be able to see his wife or children during visiting hours. He then cried and continued to give the statement as he wanted to see his family.
In cross-examination, the first appellant said that when he was brought to SS/Sgt Wong`s room on 10 March 1998 for the handing over, he asked him in English how his case was, to find out whether there was hope for himself. He did this because he had seen the substantial amount of drugs seized from the shop. SS/Sgt Wong told him to co-operate and then there might be hope. He did not say how the first appellant was to co-operate or what `hope` there was. While he was in ASP Adam`s room, the door was left ajar at all times, even after DSP Vijakumar arrived. DSP Vijakumar spoke softly. When the first appellant said that he did not know where Nor Azman was, DSP Vijakumar told him not to hide things. ASP Adam then told him to tell the truth to the Investigating Officer and also said something to the effect that there would be hope for him. The first appellant therefore felt a glimmer of hope.
On 11 March 1998, during the recording of P75A, the first appellant felt fed- up because he had been asked the same questions before. He was also tired.
The learned judicial commissioner disbelieved the first appellant. He found numerous inconsistencies in his testimony. To begin with, the first appellant`s evidence on his first meeting with SS/Sgt Wong at the MIB Building was contradicted by SS/Sgt Wong and Sgt Najid. The CNB officers were quite certain that SS/Sgt Wong was never alone with the first appellant when he was first brought to the MIB Building. Moreover, the first appellant testified that he gave the statement after being induced to do so by SS/Sgt Wong, and yet said that halfway through the statement, he felt fed-up and had to be threatened about curtailment of family visits in order to make the statement. The learned judicial commissioner had no doubt that the two CNB officers were telling the truth and that SS/Sgt Wong had offered no inducement to the first appellant.
As for the meeting in ASP Adam`s room, Sgt Najid`s evidence was that as they (ie, the first appellant and he) walked past ASP Adam`s office, the door was ajar. The first appellant asked who the occupant of the room was. Sgt Najid replied that it was his boss. The first appellant then said that he wanted to speak to ASP Adam. Sgt Najid went inside and told ASP Adam, who was seated, about the first appellant`s request. ASP Adam agreed. The first appellant then entered the room and ASP Adam closed the door. Sgt Najid waited outside, leaving the first appellant inside with ASP Adam. The first appellant remained handcuffed; Sgt Najid therefore thought that it was safe and saw no reason to go inside as well. He did not know what the first appellant wanted to say to ASP Adam. Later, ASP Adam opened the door and told Sgt Najid to carry on. Sgt Najid disagreed that he had been instructed to bring the first appellant to ASP Adam`s room or that DSP Vijakumar had also been in the room with ASP Adam and the first appellant.
ASP Adam testified that he saw the first appellant when he was escorted past his office. Sgt Najid then informed him that the first appellant wanted to see him. He did not know the first appellant and the first appellant did not ask for him by name. He agreed with the suggestion that it would have been better if Sgt Najid had sought his permission first but he normally entertained such requests. He disagreed that it was he who had asked to see the first appellant in his room. Inside, both he and the first appellant spoke while standing up. The first appellant asked whether ASP Adam could help him and the latter replied `no`, because `things have already happened`. The first appellant then cried. ASP Adam denied that he had asked the first appellant to sit down and that he was then handcuffed to the chair, and that Sgt Najid was standing behind the first appellant. He also denied that an Indian man (DSP Vijakumar) then entered the room and that he (the Indian man) was introduced as `Baskaran` or `sini MIB orang besar` or `this is the big man of MIB`. The Indian man did not ask the first appellant about Nor Azman, and then leave the room. It was not true that he had told the first appellant to tell the truth and to co-operate with the Investigating Officer; and that `hope` was held out to the first appellant by either himself or `Baskaran`.
`Baskaran` turned out to be DSP Vijakumar. He also denied being in ASP Adam`s room with the first appellant or that he had been introduced as the `orang besar` of MIB. He did not speak with either of the appellants; and the first time he heard about the meeting between ASP Adam and the first appellant was in court. He did not ask the first appellant questions about Nor Azman or anything else.
The learned judicial commissioner was convinced that the accounts given by ASP Adam and Sgt Najid concerning the meeting in ASP Adam`s room represented the truth and that DSP Vijakumar was not involved in any way. He failed to see why the alleged charade should have been enacted. The officers in question had every reason to be in the MIB Building at the material time as they were leading the operation. Further the first appellant was conspicuously silent about ASP Adam`s evidence that he (the first appellant) had broken down and cried in the latter`s room. He could remember asking ASP Adam about his case but incredibly, could not recall the reply. Moreover, if all that ASP Adam and DSP Vijakumar did was to speak softly and coax him to tell the truth to the Investigating Officer, there was no occasion for tears. Again, if the glimmer of hope that the first appellant saw after speaking to the two officers inspired him to make the statement in question, why did he become fed-up halfway or so?
With regard to the actual recording of the statement, SS/Sgt Wong denied that the first appellant had told him that he did not want to carry on but was told that if he did not co-operate, he would not be allowed any visits by his family. It was put to SS/Sgt Wong that the earlier s 122(6) statement was read to the first appellant so that he could be reminded of the notice of warning and would continue to co-operate, and that the purpose was to make the first appellant reveal everything. SS/Sgt Wong reiterated that his purpose in reading the previous statement to the first appellant was only to be fair to him as he was referring to it, though he agreed that it was possible that the first appellant might be reminded of the notice of warning by reference to the previous statement. The interpreter, one Sofia Sufri, testified that she assisted SS/Sgt Wong in the recording of the statement from the first appellant on 11 March 1998. She was also the interpreter when SS/Sgt Wong took the s 122(6) statement from the first appellant the day before. She had interpreted the charge and the notice of warning to the first appellant and also explained that the penalty was death by hanging. On 11 March, however, she only read the earlier statement and not the charge or notice of warning. She also did not remind him of the penalty upon conviction. She denied the suggestion that the first appellant wanted to stop during the recording but was told by SS/Sgt Wong that if he did not co-operate, he would not be allowed to see his family.
The learned judicial commissioner had no doubt that SS/Sgt Wong and the interpreter were telling the truth. The purpose of reading the first statement to the appellant was only to put him back in the picture as questions were going to be asked about things mentioned in the first statement. Far from attempting to induce any fear or create any false sense of obligation on the part of the first appellant, the Investigating Officer was being very decent in refreshing the first appellant`s mind about his earlier statement. Even if the first appellant was induced to make the statement because of the death penalty, the fear appeared to have dissipated because he claimed that he felt sufficiently fed-up about the same questions being asked over and over again to inform the investigating officer that he did not wish to continue. He must have known about the death penalty as that was told to him when the charge was read and explained to him. It was normal to feel fearful with that sentence hanging over one`s head but such fear caused by the legitimate explanation of the charge could not render a subsequent statement involuntary.
It was argued that an investigating officer can never be the recording officer of a statement from an accused person, relying on 
Lee Look v PP
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 240
 . In that case, the court considered that the use of an investigating officer, who was actively involved in the investigation of the case and who was subsequently called by the prosecution as a witness, as a recording officer in taking the cautioned statement from an accused person, resulted in the likelihood of bias on his part; and that as a matter of law the cautioned statement was inadmissible in evidence as it might result in a miscarriage of justice. The learned judicial commissioner was unable to accept this principle. First, an investigating officer was not a finder of fact; he merely adduced the evidence and presented it for scrutiny before a court of law. Second, a recording officer in order to be effective in recording a statement, cautioned or otherwise, had to be well-acquainted with the case. He would have to familiarise himself with it either by reading the investigation papers or by being briefed on it by the investigating officer, and would be open to the same objection of likelihood of bias. It was totally unworkable to expect someone who had no knowledge of the case to record a statement, as he would not know what was relevant or even where to begin. The learned judicial commissioner thus rejected the principle as being unduly restrictive and impractical.
He therefore found the first appellant`s second statement P75A to be a voluntary statement free from any inducement, threat or promise, and admitted it in evidence accordingly. In the second statement, the first appellant explained how the drugs ended up at the shop. He said that it was Nor Azman who had arranged for the drugs to be brought to the shop. While he was at the shop on 7 March 1998, Nor Azman had called him on his handphone and informed him that the second appellant would be moving 40 `batu` or packets of heroin from TG Mansion to the shop. The first appellant then called the second appellant himself whereupon the latter told him that Nor Azman had spoken to him (the second appellant) about moving the drugs. The first appellant then called his friend Salim to assist by picking something up from TG Mansion. Salim agreed. The first appellant telephoned Nor Azman and informed him that Salim would be bringing the second appellant and the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop. He then telephoned the second appellant and told him that Salim was on his way. At about 2pm that day, the second appellant came into the shop with three sports bags. The first appellant said that he knew that the heroin was transported in plastic packets which were kept in a sports bag, but that he did not know that there was a carton of heroin or that there were two plastic containers of heroin. The second appellant then took out the packets of heroin and placed them on the floor. Both of them then counted the packets and there were 40. They also took out a sealer, some envelopes and a bundle of empty plastic sachets from the sports bag. After that, the packets of heroin, the sealer and envelopes were replaced into the bag.
At the end of the prosecution`s case, the learned judicial commissioner found that the test in 
Haw Tua Tau & Ors v PP
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  was satisfied. He therefore called upon both the appellants to enter upon their defence to the charge against them. The appellants elected to remain silent and chose not to call any witnesses on their behalf.
 The decision below 
 
The learned judicial commissioner found that the prosecution had proved its case against the two appellants beyond reasonable doubt. He therefore convicted them and sentenced them to death accordingly.
 The appeal 
 
 The first appellant
The grounds of appeal raised by the first appellant were: first, that the learned judicial commissioner erred in holding that the two statements (P73 and P75A) were made voluntarily and were thus admissible; second, that there were discrepancies and inconsistencies between the statements of the first and the second appellants; and third, that the prosecution had failed to prove possession of the carton and the two plastic containers of heroin. The admissibility of the first appellant`s statements was challenged by relying on the same matters that had been raised before the learned judicial commissioner. To recapitulate, in relation to the first statement (P73), these were that the first appellant was under the influence of `Ice`; that he was assaulted at the time of his arrest; that the CNB officers had omitted to mention the move from Blk 125 to the more secluded Blk 122; that there were significant discrepancies in the oral testimony of Sgt Najid and between that of Sgt Najid and Insp Krishnan so as to render their assertions that P73 was made voluntarily highly suspect; and that, taking into account the cumulative effect of the assault, the pressure from the interrogation at the carpark of Blk 122 coupled with the influence of `Ice` and the close proximity of the CNB officers, the first appellant felt confused and threatened and was in fear, in particular of further assaults. In relation to the second statement (P75A), not only the was the first appellant`s cautioned statement read back to him, but also the charge and the notice of warning; these operated on his mind with the result that he was induced to make the statement which he would otherwise not have done. The cumulative effect of that inducement, the meeting with DSP Vijakumar in ASP Adam`s room and the hope held out by SS/Sgt Wong was to render that statement involuntary and inadmissible.
 (1) Admissibility of the first appellant`s statements
The admissibility of the two statements is governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act which reads: 
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him.
Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact: 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 , following 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
. It is also well established that the common law concept of involuntariness by oppression in 
R v Prager
 
[1972] 56 Cr App R 51
 has been subsumed under s 24 of the Evidence Act. The test for determining admissibility under s 24 is first, whether the confession was made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise, and second, whether in making that confession, the accused did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are questions of fact and are matters of judicial evaluation: see 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
  and 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 , following 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
. The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: 
Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
  and 
Mohd Desa bin Hashim v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 MLJ 350
 . Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily and not on the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the confession was not made voluntarily: 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
 . However, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words, it is only necessary for the prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 .
 The first statement (P73)
Counsel for the first appellant submitted that he was under the influence of `Ice`, as shown by the positive traces from the urine samples provided by the first appellant after his arrest. This submission was without merit. It has been held that the mere fact that the accused was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms when he made the statement does not render the statement involuntary unless he was in a state of near delirium, such that his mind did not go with the statement he was making: 
Garnam Singh v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 243
  and 
PP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 783
 . There was no evidence that the first appellant was anywhere in a state of near delirium. In fact, the evidence of Insp Krishnan and the officers who were members of the raiding team was that the first appellant appeared to understand the questions asked.
Counsel also contended that the first appellant was assaulted by Sgt Najid at the time of his arrest. It was claimed that this allegation was substantiated by the evidence of the two doctors who conducted the pre- and post-statement medical examination on the first appellant; the first appellant had informed the doctors on these occasions that he had chest pain and he testified that this pain was caused by the assault. The learned judicial commissioner disbelieved the first appellant`s testimony as there were many inconsistencies and it was improbable, in the circumstances, that any assault could have taken place. In addition, the medical reports noted no visible signs of injury. In any event, Dr Ng Chee Keong`s evidence was to the effect that a finding of mild tenderness (which was the first appellant`s complaint) is based solely on what the patient tells the doctor. In other words, Dr Ng had no means of verifying the first appellant`s claim that he had chest pain and the first appellant could very well have been lying to the doctor. In view of the nature of the so-called medical evidence, it was at most a neutral factor in substantiating the first appellant`s allegations of assault. We thus agreed with the learned judicial commissioner that the CNB officers did not assault the first appellant. They had used force to restrain him by body-locking him when he was caught after a short chase but they did not punch him.
Counsel also made much of the fact that all the officers omitted to mention the move from Blk 125 to the more secluded Blk 122. Counsel did not say how the failure to mention the move was material. Suffice it to say that the learned judicial commissioner was satisfied that the omission was not a deliberate attempt to mislead the court. As SS/Sgt See explained, a search operation was still in progress in the area around Blk 125 and he was instructed to move so as not to alert the other syndicate members to the presence of the CNB. This was perfectly logical. We also found no merit in counsel`s submissions to us on this point.
It was then contended that the CNB officers had uttered threats to the first appellant, and that he was threatened by the close proximity of the arresting team. We did not see how that could amount to a threat within the meaning of s 24 of the Evidence Act. If all that the officers did was to look fierce and threatening, that was obviously insufficient to amount to a threat or threats which would render any subsequent confession involuntary. Any purported inducement that the first appellant perceived was self-perceived, and it is trite law that a self-perceived inducement cannot in law amount to an inducement: 
Lu Lai Heng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 251
 . In any event, the learned judicial commissioner found that the first appellant was in no way threatened as he refused to answer many of the officers` questions.
As for the actual recording of P73, counsel contended that there were numerous inconsistencies in the testimony of Sgt Najid and between that of Sgt Najid and Insp Krishnan so as to render their assertions that the statement was made voluntarily highly suspect. We did not accept this. The accounts in the testimony of Sgt Najid who acted as an interpreter and that of Insp Krishnan were substantially the same; there were no material discrepancies. Indeed, we agreed with the learned judicial commissioner who preferred the evidence of Sgt Najid and Insp Krishnan to that of the first appellant, which the learned judicial commissioner found was fraught with inconsistencies.
Finally, counsel contended that the cumulative effect of the assault, the interrogation at Blk 122, the influence of `Ice` and the close proximity of the officers was such as to cause the first appellant to feel a mixture of fear and confusion just before P73 was recorded by Insp Krishnan. We found, as did the learned judicial commissioner, that the allegation of mix-up and confusion experienced by the first appellant was spurious. His actions and behaviour were certainly not those of a man labouring under fear and confusion; he had, for instance, the presence of mind to tell the officers that he did not possess the keys to the door of the saloon when he must have known that they meant the keys to the shop. The first appellant was clearly not in such a state of mind when he made P73. We therefore found that P73 had been made voluntarily and was rightly admitted in evidence.
 The second statement (P75A)
It was alleged that just before P75A was recorded, not only the first appellant`s previous cautioned statement but also the charge and the notice of warning were read to him. It was argued that this caused P75A to be made involuntarily as the first appellant was under the mistaken belief that he had to co-operate and that adverse inferences may be drawn if he did not do so. This, counsel submitted, induced fear or created a false obligation on the part of the first appellant which rendered P75A involuntary, relying on the authority of 
PP v Mazlan bin Maidun
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 512
 . To begin with, both SS/Sgt Wong and the interpreter testified that only the previous cautioned statement had been read to the first appellant. This was done as SS/Sgt Wong wanted to establish ownership of the drugs and also to refer the first appellant to Nor Azman whom he had mentioned in his cautioned statement. It was to put the first appellant back in the picture, as it were. The learned judicial commissioner believed the evidence of SS/Sgt Wong and the interpreter; and this was a finding of fact which we would not lightly disturb. In fact, in our view, the reading of the earlier statement would have helped to refresh the first appellant`s memory and assisted him in making a decision as to what to say. He may have thought that the warning made the day before continued to operate in relation to the s 121 statement, but if there was any such misapprehension, it was only self-induced and would be insufficient to amount to an inducement rendering the statement involuntary. As for the fear caused by the overhanging thought of the death penalty, we agreed with the learned judicial commissioner that `such fear caused by the legitimate explanation of a charge to an accused person surely cannot render a subsequent statement by him involuntary`. We therefore rejected counsel`s submissions to us on this point.
With regard to the alleged `hope` held out by SS/Sgt Wong, ASP Adam and DSP Vijakumar if the first appellant co-operated, the learned judicial commissioner found that it did not exist and was entirely self-perceived. We have already stated that a self-perceived inducement cannot in law amount to an inducement. We would add that we agree with the learned judicial commissioner and see no need to go through the reasons for his finding again seriatim. To our mind, the first appellant`s allegation that he had been induced to make the impugned statement by virtue of such `hope` was clearly untenable; it was illogical in the light of his own admission that he felt fed-up halfway through the recording of the statement and had to be threatened with curtailment of family visits in order to continue making the statement. Conversely, for the same reason, if he had felt any hope, that must have dissipated by the time he told SS/Sgt Wong that he was fed-up with the repetition of the same questions and that he did not wish to continue. We therefore held that the alleged `hope` was imaginary but that if it was not, it had no bearing whatsoever on the first appellant at the time he made the statement in question.
It was next contended that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in law in rejecting the principle in the Malaysian case of 
Lee Look v PP
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 240
  that a cautioned statement recorded by an investigating officer who is actively involved in the investigations is inadmissible on the ground of likelihood of bias. We could not accept this contention. It was the considered opinion of this court that the view of the Kuala Lumpur Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Lee Look v PP 
 that an investigating officer cannot be the recording officer, should not be adopted in this country. It would be entirely unrealistic to expect an officer who was not acquainted with the case to record a statement, as he would not know what questions to ask or even where to begin. He would have to familiarise himself with the facts by reading the relevant papers or asking the relevant questions, and would then, like the investigating officer, be open to the same objection of likelihood of bias. The principle contended for would be totally impractical and unduly restrictive. In any event, we note that s 122 of the CPC itself does not preclude the investigating officer from recording the statement; and we would hold that he can do so and that such a statement would be admissible, provided the court is satisfied that it was voluntarily made.
We therefore concluded that P75A had been made voluntarily and was rightly admitted in evidence. In addition, we would make the following remarks with regard to the challenge sought to be mounted on the admissibility of the two statements in the present case. We wish to reiterate that the learned judicial commissioner`s decision on the admissibility of the two statements was a decision on the facts, and it is axiomatic that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence: see, eg 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 . In this respect, we found the following remarks of Lord Salmon in 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
 at pp 187-188 instructive: 
The judge`s decision is, in reality, a decision on the facts. ... The Court of Appeal should not disturb the judge`s findings merely because of difficulties in reconciling them with different findings of fact, on apparently similar evidence, in other reported cases, but only if it is completely satisfied that the judge made a wrong assessment of the evidence before him or failed to apply the correct principle - 
 always remembering that usually the trial judge has better opportunities of assessing the evidence than those enjoyed by an appellate tribunal
. [Emphasis added.]
It was finally contended that the learned judicial commissioner had come to the erroneous conclusion that the charge against the first appellant had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, which he would not have done had the first appellant`s statements not been admitted in evidence. This contention was clearly unsustainable. Even if the two statements in question were excluded, we were unable to see how that would assist the first appellant. There were, first of all, the statements of the second appellant, P76A and P77A, the admissibility of which were not challenged and which clearly implicated the first appellant. They were clearly `confessions` within the meaning of s 30 of the Evidence Act (see, eg 
Anandagoda v The Queen
 
 [1962] MLJ 289 
 and 
Tong Chee Kong v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 843
 ) and could be used against the first appellant who was a co-accused ( 
Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 ). Second, the irresistible inference from the sheer quantity of the drugs (gross weight of more than 17kg) and the drug-trafficking paraphernalia found in the shop and in TG Mansion was that the first appellant had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This was simply a matter of common sense: the larger the quantity of drugs found, the stronger the presumption that they were intended for trafficking. Third, the inescapable fact was that the first appellant chose to remain silent when his defence was called. As such, this court was entitled to draw such inferences from the refusal to give evidence as appeared proper, including the drawing of an inference that he was guilty of the offence with which he was charged: see 
Haw Tua Tau & Ors v PP
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  and 
Murray v DPP
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1
.
 (2) Inconsistencies between the statements of the first and second appellants
Counsel did not say what these were. On an examination of the statements, however, we found that the alleged inconsistencies were all minor ones. They did not detract from the fact that the material parts of the appellants` respective statements coincided: that both appellants knew that the drugs were then stored at TG Mansion; that on the material date both appellants were in contact with each other regarding the mode of transport of the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop; that the second appellant had knowingly transported the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop with Salim`s assistance; that the first appellant was waiting for the second appellant at the shop; that the second appellant on arrival had unpacked the drugs and re-packed them into a sports bag with other drug paraphernalia; that the drugs were to be stored in the shop from 7 March 1998 and that both appellants had access to the shop between 7 and 9 March 1998. We thus concluded that the minor inconsistencies did not adversely affect the cogency of the statements, the contents of which, we were satisfied, established all the elements of the charge against the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt.
 (3) Possession
It was contended that the prosecution had not proved possession of the carton and the two plastic containers containing the drugs. Under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is an offence for a person to traffic in a controlled drug. Section 5(2) provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. It is also provided by s 17(c) that a person who is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine is presumed to have had the diamorphine in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of the diamorphine was not for that purpose. In order to prove possession, this court has held in 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
  that there must be physical control over the drugs and the requisite mens rea to deal with the drugs. Karthigesu JA said at [para ] 53-56: 
53 The essential question in this appeal is whether or not the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in question. Clearly in order to prove that the appellant was in possession, he must have physical control over the drugs. It is a matter of fact whether someone has physical control over an item. ...
 
54 Physical control is not enough for the purpose of proving possession. There needs to be mens rea on the part of the accused. In 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
, a case where the House of Lords was trying to determine the meaning of `possession` for the purpose of s 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964, Lord Pearce had this to say: `One may, therefore, exclude from the ""possession"" intended by the Act the physical control of articles which have been ""planted"" on him without his knowledge. But how much further is one to go? If one goes to the extreme length of requiring the prosecution to prove that ""possession"" implies a full knowledge of the name and nature of the drug concerned, the efficacy of the Act is seriously impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I think that the term ""possession"" is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its qualities ...`.
 
55 In Tan Ah Tee v PP 
[1980] 1 MLJ 49
, a case concerning the meaning of `possession` in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, Lord Pearce`s dicta was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal. Wee Chong Jin CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:
 
`In our opinion the word ""possession"" in the Act should be construed as that word has been construed by Lord Pearce and we would respectfully adopt his reasons as contained in his speech.`
 
A long line of cases have since followed 
 Tan Ah Tee v PP 
 and 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
.
 
56 This meaning of possession can be applied as the Act is merely an amended version of the 1973 Act. In our case, the appellant not only knew of the existence of packets and the straws, he also knew that they contained drugs.
We had no doubt that the first appellant had physical control over the drugs. He had access to the shop in the form of the key to the lock to the door. The oral answers given by him to Insp Krishnan in the shop on the day of the arrest showed unequivocally that not only did the first appellant know that the drugs and drug trafficking paraphernalia were present in the shop but also the weight of the drugs in the sports bag and the number of packets in the carton. His long statement described how the drugs were packed. Possession had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
 The second appellant
The grounds of appeal raised by the second appellant were: first, that the learned judicial commissioner erred in relying on the statements of the first appellant when considering the guilt of the second appellant; and second, when he concluded that the second appellant was in possession of the drugs at the shop.
 (1) Use of first appellant`s statements against second appellant
It was contended that, of the first appellant`s two statements P73 and P75A, only P75A implicated the second appellant. The first appellant made no mention of the second appellant in P73 at all and P73 was thus irrelevant vis-Ã -vis the second appellant. With regard to P75A, the complaint was not so much that it, being a confession within the meaning of s 30 of the Evidence Act, could not be used against the second appellant, in the light of the principle in the oft-cited case of 
Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
  at p 136 that: 
[t]he natural interpretation of s 30 is that it allows the conviction of an accused to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided the evidence emanating from that confession satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused`s guilt
but that it was riddled with so many discrepancies and inconsistencies which affected the weight to be attached to it, that it could not be relied upon as evidence against the second appellant. It was pointed out, for instance, that according to para 9 of P75A, it was Nor Azman who had asked the second appellant to move the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop; whereas in the second appellant`s long statement P77A, it was the first appellant who had asked him to move the drugs. Counsel submitted that it was more likely that it was the first appellant rather than Nor Azman who had asked the second appellant to move the drugs. Other inconsistencies were brought to our attention: first, that in para 11 of P75A, the first appellant stated that the second appellant entered the shop carrying a sports bag, but in para 44, he stated that the second appellant entered the shop pushing a trolley with three sports bags; and second, that the first appellant`s denial in P75A that he had any knowledge of the carton of drugs or the two plastic containers flew in the face of his earlier statement P73 wherein he admitted that all the drugs found in the shop were his. It was obvious, said counsel, that P75A was riddled with so many inconsistencies because the first appellant was trying to distance or exculpate himself from the incriminating evidence. Thus, it was not an accurate account of what transpired in relation to the drugs and should be rejected.
Counsel did not explain the relevance of the question whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who had asked the second appellant to move the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop, nor were we able to discern it ourselves. Surely it was immaterial whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who was responsible for asking the second appellant to move the drugs, as what was crucial was that the second appellant had indeed done so in pursuance of his common intention with the first appellant. This was not disputed. As for the other alleged inconsistencies, we did not think they were at all material. The train of events leading up to and resulting in the removal of the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. In this respect, the appellants` statements essentially coincided on material points. We have already set these out at [para ] 65 when dealing with the similar submission of counsel for the first appellant that there were numerous inconsistencies between the statements of the first and second appellants, and see no need to repeat what we have said here.
 (2) Possession
The prosecution`s case was that the common intention of the appellants was to put the first appellant in possession of the drugs, pursuant to the pre-arranged plan of them both. The learned judicial commissioner found that the acts of both appellants went even further in that they resulted in both of them having possession of the drugs. We agree. Both appellants obviously knew that what they were handling were drugs, specifically, heroin. In the circumstances, there was simply no room for the argument that they lacked the requisite knowledge. Both had acted in concert in moving the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop. In addition, both had access to the shop in the form of the key to the door. They thus had physical control of the drugs. Both appellants had unpacked the drugs from the three sports bags and re-packed them into one sports bag and a carton. They had also placed some drug-trafficking paraphernalia into the sports bag. The second appellant had returned to the shop on four separate occasions between 7 and 9 March 1998, the period when the drugs were stored in the shop. The conclusion that possession had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt could not be faulted.
 Conclusion 
 
We therefore concluded that all the elements of the offence with which the appellants were charged had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the mandatory sentence of death passed on them.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court):
The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on the following charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (MDA): 
 
You, Yeo See How, on or about the second day of June 1995 at about 3.30pm at the first floor of Apartment Block 32 Bendemeer Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking one packet, 32 sachets and one straw of substance containing not less than 43.28 grams of diamorphine at the said place without authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
Two other charges of possession and consumption against him were stood down and were eventually withdrawn by the prosecution upon his conviction of the present charge.
The appellant appealed against his conviction. We heard the appeal on 25 March 1996 and dismissed it on the conclusion of the hearing. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
Briefly, the case against the appellant was as follows. On 2 June 1995, at about 8.30am, one PC Wong together with several other police officers, were waiting in ambush for persons involved in housebreaking in the vicinity of Blocks 31, 32 and 33 of Bendemeer Road. At about 3.30pm, the appellant was seen at the ground floor landing of Block 31, carrying a brown travel bag. PC Wong trailed the appellant as the latter seemed suspicious. The appellant then started running, with PC Wong giving chase. The other officers joined in the chase. As the appellant was running, he threw his bag away at the first floor of Block 32. This was seen by one Cpl Tay who recovered the bag. The appellant was apprehended at Block 33.
Upon searching the travel bag in the presence of the appellant, the police officers discovered sachets of substance which they suspected to contain controlled drugs. The appellant was then brought back to the Kallang Neighbourhood Police Post, where a more thorough search was conducted. The bag contained 32 sachets of a granular substance, one packet of a granular substance wrapped in a brown paper bag, a long straw also containing a granular substance, a plastic bag filled with empty sachets, a weighing scale, a normal spoon, two metal pincers, five straws, a pager, a handphone, and improvised pipes.
The Central Narcotics Bureau then took over the investigations from the police. The investigating officer, Inspector S Krishnan, took the appellant to his place of residence and did a search. The appellant was then sent to Changi Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination. But as the appellant complained of drug withdrawal, he was warded for treatment.
The 32 sachets, the packet and the straw with substance were analysed and found to contain not less than 13.28g, 29.9g and 0.10g of diamorphine respectively, giving a total amount of 43.28g. The spoon, pincers, straws and pipes were also found to have been stained with diamorphine. It should be mentioned that in addition to the diamorphine just mentioned, the appellant also had with him 3.8 g of opium.
The appellant was tested for consumption. The urine analysis indicated that the appellant had 504 micrograms of morphine per 5 millilitres of urine. The analyst, Dr Lui Chi Peng, told the court that the content was on the high side. However, he could not say, there being so many variables, how severe an addict the appellant was. Another sample of urine tested was found to contain a similar concentration of morphine.
The prosecution also adduced medical evidence showing that when the appellant was admitted to Changi Hospital by one Dr Kelly Loke he had mild withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, chills and rigors. Methadone, a heroine substitute, was subsequently prescribed by one Dr Khoo. In the course of his stay, he was observed primarily by one Dr Goh, who had also put the appellant on intravenous drip. Dr Goh said that during that period she did not look for specific signs of withdrawal. On 8 June, one Dr Leow Kee Fong of the Changi Prison Hospital examined the appellant but found no signs of withdrawal symptoms although the appellant complained of cold sensation and body aches. Testifying also as an expert witness, Dr Leow said that, based on the observations of the other doctors, the appellant had only mild heroin withdrawal at admission.
Reliance was placed by the prosecution on a long statement recorded on 13 June 1995. The voluntariness of this statement was challenged. Though other statements were also recorded from the appellant, those were not sought to be adduced by the prosecution.
 The voir dire 
 The prosecution`s version
The investigating officer and the interpreter testified that the statement was made without any threat, inducement or promise. The investigating officer said that the appellant appeared normal. The statement was recorded as a narrative though a series of questions was asked.
The defence version
The appellant contended that after his arrest on 2 June, he pleaded with the investigating officer for a lenient charge to be preferred against him. The investigating officer replied that they would be able to speak about it after the statement had been completed, and that he would try his best to speak to the DPP so that the latter could raise it court. A request for a visit by his family was also met by a similar response. The appellant also claimed to be suffering from withdrawal symptoms and gastric pain after his arrest. As a result he was warded from 3 June to 7 June 1995 at Changi Hospital and subsequently at Changi Prison Hospital from 7 June to 8 June 1995.
On 8 June, while two statements were recorded from him, the earlier requests were repeated. By then he desparately wanted cigarette. The same reply was given by the investigating officer. Two days later on 10 June, the requests were made once more. When the appellant pointed out that a statement had already been recorded from him, he was told that there was another statement to be recorded. On 12 June, while he was being taken for a search of both his registered residential address and the address at which he actually resided at the time, he repeated his requests. Again, similar answers were given.
The same thing happened on 13 June 1995, both before and during the recording of the statement. The recording was done by way of questions and answers. The appellant alleged that that statement was given as he was told that his requests would be acceded to and that he would only be imprisoned for 20 years. During the recording of the statement, which took place between 2.20pm and 5.40pm, the appellant felt cold and had gastric pain. The interpreter adjusted the airconditioning, but the appellant still felt cold. However, as regards his gastric pain, he was told that there was no medicine. The appellant also asked for food, but was told that it would be given after the recording had been concluded. At the conclusion of the statement he was given a drink, a slice of bread and cigarettes. He was also allowed to arrange for a visit by his family for the next day. He had another visit on 15 June.
The contention of the appellant was that there were promises and inducements which led to the volunteering of the statement. There was also oppression in that no medicine was given for his gastric pain, and that the statement was brought forth by unrecorded questions.
The decision of the judge on the voir dire
The learned judge noted that admissibility was governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), citing 
 Tan Boon Tat v PP 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
. The cases 
 DPP v Ping Lin 
 [1975] AC 574; [1975] 3 All ER 175, and 
 Seow Choon Meng v PP 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
, 
 Chow Eng v PP 
 [1924] 4 FMSLR 287 were also cited by the judge on the issue of oppression.
In his findings, the learned judge found that the appellant`s allegations were exaggerations. The replies given by the investigating officer were not anything more than a courteous response. The judge was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that no inducement or promise was held out to the appellant. He noted that the requests of the appellant for food, cigarettes and visits by relatives were acceded to after the statement had been recorded, and that it was not pursuant to any inducement held out earlier. Furthermore, the judge did not think that the alleged vague promise by the investigating officer could have made the appellant give the statement, particularly in view of the fact that he was facing a capital charge. He also did not think that there was anything wrong in the recording being done by way of questions and answers where only the answers were recorded. The learned judge therefore admitted the statement.
 The statement
The relevant portions of the statement read as follows: 
 
Around April 1995, I started smoking heroin mainly to ease my gastric pains. Soon I became heavily addicted to heroin and was smoking 8 gm sachet of heroin daily. My rate of consumption prior to my arrest increased to about two to three 8 gm sachets per day ...
 
 
 
When I first relapsed to heroin, I used to buy heroin in sachets at $140 per sachet from a male Malaysian known to me as Ah Siah at Lavender MRT station ... I again met him in April 1995 at Bendemeer Rd Hawkers Centre where he gave me free heroin for my own consumption. Once I got hooked to heroin, Ah Siah started to charge me for the heroin.
 
 
 
Ah Siah suggested that he would charge me $100 per sachet for a batch of ten sachets and $90 per sachet for a batch of 20 sachets if I decided to buy in bulk. As such, I went to look for my addict friends and they agreed to share in the purchase of the heroin in bulk. Altogether, I managed to get five addict friends who are known to me as David, Robert, Ah Cheng, Ah Chuan and Ah Huat. They all know my pager number (2103678) and used to contact me whenever they wanted to place an order. By this arrangement with my friends, I did not have to spend so much money in the purchase of heroin. I also did not introduce any of my friends to Ah Siah.
 
 
 
Since April 1995, I have bought heroin in batches of ten sachets and 20 sachets from Ah Siah on about five or six separate occasions. All my heroin transactions with Ah Siah took place at the Lavender MRT station. The distribution of the heroin when I purchased in batches of ten or 20 sachets would vary according to the orders placed by my friends. I would normally hand over the heroin to my friends also at the Lavender MRT Station.
 
 
 
Late last month, Ah Siah suggested that it would be cheaper for me to buy heroin in pounds. He agreed to sell me the heroin at $3,100 per pound. I discussed with my friends and they agreed. Over a few days prior to 1 June 1995, I met my five friends separately and managed to collect $2,500 from them. My own share was to be $600. After having collected the money, sometime on 31 May 1995, I met Ah Siah at Lavender MRT Station and confirmed my order for one pound of heroin. He then agreed to meet me the following afternoon at the same venue to deliver the heroin.
 
 
 
Sometime in the afternoon on 1 June 1995, I met Ah Siah at Lavender MRT station as pre-arranged. I then paid him $3,100 and he in turn handed over one pound of heroin inside a plastic bag. I then returned to my rented flat at Apt Blk 32, Bendemeer Rd, [num ]01-793 where I kept the heroin. I then waited for my friends to contact me to collect their share of the heroin. I had made prior arrangements with my friends to contact me on 2 June 1995. Part of my arrangement with my friends was that if I did not respond to their paging on 2 June 1995, it would mean that I have been arrested. After getting the one pound of heroin, I did not immediately repack it into sachets as I still had my own consignment of 32 sachets which I intended to distribute to my friends first. The 32 sachets were actually meant for my own consumption and were accumulated from previous purchases from Ah Siah. From my experience, I would be able to pack one pound of heroin into 54 sachets with each weighing about 8 gms.
 
 
 
That was the prosecution`s case that the appellant had trafficked in the quantity of heroin stated in the charge. The defence did not make any submission at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case.
 The defence
The appellant testified that he had been detained in rehabilitation centres several times, the last of which he absconded from in February 1995. In April 1995, he met Ah Siah, and after being initially given some straws of heroin for free, started purchasing them. Soon, he was told by Ah Siah that he would be given a discount if he had bought in bulk, that is ten sachets per purchase. The appellant then made arrangements with five others to pool their resources. Thus, the appellant bought lots of ten sachets on five or six occasions. Later, Ah Siah persuaded the appellant, who arranged it again with the others, to purchase in batches of twenty sachets. Finally, the appellant was offered one pound of heroin at a discounted price of $3,100 and he was told that one pound could be divided into fifty or sixty sachets. The group of addicts agreed to jointly purchase one pound`s worth.
Out of the purchase price of $3,100, the appellant contributed $600. He obtained the heroin on 1 June, together with various paraphernalia which Ah Siah had given him to facilitate his splitting up the heroin with the others. The appellant then brought the drugs back to his flat.
On 2 June, he consumed heroin. Later that day, he noticed police officers in plain clothes in his neighbourhood. He thought that he was going to be arrested, so he packed a bag with the drugs, the weighing scale, plastic sachets and left the place, intending to meet up with the others. He took the drugs with him because he did not want to lose them in case the police raided his flat.
He further alleged that he had been told by Inspector Krishnan to say that Ah Siah was a Malaysian who could not be contacted and that he had won only $4,000 in an illegal lottery and not $6,000, as he claimed he did. He was also told that he need not have to give any further particulars of those people in his group.
The appellant maintained that the statement was induced by promises. Additionally, he disowned having stated in the statement that (i) there was an understanding with his friends that if his friends` pages were not answered, that would indicate that he was arrested, (ii) that he would be able to re-pack, based on his experience, one pound packet of the substance into 54 sachets.
Finally, the appellant claimed that by June 1995 his rate of consumption had risen to three sachets per day. He further alleged that the investigation, including the exhibits, were badly handled by the investigating officer. The defence was that the drugs found in his possession were for his own consumption as well as for his friends. Thus, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA had been rebutted.
 Decision of the court below
The judge noted that the appellant had to rebut the presumption under s 17 on a balance of probabilities. He also noted the following factors: the appellant was carrying a weighing scale and 1,063 empty sachets; and that the appellant was a drug addict. While he was willing to accept that the appellant was a severe addict, the judge also observed that even a severe addict could traffic, citing 
 Lee Yuan Kwang v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
. The judge considered it odd that he had wanted to move all the drugs, including those supposedly left over from previous purchases. He found that the appellant was not truthful. The appellant had said that, before his arrest, he had gone over to his sister-in-law`s flat at Block 31 to hand over some keys. The judges found this to be inconsistent with his claim that he was aware of the police presence. His explanation that he took the drugs out of the flat to avoid them being seized by the police was thus rejected. The judge felt that the weighing scale and the sachets all indicated that the appellant had the drugs for trafficking.
As for the defence of consumption, based on what the appellant said, of the 29.9g of diamorphine in the one pound packet, 24.91g would belong to the others. The judge held that the very act of delivering that portion of the drugs to his friends was a sufficient act of trafficking, citing 
 Lee Yuan Kwang 
 again. The judge also found that the retracted parts of the statement were the truth. He also rejected the allegation that the investigating officer had in fact coached him.
As for the criticism of the handling of the exhibits by the police, the judge thought that this was of little substance, as the issue was not about who had supplied drugs to the appellant, but whether the appellant was indeed trafficking in the quantity of drug which he was carrying. Furthermore, he held there was no duty on the prosecution to obtain fingerprints in such situations, citing 
 PP v Poon Yuen Chung 
 [1994] 1 Clas News 223 and 
 Osman bin Din v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 129
.
Having considered all the evidence tendered by the prosecution and the defence of the appellant, the learned judge found that the prosecution had proved the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.
 The appeal
The appellant contended that the judge had erred in admitting the statements; in not finding that the presumption had been rebutted; in finding, despite the severity of the appellant`s addiction, that he was trafficking; in not giving any weight to the mishandling of the exhibits; in finding that the investigation was sufficient; and in not holding that no evidence had been given as to the quantum and quality of drugs necessary for sale.
 Admissibility of the statement
The statement was challenged as being involuntary because of: 
(a) inducements or promises held out to the appellant, 
(b) oppression .
The allegations of inducement were premised on the various requests made by the appellant to the investigating officer at various times for cigarettes, a visit by his family and a lenient charge.
The appellant argued that the investigating officer had held out that his requests could be acceded to once a statement was recorded. This therefore was the incentive for the appellant to give the statement. Counsel pointed to the fact that the requests for cigarettes and visits were eventually acceded to thus showing clearly that there was indeed inducement.
Section 24 of the Evidence Act, which governs admissibility in this case reads: 
 
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him.
 
 
 
In 
 Poh Kay Keong v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 this court held that a purposive construction should be given to the expression `in reference to the proceedings against him` in the section and it was found that a threat made against family members was sufficient to vitiate the confession.
So the question which we had to determine was whether any inducement was in fact held out. The investigating officer testified on cross-examination (on the incident on 13 June): 
 
 
Q: The accused - first, a request for cigarettes. Do you agree with that? 
 
A: He could have made a request for cigarettes, your Honour; he could have. 
 
Q: To this, you told the accused, `I would not allow you cigarettes until you`ve given me the long statement?` 
 
A: Not in those exact words but something like that, like, `You can always smoke once you`ve finished everything - let`s finish our work and then we will let you smoke later.`
  
 
 
And subsequently, 
 
 
Q: ... the second request that the accused made to you whilst walking along this corridor was also for you - or for him to be allowed to see his family members. Do you think he could have made this request as well? 
 
A: Yes, your Honour. 
 
... 
 
Q: ... you also told him ... `No, give me your statement first and I will then allow you to see your family members.`? 
 
A: Something to that effect, your Honour, but not in the counsel`s words.
  
 
 
Finally, 
 
 
Q: And the third request ... to let him have a lenient charge of 20 years` imprisonment? 
 
A: Yes, your Honour, he did ask for a lenient charge. 
 
Q: And in this particular case ... you told him ... `You give me a statement first, and I will try my best`? 
 
... 
 
A: `It`s not in my hands, it`s up to the courts.`
  
 
 
The appellant had to raise a reasonable doubt that the statement was not voluntary. His case basically was that all these promises led him to make the statement. We agreed with the learned judge that it seemed incredible, given the nature of the charge against him that the appellant would have made the statement in order to obtain cigarettes and a visit by his family. While it is not impossible for accused persons to give statements in order to obtain relief from a craving for something, whether it is nicotine, or the presence of his relatives, the judge was justified in finding that this was not so in respect of this appellant. There was really nothing to suggest that his free will was so weakened by his desire to smoke or to see his relatives that he did suppose that by giving that statement he could gain any advantage.
As for the appellant`s request for a lenient charge, here the court accepted the evidence of the investigating officer, and what he said was that it was up to the courts. It is hard to see how this could have amounted to an inducement given that it was clearly stated by the investigating officer that he had no power to procure a lenient charge for the appellant. There was no evidence whatsoever that Inspector Krishnan gave the appellant any reason or basis for supposing that the Inspector could assist the appellant. There was no ground for the appellant to have supposed that by making the statement that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil.
We agreed with the judge that while the appellant`s requests were acceded to after the statement was completed, that was not pursuant to any inducement or promise held out earlier.
We now turn to consider the aspect of oppression. The appellant adopted three main lines of attack. First, it was contended that there was oppression in that while giving the statement the appellant was feeling cold, he was not given medicine for his gastric pain, and he was hungry. There was no evidence that his gastric problems were at the time serious. It would seem that there was just some minor discomfort - in other words that the appellant was not in any severe pain. The appellant testified: 
 
... I told the interpreter that I was feeling cold and in the course of the recording of the statement, I had gastric pain so I told the interpreter to get me some medicine and the answer I was given was that there was no medicine so I asked for some food in order for me to continue with the recording of the statement after the recording of the statement had concluded.
 
 
 
As the appellant was willing to continue provided food was given, he could not have really been more than discomfited by the gastric problems. He had also stated that while he was holding on to his abdomen, he did not groan in pain.
As noted by the Court of Appeal in 
 Panya Martmontree v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 there is no necessity, contrary to what may have been thought in various cases, including 
 PP v Law Say Seck 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 199
, for interrogators to remove all discomfort. Some discomfort has to be expected - the issue is whether such discomfort is of such a great extent that it causes the making of an involuntary statement. Since the discomfort here was clearly not great, we did not see any doubt was raised that the statement was involuntary.
The second line of attack was that the recording of the statement ought not to have been conducted in a question and answer format, without the questions being also written down. Such a contention really goes to the weight of the statement - whether or not the omission of a particular question is material goes to the issue of whether a particular answer can be interpreted as contended for by the prosecution. It has nothing to do with admissibility. In any event, there was no evidence from the appellant during the trial proper that any other interpretation could be made of his answers.
The third line of attack concerned the pace of questioning. The contention here was that it amounted to a form of cross-examination. Before the Court of Appeal decision in 
 Sim Ah Cheoh v PP 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
; 
[1991] SLR 150
, the position as to cross-examination of witnesses might be somewhat unclear (
 R v Lim Ah Seng 
 
[1932] MLJ 12
, 
 R v Santokh Singh 
 [1933] MLJ 178l and 
 Ong Hock v R 
[1939] MLJ 232
). In 
 Sim Ah Cheoh 
, the Court of Appeal indicated that while cross-examination was improper, it would not render a statement inadmissible if it was otherwise admissible. But cross-examination could render a statement inadmissible if it amounts to oppression.
The evidence of the investigating officer was as follows: 
 
 
Q: ... Correct me if I`m wrong, now would you ask a question following which he would give a reply? 
 
A: Something in that pattern your Honour. Questions were put across but it`s not one question, one answer, one question. It`s like a conversation between me and the accused with a series of questions.
  
 
 
That really could not be described as cross-examination. The questioning was not at a frantic pace. The testimony of the appellant also seemed to support that. The appellant had first testified that the questioning was at a fast pace, but had to agree, in cross-examination, there were pauses because of interpretation. The questioning then, even if it did amount to a cross-examination, was not oppressive, for the pace could not really be pressing.
 Has the appellant rebutted the presumption? 
Section 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act reads:Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than - 
 
 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine
  
 
 
whether or not contained in any substance ... shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.
 
 
 
There was no dispute that the appellant was in possession of the quantity of drugs and that he knew the nature of it. The presumption thus applied.
The presumption had to be rebutted on a balance of probabilities (
 Kong Weng Chong v PP 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 34
). The appellant`s defence was that the drugs were meant for his own consumption and for sharing with those addict friends.
The contention that as at least part of the appellant`s drugs was meant to be shared, there could not be trafficking in that part, is clearly without merit. `Traffic` is defined in s 2 of the MDA as follows: 
 
`traffic` means - 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver, or distribute; or 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a), otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations made thereunder ...
 
 
 
As mentioned above, the appellant testified that he had intended to distribute the drugs to the members of his pool. Towards that end, he had transported the drug out of his flat. It is not necessary under the Act that any of the acts done has to be for a profit. Section 5(2) of the Act provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. Since the appellant, on his own evidence, was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of transporting, sending, delivering or distributing to the pool members, this argument that he was not trafficking in them is clearly without any merit (
 Lee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
).
It was eminently clear that at least a portion of the drug was subject to trafficking. On the appellant`s evidence, the drugs were to be distributed according to their respective contributions. The court was told that the other five members contributed $2,500. Therefore in respect of that lot of 29.9g, whose value was $3,100, 24.1g belonged to them and which the appellant was transporting and distributing. That was a quantum in excess of the limit of 15g.
The appellant attempted to argue below that it was not clear how that pound of diamorphine was to be distributed. But given that the pool members had paid specific amounts, and that in the past they had shared rateably, the only inference that could be made was that the distribution of that 29.9g was to be done in same proportion. The appellant did not adduce any evidence that he intended to cheat the rest and keep a larger portion for himself.
 Consumption
It was not in dispute that the appellant was a drug addict. The judge was prepared to accept that he was a severe addict. The appellant gave evidence that just before his arrest, his level of consumption had gone up to about three sachets per day, and that he had to stock up because he was in fear of not being able to obtain a supply. He wanted the court to believe that in view of his high consumption rate, he had to accumulate a surplus of 32 sachets. But as noted above, a severe addict could still traffic. The judge, after considering the appellant`s reasons and having found that he was not a truthful witness, was quite right to have rejected the appellant`s claim that the 32 sachets was for his own consumption.
 Ancillary points
We now turn to consider briefly the ancillary points raised by the appellant. First, there was the allegation that the police had failed to obtain fingerprints for the various items found in the bag and that they had failed to follow up on both Ah Sia and the members of the pool. As noted by the judge, the failure to obtain fingerprints was entirely irrelevant. The appellant`s defence was that he was given the drugs by Ah Sia, and that he was bringing them for distribution to the members of the pool. The prosecution did not challenge the existence of either Ah Sia or the members of the pool. The issue before the court was not so much who supplied the drugs to the appellant but that he transported the drugs for distribution. In 
 Osman bin Din v PP 
, the Court of Appeal had noted that there was no obligation to take fingerprints for examination, particularly where the accused was caught with the offending material.
The appellant made much of the fact that the investigating officer had failed to follow-up on the appellant`s information concerning Ah Sia and the rest, including checking up or monitoring the handphone and the pager seized from the appellant. For the same reasons as given above, it was hard to see how in any event this would have made any difference given the appellant`s defence.
Second, the appellant recanted two portions of this statement - (a) statement on the arrangement with the others that if he did not respond to their paging, that means that he had been arrested and (b) the statement that from his experience, he would be able to pack the one pound packet into about 54 sachets. The judge preferred the retracted versions, and there was nothing to indicate that he was not entitled to do so, just as he also found that the investigating officer had not coached the appellant.
Third, the appellant argued that as the 32 sachets of drugs were not tested individually, the prosecution`s contention that they were for sale could not be supported, as sachets of drugs for sale would be uniform in quantity and quality. We could not see how this argument could be valid. Even if the drugs were not uniform, that did not necessarily mean that they could not be for sale. Furthermore it had to be noted that as the presumption applied, the burden lay on the appellant to show on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were not for the purpose of trafficking, which he had failed to do.
 Decision
In the premises, we agreed with the learned judge that the appellant was guilty of the charge. He failed to rebut the presumption that arose. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal.

 Aedit Abdullah JC:
Introduction
1       Mr Koh Kim Teck (“the Plaintiff”) is suing Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch (“the Defendant”) for, among other things, losses incurred by him because of what he alleges were breaches of duty by the Defendant in advising him on investments. On paper, the Plaintiff was not the Defendant’s client. For various reasons, the Plaintiff carried out his investments and banking with the Defendant through a trust company, Smiling Sun Ltd (“SSL”). The Plaintiff filed a fairly lengthy statement of claim. The Defendant sought to strike out his claim. This was refused by the Assistant Registrar. The Defendant then appealed.
Background
2       The Defendant is the Singapore branch of a global banking institution. When the Plaintiff opened an account with the Defendant, he did so in the name of the trust company set up for this purpose, SSL. His banking and investment activities with the Defendant were also conducted using the same offshore corporate vehicle as an intermediary. Thus, the Defendant’s client – on paper at least – was SSL, and not the Plaintiff.
3       However, on the Plaintiff’s version of the facts, the Defendant’s employees rendered advice to the Plaintiff directly and took instructions from the Plaintiff. Everyone was well aware that the Plaintiff’s money funded the investments made in SSL’s name. The Plaintiff was made to believe he could rely on the advice rendered to him. In fact, it was the Defendant who advised that the banking relationship be structured in an indirect way. Moreover, the sole shareholder, sole director and registered agent of SSL at all material times were agents and/or nominees of the Defendant.
4       Unfortunately, the investments made in SSL’s name turned sour, causing heavy losses to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff now sues the Defendant on the basis that the Defendant had breached the duty of care owed to the Plaintiff 
personally
. The writ of summons was filed on 16 October 2013, and the statement of claim (“the SOC”) was filed and served on the Defendant on 4 March 2014.
5       The Defendant took the position that if anybody at all is entitled to sue, it would be 
SSL
, 
ie
, the party in a direct contractual relationship with the Defendant. The Defendant characterised the Plaintiff’s suit as an unprincipled attempt to circumvent this “carefully chosen and constructed contractual relationship”. The Defendant applied to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court in Summons No 1330 of 2014 (“Summons 1330”). Summons 1330 was filed on 14 March 2014.
6       Summons 1330 refers to all four grounds under O 18 r 19(1), 
ie
, that the SOC (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action; (b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; (c) may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action and/or (d) is otherwise an abuse of process by the Court.
7       Summons 1330 was heard by the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), who dismissed the Defendant’s application to strike out the SOC and ordered the Defendant to pay the costs fixed at S$14,000. The Defendant appealed. After hearing the parties on 23 December 2014, I reserved judgment.
The Plaintiff’s account of the facts
8       The facts pleaded by the Plaintiff in the SOC run to 116 paragraphs and 43 pages. The extent to which the Defendant joins issue with the SOC is unclear, since no defence has yet been filed. From the affidavits filed on behalf of the Defendant, it is likely that many of the allegations in the SOC will be disputed should the case go to trial.
9       Between 2002 and 2003, an employee of the Defendant, Ms Jullie Kan (“Ms Kan”), approached the Plaintiff to try to obtain his custom as a private wealth investor. The Plaintiff was not initially interested in opening a private banking account with the Defendant. This was because of (at least in part) his aversion to risk and his lack of time to properly oversee his investments or even to conduct the necessary research and due diligence. Ms Kan represented that the Defendant had specialised personnel who could advise the Defendant’s clients and attend to matters related to their investments. This failed to sway him at first. However, he was attracted to her subsequent suggestion that the Plaintiff should create a “safe haven” for his funds, and that the Defendant would advise him on the creation of a corporate trust structure. He was also told that the Defendant would set up the trust company and invest the Plaintiff’s funds according to the Plaintiff’s investment objective of wealth preservation. It was on this basis that the Plaintiff decided to engage the Defendant’s services.
10     The trust company, SSL, was incorporated on 5 September 2003 in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). At the material time, SSL’s sole director and sole shareholder were both agents and/or nominees of the Defendant, and the 
Defendant
 had full control of SSL through its agents and/or nominees. The Plaintiff was the beneficial owner of SSL’s shares. At around the same time, an account (“the Account”) was opened with the Defendant in the name of SSL. The Plaintiff was conferred a “Limited Power of Attorney” by SSL on 23 September 2003 in respect of “any transaction of an administrative nature”. The Plaintiff also claims that SSL was the Plaintiff’s nominee and/or alter ego in its dealings with the Defendant 
vis-à-vis
 the operation of the Account.
11     The Plaintiff proceeded to deposit his funds into the Account. Further, on the advice of one of the Defendant’s employees, the Plaintiff applied for a US$5m facility with the Defendant in 2006. This led to the creation of a charge over all of SSL’s assets as security for the debt. However, the Plaintiff allegedly had no knowledge of the charge. This facility was subsequently increased to US$20m in April 2008, and increased again to US$30m in September 2008 after the Defendant made a “mistake” in managing the Account, resulting in the breach of the previous limit. For convenience, I will refer to each of the facilities by its limit, 
eg
, I will refer to the facility for US$30m as the “US$30m Facility”.
12     Various investment products, including Knock-out Discount Accumulators (“KODAs”) and Dual Currency Investments (“DCIs”), were purchased on the Defendant’s advice. The Defendant knew that the Plaintiff had no familiarity with both KODAs and DCIs.
13     The SOC also details his instructions to the Defendants’ employees, as well as the various representations made to him by the Defendants’ employees with respect to the movement of monies into the Account, the purchase of the KODAs and DCIs, and the various facilities on the Account. It is sufficient to say that the advice they rendered is alleged to have involved both material omissions and untruths.
14     On 21 October 2008, the Plaintiff was advised by the Defendant to sell down and close out the Account’s then “open” DCIs and to sell certain shares. This was the first time that the Plaintiff had been warned of the risk of the DCIs. By that time the value of the portfolio had dropped precipitously. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff instructed the Defendant to wait for the DCIs to mature over the next few days instead of terminating them.
15     On 24 October 2008, the Defendant issued a fax addressed to SSL and copied to the Plaintiff, stating that, 
inter alia
, the facility to collateral ratio had reached a level where the Defendant is entitled to close out SSL’s trade positions. The notice further intimated that the Defendant would do so unless SSL deposited cash worth US$5.7m or its equivalent in the Account by 2pm on the day of the letter. The Plaintiff was caught unaware as he had not been previously informed that the US$30m Facility would allow the Defendant to “close out” the portfolio in the manner described, or even that there were pre-set limits to the facility to collateral ratio.
16     The Plaintiff was unable to provide the required additional collateral in time. The Defendant then closed out all of the Account’s open investment positions, including the KODAs and the DCIs still in place, and liquidated all the assets in the Account pursuant to the charge. The result was that the assets and/or funds held in the Account were eliminated and the Account was placed in negative balance.
Duties alleged to be owed to the Plaintiff
17     The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a 
common law
 duty to take reasonable care in the following respects:
(a)     when giving advice and/or providing information and/or in advising the Plaintiff on the management of his wealth;
(b)     to advise the Plaintiff in respect of the Account (including, 
eg
, identifying and limiting risk, and keeping him informed on key aspects of the running of the Account); and
(c)     to not act in a way inconsistent with the Defendant’s contractual duties to SSL and/or the Plaintiff under an implied term that the Defendant would give the Plaintiff a reasonable period for the provision of additional collateral.
18     The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant breached the abovementioned duty in relation to its investment advice rendered (or not rendered) to the Plaintiff, the running of the Account, and in failing to provide a reasonable period for the provision of additional collateral prior to the close out.
19     The Plaintiff therefore claims for the loss of US$26m (which is the amount the Plaintiff claims he credited into the Account from the date which Account was open to about 2009) and/or damages to be assessed.
The law on striking out
20     Pleadings should only be struck out in plain and obvious cases, not requiring detailed and lengthy examination. This is expressed in the Court of Appeal’s decision in 
Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others
 
[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649
 (“
Gabriel Peter
”) at [18]:
18     In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in 
Hubbuck & Sons, Limited v Wilkinson, Heywood & Clark, Limited
 
[1899] 1 QB 86
 at 91. It should not be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.
21     Further, “the claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out” (
Singapore Civil Procedure
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 2013) (“
Singapore Civil Procedure
”) at para 18/19/6; accepted in 
Chan Kin Foo v City Developments Ltd
 
[2013] 2 SLR 895
 at [47]).
22     Under O 18 r 19(1)(
a
), a reasonable cause of action is one “which has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered” and “the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out” (
Gabriel Peter
 at [21]). It is essentially a question of law, and the pleaded facts are presumed to be true in favour of the claimant (
Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd
 
[1991] 1 SLR(R) 844
 at [29]).
23     When an action is plainly or obviously unsustainable, the court may strike out the claim for being “frivolous or vexatious” under O 18 r 19(1)(
b
) of the ROC, or in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction (see 
The “Bunga Melati 5”
 
[2012] 4 SLR 546
 at [32] and [33]). A claim can be either legally or factually unsustainable, as explained in 
The “Bunga Melati 5”
 at [39] as follows:
(a)     
legally unsustainable
: if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”; or
(b)     
factually unsustainable
: if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, [for example, if it is] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based”.
24     Finally, a claim is an abuse of process if the court’s process is not used 
bona fide
 and properly (
Gabriel Peter
 at [22]).
The AR’s decision
25     Before the AR, the Defendant raised the following arguments:
(a)     First, the Plaintiff’s claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The Plaintiff has no standing to pursue claims in relation to the Account, which is in SSL’s name. It was the Plaintiff who chose to use SSL to establish the banking relationship. Further, the Plaintiff’s claim for losses merely mirror SSL’s losses in the Account, and is not recoverable as a matter of BVI law, being the law of the place of SSL’s incorporation.
(b)     Secondly, the Plaintiff’s claim is an attempt to circumvent the contractual framework governing SSL’s banking relationship with the Defendant and is thus frivolous and/or vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of process.
26     The AR characterised the issues before him as follows:
(a)     The first issue: Whether the Plaintiff’s case discloses no reasonable cause of action as, even in the pleaded circumstances, the Defendant does not owe any duty of care to the Plaintiff.
(b)     The second issue: Whether the Plaintiff’s case is doomed to fail for violating the rule against reflective loss.
(c)     The third issue: Whether the Plaintiff’s action is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process for being contrary to the relevant contractual documentation.
27     With respect to the first issue, the AR applied the test set out in 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 (“
Spandeck
”). To begin, he determined that if the Defendant had been negligent in managing the funds entrusted to it, it was plainly foreseeable that the Plaintiff would ultimately be harmed.
28     The first criterion of proximity was also satisfied as there was causal proximity between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the sense that there was a sufficiently close causal connection between the Plaintiff’s loss and any negligence by the Defendant. The parties were clear that the various transactions, including the incorporation of SSL, were to be carried out for the sole purpose of investing the Plaintiff’s personal funds. The Defendant looked to the Plaintiff for instructions, not SSL. The Plaintiff had hardly anything to do with SSL. In essence, the total disregard for the views of SSL showed that both parties were quite aware of the reality that it was ultimately the Plaintiff’s money that was at stake.
29     As for whether there are any policy considerations that would militate against the imposition of a duty of care, the AR answered in the negative. While the parties had interposed a trust between them, it only meant they had chosen that there would be no contractual or fiduciary duties owed to each other. The parties did not agree that they would not owe each other any duty of care in negligence. On the whole, it was not impossible to find that the Defendant owes the Plaintiff a duty of care.
30     On the second issue, the AR noted that there was a dispute over whether Singapore or BVI law governs the issue. He declined to determine it. Whether or not Singapore or BVI law applied, it would not be appropriate to terminate the Plaintiff’s action on this ground. While it was clear from the expert evidence before him that the rule against reflective loss was good law in BVI, it was unclear whether certain exceptions to the rule will be accepted or rejected by the BVI court. If Singapore law applied, then the possibility of the Plaintiff’s case succeeding increased, based on the Singapore Court of Appeal judgment in 
Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 597
.
31     On the third issue, the AR found that the contractual documentation was relevant at trial for determining whether any duty of care could be founded. However, it did not mean that the Plaintiff’s claim in negligence was 
obviously unsustainable
 as the contractual documentation did not disclose any clear and specific intention to exclude a common law duty of care. It was at best ambiguous. He relied on the following grounds:
(a)     firstly, there was no documentation between the Plaintiff and the Defendant (save for one exception), and the terms relied on by the Defendant were agreed between the Defendant and SSL;
(b)     secondly, even if the terms bound the Plaintiff in spite of him not being party to the documentation, there was the question of whether the terms will pass muster under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”); and
(c)     thirdly, the exact implications of the terms relied upon were not clearly fatal to the Plaintiff’s case. Even the clause relied on in the Limited Power of Attorney, which was the only document signed by the Plaintiff in his personal capacity, only indicated that the Defendant took no responsibility towards SSL for the investment decisions made by the Plaintiff as attorney, without saying anything about responsibilities owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff 
personally
.
32     For the above reasons, the AR declined, in his words, to “prematurely abort the action”. Accordingly, he dismissed the application and ordered that the Defendant pay costs of S$14,000.
Summary of the parties’ submissions on appeal
33     The Defendant has taken a more focused approach on appeal. It is not pursuing its argument below that the Plaintiff’s claim offends the rule against reflective loss. Instead, it submits as follows:
(a)     first, the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action as the Plaintiff was in effect trying to “reverse pierce” SSL’s corporate veil; and
(b)     second, the Plaintiff’s claims are frivolous and/or vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of process as they are nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the contractual framework between SSL and the Defendant.
34     In reply, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant’s reliance on the “reverse piercing” issue is premised on a deliberate misstatement of the gravamen of the Plaintiff’s position in the suit, and, in any event, the authorities the Defendant relies on do not meet the threshold of “impossibility” required for such an application.
My decision
Whether the Plaintiff’s claims disclose no reasonable cause of action
Whether the Plaintiff has pleaded a separate and independent duty owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff
35     The Defendant’s counsel, Mr Alvin Yeo SC (“Mr Yeo”), argues that the Plaintiff did not plead that the Defendant owed it a duty separate and independent from that owed to SSL. Rather, all that is pleaded in the SOC is a bare assertion that SSL is the Plaintiff’s 
alter ego
. There is no basis for that other than his assertion that he owns and controls SSL. In other words, the only case the SOC discloses is that the Plaintiff, not SSL, was the real “customer” of the Defendant; thus, the Plaintiff is seeking to displace SSL 
entirely
 as the customer of the Account by asking the Court to “reverse pierce” SSL’s corporate veil. The Defendant submits that this fact was not appreciated by the AR.
36     On a plain reading of the SOC as a whole, I find that it does disclose the averment that the Defendant owes the Plaintiff a separate and independent duty. In my view, the Defendant’s characterisation of the Plaintiff’s case is a strained interpretation of the SOC. For completeness, I note that the Plaintiff submits that the personal claim is its primary claim in the suit, and the 
alter ego
 plea is merely an alternative. While it is not entirely clear from the SOC which claim is the primary one, this does not mean that the Plaintiff has failed to plead the material facts necessary to establish a separate duty of care in tort.
37     To support its contention that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty of care (as set out at [17] above), the Plaintiff relies on paras 88 to 95 of the SOC, in particular, para 88 which I set out in full as follows:
The Defendant was fully aware that although the Account was in the name of SSL, the Plaintiff:
a.    Was the 
ultimate beneficial owner
 and/or alter ego of SSL;
b.    relied entirely on the investment advice and expert opinion of the Defendant to make the investment decisions and/or make investment decisions on behalf of SSL; and
c.    was the person who ultimately gained or made loss from such decisions.
[emphasis added in bold]
38     Para 14 of the SOC also states:
At all material times, SSL was the 
nominee
 and/or alter ego of the Plaintiff in its dealings with the Defendant 
vis a vis
 the operation of the Account. [emphasis added in bold]
39     As the Plaintiff argues, the words “ultimate beneficial owner” and “nominee” do not necessarily import connotations of veil piercing. I will also add that a plain reading of para 88b of the SOC indicates that what is asserted is that the Defendant owes a duty 
directly
 to the Plaintiff as it was the Plaintiff 
himself
 who relied on the Defendant’s investment advice.
40     Moreover, the Plaintiff’s pleaded grounds for the alleged duty of care include assertions that the Defendant knew of the Plaintiff’s cautious investment approach, and that the Defendant had undertaken to provide advice and/or information to enable the Plaintiff to make informed decisions. By undertaking these tasks, the Defendant had assumed responsibility to take reasonable care to ensure that its advice was suitable and/or that the information was sufficient for its purpose.
41     These facts relate to the Defendant’s actions towards 
the Plaintiff
 and also fit with the overall tenor of the SOC, which primarily details the interactions between the Plaintiff 
personally
 and the Defendant’s employees. Indeed, but for the alternative “
alter ego
” plea in paras 14 and 88(a), there is nothing in the SOC that is inconsistent with a plea of a duty of care that is 
personal
 to the Plaintiff.
42     For completeness, I will also add that it is trite that pleadings must contain only material facts (subject to certain exceptions). Material facts are facts which are necessary to establish a cause of action or defence, as well as facts which a party is entitled to prove at trial. The plaintiff is not required to plead the legal result or consequences of the facts stated in his pleading; this is a matter for the court to decide. Of course, the facts which form the basis for that conclusion must be pleaded. With respect to negligence, I refer to Jeffrey Pinsler SC’s views in his book, 
Principles of Civil Procedure
 (Academy Publishing, 2013), at para 15.016:
As it is only material facts which may be stated in the pleading, the advocate must avoid setting down his legal arguments or theories of the law. The whole purpose of the pleading process is to state the facts on which each party relies so that the court may arrive at the appropriate legal conclusion. The legal result of the facts is entirely a matter for the court. For example, it is unnecessary for the plaintiff in a negligence action to plead the legal elements of the cause of action. 
All he has to do is set out the circumstances in which the duty arose, the facts which constitute the breach of duty, and the facts which establish the damage resulting from the breach.
 As the legal conclusion is a matter for the court to determine, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to plead the legal consequences of the facts stated in his pleading. …
[emphasis added]
43     In the present case, therefore, the Plaintiff need only state the material facts which give rise to the existence of a duty, breach and damage. As I have noted above, he has done so.
Whether it is impossible for a duty of care to arise 
44     The question then is whether it is 
possible
 for the pleaded facts to establish that a separate and independent duty of care in tort was owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff in respect of the Account.
45     I have set out at some length the pleaded facts, but I shall reiterate the key points. The Defendant’s employee had courted the Plaintiff’s personal custom. The Plaintiff had made known that he had no time to monitor any investments or to conduct the necessary research or due diligence. The Defendant (a major and reputable bank) had represented to the Plaintiff that it was fully capable of managing his investments and providing 
him
 with advice. With respect to the various investments, the Defendant also knew that the Plaintiff would be funding the account and would be looking to the Defendant for advice and relying on the same. The Defendant advised the Plaintiff to structure the banking relationship in this indirect manner, and the key personnel of SSL were nominated and appointed by the Defendant.
46     It is evident that the threshold question of foreseeability in 
Spandeck
 is easily satisfied, for the reasons given by the AR (at [27] above).
47     The next question is whether it is possible to find that the Plaintiff and Defendant were in a sufficiently proximate relationship to found a 
prima facie
 duty of care. The Court of Appeal has accepted what has been termed the “
Hedley Byrne
 principle” (after the seminal House of Lords decision of 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
), which establishes that the assumption of responsibility can be the basis of a sufficiently proximate relationship so as to give rise to a duty of care in the tort of negligence. For the 
Hedley Byrne
 principle to apply, it must be shown that there has been “an assumption of responsibility by the tortfeasor to 
take care
 in the giving of information or advice or the performance of a service, and reliance by the plaintiff on such care being taken”. In this respect, see the Court of Appeal decision in 
Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG
 
[2011] 4 SLR 559
 at [33] to [35] and [39], which was affirmed in 
Anwar Patrick Adrian and another v Ng Chong & Hue LLC and another
 
[2014] 3 SLR 761
 (“
Anwar Patrick Adrian
”) at [69] to [71].
48     In analysing this issue, an important question is whether or not the underlying contractual arrangements evince the intention to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care. The following passage in 
Animal Concerns Research & Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee
 
[2011] 2 SLR 146
 (“
Tan Boon Kwee
”) at [71] is instructive:
71     The mere fact that there is a pre-existing contractual relationship or backdrop between the parties should not, in itself, be sufficient to exclude a duty of care on one of them to avoid causing pure economic loss to the other (the situation is 
a fortiori
 where, as here, there is in fact 
no
 contractual relationship between the parties, but merely a contractual backdrop, in the sense that each party was in a separate contractual relationship with a third party, 
viz
, A.n.A). The true principle, in determining whether or not any contractual arrangement has this effect, should be whether or not the parties structured their contracts intending thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see the House of Lords decision of 
Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd
 
[1995] 2 AC 145
 at 193-194).
49     It is also perfectly possible for one party to owe a duty of care to another even if the parties have 
deliberately
 decided 
not
 to be in a direct contractual relationship, see, 
eg
, the English Court of Appeal case of 
Riyad Bank & Ors v Ahli United Bank (UK) plc
 [2006] 1 CLC 1007 (“
Riyad Bank
”). A specific decision not to have any contractual relationship between the parties is “a neutral consideration until one knows what the reason for that decision was” (
Riyad Bank
 at [28], 
per
 Longmore LJ).
50     On the other hand, in arguing that it is not possible for a duty of care to arise on the presently pleaded facts, the Defendant relies heavily on the English High Court case of 
Diamantis Diamantides v JP Morgan Chase Bank & Others
 [2005] EWHC 263 (“
Diamantis (HC)
”), which result was affirmed by the English Court of Appeal in 
Diamantis Diamantides v JP Morgan Chase Bank and others
 [2005] EWCA Civ 1612 (“
Diamantis (CA)
”).
51     In 
Diamantis
, the plaintiff had, through two Liberian companies (first Ursa Navigation Inc (“Ursa”) and then Pollux Holding Limited (“Pollux”)), purchased investments from JP Morgan Chase Bank (“Chase”). Both companies were wholly owned and controlled by the plaintiff. Chase had courted the plaintiff as its client. Chase had provided him advice and told him that he was a very important client of the bank. In that case, it was not pleaded that the plaintiff opened any accounts with Chase in his personal capacity or purchased any investments from Chase. On the contrary, it was pleaded that the accounts were opened and maintained by the companies and that investments were purchased by the companies.
52     The claim was founded on the plaintiff being “a customer in his personal capacity and that everyone concerned understood and agreed that he was the customer or client” of Chase (
Diamantis (HC)
 at [12]). The plaintiff claimed that there was an “advisory relationship” between Chase and the plaintiff, whereas there was a “transactional relationship” between Chase and Pollux.
53     Morison J, at the English High Court, struck out the plaintiff’s claim. I cite below the key portion of his reasoning (
Diamantis (HC)
 at [27] and [28]):
… The question is whether Mr Diamantides has a claim at all. That depends upon a credible case being advanced that Chase and he were in a contractual relationship: banker and customer. The facts pleaded show clearly that at all times Pollux was the customer and Mr Diamantides, the principal behind the company and sole shareholder and controller was the voice for and asset provider to the company. Had Mr Diamantides wanted to trade in his own name and had, which I doubt, the Bank been willing to accept him as a private investor for trading in risky emerging market instruments, then he would have bought and sold instruments in his own name. Instead, and possibly necessarily, the Bank dealt with all transactions for and on behalf of the company, Pollux. Because Pollux is a company which carried on the business of investing for its sole shareholder's benefit, it did not have the protection afforded by the statutory scheme then in force to a ‘private investor’. …
28. I accept Mr Hapgood QC’s submissions. In particular I think he rightly submitted this is an unprincipled attempt by an individual, who chose to invest through a corporate vehicle, to pierce the veil of his own company. That is not in law permissible: see Trustor AB v Smallbone 
[2001] 1 WLR 1177
. The beginning and end of this case is that Pollux was the customer; Mr Diamantides was not. As Pollux’s voice, the advice was given to him on behalf of Pollux and he caused Pollux to act on it. There is no commercial sense in a split between advisory and transactional activities. It is, frankly, meaningless and would make the regulatory regime impossible. …
54     It is apparent that it was important to Morison J that Chase was unlikely to have been willing to deal with the plaintiff directly in the first place. Also relevant to his decision was his view that the plaintiff was trying to avoid the consequences of Pollux not being a private investor, which would make nonsense of the regulatory regime then in force, an undoubtedly important policy consideration (see also 
Diamantis (HC)
 at [16]).
55     On appeal, the English Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal on a different point. It was found that the plaintiff could not succeed as the pleaded facts were not capable of supporting his pleaded case that the advisory duties were owed to him alone, while the transactional obligations were owed exclusively to Pollux; such an unusual situation could only arise “as a result of special arrangements between the personal client, the investment manager and the company defining the scope of the relationships between them” (
Diamantis (CA)
 at [41] and [43]).
56     It should be emphasised that after considering the cases of 
Johnson v Gore Wood & Co
 [1999] BCC 474 and 
Conway v Ratiu and others
 [2005] All ER (D) 103 (Nov), Moore-Bick LJ, who delivered the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated that he would have been 
inclined to agree
 with the submission that it is perfectly possible for the bank to owe fiduciary duties to the plaintiff, from whom it received its instructions and whom it knew to be the person behind Ursa and Pollux, if it had gone 
no further than that
 (
Diamantis (CA)
 at [36]). The Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold the striking out of the plaintiff’s claim below was therefore based on the unique case advanced by the plaintiff.
57     It is clear to me that, notwithstanding certain factual similarities, the 
Diamantis
 cases are distinguishable. Indeed, Moore-Bick LJ’s remarks in 
Diamantis (CA)
 at [36] support the Plaintiff’s case.
58     Thus, at this stage, I do not think it is 
impossible
 to find that there had been an assumption of responsibility by the Defendant to take care 
vis-à-vis
 the Plaintiff 
simply
 because the Account was opened in SSL’s name instead.
59     Additionally, I also agree with the AR for the reasons he stated that there is certainly sufficient 
causal
 proximity in this regard (see [28] above).
60     That leaves the final question of whether there are any policy considerations that negate the imposition of a duty of care. I find that there are none. The AR approached the issue of the contractual matrix as a policy consideration, while in the present case I have considered it under the first limb of the 
Spandeck
 test. As noted in 
Tan Boon Kwee
 at [66] to [69], the contractual matrix may, depending on the facts, be treated as a proximity factor or a policy consideration. Nevertheless, given the overlap between the two limbs of the 
Spandeck
 test, the result will often be the same. In any event, as is apparent, I concur with the AR’s conclusion. As the AR notes, quite rightly, nothing in the facts pleaded indicates that the parties did not intend to owe the other a duty of care in negligence.
Whether it is impossible for the alter ego averment to succeed
61     For completeness, I will briefly address whether it is appropriate to strike out the “
alter ego
” averment on the argument that it is an impermissible act of “reverse piercing”. The difference between a typical case where the court is asked to pierce the corporate veil of a company, and a case of “reverse piercing”, is that in the latter, it is not a third party who is seeking to hold a shareholder or controller of the company liable for the company’s liabilities. Rather, the shareholder 
himself
 asks the court to disregard the separate legal personality of the company, so as to enable him to pursue claims against a third party that had dealt with the company. The defendant argues, quite forcefully, that it requires even 
more
 exceptional circumstances before a court will permit a shareholder to disregard the company’s separate legal personality in order to pursue his claims personally. To allow a shareholder to deny the existence of incorporation as and when he chooses would undermine the separate legal personality doctrine and open the floodgates.
62     In this regard, the defendant refers to Jeff H Y Chan, “Should ‘reverse piercing’ of the corporate veil be introduced into English law?” (2014) Comp Law 35(6) Comp Law 163 (“Jeff Chan”). As argued in Jeff Chan, corporations are expected to “take the rough with the smooth”. Owners of corporations should not be allowed to “manipulate the legal status of their corporation to suit their current needs, without due respect to the legal order of a corporation form” (Jeff Chan at p 168). Yet, various arguments in favour of allowing reverse piercing are also noted in Jeff Chan at p 167. The author accepts that the position is unsettled in English law (at p 164). Further, as the Defendant admits, there does not appear to have been any “reverse piercing” cases brought before the Singapore courts to date.
63     It is inappropriate to strike out an action that contains a point of law which requires serious argument. However, if the court is satisfied that the issue of law is unarguable and unsustainable, it may proceed to determine that question (see 
Singapore Civil Procedure
 at para 18/19/6). In my view, the issue of “reverse piercing” does require serious argument, and is certainly not 
unarguable
 and 
unsustainable
. This is an issue better resolved at another forum. Thus, I am also not inclined to strike out the 
alter ego
 averment on the basis that it is an impermissible attempt at “reverse piercing” the corporate veil.
64     For the above reasons, I find that it is inappropriate to strike out the SOC on this ground.
Whether the Plaintiff’s claims are frivolous or vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of process
65     For the argument that the Plaintiff’s claims are frivolous or vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of process, the Defendant refers to various contractual terms that were concluded between the Defendant and SSL in respect of the Account, including:
(a)     the account opening terms such as the 2003 Account Opening Conditions and the 2003 Risk Disclosure Statement;
(b)     the Limited Power of Attorney;
(c)     confirmation letters in respect of SSL’s investments in the KODAs (“the KODA Confirmation Letters”); and
(d)     the facility letter for the US$30m Facility.
66     It is not necessary to set out the various provisions at length. It is sufficient to state that, according to the Defendant, the effect of the abovementioned documentation is that:
(a)     the Defendant and SSL have expressly agreed that the Defendant would not be SSL’s financial adviser;
(b)     the Defendant owes no duty to advise SSL and bears no responsibility to SSL in respect of any investments conducted through the Account;
(c)     SSL would be responsible for any transactions it ultimately chooses to enter into and would not be relying on any advice from the Defendant or its officers; and
(d)     SSL was required to provide any additional collateral required by the Defendant within such period specified by the Defendant, which may be less than 24 hours.
67     Thus, the Defendant submits that the duty of care allegedly owed to the Plaintiff is completely inconsistent with the contractual framework. The Plaintiff has “deliberately constructed an artificial case so as to circumvent the contractual framework governing the Account”.
68     I have already applied the 
Spandeck
 test to the pleaded facts, above. The question here is whether the evidence of the contractual framework described at [66] above affects the analysis, such that the Plaintiff’s claim is obviously unsustainable or an abuse of process. Undoubtedly, the existence of an express disclaimer of responsibility is relevant in determining the existence and scope of any duty of care. As I noted at [60] above, this might be considered under either the first or the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test.
69     In my view, striking out the SOC on this ground is not appropriate for a number of reasons.
70     Firstly, the interpretation of some of the terms the Defendant relies in support of its case is hotly contested even at this stage. The proper construction of the various contractual terms relied upon may involve findings of fact which can only be resolved at trial. This was a fact rightly noted by the AR. Indeed, Mr Yeo submits that he is not asking the court to decide whether the clauses provide a complete defence to any claim.
71     Secondly, even if I accept the Defendant’s interpretation of these clauses, there is the question of whether these clauses are even 
valid
 and 
binding
 on SSL in the first place. Some of the clauses may be properly characterised as non-reliance or non-representation clauses. Such “basis clauses”, so called because they are said to merely define the 
basis
 of the relationship of the parties to the contract, may not necessarily prevent a duty of care from arising. In 
Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen and another appeal
 
[2013] 4 SLR 886
 at [60] to [67], the Court of Appeal took the view (albeit 
obiter
) that if the substantive effect of such “basis clauses” is to exclude or restrict the imposition of a duty of a care in law, they will have to satisfy the requirement of the test of reasonableness under the UCTA. In the circumstances of the present case, it is not impossible that some or all of these clauses may fall within the scope of the UCTA and be found to be unreasonable. If it turns out that the contractual terms are invalid, it seems to me that it will only be in very unusual circumstances that an alleged duty of care will be negated or circumscribed 
simply
 for being inconsistent with those invalid contractual terms. Thus, the AR was quite right to take this issue into account.
72     Even 
if
 these terms are valid and binding on 
SSL
, there is also the question of what effect, if any, they may have 
vis-à-vis
 the 
Plaintiff
. Indeed, the Plaintiff asserts that he never received a copy of the 2003 Account Opening Conditions (Mr Koh Kim Teck’s first affidavit, para 31) or the 2003 Risk Disclosure Statement (Mr Koh Kim Teck’s first affidavit, para 38). The Plaintiff also states that the KODA Confirmation Letters were only signed by him on SSL’s behalf 
after
 each individual trade was done. He had not read the said letters because, 
inter alia
, the Defendant’s representatives had told him there was no need for him to go through the terms after their explanations of the KODAs (Mr Koh Kim Teck’s first affidavit, paras 39 to 42). There is, at the very least, a question to be resolved as to the Plaintiff’s knowledge of the terms at the material time.
73     I note the AR’s view that the documentation does not bind the Plaintiff, save for the Limited Power of Attorney, since he is not personally a party to the contracts entered into between SSL and the Defendant. This assumes that SSL and the Plaintiff are separate legal persons. To the extent that the Plaintiff’s claim does not rely on the 
alter ego
 plea, this distinction between SSL and the Plaintiff is justifiable. However, in the Plaintiff’s alternative plea that SSL is his 
alter ego
, it is precisely this consequence of incorporation that is being disclaimed. Can a claimant, in the same breath, ask the court to lower the corporate veil in tort and then insist on the doctrine of separate legal personality in contract, with regard to what is substantially the same transaction? It seems to me that it will only be in highly unusual circumstances that a court will disregard the corporate form only for 
part
 of its dealings with the same party. To be fair to the Plaintiff, he does not draw this clear line between himself and SSL in his written submissions on appeal. In any event, the legal effect of these terms remains unclear.
74     In summary, as far as the alleged advisory duties are concerned, the Plaintiff’s claim is not obviously unsustainable. This must be so, considering that there are numerous issues of fact and law that need to be resolved before the court can say for certain what exactly was agreed between SSL and the Defendant, and the extent that these terms are enforceable in law against SSL (or the Plaintiff). Until then, it is impossible to say for certain what impact the contractual framework has on any duty of care owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.
75     As for the Defendant’s alleged duty not to act in a way inconsistent with an implied term that the Defendant would give the Plaintiff a reasonable period for the provision of additional collateral, this turns on whether it is 
possible
 that such a term might be implied. Similarly, I am unable to say, at this stage, that it is 
not
 possible.
76     I therefore dismiss the appeal on this ground as well.
Conclusion
77     In summary, the proper resolution of the case throws up a number of factual and legal issues that cannot be properly resolved at this stage. The Plaintiff’s claim cannot be said to disclose no reasonable cause of action or be frivolous, or vexatious, or an abuse of the process of the court. For the reasons stated, I dismiss the appeal. I will hear the parties on costs.",2015-02-26 00:00:00,SG High Court

[LawNet Editorial Note: This was an appeal from the decisions of the High Court in 
[2013] SGHC 164
 and 
[2013] SGHC 222
.]
24 February 2016
 Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):
Introduction
1       This was an appeal by an offender (“the Appellant”) against his conviction and sentence of death on two charges of trafficking in diamorphine under s 5(1)(
a
) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). It was heard together with his application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal.
2       The main issue was whether there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that the Appellant knew the nature of the drugs which were in his possession. The appeal also raised a subsidiary question as to the admissibility of the cautioned statements and long statements purportedly given by the Appellant under, respectively, s 122(6) and s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), that being the version of the Criminal Procedure Code which was in force at the time of the Appellant’s arrest.
3       The Appellant’s principal contention on appeal, as in the court below, was that he had been given the drugs in question by a friend known as “Latif” for safekeeping. He claimed that he had no knowledge that what he was safekeeping for Latif was in fact drugs, much less knowledge of the nature of those drugs.
4       After hearing the parties’ arguments, we dismissed both the application for leave to adduce further evidence and the appeal. These are our reasons.
The facts
The Appellant is arrested with drugs in his car
5       On 6 July 2010 at around 3.17pm, the Appellant was driving on a slip road from Boon Lay Way onto Jurong Town Hall Road when officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) stopped and arrested him. The Appellant and his car were brought to a nearby open-air car park, where the car was searched. A red tote bag (“G1”) was recovered from under the passenger seat of the car. G1 contained a packet of brown granular substance wrapped in newspaper.
[note: 1]
 This packet (also referred to hereafter as “the wrapped package in G1” where appropriate to the context) was later found, upon analysis by the Health Sciences Authority (“the HSA”), to contain 26.13g of diamorphine, and formed the subject of the first charge against the Appellant.
6       While the Appellant and the CNB officers were at the car park, SSgt Mohd Hafiz Jumali was instructed to record a statement from the Appellant. SSgt Hafiz claimed that he asked the Appellant three questions about the contents of G1 – namely, “What is this?”, “Who does it belong to?” and “What are these for?” – all of which questions, the Appellant refused to answer.
[note: 2]
 SSgt Hafiz recorded the Appellant’s refusal to respond to his questions in his pocket book.
[note: 3]
 SSgt Hafiz’s pocket book entry was countersigned by one of his colleagues as a witness.
[note: 4]
 The Appellant, on the other hand, claimed that he was asked only one question (
viz
, “What is this?”), to which he replied that he did not know.
[note: 5]
 The Appellant also said that his response made SSgt Hafiz upset, and that the latter told him that he (SSgt Hafiz) could always “ask another officer to sign” if the Appellant did not admit to the offence.
[note: 6]
The Appellant’s flat is searched and drugs are found in his bedroom
7       The CNB officers thereafter escorted the Appellant to the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Block 325 Bukit Batok Street 33, #06-03 (“the Flat”) where he lived, arriving there at about 4.15pm. The Appellant’s mother (“Mdm Bibah”), who owned the Flat and with whom the Appellant lived, was in the Flat at that time. The CNB officers searched the Flat, including the Appellant’s bedroom. The bedroom door was locked when the CNB officers first arrived, but the CNB officers managed to unlock it with a key found on the Appellant.
[note: 7]
8       A red plastic bag (“A1”)
[note: 8]
 and a black plastic bag with prints (“A2”)
[note: 9]
 were recovered from the Appellant’s bedroom. A1 contained a packet of brown granular substance wrapped in newspaper, two sachets of crystalline substance and multiple packets of smaller unused Ziploc sachets.
[note: 10]
 A2 contained two packets of brown granular substance which were wrapped in two further layers of plastic bags.
[note: 11]
 The contents of A1 and A2, which were later found, upon analysis by the HSA, to contain 40.64g of diamorphine, formed the subject of the second charge against the Appellant. Traces of the Appellant’s DNA were also found on both the interior and the exterior surfaces of A1.
9       There was a dispute over the precise location where A1 and A2 were found. The Prosecution’s witnesses gave evidence
[note: 12]
 that A1 and A2 were found concealed, but as two separate bags, in a cavity in a cupboard in the Appellant’s bedroom.
[note: 13]
 That cavity could only be accessed when a drawer in the cupboard was removed in its entirety. In contrast, the Appellant testified that A1 was placed 
inside
 A2, and that A2 (with A1 inside) was placed in a drawer in the aforesaid cupboard, which was where the two bags found.
[note: 14]
10     Other items recovered from the Appellant’s bedroom included a metal spoon, a digital pocket weighing scale, a packet of rubber bands and a brown envelope with numbers scribbled on it.
[note: 15]
 The spoon and the weighing scale were stained with traces of diamorphine.
[note: 16]
 The Appellant claimed that both the spoon and the weighing scale were found in A2, together with the rest of the drugs. In addition, a large amount of cash totalling more than $70,000 was recovered from another cupboard (different from the one mentioned at [9] above) in the bedroom.
[note: 17]
11     Mdm Bibah’s bank passbook was also seized during the search of the Flat. There was approximately $100,000 standing to the credit of Mdm Bibah in her bank account.
12     At the Flat, SSgt Hafiz, who had earlier been instructed to record a statement from the Appellant (see [6] above), was instructed to record a second statement from the Appellant. He did so while he was alone with the Appellant in the latter’s bedroom. SSgt Hafiz claimed that he asked the Appellant three questions about the contents of A1 and A2 – namely, “What is this?”, “To whom does it belongs [
sic
] to?” and “What do you … intend to do with these two big packets?” – to which the Appellant refused to respond.
[note: 18]
 SSgt Hafiz recorded this in his pocket book, and his entry was countersigned by his colleague as a witness.
[note: 19]
 The Appellant, on the other hand, claimed that SSgt Hafiz asked him only one question (
viz
, “What is this?”), to which he replied, “I don’t know”.
[note: 20]
13     After the Flat was searched, the CNB officers brought the Appellant to the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint (“Woodlands Checkpoint”), where further searches were carried out on the Appellant’s vehicle. The Appellant was thereafter brought back to the CNB headquarters, where he was given food at around midnight.
The Appellant’s cautioned statements are recorded
14     On 7 July 2010 at 2.51am, ASP Aaron Tang recorded two cautioned statements from the Appellant in respect of each of the charges against him. The Appellant elected to speak in Malay, and the statements were recorded in the presence of Mdm Sophia Binte Sufri, who acted as the Malay interpreter. Only the Appellant, ASP Tang and Mdm Sophia were present at the recording of the cautioned statements. The recording of both cautioned statements concluded at about 3.40am. The pre- and post-statement medical examinations of the Appellant were conducted at Alexandra Hospital. Apart from superficial abrasions on the left side of the Appellant’s forehead, there were no other significant clinical findings.
[note: 21]
15     Both of the Appellant’s cautioned statements were very brief, but admitted guilt. The first of the two cautioned statements read:
[note: 22]
My family does not know about my activities. My family is not involved in this matter[.] I hope that my wife in Indonesia can be allowed into Singapore to see me. That’s all.
The second statement read:
[note: 23]
I am sorry. I don’t change. I have caused problems to everyone especially my family and my wife. Now, I cannot look after her. I am sorry to her and my family. That’s all.
16     ASP Tang’s evidence was that the recording of the cautioned statements was routine and took place in accordance with the stipulated procedure.
[note: 24]
 Before those statements were recorded, the charges were interpreted and explained to the Appellant, who indicated that he understood the nature of the charges and the sentence which would follow (
viz
, the death sentence) if he was convicted. ASP Tang also said that he recorded both cautioned statements early in the morning because he wanted to give the Appellant early notice of the charges against him. ASP Tang said that this was his usual practice.
[note: 25]
17     The Appellant, on the other hand, disputed the admissibility of his cautioned statements. He asserted that he had not given the statements voluntarily in that: (a) they had been procured by threats, inducement or promises from ASP Tang; (b) they had been recorded under oppressive conditions; and (c) their contents had been fabricated. In any case, the Appellant claimed, the statements had either been inaccurately interpreted by Mdm Sophia or not interpreted at all. We examine in greater detail below (at [61]–[63]) these contentions by the Appellant.
The Appellant’s long statements are recorded
18     ASP Tang also recorded three long statements by the Appellant, one on each of the three days after 7 July 2010. The first long statement was recorded on 8 July 2010 between 9.20am and 11.30am; the second, on 9 July 2010 between 3.40pm and 5.45pm; and the third, on 10 July 2010 between 10.35am and 11.35am. As in the case of the recording of the Appellant’s cautioned statements, only the Appellant, ASP Tang and Mdm Sophia were present at each of the three sessions.
19     In the three long statements,
[note: 26]
 the Appellant admitted that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 belonged to him, and that he knew they contained heroin. He admitted that he had purchased heroin in large quantities and had repacked it into smaller packets, which he would then sell for profit. That was the reason why he had a weighing scale and smaller Ziploc sachets in his bedroom. At the time of his arrest on the afternoon of 6 July 2010, the Appellant had been on his way home from Joo Koon Circle after receiving a quantity of heroin which he had purchased from Latif.
20     The long statements further stated that the money in the Appellant’s bedroom belonged to him; approximately half of it was from his savings, and the other half came from selling drugs. The statements also revealed that the brown envelope found in the Appellant’s bedroom contained his notations relating to drug purchases.
21     ASP Tang claimed that he recorded each of the long statements in accordance with the proper procedure.
[note: 27]
 At each session, he asked the Appellant questions, which were interpreted to the latter by Mdm Sophia. The Appellant’s responses were translated to ASP Tang, who recorded them in prose. ASP Tang then printed out each statement, and had Mdm Sophia read and interpret it to the Appellant. ASP Tang gave the Appellant an opportunity to amend each statement (which the latter in fact did for the first long statement),
[note: 28]
 and thereafter asked him to sign it.
22     The Appellant disputed the admissibility of his three long statements. The grounds of his challenge were, however, unclear. His case on the inadmissibility of these statements included allegations of threats, as well as allegations that ASP Tang and Mdm Sophia had fabricated the statements in their entirety without consulting him at all.
[note: 29]
 As Mdm Sophia passed away before the case came to trial,
[note: 30]
 the admissibility of the Appellant’s cautioned statements and long statements came down to a contest between ASP Tang’s and the Appellant’s evidence on the manner and the circumstances in which the statements were recorded.
The Appellant’s evidence at the trial as to how he came to be in possession of the drugs
23     The contents of the Appellant’s three long statements stood in stark contrast to his evidence at the trial. In his oral evidence at the trial, the Appellant said that he did not know that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs. He was given those three items by Latif for safekeeping on the day of his arrest (
ie
, 6 July 2010), and was supposed to return them to Latif that evening. He did not check what was in them and therefore did not know that they contained drugs.
24     According to the Appellant’s oral evidence, he became acquainted with Latif when they met in Johor in November or December 2009.
[note: 31]
 Both of them were then purchasing supplies for their respective upholstery companies.
[note: 32]
 Between then and 6 July 2010, they met approximately six to seven times and became good friends.
[note: 33]
25     The Appellant testified that at about 7.00am on the morning of 6 July 2010, Latif called him and asked him to meet at the void deck of the HDB block where he (the Appellant) lived.
[note: 34]
 Upon the Appellant’s inquiry as to what the meeting was for, Latif simply said that it was important. The Appellant said that it did not occur to him to probe further. At the meeting at the void deck, Latif handed the Appellant a black plastic bag; that black plastic bag was A2. The Appellant’s account of this was as follows:
[note: 35]
When I reached the void deck, I met him. He said, “I want to ask for your help. I want to go to Jurong. I have something important about work to do”. I asked him what kind of help that I could render for him. He said, “Please keep this bag for me.” The bag is black in colour. So I asked him, “What is the content of the bag?” He replied, “This is something to do with my work. I have to bring this to Johor.” …
The Appellant also said in his oral evidence that he noticed a red plastic bag inside A2; that red plastic bag was A1.
26     At the aforesaid meeting, Latif further instructed the Appellant to meet him again at Joo Koon Circle at about 3.00pm on the same day to receive 
another
 item for safekeeping. Latif explained that he had “some 
barang
 to do with his work which he needs to bring back to Johor”.
[note: 36]
 The Appellant agreed. After the meeting at the void deck, the Appellant returned to the Flat and kept A2 (along with A1) in the drawer mentioned at [9] above. He did not take out the contents of A2 (nor those of A1) to inspect them; neither did he look into either of the bags.
27     As requested by Latif, at about 3.00pm on the same day, the Appellant drove to Joo Koon Circle. On receiving a call from Latif, the Appellant informed the former that he had arrived.
[note: 37]
 Latif entered the Appellant’s car and asked him for a bag. The Appellant handed Latif the red tote bag which he kept in his car; that red tote bag was G1. Latif alighted from the car and returned a short while later with a package in G1, 
ie
, the wrapped package mentioned at [5] above. The Appellant asked Latif what was in the package, but Latif merely gave the same response as he had that morning in relation to A1 and A2, 
ie
, that the package had something to do with his “work”. The Appellant did not look into G1 or the wrapped package in it,
[note: 38]
 and immediately placed it on the floorboard of the front passenger seat.
28     The Appellant was stopped and arrested on his way home.
The decision below
29     In the court below, the trial judge (“the Judge”) conducted a 
voir dire
 to determine the admissibility of the Appellant’s cautioned statements and long statements. He concluded that the statements had been made voluntarily and were thus admissible as evidence.
30     The Judge rejected the evidence given by the Appellant at the 
voir dire
 on the grounds that it was inconsistent (see 
Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman
 
[2013] SGHC 164
 (“
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
”) at [7]). He noted that the Appellant first claimed that the admissions in his statements had been induced by threats that his mother would be implicated if he did not admit to the offences. He thereafter claimed that the statements had been fabricated by ASP Tang and Mdm Sofia. He finally said that ASP Tang had asked him some questions which he had answered, and ASP Tang had then recorded those answers in the statements. The Judge also observed that the statements made by the Appellant were interspersed with specific details about his family which could only have come from him and not from ASP Tang. The Judge therefore preferred and accepted ASP Tang’s evidence that the recording of the statements was routine, and that the statements had been given voluntarily by the Appellant.
31     The Judge convicted the Appellant of both charges as he was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant “was possessing diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [15]). The following factors lay behind the Judge’s decision.
32     First, the Judge noted that the Appellant had not given any satisfactory explanation as to why Latif needed him to safekeep two bags of the size of A1 and A2 when both bags “could have easily been carried by Latif” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [8]). Second, the Judge rejected the Appellant’s evidence that A1 and A2 had not been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard mentioned at [9] above, but had instead been found in a drawer in that cupboard (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [9]). The Judge preferred the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses that the two bags had indeed been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard. In this regard, he noted that the CNB officers had, in the Appellant’s presence, taken photographs of the place where A1 and A2 were found, and reasoned that if the two bags had indeed been found in the drawer mentioned by the Appellant, the Appellant would have indicated that to the CNB officers when they were photographing the scene. However, he did not do so. Third, the Judge held that if the Appellant truly did not know that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs, it did not make sense for him not to say anything or explain himself when confronted with the drugs in his car and at the Flat (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [11]). Fourth, the Judge was of the view that the Appellant had not satisfactorily explained why traces of his DNA were found on (
inter alia
) the interior surface of A1 (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [9]). Fifth, the Judge held that the Appellant had not given a satisfactory explanation as to why he had approximately $70,000 in cash in his bedroom, how there came to be a sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account and why Mdm Bibah’s bank passbook was found in his bedroom (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [12]). Sixth, the Judge found that the Appellant’s cautioned statements indicated guilt on his part (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [13]).
33     The Judge eventually sentenced the Appellant to death, but only after a procedural detour, which we will elaborate on further at [96]–[97] below.
The arguments on appeal
The Appellant’s arguments
34     Before this court, the Appellant argued that for two reasons, the Judge erred in finding that he had made his cautioned statements and long statements voluntarily. First, there were, according to the Appellant, “fertile areas” which ASP Tang could have threatened him with.
[note: 39]
 ASP Tang could have threatened to implicate Mdm Bibah, or to confiscate her money or the Flat. He could also have threatened not to allow the Appellant’s wife, who was then in Indonesia, to come to Singapore. The Appellant claimed that those threats were in fact made, and thus rendered his statements involuntary.
[note: 40]
35     Second, the Appellant contended that his evidence at the trial was not inconsistent.
[note: 41]
 He made it clear during cross-examination that those parts of his statements relating to his personal details were provided by him, while those parts of his statements relating to the drugs were fabricated by ASP Tang.
36     The Appellant also argued that his conviction by the Judge was against the weight of the evidence. In particular, he contended that the Judge erred in finding that he knew the nature of the contents of A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1. This was because:
[note: 42]
(a)     The Appellant came to know Latif in the course of their respective upholstery businesses and genuinely thought that the contents of A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 had to do with upholstery work.
(b)     The Appellant had asked Latif what the contents of A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 were and had found Latif’s responses satisfactory.
(c)     The Appellant trusted Latif and thus had no reason to suspect that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs.
For these reasons, the Appellant argued, the Judge was wrong to conclude that his evidence at the trial was “unconvincing” and that there were gaps in that evidence.
[note: 43]
37     The Appellant further argued that the Judge erred in rejecting his evidence that A1 and the drug paraphernalia therein were found in A2.
[note: 44]
 No reasons were given for this argument, apart from the assertion that the Appellant’s evidence should have been preferred to that of the Prosecution’s witnesses.
38     In addition, the Appellant contended that the Judge was incorrect to draw adverse conclusions from the cash found in his bedroom
[note: 45]
 and the money in Mdm Bibah’s bank account.
[note: 46]
 This was because the cash came from his upholstery business, while the sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account represented her lifelong savings, which she had accumulated while working as a cleaner at a hotel. The further evidence which the Appellant sought leave to adduce on appeal was directed at reinforcing these points.
39     The Appellant argued that in any event, the execution of his death sentence should be stayed because there were “constitutional issues” arising out of s 33B of the MDA which had yet to be resolved.
[note: 47]
 Section 33B contains the “substantial assistance” provision introduced by legislative amendments which came into effect on 1 January 2013. In brief, this provision permits the court to sentence a drug courier to life imprisonment instead of death upon the statutory prerequisites specified in s 33B(2) being satisfied. The Appellant argued that the execution of his death sentence should be stayed until the aforesaid constitutional issues were resolved.
The Prosecution’s arguments
40     The Prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the Judge was correct to admit the Appellant’s statements because his evidence at the trial was both internally and externally inconsistent.
[note: 48]
 In contrast, the Prosecution’s witnesses gave consistent evidence that withstood cross-examination.
41     The Prosecution argued that there was, in any event, sufficient evidence, as set out below, to sustain the Appellant’s conviction even if his statements were not admitted as evidence:
(a)     The circumstances showed that the Appellant knew that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs. The Appellant’s behaviour after his arrest was that of a guilty person.
[note: 49]
 He was uncooperative and even attempted to flee from the CNB officers when he was stopped by them.
(b)     The Appellant’s failure to give any explanation when he was confronted with the drugs was telling.
[note: 50]
 He did not explain to the CNB officers that he was merely safekeeping A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 for a friend; he simply kept quiet.
(c)     The drugs in A1 and A2 were carefully concealed out of sight in the Appellant’s bedroom in a cavity in a cupboard.
[note: 51]
(d)     The Appellant’s DNA was found on (
inter alia
) the interior surface of A1, which suggested that he had opened the bag even though he claimed not to have done so.
[note: 52]
42     With regard to the Appellant’s submissions on staying the execution of his death sentence, the Prosecution argued that there was no legal basis for granting such a stay pending the resolution of issues concerning s 33B of the MDA raised in other unrelated cases. It was clear, in any event, that s 33B was inapplicable to the Appellant, and there was no reason to stay the execution of his death sentence.
[note: 53]
The issues before this court
43     Four issues arose for our consideration:
(a)     first, whether leave should be granted to the Appellant to adduce further evidence at the hearing of the appeal to explain the large amount of cash found in his bedroom and the sizeable balance in his mother’s bank account;
(b)     second, whether the Judge erred in admitting as evidence the Appellant’s two cautioned statements and three long statements on the basis that they had been made voluntarily;
(c)     third, whether the Judge erred in finding that the Appellant had failed to establish that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession; and
(d)     fourth, whether the execution of the Appellant’s death sentence should be stayed.
44     We deal with each of these four issues in turn below.
Whether leave should be granted to the Appellant to adduce further evidence at the hearing of the appeal
45     We begin with the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal. The further evidence in question consisted of two affidavits. The first was an affidavit affirmed by Mdm Bibah that purported to explain how she had accumulated the sum of approximately $100,000 in her bank account. The affidavit exhibited monthly bank statements for that account dating back to January 2007. The second affidavit was one affirmed by the Appellant’s brother, Mr Abdul Mutalib bin Othman, which was said to show that the cash found in the Appellant’s bedroom were the Appellant’s earnings from his upholstery business, and not money made from drug trafficking.
The applicable legal principles
46     There was no dispute between the parties as to the legal principles governing the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence. These principles were considered in, 
inter alia
, 
Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid v Public Prosecutor
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 410
 (“
Abdul Rashid
”), a case decided when the relevant statutory provision at the time was s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed)”). That provision stipulated that the Court of Appeal had the power to admit further evidence on appeal where it was necessary to do so:
In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court.
We note in passing that s 55(1) of the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed) was later replicated in s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), which provision has since been repealed and replaced by s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).
47     In 
Abdul Rashid
, the offender sought to introduce further evidence in his appeal against sentence after pleading guilty in the court below. We held that s 55(1) of the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed) permitted an appellate court to “grant leave to adduce further evidence to avoid a miscarriage of justice”, but that important objective had to be balanced against “the public interest in the finality of trial and [in] ensuring that trials are not reopened each time evidence that should have been admitted at first instance was not admitted” (see 
Abdul Rashid
 at [6]). What was paramount under s 55(1) was “relevancy, more specifically, materiality, as well as the credibility … of the further evidence [sought] to be adduced” (see likewise 
Abdul Rashid
 at [6]).
48     We also observed in 
Abdul Rashid
 (at [7]) that the principles laid down in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
 provided a helpful “reference” in assessing whether further evidence should be permitted on appeal. However, we pointed out at the same time that 
Ladd v Marshall
 was a civil case, and that the court had to be mindful of “the higher burden of proving guilt in a criminal case” when applying those principles in the criminal context (see likewise 
Abdul Rashid
 at [7]).
49     Under the 
Ladd v Marshall
 principles, further evidence may only be introduced on appeal where the evidence in question: (a) was not obtainable with reasonable diligence at the time of the proceedings in the court below; (b) would have an important influence on the result of the case; and (c) is apparently credible, although not incontrovertible. In the light of these principles as well as the considerations which will be alluded to hereafter, we dismissed the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal as we were not satisfied that the threshold for permitting the introduction of such evidence had been crossed.
Mdm Bibah’s affidavit
50     Where the affidavit of Mdm Bibah was concerned, that affidavit stated that the money in her bank account was an “accumulation of many years of hard work and contributions” from her seven children.
[note: 54]
 Mdm Bibah worked as a cleaner at a hotel until her retirement in 1996, and her salary had been paid into that bank account.
[note: 55]
 The affidavit also set out the amount and the frequency of the allowances that Mdm Bibah received from her children, which were apparently also paid into that account.
51     In our judgment, the affidavit and the bank statements exhibited thereto were of little relevance to the main issue in this appeal, namely, whether the Appellant had knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession. Furthermore, Mdm Bibah’s affidavit did not even explain how she came to acquire the sum of approximately $100,000 that stood in her bank account, particularly the large amounts which were credited into the account over the five months preceding the Appellant’s arrest.
52     The earliest exhibited bank statement indicated that in January 2007,
[note: 56]
 the account balance stood at approximately $44,000. The account balance hovered at around this amount (with only small and erratic withdrawals and deposits in between) until February 2010, some three years later, when there was a deposit of $20,000.
[note: 57]
 There were thereafter two more deposits, each of $10,000 in March 2010 and May 2010 respectively,
[note: 58]
 and another deposit of $20,000 in June 2010.
[note: 59]
 This raised the account balance to approximately $104,000. After those four sizeable deposits, the account balance reverted to the previous pattern of hovering at roughly the same amount (
viz
, approximately $104,000), with only small and erratic withdrawals and deposits in between. The latest bank statement exhibited in Mdm Bibah’s affidavit, which was for the month of October 2013, reflected a balance of $105,531.07.
[note: 60]
53     Mdm Bibah failed to give any explanation for the four sizeable deposits into her bank account between February 2010 and June 2010. By that time, she was already well into her retirement, and had not earned any salary for approximately 14 years. Her only source of funds consisted of the modest allowances from her children, which could not satisfactorily account for the large sums deposited into her bank account during that short five-month period.
54     We would go further and venture to suggest that the deposits into Mdm Bibah’s bank account during those five months, instead of assisting the Appellant’s case, appeared to be wholly consistent with his long statements. The second long statement indicated that the Appellant started peddling drugs about “4 to 5 months” prior to his arrest on 6 July 2010.
[note: 61]
 According to that long statement, therefore, the Appellant was dealing in drugs between February 2010 and early July 2010. There was, in our view, an uncanny coincidence between this period, when the Appellant was peddling drugs (according to his second long statement), and the inexplicable large sums deposited into his mother’s bank account during that same period.
Mr Mutalib’s affidavit
55     Turning now to Mr Mutalib’s affidavit, that affidavit was likewise, in our judgment, of little relevance. The affidavit confirmed that Mr Mutalib had employed the Appellant as a sub-contractor in relation to an upholstery business, and exhibited documents which allegedly showed cash payments that Mr Mutalib’s company had made to the Appellant for the latter’s work.
[note: 62]
 The suggestion was that those cash payments accounted for the cash found in the Appellant’s bedroom.
56     The exhibited documents were, however, cryptic, and did not in fact show or prove that cash payments had indeed been made by Mr Mutalib’s company to the Appellant. The documents consisted of handwritten notes on sheets of ruled paper, with columns containing multiple rows of random figures and random sums of money.
[note: 63]
 The meaning and effect of those handwritten notes was indecipherable, and no attempt was made by the Appellant’s counsel to explain what those notes meant.
57     We were thus of the view that the evidence in Mr Mutalib’s affidavit did not even satisfy 
any
 of the 
Ladd v Marshall
 criteria. We accordingly dismissed the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal. This brings us to the substantive issues which arose in the appeal, to which we now turn.
Whether the Judge erred in admitting as evidence the Appellant’s two cautioned statements and three long statements on the basis that they had been made voluntarily
58     We mentioned earlier that the admissibility of the Appellant’s two cautioned statements and three long statements turned on which of two competing accounts of the recording of those statements ought to be preferred and accepted, the Appellant’s or ASP Tang’s. This undoubtedly required an assessment of their credibility and veracity – an assessment which the Judge was best placed to make. It is trite that in such circumstances, an appellate court will interfere with the trial judge’s finding of fact only where it is plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence (see 
ADF v Public Prosecutor
 
[2010] 1 SLR 874
 at [16(a)]).
59     In our judgment, far from his finding in this regard being plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence, the Judge was more than justified in the conclusions that he reached. There was therefore no basis for us to interfere with his finding that the two cautioned statements and the three long statements by the Appellant had been made voluntarily and were thus admissible as evidence.
60     The Appellant’s evidence on the inadmissibility of his statements was erratic, and his explanations, highly improbable. These two factors, apart from undermining the veracity of his account of the recording of the statements, combined to detract from his overall reliability and credibility as a witness. We will address the position in respect of the two cautioned statements before turning to the position in respect of the three long statements.
The admissibility of the two cautioned statements
61     Three factors led us to reject the Appellant’s narrative as to the involuntariness of his two cautioned statements. First, there were inconsistencies between the case which the Appellant’s counsel put to ASP Tang and the Appellant’s own evidence; indeed, there were inconsistencies even within the Appellant’s own evidence. Four of these inconsistencies bear mention:
(a)     The Appellant’s counsel, when cross-examining ASP Tang, put it to him that the Appellant’s cautioned statements had been made involuntarily because they had been induced by threats or had been recorded under oppressive circumstances. Significantly, counsel 
did not
 put to ASP Tang an additional ground which the Appellant mentioned for the first time only in his examination-in-chief, namely, that he had been induced to admit to the offences by a promise from ASP Tang to help to bring his (the Appellant’s) wife to Singapore to see him.
[note: 64]
(b)     The Appellant’s counsel, when cross-examining ASP Tang, put it to him that the Appellant’s cautioned statements had been induced principally by two threats: first, seizure of the money in Mdm Bibah’s bank account and the cash in the Appellant’s bedroom;
[note: 65]
 and, second, forfeiture of the Flat, which belonged to Mdm Bibah.
[note: 66]
 Under cross-examination, the Appellant brought up a third threat that had hitherto not been mentioned, namely, a threat by Mdm Sophia (the Malay interpreter) to the effect that the Prosecution’s evidence against the Appellant was very strong, so he had better admit to the offences.
[note: 67]
 This third threat was not, however, put to ASP Tang, nor was it mentioned in the Appellant’s examination-in-chief.
(c)     The Appellant’s counsel suggested that the Appellant’s cautioned statements had been made under oppressive conditions because they had been recorded very early in the morning and the Appellant “only had his dinner past midnight”.
[note: 68]
 The suggestion was that at the time the Appellant gave the cautioned statements, he was tired; he had not been fed until very late in the night. In this regard, we note that the Appellant, in his examination-in-chief, was asked, “Did you have food?”, to which he replied, “Yes, they gave me food” at “[m]idnight”.
[note: 69]
 This was consistent with the impression given by the Appellant’s counsel. During cross-examination, however, the Appellant changed his complaint, and said that while he had been given food at midnight, he had not eaten it because he had no appetite.
[note: 70]
(d)     The Appellant first admitted in his evidence-in-chief that his cautioned statements had been recorded by ASP Tang with Mdm Sophia acting as the Malay interpreter.
[note: 71]
 His position was that the admissions in those statements were involuntary because they had been made under threat. In cross-examination, however, the Appellant changed his position and claimed that the cautioned statements had not been made by him at all and also had not been explained to him. Instead, ASP Tang and/or Mdm Sophia had fabricated the statements, and the Appellant had merely been asked to sign whenever a signature was required.
[note: 72]
62     The second factor that led us to reject the Appellant’s contention as to the inadmissibility of his cautioned statements was the plain implausibility of some of his assertions. This could be seen from the evidence on at least three occasions:
(a)     The Appellant said in his cross-examination that during the recording of his cautioned statements, he told Mdm Sophia that “this 
barang
 [
ie
, the drugs] is not mine”,
[note: 73]
 and that he was “in unstable condition”.
[note: 74]
 When the Appellant was further asked in cross-examination whether Mdm Sophia translated those assertions to ASP Tang, the Appellant’s response was that he did not understand English. While English may not have been the Appellant’s primary language, it is, in our view, doubtful that his command of English was indeed so poor that he could not even tell whether or not Mdm Sophia was trying to relay his message to ASP Tang. Moreover, there was no reason to think that Mdm Sophia might not have been doing her job properly at the time.
(b)     The Appellant at times suggested that it was 
Mdm Sophia
, and not ASP Tang, who had threatened him. For example, in his cross-examination, he stated:
[note: 75]
Mdm Sophia said, “You have to admit. If you do not admit”, my mother will face problem. My mother’s money, my mother’s flat, my own savings, my own cash, they will seize.
No mention was made of this threat having emanated from ASP Tang. If the Appellant’s account were accepted, it would mean that Mdm Sophia had either, independently of ASP Tang, threatened the Appellant to obtain admissions from him, or had colluded with ASP Tang to do so. To us, both scenarios seemed highly improbable.
(c)     The Appellant’s assertion that he had been induced to admit to the offences because he did not want the CNB to confiscate the cash found in his bedroom likewise appeared implausible. Given that the Appellant had, in his cautioned statements, effectively admitted to selling drugs for profit, if at least part of the large amount of cash found in his bedroom had come from peddling drugs, that would give the CNB all the more reason to confiscate the cash. It is inconceivable that the Appellant would think that by admitting to selling drugs, the CNB would not confiscate the cash found in his bedroom. We would add that this alleged inducement is incredible in another sense – namely, that the Appellant viewed his money as being more important than his own life.
63     The third and final factor that led us to reject the Appellant’s account of the recording of his cautioned statements lay in the results of the pre- and post-statement medical examinations at Alexandra Hospital, which were conducted shortly before and shortly after the cautioned statements were taken from him. The fact that the Appellant gave the cautioned statements voluntarily is entirely consistent with the results of the medical examinations, which did not indicate anything out of the ordinary apart from superficial abrasions on the left side of the Appellant’s forehead. If the Appellant had indeed been “in shock” and “in trauma” as he claimed,
[note: 76]
 and if such “shock” and “trauma” had been severe enough to whittle away his ability to give a voluntary statement, that would have been apparent at the medical examinations.
The admissibility of the three long statements
64     The Appellant’s evidence relating to the recording of his long statements did not fare much better. The most glaring inconsistency related to the Appellant’s central contention during cross-examination that the long statements had all been fabricated by ASP Tang. His position was that he had merely been “told to sit down and face [ASP Tang and Mdm Sophia] [while] they make this statement”.
[note: 77]
 There “wasn’t any interpretation”,
[note: 78]
 and he was not “even asked to give [his] account of what happened”.
[note: 79]
65     There were at least three difficulties with this central contention. First, it was raised only during the Appellant’s cross-examination. This allegation of fabrication was not put to ASP Tang, nor did the Appellant mention it in his own examination-in-chief. Second, no reasons were proffered as to why ASP Tang and Mdm Sophia would want to work together so brazenly to fabricate statements against the Appellant. Third, when it was drawn to the Appellant’s attention that there were numerous personal details in the long statements that ASP Tang could not possibly have conjured up without his input, the Appellant then admitted that “whatever question [ASP Tang] asked, I answered him”.
[note: 80]
 This was a sharp departure from the Appellant’s previous position that apart from the threats made to him, no other questions were asked of him.
[note: 81]
66     The position that the Appellant eventually settled on was that in so far as his long statements related to his “personal thing, … [his] family”, he was asked questions (and therefore provided input); but in so far as his long statements related to the drugs found in his possession or drug trafficking, he was not asked any questions (and therefore did not provide any input), and the facts set out in the statements were fabricated by ASP Tang.
[note: 82]
Conclusion on the admissibility of the Appellant’s statements
67     The above inconsistencies and shortcomings could well have been overlooked if viewed in isolation. But, the cumulative picture that emerged from the Appellant’s testimony on the recording of his statements was that he was making broad, unfocused and self-serving assertions in support of his position that his statements had been given involuntarily. His evidence was internally inconsistent and shifting, and even the final position that he settled on was difficult to accept.
68     ASP Tang’s evidence, in contrast, was systematic and detailed. ASP Tang gave evidence that the recording of the Appellant’s statements had been routine, and that the statements had been interpreted and read back to the Appellant, who had been permitted to make corrections before signing the statements. ASP Tang’s evidence was unshaken under cross-examination. We therefore found no basis to disturb the Judge’s finding that the two cautioned statements and the three long statements by the Appellant had been made voluntarily. Those statements were, in our judgment, rightly admitted as evidence.
Whether the Judge erred in finding that the Appellant had failed to establish that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession
69     We move on now to the Judge’s finding on the Appellant’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession. The Appellant did not appear to dispute that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 (
viz
, the articles containing the drugs) were in his possession. The fact of possession triggers the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that the Appellant knew the nature of the drugs in those three articles. Section 18(2) states:
Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
The only question before us was whether, on the evidence, the Appellant had rebutted this presumption.
70     The Judge held that the Appellant had not done so. Having considered the evidence, we could not see any basis to disturb the Judge’s conclusion on this point. In explaining our reasons for so deciding, we first set out the law and review some cases which are illustrative of how and when the presumption of knowledge may be rebutted. We then turn to the objective contemporaneous evidence in the present case, which, in our judgment, corroborated and fortified the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant was in fact peddling drugs and not just safekeeping the drugs in question for Latif.
The law
71     In 
Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 4 SLR 1156
 (“
Nagaenthran
”), this court addressed the effect of the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, and what an accused would need to show (as well as to what standard of proof) to rebut the presumption. In short, the accused would be required to establish on a balance of probabilities the 
non
-existence of knowledge of the nature of the drugs concerned. He could do so by proving, for example, that he had mistakenly thought that the drugs in his possession were something innocuous, such as detergent. The remarks of Chan Sek Keong CJ in 
Nagaenthran
 at [23], [24] and [27] are instructive and bear setting out at length:
23    … To rebut the presumption of knowledge, all the accused has to do is to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he 
did not know
 the nature of the controlled drug referred to in the charge. The material issue in s 18(2) of the MDA is 
not
 the 
existence
 of the accused’s knowledge of the controlled drug, 
but
 the 
non-existence
 of such knowledge on his part.
24    As to the meaning of the phrase “the nature of the drug”, our view is that it refers to the actual controlled drug found in the “thing” (
eg
, the bag or container, 
etc
) that was in the possession of the accused at the material time. For instance, if heroin is found in a bag or a container in the accused’s possession and he is unable to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge of the heroin (see [27] below), he would be presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA to have known of the heroin in his possession.
…
27    How can an accused rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug found in his possession (
eg
, in a bag he is carrying or on his person)? He can do so by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he genuinely believed that what was in his possession was something innocuous (
eg
, washing powder, when it was in fact heroin (see 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
)), or that he thought it was a controlled drug other than the one actually found in this possession (
eg
, where he genuinely believed he was carrying “ice”, rather than heroin (see 
Khor Soon Lee v PP
 
[2011] 3 SLR 201
)).
[emphasis in original]
72     Chan CJ also emphasised at [31] of 
Nagaenthran
 that the inquiry was, in the final analysis, one of fact. It would turn on the veracity and credibility of the accused person’s evidence:
… Consistent with the burden which he has to discharge, the accused has to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate, on a 
balance of probabilities
, that he did not know the 
nature
 of [the] drug. This is a question of fact in each case, and turns very much on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the defence witnesses (especially that of the accused, if he chooses to testify). [emphasis in original]
73      
Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 3 SLR 201
 (“
Khor Soon Lee
”) was a case where this court found that the accused had succeeded in rebutting the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the drugs in his possession contained heroin.
74     The accused in that case was found at Woodlands Checkpoint to be in possession of a package containing not less than 27.86g of diamorphine. He admitted that he was a drug courier for a person named Tony, and that he had been tasked by Tony to carry drugs from Malaysia into Singapore. He asserted, however, that he had been led to believe that he was carrying only erimin, ketamine and ecstasy, the trafficking of which did not attract the death penalty, and not heroin, the trafficking of which did.
75     The accused’s evidence was that when Tony approached him to deliver drugs, he specifically asked Tony whether heroin would be involved in the deliveries. The accused did not want to traffic in heroin because he was afraid of the death penalty. Tony assured the accused that the deliveries would not involve heroin. The accused’s evidence to that effect was not challenged by the Prosecution (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [6]).
76     In the result, this court held that in the circumstances, the accused had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The court relied on the following facts to reach that conclusion:
(a)     The accused had, on numerous previous occasions, assisted Tony in transporting drugs into Singapore. He had been assured by Tony on those occasions that the drugs did not include heroin. There was accordingly a consistent pattern of importing controlled drugs, the importation of which did not carry the sanction of capital punishment. The particular transaction involved in 
Khor Soon Lee
, which involved diamorphine, was a deviation from this consistent pattern (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [23]).
(b)     In view of the consistent and established pattern of importation, the accused had no reason to suspect that the package in question in 
Khor Soon Lee
 contained diamorphine (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [24]).
(c)     The accused had a close personal relationship with Tony and trusted him. That explained why he believed Tony’s assurance that the packages which he delivered for Tony would not contain diamorphine, and why he adhered to Tony’s instructions not to open up those packages (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [25]).
(d)     Tony’s DNA was found on the package in question in 
Khor Soon Lee
, which corroborated the accused’s account that Tony had a significant role in the transaction (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [25]).
(e)     All of the above assertions were not challenged by the Prosecution.
This court therefore concluded that whilst the accused might have been negligent or reckless in not checking the contents of the package involved in 
Khor Soon Lee
, he had not been wilfully blind and, therefore, had established the 
non
-existence of any knowledge that what he was carrying was heroin (see 
Khor Soon Lee
 at [28]).
77     The later case of 
Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor
 
[2012] 2 SLR 903
 (“
Dinesh Pillai
”) provides a useful contrast to 
Khor Soon Lee
.
78     The offender in 
Dinesh Pillai
 was paid to deliver “secret” and “expensive” food from Malaysia to Singapore (see 
Dinesh Pillai
 at [2]). The food was given to the offender wrapped in brown paper and placed in a red plastic bag along with a packet of curry and a packet of freshly cut chilli. The offender was instructed to carry the packet of food across Woodlands Checkpoint, and thereafter wait for instructions on whom it was to be delivered to.
79     The offender made two deliveries in this manner on separate occasions. He was paid RM200 for the first delivery and RM300 for the second. He was arrested while making his third delivery, and the substance wrapped in brown paper on that occasion (“the Brown Packet”) was found, upon analysis, to contain not less than 19.35g of diamorphine. The offender argued that “although he suspected that the Brown Packet contained contraband or something illegal, he never associated it with a controlled drug, much less diamorphine” (see 
Dinesh Pillai
 at [19]). He claimed that he was shocked when he was informed by the CNB that the Brown Packet contained diamorphine.
80     This court dismissed the offender’s argument and held that he had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. This was because he did not believe that the Brown Packet contained only food and had the opportunity to check what was in it; yet, he did not do so (see 
Dinesh Pillai
 at [20]–[21]):
20    … This is not a case where the appellant reasonably believed that the Brown Packet contained some controlled drug other than diamorphine (
eg
, “ice”, ecstasy, 
etc
) and had good reason for such belief (compare, 
eg
, … 
Khor Soon Lee
 …) … In the present case, the appellant 
did not bother to take the simple step of peeping into the Brown Packet to see what it contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal
 …
21    In our view, the appellant has failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption on a balance of probabilities because 
he turned a blind eye to what the Brown Packet contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal
. The factual distinction between this case and 
Khor Soon Lee
 is that in the latter case, 
the accused did not have any suspicion that he was carrying anything other than erimin and ketamine (which the court accepted)
. In contrast, in the present case, the appellant was aware that he was carrying something illegal, and he could easily have verified what that thing was by simply opening the Brown Packet. 
It was not enough for the appellant to take the position that he did not open the Brown Packet because he had been told not to do so.
 …
[emphasis added]
81      
Khor Soon Lee
 and 
Dinesh Pillai
 illustrate the need to examine with care the entire circumstances in which the transaction in question occurred, and, in relation to cases such as the present, the importance of scrutinising the evidence and narrative given by the offender to determine its veracity.
The evidence in the present case
82     In the present case, we could not find any basis for interfering with the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant knew the nature of the drugs in his possession. There were at least three factors, all independent of the admissions in the Appellant’s statements, which led us to reject his narrative and affirm the Judge’s conclusion.
Gaps and internal incoherence in the Appellant’s narrative
83     First, there were gaps in the Appellant’s account of the material events that ruptured the internal coherence of his narrative. The Appellant offered no convincing explanation for his unquestioning subservience to Latif. He did not explain why Latif telephoned for no apparent reason to ask him to safekeep A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 for a day. He also did not explain why he agreed to Latif’s request without inquiring further. In respect of A1 and A2, the Appellant said that Latif “wanted to see his friend in Jurong”, and that “[i]t was troublesome for him to … bring [the bags] along with him”.
[note: 83]
 But, even if that was accepted – 
ie
, even if it was indeed the case that the Appellant was prepared to safekeep A1 and A2 for Latif for no apparent reason – there was no reason why the Appellant should have been willing to drive to Joo Koon Circle from the Flat in Bukit Batok later in the afternoon on the same day just to receive yet 
another
 item from Latif (
viz
, the wrapped package in G1) for safekeeping.
84     The bizarreness of the Appellant’s account was heightened by his admission that he had never “collected any stuff from [Latif] before – prior to the day of [his] arrest”.
[note: 84]
 The Appellant also gave no explanation as to why he did not probe Latif further on the contents of A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1, or even just glance at or feel the contents of those three items to try to find out for himself what they contained. The Appellant was satisfied, without more, by the weak explanation given by Latif that the contents of those three items related to the latter’s “work”.
The Appellant’s unsatisfactory explanation for the DNA found on the interior surface of A1
85     The second factor which led us to affirm the Judge’s decision on the Appellant’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs in his possession lay in his explanation, which we found far from persuasive, as to why his DNA came to be on (
inter alia
) the interior surface of A1. The DNA Profiling Laboratory at the HSA conducted DNA profiling on A1, and the results revealed the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on both the exterior and the interior surfaces of A1. The Appellant’s evidence was that when he received A1 and A2 from Latif, A1 was inside A2. The Appellant did not open up A2 or even look into it after receiving it from Latif. Instead, he placed A2 (with A1 inside) straight into a drawer in a cupboard in his bedroom.
86     The Appellant did not dispute the fact that his DNA was found on, 
inter alia
, the 
interior
 surface of what, by his account, was the 
inner
 bag (
ie
, A1). Instead, during cross-examination, he attempted to explain the presence of his DNA on the interior surface of A1 in this way: when he placed A2 (which, according to him, was the outer bag) into the above-mentioned drawer, he “noticed [at] the opening [of A2], there was a plastic bag, red plastic bag [
ie
, A1] … that is about to come out”.
[note: 85]
 He therefore had to “push” the red bag (A1) into the drawer. Upon being confronted with the fact that his DNA had been found on the 
interior
 surface (in addition to the exterior surface) of A1, the Appellant attempted to explain the presence of his DNA as follows:
[note: 86]
Q
Mr Kahar, do you know that DNA analysis show[s] that your DNA profile was found on … the interior surface of this red plastic bag?
A
(No audible answer)
...
Q
Do you know that?
A
Yes because I used my fingers to push the red plastic bag in.
Q
Once. You pushed it once, according to your evidence.
A
 
Yes but right inside, it’s quite long that I touched it.
 
Q
 
Now it’s quite long that you touched it. So like one push was a long push. Is that what you are asking the Court to believe?
 
A
 
Yes because I pushed it to the maximum when I –
 
Q
Now I put it to you that it’s not true.
A
I disagree.
[emphasis added in bold italics]
The Appellant’s explanation was, in our judgment, entirely unsatisfactory and unconvincing. The presence of the Appellant’s DNA on the interior surface of A1 suggested that he had handled the contents of that bag. This seriously undermined the Appellant’s narrative that he only received A1 (placed inside A2) for safekeeping and did not look into or feel the contents of either bag.
The Appellant’s unsatisfactory explanation for two suspicious text messages
87     Our third reason for upholding the Judge’s ruling on the state of the Appellant’s knowledge for the purposes of s 18(2) of the MDA was the Appellant’s failure to give any satisfactory explanation for two suspicious text messages which he received on his cellular phone from persons who were saved as “Contacts” in the phone. The first was a text message from one “Unna”, which was received on 2 July 2010. The Appellant’s evidence was that Unna was a “normal friend” with whom he did not have any “business dealing[s]”; they merely met up “to socialise, just to sit and drink”.
[note: 87]
 The message from Unna stated:
[note: 88]
… “How are you bang? Have you returned? 
I have 1 deal to talk with [you]
, 
if you get 5 balls
” – or more – “
in one week I give you for a price of ... 6100
/-, bang … for a week I have no work, bang … My boss asked me to talk to you, bang. Since so many things have depleted … Now I have 1 ball with me, if you agree” – I can pass it – “I can pass” – it – “to you at 5 o’clock later. Sorry bang, every day I feel miserable. … Please reply bang” [emphasis added in bold italics]
This message contradicted the Appellant’s claim that he did not have any business dealings with Unna. More importantly, it suggested that the Appellant was in a position to sell Unna “5 balls” for “6100”.
88     The second text message was from Latif, and it stated:
[note: 89]
… “Bang, why do you not take the call, bang? I am worried. 
If there is any problem, please let me know
, bang. 
Are you short of the stuff
 (lit: Horse). If I have done something wrong, please forgive me. Please reply or call me, bang”. [emphasis added in bold italics]
The second text message was especially significant because it was received at 2.22pm on 7 July 2010,
[note: 90]
 the day after the Appellant’s arrest. It was thus sent to the Appellant the day after he claimed to have received A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 from Latif for safekeeping. This message was incompatible with the Appellant’s account that Latif had given him those three items the day before merely for safekeeping. If that had indeed been the case, one would have expected Latif to simply ask the Appellant where he (the Appellant) was, so that Latif could retrieve those items from him. Instead, the text message expressed Latif’s concern that there might have been a “problem” with what he had given the Appellant the previous day, and that the Appellant might have been “short of the stuff”.
89     Taking it at its highest, the second text message suggested that the Appellant had purchased drugs from Latif, and that Latif was asking him whether the amount of drugs was correct. Even taking it at its lowest, this message undermined the Appellant’s account of his interactions with Latif on 6 July 2010. It was not just a case of the Appellant blindly obeying Latif’s instructions to safekeep A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1.
90     When the Appellant was cross-examined on these two text messages, his only response was to deny that he knew what either of these messages meant,
[note: 91]
 even though they were from persons who were saved as “Contacts” in his cellular phone.
Conclusion on the state of the Appellant’s knowledge
91     In our judgment, the glaring and unexplained (or inadequately explained) inconsistencies and gaps in the Appellant’s evidence as set out at [83]–[90] above, when viewed against the backdrop of his diminished credibility and reliability as a witness (see [60] above), were fatal to his contention that he was merely safekeeping A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 for Latif, and had no knowledge of what those items contained. Even leaving aside the admissions in the Appellant’s statements, the large amount of cash found in his bedroom and the sizeable sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account, it was our judgment that the Appellant had failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession.
92     These factors, when considered in their totality, corroborated the admissions in the Appellant’s cautioned statements and long statements, which, in our view, were rightly admitted by the Judge as evidence. The large quantity of drugs found in the Appellant’s bedroom, together with other drug-related paraphernalia such as smaller unused Ziploc bags, rubber bands, a stained weighing scale and a stained spoon, strongly suggested that the Appellant was trafficking in drugs. The Appellant had therefore failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, and the Judge was entitled to find that the Prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in them. We therefore dismissed his appeal.
93     There is, however, one inconsequential error in the Judge’s decision which we need to mention. One of the factors which the Judge relied on in convicting the Appellant was that Mdm Bibah’s passbook had been found in the Appellant’s bedroom as opposed to her own bedroom (see 
Abdul Kahar (Conviction)
 at [12]; see also [32] above). That was, however, an incorrect factual position. The Prosecution’s witnesses gave clear and uncontroverted evidence that the passbook had been recovered from 
Mdm Bibah’s
 bedroom rather than the Appellant’s.
[note: 92]
 That said, this error on the part of the Judge was immaterial to our conclusion that the Appellant had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.
Whether the execution of the Appellant’s death sentence should be stayed
94     We now turn to consider the Appellant’s contention that the execution of his death sentence should be stayed pending the resolution of the constitutional issues arising out of s 33B of the MDA “in 
Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v AG
 (Civil Appeal No. 131 of 2014), and/or 
Re: Chen Ming Jian
 (Originating Summons No. HC/OS514/2015”.
[note: 93]
 We rejected this argument as it was wholly without merit.
95     First, the Appellant did not establish any legal basis for staying the execution of his death sentence pending the resolution of two other 
unrelated
 cases. Second, it was, in any event, difficult to see how the outcome of the two other cases which raised the constitutionality of s 33B of the MDA would have any bearing on the Appellant’s case. It was clear that the Appellant could not avail himself of the “substantive assistance” provision in s 33B of the MDA as the prerequisites to trigger the operation of that provision had not been met. The Public Prosecutor had not given the Appellant a certificate of substantive assistance. Moreover, the Appellant’s involvement in drug trafficking was not confined to “transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug” within the terms of s 33B(2)(
a
)(i) of the MDA.
96     At this juncture, we should explain that the Judge convicted the Appellant of the two drug trafficking charges on 27 August 2013, and thereafter delivered his judgment on sentence (reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman
 
[2013] SGHC 222
 (“
Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)
”)) on 24 October 2013. In that judgment, the Judge drew attention to the then “newly-enacted s 33B of the [MDA]” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)
 at [1]). He held that “[a]lthough … the [Appellant’s] involvement … went beyond transporting, sending, or delivering the drugs”, he would give the Appellant “the benefit of the doubt” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)
 at [4]) since the case was “among the first cases under the new provisions” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)
 at [5]). He thus held that the Appellant “had acted as a ‘courier’ only” (see 
Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)
 at [5]).
97     The Judge’s decision on sentence formed the basis of a criminal reference brought by the Prosecution and heard by this court as it was constituted for the present appeal. We unanimously held, in a judgment reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan and another
 
[2015] 1 SLR 834
 (“
Chum Tat Suan
”), that the Judge was “wrong to have held that [the Appellant] was a courier when the Judge was ‘satisfied that [the Appellant’s] involvement in trafficking 
went beyond transporting, sending or delivering
 [the drugs]’” [emphasis in original] (see 
Chum Tat Suan
 at [70]). We thus quashed the Judge’s decision on sentence, and remitted the matter to him to determine whether the Appellant’s involvement in drug trafficking was restricted to the activities within s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA. Thereafter, the Judge found that the activities which the Appellant had engaged in fell outside the scope of that provision, and accordingly sentenced him to death.
98     In our judgment, it was clear that the Appellant would not be able to avail himself of s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA, not least because his involvement in drug trafficking went beyond “transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug”. There was no reason to interfere with the Judge’s finding that the Appellant was actively involved in purchasing, re-packaging and selling drugs. We therefore refused to stay the execution of the Appellant’s death sentence.
Conclusion
99     For all of the foregoing reasons, we could not find any basis to interfere with the Judge’s decision to convict the Appellant and sentence him to death. We also could not see any basis to admit the further evidence which the Appellant sought leave to introduce on appeal, or to stay the execution of his death sentence. We therefore dismissed his appeal, as well as his application for leave to adduce further evidence and his request for a stay of the execution of his sentence.

2877948,R v Perry [2016] NSWSC 1562,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	MATHEWS AJ: On 22 June 2016 Matthew James Perry pleaded guilty on indictment to the charge that, on 18 June 2014, at Colyton in NSW he murdered Jed Coates. Thereafter the matter was adjourned on several occasions in order for evidence to be presented and submissions made relating to sentence. He now comes to be sentenced in relation to that offence.
	


Circumstances of Offence


	
	At the time of the killing the offender was 21 years old, and the deceased was 18, having been born on 7 June 1996. They knew each other, as they had attended the same school, and the offender was a friend of the deceased’s older brother, Dan. There was some resentment between the two of them, as the offender believed that the deceased was part of a group that had attempted to steal his motor bike. The deceased had denied that this was the case.
	
	
	On the evening of 18 June 2014 the deceased was at the Colyton Hotel with a friend, Jack Kliese. The offender was also at the hotel with some friends. During the evening the deceased approached the offender. According to Jack Kliese, it was intended to be a conciliatory approach, but the offender did not take it that way. Shortly after the deceased approached him, the hotel CCTV footage shows the offender grabbing the deceased by the throat. Punches were thrown between them, with Jack Kliese joining in. The fight was rapidly broken up by the hotel security staff, and the deceased and Jack Kliese were ejected from the hotel. A security guard saw the two of them in the hotel car park, where they remained for about 20 to 25 minutes after being ejected from the hotel. During this time Jack Kliese realised that he had left a cigarette packet inside the hotel, containing about $250 in cash. At his request, a security guard went inside to find it. He brought the packet out, but it was empty. Jack Kliese was very upset about this. He believed that the offender had stolen his money. The security officer described them both as being drunk. The deceased called out to the offender: “we are going to get you,” and Jack Kliese shouted: “we know where you live. I will get a knife and stab you and your family.”
	
	
	The offender told his friends in the hotel that he was worried about his mother – no doubt because of the threats made by Mr Kliese. So he took a taxi and returned to the home where he lived with his mother in Nevada Avenue, Colyton. He told her that he had had a conflict with two men at the pub, and that they wanted to meet him down in the park, to fight him “one on one”.
	
	
	A number of abusive messages were then exchanged between the offender and the deceased on Facebook. These culminated in an arrangement that they would meet for a “one on one” fight, presumably meaning a fist fight. In the meantime, the deceased telephoned his brother Dan and told him that the offender had stolen Jack Kliese’s money. Dan contacted the offender who denied doing so. Dan told the deceased to go home. The deceased did so, returning to the home where he lived with his mother. His mother tried to talk him out of meeting up with the offender, but he insisted that he was going to do so. Dan also tried unsuccessfully to talk him out of it. There were also several messages between the offender and Dan. The deceased and Jack Kliese then left the deceased’s home, the deceased having armed himself with a shovel and given Mr Kliese a “club lock”. They apparently armed themselves in this way as they were afraid that the offender might bring his friends with him to the fight.
	
	
	Meanwhile the offender was at home preparing himself for the encounter. His mother told police that he was initially carrying a knife with knuckle dusters attached which he was proposing to take with him. She would not let him take it, and she believed that he was unarmed when he left the house. However, as it later transpired, he was armed with a .22 calibre firearm, about 35 to 40 cms long.
	
	
	Following further messages between the offender and the deceased, the three of them met up in the street in Colyton, not far from the offender’s home. Neighbours heard shouting from the street. The offender was seen to be pointing the gun in the direction of the deceased and Jack Kliese, apparently moving it backwards and forwards between the two of them. They took a couple of steps backwards, and shortly afterwards the offender fired the gun in the direction of the deceased. The bullet entered the right side of the front of his neck, transected the right subclavian artery and passed through the right lung, prior to lodging in the subcutaneous tissues on the right side of the upper back, causing extensive blood loss. The deceased died almost immediately.
	
	
	A post mortem examination performed by Dr Johan Duflou identified the gunshot wound as the sole cause of death. The deceased had a high level of alcohol in his blood, namely .172 grams per 100 ml. In addition there was evidence of recent cannabis consumption.
	
	
	The offender left the scene immediately after the shooting and returned home, while Jack Kliese called for assistance. Mr Kliese told the police that the offender was the shooter. Later he claimed not to know who the shooter was, but after being told that the deceased was dead he gave the police a full account, again nominating the offender as the shooter. The offender was then arrested and interviewed. He admitted the earlier altercations at the hotel and in the street, but denied that it was he who had shot the deceased. However in subsequent correspondence between his legal representatives and the Director of Public Prosecutions it became clear that he was no longer denying that he was the perpetrator. He was charged with murder, and was due to stand trial on 22 June 2016. On that day he entered a plea of guilty to murder. Accordingly, the trial did not proceed. I will be referring to this later as it is highly relevant on sentence.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence on sentence, in which he expressed extreme remorse for his actions. He said that he had purchased the gun some time before this night. He was buying fireworks from a man one day, and – as he put it – he stupidly bought the gun as well. He had kept it under the house where he lived with his mother. He told the psychologist, Alison Cullen, that he took it with him on the night in question with the intention of scaring the deceased and Mr Kliese. He did not intend to kill the deceased.
	


Objective Seriousness of this Offence


	
	It is appropriate at this stage to say something about the objective criminality involved in this offence, and where it stands in relation to the midpoint of objective seriousness for the offence of murder. Mr Peluso, who appeared for the offender, submitted that in all the circumstances, this offence was below the midpoint of objective seriousness. The Crown prosecutor submitted that the fact that a firearm was involved was an aggravating factor which brought it up to the midpoint.
	
	
	In my opinion the circumstances of this offence place it significantly below the midpoint of objective seriousness for murder. Certainly a firearm was used, but without it there would have been no murder, so in one sense it was an inherent part of this particular offence. The offender had it with him because he was concerned for his welfare, given the abusive messages that had been sent by the deceased. Indeed, not long before the fatal encounter the offender had sent a message to Dan, suggesting that it would be the best thing if the deceased just went home, “like a good boy”. It is accepted by the Crown that the shooting was a spontaneous act which was not premeditated. His intention, as he later said, was not to kill anyone but to frighten the two men away. In this regard it is also accepted by the Crown that the offender acted with reckless indifference to human life rather than with an intention to kill or really seriously injure the deceased. The combination of these factors, in my opinion, significantly reduces the objective culpability involved in this offence.
	
	
	I now turn to say something about the offender’s background.
	


The Offender’s Background


	
	The offender is 24 years old, having been born on 19 August 1992. He is the younger of two children born to his parents. His parents separated shortly before his birth, and he and his older sister were brought up by their mother. His father remarried, and he has always enjoyed a good relationship with all family members, including his step-mother and step-brother. He attended Colyton High School, leaving at the end of Year 10. Thereafter he completed a 4 year panel beating apprenticeship. He was working with the same employer throughout his apprenticeship and until his incarceration for the present offence. For the last 2 years he was in a stable relationship. His partner had a three-month old son when they commenced their relationship, and a strong bond was forged between them, with the offender taking over the role of the boy’s father.
	
	
	The offender has no previous convictions. Both his father and his step-mother gave evidence on sentence, and spoke very highly of him. He has had a stable lifestyle and has never had any problems with drugs or alcohol. Nor had he previously shown any signs of violence or aggression. Glowing references were also provided by other family members, as well as by neighbours and friends.
	
	
	The offender was assessed in August this year by the forensic psychologist, Alison Cullen, and her report dated 22 August 2016 was tendered into evidence. This shows that the offender had been feeling depressed for some time before this offence. Indeed he had initiated psychotherapy with a private psychologist when he was only 19 years old. It is possible that this was associated with the offender’s spinal condition, which was starting to cause intermittent pain at about that time. Ms Cullen noted that he was pleasant and co-operative during their interview, although he described himself as being “pretty sad”, and having difficulty sleeping. He had high levels of depression, anxiety and stress. At least part of this was attributable to the offender’s incarceration and his then impending sentencing proceedings. Ms Cullen concluded that, prior to his incarceration, the offender demonstrated being a responsible, hard-working and caring young man.
	
	
	For a number of years the offender has had problems relating to his back and hips. These have prevented him from performing the physical exercise he had previously enjoyed. They have also on occasions led to severe pain. He was recently diagnosed as suffering from Scheurmann’s Disease. This is a very serious condition which results in the sufferer’s spinal column collapsing forward on itself and causing curvature of the spine at the affected levels. This leads to visible deformity, and also produces periodic pain, sometimes of a very severe nature. There is no cure for this condition, and it may well deteriorate over time. Moreover in the offender’s case, the disease involves both the thoracic and the lumbar regions of the spine – one of them curving to the left and the other curving to the right. According to the medical evidence, this is an unusual combination and significantly aggravates his clinical condition. As a result of his condition, the offender is restricted in his physical activities, and he should not be required to lie on hard surfaces or on thin mattresses.
	


Aggravating and Mitigating Factors


	
	I turn to discuss the aggravating and mitigating factors which are relevant to this case as set out in s.21A(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (“the Act”).
	
	
	The only aggravating factor which is not inherent in the offence of murder is that the offence involved the use of a weapon pursuant to s.21A(2)(b). I have already referred to this factor. For reasons already given, I do not regard it of great significance in the particular circumstances of this case. As to mitigating factors, the only one relating to the offence itself, as opposed to the offender, is that pursuant to s.21A(3)(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. As already indicated, the Crown accepts that the killing was a spontaneous action which was not premeditated.
	
	
	There are, however, a number of mitigating factors relating to the offender personally. They are: first that the offender has no record of previous convictions and is therefore taken to be a person of good character pursuant to paragraphs (3)(e) and (f). Associated with this, he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend, pursuant to paragraphs. (3)(g) and (h). The offender has displayed real remorse for this offence pursuant to paragraph. (3)(i), and has accepted responsibility for his actions. Finally, he has entered a plea of guilty, pursuant to paragraph (3)(k). This last matter is of considerable significance, and I shall return to discuss it very shortly.
	


The Appropriate Sentence


	
	The purposes of sentencing are set out in s. 3A of the Act. Very briefly they are: to punish the offender, to deter the offender and others, to protect the community, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct, and to recognise the harm done to the victim and to the community. A number of these purposes point in opposite directions. In the present case, given the seriousness of this offence, the offender will inevitably be serving a lengthy term of imprisonment. This will be more than sufficient to satisfy the purposes of deterrence of the community, of denunciation and of recognition of the harm done to the community.
	
	
	As relevant to this last aspect, namely the harm done to the community, extremely moving victim impact statements were read in Court by or on behalf of the deceased’s mother and father. These bore testimony to the shattering impact of this offence on all who knew Jed Coates, particularly his immediate family. On behalf of the Court, I extend my heart-felt condolences to them. They may well consider that the sentence I am about to impose is quite inadequate, having regard to the extent of their loss. I hope that they understand that the loss suffered by them and the community is but one of the many factors to be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for murder is imprisonment for life, with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Since the High Court judgment in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 25, it has been accepted that the standard non-parole period constitutes a guide post rather than a starting point, as had previously been considered.
	
	
	As already indicated, I consider the objective culpability involved in the present offence to be well below the midline, for reasons I have already given. In addition, virtually all the subjective factors relating to the offender personally are very positive. A further relevant matter is the offender’s serious spinal condition, which is likely to make the prison environment particularly harsh for him.
	
	
	As to the discount attributable to the offender’s plea of guilty, Mr Peluso, who appeared for the offender, suggested that a discount of 15% would be appropriate in this case. The Crown prosecutor submitted that such a discount would be too high, given that the plea was only entered at the commencement of the trial. However she conceded that it did have high utilitarian value, as the Crown was proposing to call 53 witnesses at the trial. In the circumstances, I propose to allow a discount of 12.5%. The non-parole period I propose to impose will be very slightly below the statutory ratio set out in s.44 of the Act. The offender’s serious spinal condition, which will almost certainly make imprisonment particularly arduous for him, constitute special circumstances which justify this approach.
	
	
	The offender has been charged with three additional offences relating to his possession of the firearm which was used in this offence. He has requested that they be taken into account when sentencing him for the present offence. Given that they are comparatively minor charges and are inherently connected with the current offence, it is, in my view, highly appropriate to do so. Accordingly, in sentencing the offender for the offence of murder I am taking those three further offences into account.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 19 June 2014, and his sentence is to commence on that date.
	
	
	Matthew James Perry, for the murder of Jed Coates, and taking into account the offences on Form One, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years commencing on 19 June 2014 and expiring on 18 June 2027, with an additional term of 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 19 June 2027 and expiring on 18 December 2031, making a total sentence of 17 years and 6 months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 18 June 2027.

2877951,Younan v R [2016] NSWCCA 248,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth), s 400.4(1). The case against the appellant was that, at his request, an accountant with whom he had an intimate relationship fraudulently submitted business activity statements to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and, having received refunds from the ATO, caused those monies to be paid to the appellant. Those payments formed the basis of the proceeds of crime charge.

During the trial, two applications for the discharge of the jury were made by counsel for the appellant and refused by the trial judge. The applications were made on the basis that a witness, the accountant who had been responsible for submitting the business activity statements, had given evidence prejudicial to the appellant. The witness had made statements to the effect that the appellant had threatened both her and her family, and that the appellant had made remarks about kidnapping an ex-partner.

The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years upon his entering into a recognisance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for the rest of the term. He was also ordered to pay reparation in the sum of $322,600.

On appeal the appellant raised a number of matters concerning the conduct of the trial at first instance, many of which related to the evidence given by the accountant and the way the Crown conducted the prosecution case.

The matters that arose for determination on appeal were:

i)   Whether the conviction should be set aside on the ground that the trial judge erred by failing to discharge the jury after prejudicial remarks were made about the appellant by a witness called by the Crown;

ii)   Whether the conviction should be set aside on the ground that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice by reason of the appellant not being afforded a fair trial;

iii)   Whether the conviction should be set aside on the ground that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice due to the incompetence of counsel;

iv)   Whether the conviction should be set aside on the ground that the appellant had been unduly pressured into signing a statement of agreed facts;

v)   Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Held:

In relation to i)

1.   In reviewing a refusal to discharge a jury the appellate court must decide for itself whether the result of the refusal to discharge the jury resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice. [34]

Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427; [1996] HCA 22; R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53; Santo v R [2009] NSWCCA 269; R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703; Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 206.

2.   There was no error in the trial judge making reference to the expense of a discharge of the jury in circumstances where this was referred to as one of a number of considerations. [42]

3.   The trial judge did not err in considering that the remarks made by the witness could be adequately dealt with by appropriate directions. [46]

In relation to ii)

1.   The prosecution was conducted in a proper manner. [54]-[58]

2.   None of the materials presented by the appellant gave rise to any substantial concerns regarding the evidence given by the accountant. [61]

3.   Evidence given by the accountant after directions were given by the trial judge to limit her evidence was not unsolicited evidence of matters that might have been subject to criminal charges or matters that were not part of the Crown brief and were prejudicial to the appellant. [66]-[68]

4.   The Crown did not conflate the separate and distinct offences of the appellant and the accountant in a way that could have been misused by the jury. [74]

5.   The Crown did not adduce inadmissible, irrelevant, misleading, vague, or confusing evidence in relation to the appellant. [81]

6.   The Crown did not engage in extensive repetitive questioning. [82]

7.   No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the use of leading questions in examination of the accountant by the Crown. [83]

8.   Evidence of the accountant concerning her conviction for related offences was in no way misleading or unfair and created no risk of misuse. [90]

9.   Having regard to the matters referred to at 1-8 the appellant had not established that there had been a miscarriage of justice. [92]-[93]

Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614; [2006] HCA 9

In relation to iii)

1.   There are circumstances where something that has occurred in the course of a trial as a consequence of flagrant incompetence of counsel will have caused a miscarriage of justice. [95]-[96]

R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; Tsiakas v R [2015] NSWCCA 187.

2.   It was apparent that trial counsel was alive to the issues in the trial and competently represented the applicant. [103]

In relation to iv)

1.   In some circumstances it is appropriate to set aside on appeal a plea of guilty or other concession of an accused person on the basis of a miscarriage of justice.

Loury v R [2010] NSWCCA 158.

2.   Both trial counsel and the appellant signed the agreed facts, and the agreed facts were supported by documentary evidence and were, to that extent, not contentious. [119]

3.   It was unnecessary to make any findings as to whether the appellant understood the agreed facts as that agreement did not impact upon the appellant’s defence. [120]

In relation to v)

1.   The trial judge did not err in his approach to the appellant’s age as this was not a case where it was suggested that the appellant’s immaturity was a significant factor in the offending conduct. [135]-[136]

KT v R (2008) 182 A Crim R 571; [2008] NSWCCA 51; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397; R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37.

2.   Notwithstanding the trial judge’s compliance with s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the language used by the trial judge indicated that the trial judge erred in making a finding of special circumstances. [159]

Crimes Act (Cth), s 16A; Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 44; Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; [1990] HCA 18; Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45.

3.   That being the case, it was necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. [173]

Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3); Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 702; [2001] NSWCCA 534.

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: On 25 February 2014, the appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of dealing in the proceeds of crime, being money or property worth $100,000 or more, contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth), s 400.4(1). The maximum penalty for the offence is a term of imprisonment of 20 years and/or 1,200 penalty units.
	
	
	On 1 May 2015, the trial judge, Knox SC DCJ, sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 25 February 2015 and expiring on 24 February 2019 upon his entering into a recognisance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for the remainder of the term. The balance of the term will expire on 24 February 2021. A reparation order in the sum of $322,600 was also made.
	
	
	The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	By his grounds of appeal the appellant contended:
	



	
	that the trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury after the principal Crown witness, Leah Ostermeyer, made prejudicial remarks in relation to the appellant: ground 1;
	
	
	that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice in that the appellant did not have a fair trial: ground 1A;
	
	
	that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice due to the incompetence of counsel: ground 1B;
	
	
	that the appellant was unduly pressured in to signing the agreed facts: ground 1C;
	
	
	that the sentence imposed was too severe: ground 2.
	


Background


	
	The Crown case against the appellant was that at his request, Ms Ostermeyer, who was an accountant and with whom he was in an intimate relationship, fraudulently submitted business activity statements to the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the names of non-existent entities, and claimed GST refunds in the names of those entities. The appellant provided details to Ms Ostermeyer to be included in the false applications for GST refunds.
	
	
	Upon receipt of the refunds from the ATO, Ms Ostermeyer deposited the monies into her own accounts and later either paid the appellant cash or transferred funds into accounts in his name. In total, over the period 14 June 2006 to 4 September 2007, Ms Ostermeyer transferred $322,600 into the appellant’s accounts. The Crown characterised the evidence that it led from Ms Ostermeyer as being that she provided money to the appellant initially because she was charmed by him and subsequently because of threats made by him.
	
	
	There was no dispute a trial that the appellant had received the funds from Ms Ostermeyer. The issue was whether the appellant believed the monies were the proceeds of crime. It was the Crown case that, regardless of why Ms Ostermeyer provided the money to the appellant, he at all times knew that it was sourced from fraudulent GST returns. The appellant’s case was that Ms Ostermeyer paid the monies into his accounts in the context of their relationship, as an informal loan for their common purposes, including social spending, as well as for his own personal expenditure, and that he had no knowledge that the monies had been fraudulently obtained.
	
	
	Before dealing with the individual grounds of appeal, something needs to be said about the way the matter proceeded before this Court. The appellant originally raised one ground of appeal against conviction being the issue raised by ground 1 referred to above. Written submissions under the hand of senior counsel were filed in support of that ground of appeal. Subsequently, additional submissions were filed by counsel who appeared on the appeal which raised additional grounds 1A, 1B and 1C. This was not attended to by the filing of an amended notice of appeal. The Crown filed submissions in response to all submissions.
	
	
	In oral submissions on the hearing of the appeal, the appellant’s counsel, after questioning from the Bench, withdrew ground 1 and the submissions filed in support of it and also withdrew portions of ground 1A.
	
	
	Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the appellant, who by this time was unrepresented, sought leave to re-open the case and to reinstate those grounds of appeal that had been withdrawn. That leave was granted and directions were made for the filing of any further submissions. The appellant personally filed further submissions on 16 June 2016 to which the Crown filed a response on 6 July 2016.
	
	
	It must be said that the submissions of senior counsel, and of junior counsel who appeared on the initial hearing of the appeal, were unsatisfactory in many respects, particularly in the form in which they were presented to the Court, but also in respect of any analysis of the issues raised as a ground of appeal. Of 31 unnumbered pages of senior counsel’s submissions of 11 November 2015, only approximately 4-5 pages comprised any argument or analysis. The balance contained long extracts of his Honour’s summing up to the jury, extracts of judgments given during the course of the hearing and some extracts of transcript.
	
	
	The oral submissions made by counsel at the hearing were also problematic in various respects. It is for these reasons the Court granted leave to the appellant to reinstate all grounds of appeal, notwithstanding substantial overlap, particularly as between ground 1 as originally advanced and ground 1A. These reasons accordingly deal with all grounds of appeal and all submissions filed by or on behalf of the appellant and the responses of the Crown. The consequence has been a delay in the delivery of reasons as the Court was required to deal with the detail of numerous sub-grounds of appeal. The written and oral submissions of senior and junior counsel were well below a reasonable standard that the Court is entitled to expect.
	


CONVICTION APPEAL

Ground 1: failure to “abort the trial” after prejudicial remarks about the appellant


	
	This ground was directed to the trial judge’s failure to discharge the jury after Ms Ostermeyer gave evidence which the appellant contended was both highly prejudicial and unresponsive to the questions asked of her.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the evidence was given need to be recounted in a little detail.
	
	
	In her evidence in chief, Ms Ostermeyer gave evidence that she continued to commit the frauds on the ATO so as to give money to the appellant notwithstanding that she was no longer in a relationship with him:
	


“Because he threatened to tell my family, my bosses, the ATO, the police, everything that happened -- …

…

… and towards the end he also threatened to kill me and my family.”


	
	Ms Ostermeyer also gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. You mentioned some verbal threats that he made?

A. Yes.

Q. Has he ever done anything other than verbally threaten you?

A. He has hit me a couple of time.

Q. Is that related at all to these frauds?

A. Not only, no.”


	
	Some time later, trial counsel raised a concern about Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence of a threat to kill her on the basis that she had not previously made any such allegation. The trial judge requested that the Crown Prosecutor confer with Ms Ostermeyer before commencement of proceedings the next day.
	
	
	The next day, 18 February 2015, before conferring with Ms Ostermeyer, the Crown acknowledged that she had not previously made a statement or given specific evidence of the use of the word “kill” or death threats. However, she had given evidence in the criminal proceedings against her that the appellant had said, “if I don’t help any more watch what’ll happen, what what’ll happen to your family”. After conferring with Ms Ostermeyer, the Crown informed the Court that she had confirmed that the appellant had threatened her with words to the effect of, “I will kill you and your family”.
	
	
	Later in the proceedings on that day, the appellant’s counsel adverted to the evidence given the previous day, set out above at [15], and sought a discharge of the jury on the basis that that evidence was prejudicial to the appellant. The trial judge rejected the application on the basis that the evidence was “part of the context and there [was] no real prejudice to the [appellant]”. His Honour was of the view that the evidence that had precipitated the application could be dealt with in cross-examination. His Honour was also of the view that the defence had not been caught unaware by that evidence, as Ms Ostermeyer’s statements were replete with comments about the appellant being extremely violent.
	
	
	There is no appeal against his Honour’s rejection of this application, although the appellant relies upon it contextually as indicating that there was a build up of prejudice over the course of Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence.
	
	
	Later on the same day, in cross-examination by trial counsel, Ms Ostermeyer gave further evidence of which complaint was made. That evidence, and the circumstances in which it was given, was as follows:
	


“Q. Then when you gave him the $8,000 what did he say, can you recall?

A. That that money will really help him stay out of gaol for kidnapping his ex partner.

KLARICA: Your Honour this witness --

WITNESS: That’s what he said.

KLARICA: This witness your Honour --

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Klarica we will just take this calmly. Just concentrate on the questions you are being asked.

WITNESS: He asked me what was said that’s exactly what was said.

HIS HONOUR: That’s the case, I think Mr Klarica, I think we better proceed on that basis.

KLARICA: Yes your Honour with respect.

Q. Madam, that is just a lie.

A. Okay.

HIS HONOUR

Q. You don’t agree with that?

A. No I don’t agree with that, but that’s what you’re saying, so if you went back to your court records.

KLARICA

Q. You are trying at every level, or you will be trying at every level to say things against Mr Younan, aren’t you?

A. No I’m telling the truth.

Q. You hate him that much now, don’t you?

A. No I really don’t care what happens to him any more. It doesn’t matter.

Q. Which means you don’t like him at all do you?

A. I don’t care if he walks out of here, I don’t care if he goes to gaol, it doesn’t matter to me any more, because I was punished for what I did.

Q. Madam, so you have this $8,000 you say, you say – didn’t he just thank you, didn’t he say, ‘Oh thanks Leah for this $8,000 you’re great’, something like that?

A. No I already told you what he said.”


	
	On the basis of this evidence, and particularly the reference to a kidnapping, the appellant made another application for the discharge of the jury. By ground 1 of the appeal, the appellant contends that his Honour’s refusal of that application was in error.
	


Trial judge’s reasons for refusing the application to discharge the jury


	
	The trial judge, in dealing with the application to discharge the jury, noted that two bases for discharge had been advanced. first, the specific comment relating to the kidnapping, read in the context of the cross-examination preceding and immediately following it; and secondly, the cumulative prejudicial effect on the jury of hearing that evidence, combined with evidence as to assaults that occurred during the course of the relationship, as well as that of other threats to kill her and her family.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the evidence as to the kidnapping was not relevant, and that the substantial issue for his determination was whether, in the circumstances, there had been irrevocable or irreparable prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the jury assessment of Ms Ostermeyer’s credit would be “the essential matter”. His Honour also considered it relevant to consider how the evidence arose. In this regard, his Honour considered that Ms Ostermeyer’s answer in which she referred to the appellant having kidnapped his ex-girlfriend was in response to an “open question”, viz, “what did he say?”.
	
	
	His Honour acknowledged that the gravamen of the application to discharge the jury was the contention that “this answer manifested a deliberate intention to denigrate the accused”. His Honour considered, however, that defence counsel would have been aware of the likelihood of this matter being ventilated, although his Honour acknowledged that trial counsel was entitled to rely on Ms Ostermeyer complying with the instructions given to her by the Crown “not to open up these kinds of matters”.
	
	
	His Honour did not consider that there had been any deliberate attempt by Ms Ostermeyer to derail the trial and concluded:
	


“… I do not think that there is a risk that the jury would be overtly or irreparably prejudiced at this stage, particularly in light of the fact that I am proposing that they be given a direction to ignore irrelevant matters and that the transcript will be given to them with irrelevant matters taken out of it.”


	
	His Honour added that there were a number of essentially secondary considerations in coming to that decision, including that it was day 7 of the trial and there had already been substantial delays, which caused difficulties both for witness recollection and for the management of the court; and that there had been considerable expense to both the Crown and the defence, which was privately funded.
	


Submissions


	
	The appellant complains that his Honour erred in his determination of that application in the following respects. First, by taking into account the cost to the defence, in circumstances where the application was made by the appellant. Secondly, because the prejudicial effect of the evidence was irreparable. It was submitted in this regard that Ms Ostermeyer had displayed an emotional presentation of fear of the appellant such that the jury would have believed he had abused her both emotionally and physically. The appellant complained that abhorrence of such conduct by the community “would almost certainly have caused the jury to despise him regardless of the issues in the trial”.
	
	
	The appellant complained that the evidence of the assaults were in fact irrelevant because they related to a time well after the occurrences of the subject offence. It was then contended that Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence as to the “kidnapping” had the effect of cementing an image of the appellant as “being an abuser of women … for his own gain”. It was submitted, therefore, that in the circumstances there was a “high degree of necessity” for the discharge of the jury. The appellant relied upon the principles stated in Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427; [1996] HCA 22.
	
	
	In his further submissions filed on 16 June 2016, the appellant submitted:
	


“The Trial Judge allowed Ms Ostermeyer to present evidence to the jury that was unfairly prejudicial towards me. This included claims of myself making threats to Ms Ostermeyer and her family. However, there were never any police reports or evidence to prove Ms Ostermeyer’s claim, from the date of the alleged offences until present. Further, Ms Ostermeyer claimed to have feared for her safety at the time she was charged, however, she declined witness protection when it was offered to her. She had never made a complaint about fear prior to this time.”

Discharge of the jury: legal principles


	
	The principles that govern the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion in determining an application to discharge a jury were stated in Crofts where Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed, at 440, that:
	


“No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial.”


	
	As their Honours further stated, at 440:
	


“The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact.”


	
	Their Honours explained, at 441, that the duty of an appellate court, in reviewing a refusal to discharge a jury, was “not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind”. Rather, an appellate court “must also decide for itself whether, in [the] circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice”. 
	
	
	The circumstances giving rise to the application to discharge the jury in Crofts concerned the admission of inadmissible evidence. In that context, the plurality stated, at 441, that the appellate court must consider whether it can “say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable”.
	
	
	Consistently with the principle stated in Croft this Court in the earlier decision of R v Marsland (NSWCCA, 17 July 1991, unreported) had stated:
	


“[T]he question we must ask ourselves is whether we can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred.”


	
	In R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329, Mason P and Barr J observed, at [80], citing Crofts, that “[t]he criterion for the exercise of the discretion [to discharge the jury] was the maintenance of the fairness of the trial” and that “[t]he test for the discharge of the jury was one of necessity”. In their Honours’ view, at [82], the trial judge in that case had been “correct in observing that a jury is generally likely to follow an instruction to ignore evidence which has been struck out”, and they rejected the appellant’s argument that the jury would have been unable to comply with a direction to put certain prejudicial material out of their mind.
	
	
	Likewise, in Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53, I observed, at [51], that it is clear from the authorities “that it is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge as to what course to take when an irregularity has occurred” and that “appropriate directions may, in certain circumstances, be sufficient”.
	
	
	These observations have been applied in subsequent decisions of the Court, with emphasis upon: the discretionary nature of the decision whether to discharge the jury; whether the Court is satisfied that any irregularity, the subject of the application for discharge, had not affected the verdict; and the adequacy of any direction given to the jury: see Santo v R [2009] NSWCCA 269 at [50]-[51]; R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703 at [18]. In Ahola Button J also observed, at [17], that the authorities did not require or encourage trial judges to take an overly sensitive approach to the accidental receipt of prejudicial material.
	
	
	The applicable principles were again reviewed and summarised in Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 206 by the Court (myself, Fullerton and Hamill JJ) at [126] as follows:
	


“…

(2)   In deciding an application to discharge the jury, key considerations include:

(a)   the fairness of the trial: Crofts at 440;

(b)   the nature of the statements said to have given rise to the prejudice, including whether they were such as to ‘have been left vividly etched on the mind of the jury’: Crofts at 441;

(c)   the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues: Crofts at 440;

(d)   the stage at which the mishap occurs: Crofts at 440; Maric [v R (1978) 52 ALJR 631] at 635;

(e)   the deliberateness of the wrongful conduct: Crofts at 440; Maric at 635;

(f)   the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome the apprehended impact of the evidence, and particularly the difficulty of formulating a direction that does not refer specifically to the evidence and by doing so reinforce the prejudice: Crofts at 440-441; Maric at 635.

…

(4)   The test to be applied by appellate courts reviewing the discretion to discharge has been stated in a variety of ways. However, in Maric, at 635, it was noted that ‘[a]t basis, the question is whether [the court] can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict’, and in Crofts, at 441, the question was put similarly as whether, in the circumstances, the appellate court can ‘say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable’.

(5)   Significant leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations, bearing in mind:

‘… that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript’: Crofts at 440-441.

(6)   Nevertheless, the duty of an appellate court considering a challenge to the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge ‘is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind’: Crofts at 441, but rather must apply the broader test stated at (4) above.”

Consideration


	
	As was pointed out by the Crown, the question of wasted costs was raised by trial counsel in his submissions to the trial judge as to why the jury should be discharged. Counsel’s submission was to the effect that, although, if the jury was discharged, there would have been the expenditure of public monies, that did not include any expenditure on the appellant’s legal costs as he was privately represented and was not in receipt of legal aid. Counsel stated to the trial judge that the appellant, therefore, “loses far more in terms of any monies and the like”.
	
	
	It was in that context that his Honour made reference to there having been considerable expense to both the Crown and the defence. His Honour’s comment was made towards the end of his judgment and it is apparent from his comment that he considered it to be a relevant matter. However, he referred to it as one of a number of considerations that were “secondary to the rights of the defence to have a fair trial”. There was no error in his Honour making reference to this matter in the manner that he did.
	
	
	His Honour acknowledged that Ms Ostermeyer’s reference to the kidnapping was not relevant and recognised that a jury may react in a variety of ways to such evidence. However, his Honour observed that the essential matter was going to be the jury’s assessment of Ms Ostermeyer’s credit.
	
	
	It was also relevant, as his Honour observed, that the Crown had not opened up this area of questioning and that the matter had been raised in cross-examination, in answer to an open question asked by the appellant’s trial counsel. Further, the transaction about which Ms Ostermeyer was being questioned and in respect of which she gave the impugned response, was not one in respect of monies which formed part of the proceeds with which the appellant was charged. His Honour considered that the matter could be appropriately be dealt with by removing this reference from the transcript. It appears that was done and the matter was not further raised by his Honour, by the Crown, or by trial counsel during the course of the trial.
	
	
	His Honour was not prepared to find that trial counsel must have known of the response that Ms Ostermeyer would give to the question asked by the appellant’s trial counsel. However, in its submission on the appeal, the Crownpointed out that the assertion as to the kidnapping had been made by Ms Ostermeyer in her police record of interview, in her evidence in her sentence proceedings and in her police statement, all of which had been made available to the defence, such that it could not be said that this material was not known to the appellant’s legal representatives. This was the basis for the Crown submission on the appeal that the decision to ask the question must have been a tactical one. For my part, I do not consider that there is material before the Court that allows that inference to be drawn.
	
	
	His Honour correctly directed himself as to the principles to apply in determining the application. Ms Ostermeyer gave an answer which was directly responsive to a question asked by the defence and which related to a matter of which the defence may be taken to have been aware. The factors considered by his Honour in respect of the difficulties which would be occasioned by a retrial were relevant. In those circumstances, I do not consider that his Honour erred in considering that the matter could be adequately dealt with by appropriate directions and the removal of the irrelevant evidence from the transcript.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 1A: substantial miscarriage of justice


	
	The appellant submitted that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice in the respects enumerated in paras (i)-(viii) of the further submissions filed on the conviction appeal. Notwithstanding the abandonment of paras (i)-(v) of this ground by counsel during the hearing of the appeal, each call for consideration in circumstances where I have accepted that the grounds of appeal should be reinstated.
	
	
	As will be apparent from the various sub-grounds, it is contended that there was a miscarriage of justice in the process of the trial such as either to deprive this Court of the ability to assess the strength of the Crown case against the appellant or alternatively that there was such a failure to observe the conditions essential to a satisfactory trial that it would be unjust or unsafe to allow the appellant’s conviction to stand.
	
	
	In support of those propositions, counsel on the appeal referred the Court to the principles stated in Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614; [2006] HCA 9 at [6]. In that passage, in the context of a discussion of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), Gleeson CJ considered the nature of a miscarriage of justice:
	


“Some irregularities ‘may’ involve no miscarriage of justice if the appellate court forms a certain opinion about the strength of the case against the appellant. The corollary of that proposition is that a defect in process may be of such a nature that its effect cannot be overcome by pointing to the strength of the prosecution case. It is impossible to state exhaustively, or to define categorically, the circumstances in which such a defect will occur. In Mraz v The Queen [(1955) 93 CLR 493; [1955] HCA 59 at 514], Fullagar J said that ‘every accused person is entitled to a trial in which the relevant law is correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence are strictly followed’ and that, if there is a failure in any of those respects ‘and the appellant may thereby have lost a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted’, then there is a miscarriage of justice. That well-known passage relates the failure of process to the loss of a chance of acquittal. Even though it is impossible and undesirable to attempt to reduce miscarriages of justice to a single formula, there is at least one circumstance in which a failure of process cannot be denied the character of a miscarriage of justice on the ground of the appellate court’s view of the strength of the prosecution case. That is where the consequence of the failure of process is to deprive the appellate court of the capacity justly to assess the strength of the case against the appellant. There may be other circumstances in which a departure from the requirements of a fair trial according to law is such that an appellate court will identify what occurred as a miscarriage of justice, without undertaking an assessment of the strength of the prosecution case. If there has been a failure to observe the conditions which are essential to a satisfactory trial and, as a result, it appears unjust or unsafe to allow a conviction to stand, then the appeal will be allowed.”

Para (i): The prosecution was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with the proper conduct of a Crown prosecution


	
	The appellant contended that he did not have a fair trial in circumstances where the prosecution was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with the proper conduct of a Crown prosecution. This included the failure of the Crown Prosecutor to properly or adequately confer with the key Crown witness, Ms Ostermeyer, before empanelling the jury, before giving an opening address to the jury, and before adducing evidence from that witness. The appellant submitted that, had there been adequate conferral, Ms Ostermeyer would not have made the inadmissible statements discussed above in respect of ground 1. Reliance was placed upon passages of the transcript of the trial from 17 and 18 February 2015. The context in which the discussion in those passages took place had commenced earlier when Ms Ostermeyer stated in her evidence in chief that, “towards the end he also threatened to kill me and my family”. The transcript upon which the appellant relied, taken with the transcript immediately before and after those nominated portions, is set out below:
	


“[Tuesday 17 February 2015]

CROWN PROSECUTOR: … There’s another matter I wanted to raise … and that is that I was conscious about asking Ms Ostermeyer about why she feared for her life.

HIS HONOUR: … the answer that she gave was ‘I feared for my own safety. I didn’t want to risk anyone else.’

CROWN PROSECUTOR: And she also said ‘He threatened my life and the life of my family’.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I didn’t want to explore that at the risk that she might refer to things that are not associated to this trial but which may have founded a legitimate fear in her mind if she had been told those things at the time.

HIS HONOUR: Well that’s one of the reasons I stopped before cross-examination starts is to give you the opportunity to confer on that to make sure that she doesn’t go into – I mean I don’t know what Mr Younan is charged with anywhere else. I don’t know his background.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour --

HIS HONOUR: I think you ought to confer on that to make sure that it is admissible and relevant to that issue of fear and then subject to what your hard working solicitor can do in terms of notes, let your opponent know what’s happening about that because I don’t want him prejudiced nor the Crown prejudiced by what becomes a very significant issue.

…

… Do you know what she’s going to say or roughly.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No I don’t. I’ve had a limited conference with her. …

… I haven’t spent anywhere near the amount of time with her that I would with a witness of this importance in a case. Having said that I don’t know what she’s going to say but I did give her clear instructions that even if she thought that was what her answer might be to something that was raised in examination or in cross-examination she shouldn’t say it and that the issue would be raised in her absence, as I’m doing now, because I’m concerned that it might be now …

HIS HONOUR: It becomes, you see it becomes a significant issue now. Appropriately, Mr Klarica didn’t object as to form but at the moment they’re generic terms and it is, on the basis of the jury either accepting or rejecting that account that in my view, one of the crucial issues in this case will rise or fall. So I think you should be doing that provided you give a copy of what the conference notes are on that respect to Mr Klarica.

…

[Wednesday 18 February 2015]

HIS HONOUR: Good morning, what’s the state of play Mr Crown? Have you been able to confer with the witness about those matters?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I haven’t been able to confer with her at all your Honour, we have been waiting for her to arrive this morning, she hasn’t arrived yet and I wasn’t able to do so yesterday after court, she disappeared into thin air and no one could find her, so I am not any further advanced on those issues.

I can tell your Honour that I have been through the transcript of her evidence before Judge Williams, and through the police record of interview and both times she refers to threats of physical, what appears to be harm.

…

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Does not refer to the word ‘kill’ or death threats.

HIS HONOUR: No.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I think in her evidence before Judge Williams she says something to the effect of ‘what what’ll happen to your family’ or --

HIS HONOUR: Yes that’s right, I checked it last night myself.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The line 35 of page 19, he said, ‘If I don’t help any more watch what’ll happen, watch what’ll happen to your family’. Now that could be, and threatened her, me and my family, that can be interpreted in different ways, but if that’s what he said that’s what her evidence ought to be not the conclusion and I’d like the opportunity to speak with her and --

HIS HONOUR: I think we should and then you’ve --

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Confer that, and if there’s a way of distilling that away from what she’d said earlier, I can do it without it being brought unnecessarily to the jury’s attention.”


	
	The appellant’s submissions in respect of this ground omitted to refer to what happened following this last exchange. There was an adjournment shortly afterwards to enable the trial judge to read trial counsel’s written submissions in respect of an argument that related to certain telephone intercept material the Crown had sought to tender. As is apparent from the transcript, when the court resumed, the Crown had spoken with Ms Ostermeyer and informed the court as to the evidence that she would give. The Crown also informed the court that Ms Ostermeyer had been warned not to raise certain matters, such as making any reference to the appellant’s association with motorbike gangs. The following exchange then occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR: She will not say that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Or gangs and she will not say that.

HIS HONOUR: No.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Because the fact of the matter is that until she was arrested she herself did not see him as having any gang associates or anything like that.

HIS HONOUR: No.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: But she took those as threats from him. I asked her what the words were, similar to as I asked in the witness box what were the words because I wanted to know whether or not it was her take on some other words, she said no, the actual words were ‘I will kill your family and I will kill you.’ So that’s that evidence. Given my friend’s position I would be content if your Honour wanted to hear it on a voir dire and have --

HIS HONOUR: No, if you say that is what she is going to say.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Now on that respect Mr Klarica do you need any more time, any more detail, I mean you and I both know that now, it is not going to get any better by adjournment, that is what I am thinking.

KLARICA: I don’t think so.

HIS HONOUR: No.

KLARICA: It is out there.

HIS HONOUR: It is out there now.

…

HIS HONOUR: That does not denigrate from your foreshadowed application for the trial to be aborted but we will deal with that when we deal with that.

KLARICA: That is not an issue, yes.”


	
	Whilst it is apparent that the Crown would have preferred to have had more time to confer with Ms Ostermeyer, he was in fact able to confer with her and did so following the exchange upon which the appellant relied. Following that conference with Ms Ostermeyer, the Crown informed the Court of the evidence that she would give and what she had been directed not to say.
	
	
	Subject to the matter dealt with below in respect of ground 1A(iii), the appellant’s submissions in support of this ground made no other complaint about any evidence Ms Ostermeyer gave subsequent to this. The appellant had, of course, under ground 1, made complaint about the kidnapping evidence, which was given after the evidence to which ground 1A(i) is directed. In my opinion, it is relevant to this ground that the Crown brief that had been served on the appellant included the evidence to which reference is made at [52] above, so that the appellant was well aware of the extent of the evidence that was to be led as to the abusive and violent nature of the relationship with the appellant.
	
	
	It is also apparent from the exchange on 18 February 2015, extracted above at [51], in which his Honour determined not to examine Ms Ostermeyer on the voir dire, that he was satisfied that there had been an appropriate conference with her.
	
	
	Finally, to the extent that this ground was directed to Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence being prejudicial to the appellant, this has been dealt with in relation to ground 1. For the reasons I gave there, I do not consider that the admission of the evidence of itself, in the circumstances, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The appellant also contended in support of this ground that the Crown had adduced evidence of numerous and complex transactions in a vague, generalised manner. This ground was not particularised or otherwise explained. It remained a mere assertion. Further, contrary to the assertion, the Crown pointed to Exhibits 8 and 10 being a Schedule of Banking evidence and Banking Transaction Flow Chart which, although detailed, provided an uncomplicated and uncontested summary of the transactions that underlay the charge.
	
	
	Ground 1A(i) is rejected.
	


Para (ii): There were serious concerns as to the integrity of Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence


	
	The appellant submitted that “there were serious concerns about the integrity of the evidence of Ms Ostermeyer, and to the propriety of her conduct during the time in which she gave evidence and whilst she was out of the witness box”. The particular matter of concern was that, as appeared from the trial transcript of 19 February 2015, there was a suggestion that Ms Ostermeyer had discussed or sought to discuss her evidence with a friend. The Crown indicated to the trial judge that any warning or direction might better come from him. His Honour addressed Ms Ostermeyer, who had come into the court room but was not in the witness box, as follows:
	


“… regardless of your desire, understandable as it is to complete your evidence, it must be done in a proper way.

Now, I’d ask you to bear that in mind and also what I’ve said which is why I want Ms Johnson in here as well, it’s been suggested to me that there were discussions which took place after the Court closed yesterday which may leave or give rise to the view that you were discussing the evidence. I don’t know whether that’s the case or not, I simply don’t know, but I have reiterated this to both of you that you must not discuss the evidence in the circumstances.

… I’m not asking for a response, I’m just indicating what the situation is so that you’re not wondering about it in the meantime. Do you follow all that? Thank you.”


	
	It is significant in this regard that when the Crown indicated to the trial judge that any admonition would be better coming from his Honour, the appellant’s trial counsel agreed with the course proposed and stated that he did not wish to be heard on the matter. Nor did trial counsel subsequently raise any issue or question as to the terms in which the admonition was delivered by his Honour.
	
	
	None of the materials referred to by the appellant in respect of this ground give rise to any substantial concerns regarding Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence.
	
	
	Ground 1A(ii) should be rejected.
	


Para (iii): Ms Ostermeyer defied the trial judge’s direction to limit her answers


	
	This ground related to directions given in respect of what the appellant characterised as Ms Ostermeyer improperly “volunteering” evidence of violence by the appellant. The first such direction was given in the course of the directions given to Ms Ostermeyer outlined above in respect of ground 1A(ii). On that occasion, the trial judge told Ms Ostermeyer:
	


“I know that you’ve had discussions with the Crown about limiting your responses, but there are legal consequences of a serious nature if the evidence is given in a way which can prejudice a fair trial.”


	
	The appellant contended that, after that direction, Ms Ostermeyer had again improperly volunteered allegations of violence in another exchange later that day, requiring further admonition by his Honour, as follows:
	


“[MR KLARICA]

Q. I’m going to put, suggest to you that on 1 October 2007 you stayed at Rydges with him. What do you say about that?

A. I have no recollection of staying there with him.

…

Q. I suggest to you that you stayed at Rydges on 21 December 2007 with him. What do you say about that?

A. I have no recollection of that.

Q. I suggest that you stayed with him on 26 January 2009 at Rydges?

A. That one I can remember because he assaulted me at that --

Q. You can remember that one?

A. – Rydges hotel.

Q. So you have stayed then at Rydges hotel?

A. I went to the Rydges hotel where he assaulted me --

HIS HONOUR: Just answer the question. In terms of the question whether you stayed there you were there but you didn’t stay there.

Q. Is that right?

A. I did not stay there because he assaulted me and I went home.

HIS HONOUR: We don’t need to go into that any further. I understand that, thank you.”


	
	Trial counsel continued with the cross-examination by asking questions about the assault that Ms Ostermeyer said occurred at Rydges. His source for those questions was her record of interview. In the same context, trial counsel also cross-examined Ms Ostermeyer to the effect that at that time, she was still in an intimate relationship with the appellant and that she had paid for the hotel on 26 January 2009 and on previous occasions.
	
	
	In my opinion, the answer of which the appellant now complains did not lead to any miscarriage of justice. There was a concern with Ms Ostermeyer giving unsolicited evidence of matters that might have been subject to criminal charges, such as the reference to the kidnapping charge, or in respect of matters that were not part of the Crown brief and which would be prejudicial to the appellant. This evidence did not, in my opinion, fall into either of those categories.
	
	
	Although Ms Ostermeyer gave evidence as to why she remembered this occasion of being at the hotel, it was evidence that was given to explain why she remembered the occasion. The fact that trial counsel immediately asked questions based upon her record of interview is indicative that he was anticipating that Ms Ostermeyer would give some such evidence. It is also apparent from the transcript that his intent in cross-examination was not only to establish that Ms Ostermeyer was still in an intimate relationship with the appellant, but also to establish that her denial, “was a lie”. In other words, it is apparent that trial counsel intended to and did use Ms Ostermeyer’s answer in her record of interview to attack her credibility.
	
	
	In my opinion, ground 1A(iii) should be rejected.
	


Para (iv): conflation of the distinct and separate offences alleged against the appellant and Ms Ostermeyer


	
	The appellant further complained that the Crown case conflated the separate and distinct offences of the appellant and Ms Ostermeyer, or, in the alternative, the Crown case was presented in a manner and in circumstances where there was a real risk that the evidence would be misused by the jury unfairly, in that they would conflate the separate and distinct offences.
	
	
	As I understand the appellant’s submissions on this ground, it was contended that the alleged conflation occurred because, although the appellant’s role in the fraud committed on the ATO was relevant only to the question of his knowledge as to the provenance of the monies which he received, the case was conducted with a “significant focus” on that role.
	
	
	It is to be remembered that this was a case where there were Agreed Facts in which the different offending conduct of Ms Ostermeyer and the appellant were clearly stated. It is also apparent that the assertion now made was not a concern at trial, given trial counsel’s address to the jury, as follows:
	


“… the only issue in the case … it’s always been what was the belief of the accused …

There’s no issue as to any of the other facts. Yes he received money; yes he spent money; yes – everything in those agreed facts have been agreed to by Mr Younan. He’s looked at it and he says, ‘Yep I agree with all that.’ except for the belief aspect and that’s what we’re looking at today. And that’s what you, no doubt is the ultimate issue that you would have to decide today.

I expect his Honour will be advising you of the four elements, you’ve already heard them, I’m not going to go through them again, because the only element that I’d be submitting will be of importance and that is contentious, is this element of belief, okay?”


	
	The trial judge in his summing up specifically stated:
	


“The Crown reminds you that Mr Younan is not charged with defrauding the ATO, but with the fact that he got the money and used it against the background of knowledge, which he must have had about the nature of those monies. He submits to you that even without Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence, there was sufficient other evidence to satisfy you that Mr Younan knew and must have known what was going on.”


	
	The appellant’s role in the fraud was clearly relevant to the main issue in the trial, being his knowledge of the provenance of the monies.
	
	
	In my opinion, the appellant has not established that the Crown conflated the separate and distinct offences of Ms Ostermeyer and the appellant or presented the case in a way that evidence could be misused by the jury. Ground 1A(iv) should be rejected.
	


Para (v): by adducing inadmissible and other evidence


	
	The appellant next contended that the Crown adduced a significant amount of evidence that was inadmissible, irrelevant, misleading, vague, or confusing, and that was unfairly prejudicial to him.
	
	
	Again, the appellant did not particularise any specific evidence that was said to satisfy any of the descriptions of which complaint is made. Rather, the appellant’s counsel on the appeal submitted that, “it was misleading not in the individual question - this is the difficulty I face and I accept that there’s no schedule [of evidence]”. The appellant also complained that some of Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence, when she was being shown Exhibit 8, which related to payments made by the ATO to Ms Ostermeyer, was responsive to leading questions.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that there was no necessity for Ms Ostermeyer to be questioned about Exhibit 8, when the document was already in evidence. The Appellant further contended that many of Ms Ostermeyer’s answers were to the effect that she did not remember the transaction but that “if it was in the document it must be correct”. The appellant submitted that this had the effect of giving undue weight to the evidence as it would give the jury the impression that she was giving evidence from her own memory. The appellant further complained that examining Ms Ostermeyer on the document was unnecessary in circumstances where there was a Statement of Agreed Facts.
	
	
	These submissions do not do justice to the evidence that was adduced with reference to the document Exhibit 8. The first portion of evidence of which the appellant complained was as follows:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Now, this is an exhibit in these proceedings and tendered with this exhibit are a number of bank statements which are in a folder, which I might take you to shortly. Take your time when looking at this exhibit and I want you just to see whether or not you – looking at the dates, the amounts that you were receiving from the ATO, whether that accords with your recollection generally of what you were receiving and when in the ATO?

A. Yeah, it looks right, yeah.

Q. And on the far right-hand side one column back from the right, do you see ‘Amount’ and ‘Date’?

A. Yes.

Q. That is a summary of the dates in which those respective amounts were paid into Mr Younan’s bank accounts?

A. Okay.”


	
	The examination which followed was in respect of specific transactions that Ms Ostermeyer was asked to explain. The following are portions of the evidence that was adduced in this manner:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Why didn’t you give him the $4,107?

A. Because part of it went to pay off a loan that he had in my name.

Q. What do you mean?

A. So I borrowed money.

Q. Yes?

A. Like I said before and he was meant to repay it, so this was his way of repaying the loan.

…

Q. Who made that payment?

A. I did.

Q. And that was in respect of the loan that you’re referring to?

A. Yes.

Q. GE CreditLine?

A. Yes.

Q. And after you made that payment how much money did you have in your account?

A. $9.27.

Q. You next received money from the ATO on 26 June?

A. Yes.

Q. And if you look at the schedule you can see that was also done in your own name?

A. Yep.

Q. $3,865?

A. Mm-hmm.

Q. Now, on that day you paid $1,200 into his account, why didn’t you pay the full amount into his account on that day?

A. Again, it was used – so other parts were taken out in cash for me to give to him and some of it was used to repay a credit card debt that he had accumulated on my credit cards.”


	
	As this portion of the evidence demonstrates, the examination on Exhibit 8 did not bear the characterisation that the appellant sought to give it. I also do not accept the submission of the appellant’s counsel that, looked at as a whole, the evidence on this topic was misleading or otherwise gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. The transactions required explanation and the Crown proceeded through the material in an orderly way. Examination on documents is often laborious. That does not render it lacking in relevance, nor does it give the evidence undue emphasis.
	
	
	I would reject ground 1A(v).
	


Para (vi): Repetitive questioning


	
	The appellant further submitted that there was extensive repetitive questioning by the Crown Prosecutor. There was no particularisation of this assertion, nor were any oral submissions directed to it. The ground should be rejected.
	


Para (vii): Extensive and improper use of leading questions


	
	The appellant next contended that there was extensive and improper use of leading questions by the Crown Prosecutor. The appellant relied upon his submissions in respect of ground 1A(v) in support of this ground. For the reasons given in respect of that ground, this ground should be rejected. Except to the extent that it was necessary to draw Ms Ostermeyer’s attention to a particular portion of the document, the evidence involved an explanation of the transactions which underlay the offence with which the appellant was charged. Thus, notwithstanding that some leading questions were used, no miscarriage of justice was occasioned. As no objection was raised at trial, leave to raise this ground is required: see Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.
	


Para (viii): Adducing evidence that was irrelevant or in respect of which there was a risk of misuse by the jury


	
	The appellant submitted that the Crown adduced evidence, particularly from Ms Ostermeyer, that was irrelevant and/or in circumstances where there was a real risk that the evidence would be misused by the jury in some unfair way. In particular, it was submitted that Ms Ostermeyer’s evidence would provoke an irrational, emotional, or illogical response, and cause the jury to give the evidence more weight than it deserved. The focus of this complaint was evidence that Ms Ostermeyer had served a term of full-time imprisonment arising from her related but separate offences and that she repaid $75,000 that related to her own legitimate loans.
	
	
	It was a central element of the Crown case that Ms Ostermeyer had committed fraud offences and that that was the source of the funds that she had channelled to the appellant.
	
	
	The evidence in relation to the loans was in a different category. Ms Ostermeyer was asked, at the commencement of her examination in chief, whether she remembered the first time that the appellant asked her for money and why she gave it to her. She said that took out a number of loans and gave the money to him. Those loans were described as legitimate borrowings and Ms Ostermeyer said that she repaid the monies as she was responsible for them. She also withdrew money on her credit card. Ms Ostermeyer said that the appellant told her he would make the repayments, but that he did not do so.
	
	
	That topic was linked to the evidence of the commencement of the fraud, and the appellant’s knowledge of it, as follows:
	


“Q. I’m going to ask you some questions about the first fraud that you committed. The one in your own name?

A. Yeah.

Q. … Do you remember whether you had any discussions with [the appellant] about that?

A. Yes. I could not physically borrow any more money from a bank. I was a trainee. I didn’t have the income to support the loans so the way for me to obtain money was through lodging activity statements. So when I said that I could not borrow any more money to give him that there was no way for me to get him more money he suggested for me to lodge the activity statements.”


	
	The evidence as to the loans was context evidence which was relevant to explain how it was that Ms Ostermeyer came to engage in illegal activities. It was directly relevant to proving the appellant’s role in, and knowledge of, those activities. There was no objection to the evidence given in chief and it was the subject of full cross-examination. I do not consider that there is substance in the appellant’s assertion of a risk that the evidence of the loans could be misused by the jury.
	
	
	Evidence as to Ms Ostermeyer’s conviction and prison sentence was also given in examination in chief. The relevant exchanges were as follows:
	


“Q. … You were arrested for you involvement in these frauds in December 2011. Is that correct?

A. June 2011.

Q. June 2011. You had stopped committing these offences for years earlier in September 2007. Is that right?

A. Yeah.

Q. Had you moved on with your life in some way from there?

A. Yes.

…

Q. … did you, in a general sense, talk to the police about what had happened with [the appellant]?

A. In my first interview.

Q. Yes?

A. No.

Q. Was it another interview, a later interview?

A. Yes.

Q. Why did you decide that you were going to tell the police about [the appellant]?

A. Because they convinced me that I shouldn’t be the only one to be punished for what has happened.

…

Q. You gave evidence in your sentencing hearing didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. Had somebody given you some advice that you might receive a discount if you gave evidence in your sentencing hearing about what had happened?

A. Yes.

…

Q Did you understand that discount was a discount of 20% of what would have been your sentence for what’s called future co-operation, that is giving evidence now and 10% in the past or you don’t know?

A. No I don’t know.

Q. But you understand that you received a discount of some months of your sentence?

A. Yes.”


	
	As is clear from these exchanges, the evidence as to Ms Ostermeyer’s convictions were relevant to her credibility, as she made no allegations in respect of the appellant until after she was arrested, and she was given a discount in sentence in return for giving evidence against the appellant. The evidence was in no way misleading or unfair and it created no risk of misuse; in fact, it was to the appellant’s advantage. Again, the evidence was not objected to and was the subject of cross-examination, in which it was suggested that “the sad reality is you have to stick to your story otherwise you will go back to gaol”.
	
	
	Ground 1A(viii) should be rejected.
	


Conclusion on ground 1A


	
	In my opinion, the appellant has not established, in accordance with the principles stated in Nudd, that there has been a miscarriage of justice. None of the specific errors alleged have been established nor is there any sense in which the factors, taken in aggregate, constituted a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Some of the specific errors alleged in ground 1A required the grant of leave pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. In the normal course, I would have rejected the grant of leave in respect of those grounds in accordance with the principles recently stated in Flaherty v R; R v Flaherty [2016] NSWCCA 188 at [15]-[16]. However, given the circumstances of the appellant’s legal representation in the case, to which reference has been made, I have considered it appropriate to grant leave to appeal where that is required. Having considered each paragraph of this ground as on appeal, I would reject ground 1A.
	


Ground 1B: incompetence of counsel


	
	The appellant submitted that a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred due to the incompetence of counsel, including by reason of the failure to appropriately object to the matters raised in relation to ground 1A, or to seek judicial directions or orders in respect of those matters.
	
	
	The relevant principles were expressed by Gleeson CJ in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685, as follows:
	


“The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows:

1.   A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.

2.   As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3.   However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.”


	
	In Tsiakas v R [2015] NSWCCA 187, this Court again examined the relevant principles that apply when an allegation of incompetence of counsel is raised, as follows:
	


“42.   In some circumstances the incompetence of Counsel acting for an accused person at a trial may be of such a kind that it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice justifying intervention by this Court. In such cases what needs to be considered is what ultimately did or did not occur at the trial, whether there was some material irregularity in the trial and whether there is a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial (Nudd … at [24] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [31]-[33] per Gaudron J, at [79] and [97] per McHugh J, at [101] per Gummow J and at [103]-[108] per Hayne J).

…

44.   … it is not sufficient to warrant intervention to simply point to some failing, even a gross failing, of the legal representative who appeared during the sentence proceedings. In conviction appeals, where incompetence to the relevant standard is demonstrated, the Court considers whether there is a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial (Nudd at [24]).


	
	In addition to the factors referred to in respect of ground 1A of the appeal, the appellant’s affidavit filed 4 May 2016 was also relevant to this ground of appeal. Initially, that affidavit was not read on the appeal. Having regard to the fact that the appellant, subsequent to judgment being reserved, became self-represented and seeks to have this material before the Court, it is appropriate to admit that evidence, which was, relevantly, as follows:
	


“4.   I instructed my legal advisors but they did not follow my instructions during the trial to object to evidence, being phone taps and other serious errors relating to the trial where, when Judge Knox suggested that the trial be aborted due to the recording system not recording evidence for over two hours my legal advisors advised me not to take that action. When my Counsel then told the Judge that the trial would not be aborted he asked the Judge whether there would be compensation to which the Judge said there would be.

5.   My Counsel then said to me that we should have aborted the trial. At this stage it was too late.

6.   After this refusal by my legal advisors I requested to my legal advisors to have the decision appealed in the Supreme Court which they refused to do.

…

8.   That on another occasion in the trial and during sentencing when Judge Knox stated that there was no evidence of a mortgage and no mortgage papers my legal advisors had this material but did not produce it. I had tendered papers to my legal team, the mortgage papers, which were not handed to the Judge during sentencing. The Judges sentencing remarks included that there is not evidence of proof Mr Younan owns any properties during sentencing proceedings.

9.   That on occasion when I asked the legal advisors to subpoena witnesses they did not follow my instructions and did not issue subpoenas or if they did then no witnesses attended court.

10.   My legal advisors did not follow instructions during the trial to object to evidence, being phone taps and other serious allegations.”


	
	Trial counsel responded to those allegations as follows:
	


“2.   In response to paragraph 4 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 I state that I followed instructions and did take objection with the admissibility of the phone tap evidence. With respect to the recording system failure I have no recollection of the conversation due to the passage of time however my instructing solicitor instructed me that that the appellant desired to proceed with the trial. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure ‘A’ is a copy of my instructing solicitor’s file note in that regard. I am unaware and do not recall any conversation with His Honour with respect to costs but I am sure it would have been recorded on the transcript.

3.   In response to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 I have no recollection of mentioning that the trial should have been aborted, nor do I have any recollection of being requested to appeal the matter. I do not understand how I can appeal a matter that was consented to.

…

5.   In response to paragraph 8 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 I have no recollection of any mortgage documents during the trial or the sentence. I enquired for my instructing solicitor as to whether he had received any mortgage documents and he stated he did not.

6.   In response to paragraph 9 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 the appellant’s instructions were followed with respect to issuing subpoenas. My instructing solicitor issued subpoenas to BDO Australia P/L, DRB Group P/L, ANZ Bank, Commonwealth Bank, NSW Police Force, NSW Crime Commission and the Rydges Hotel Bankstown. With respect to witnesses my instructing solicitor did speak to witnesses and although I have no recollection of the conversation had with respect to witnesses, my instructing solicitor obtained written instructions from the appellant with respect to the issue of calling witnesses. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure ‘B’ is a copy of those instructions.

7.   In response to paragraph 10 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 objection was taken with respect to the phone taps as well as many other objections which resulted in two applications to discharge the jury being made. The transcripts should reflect the objections as I do not have an independent recollection of what objections I made.”


	
	Annexures A and B to counsel’s affidavit were relevantly as follows:
	


“[Annexure A]

brought to J’s attention no recording from 2pm at 2.40pm

Discussion about how to proceed – whether trial should continue

I also accept that Maroun Phillippe is not available to come to court and I agree to proceed without him.

[Signature of Raymond Younan]

24.2.15”


	
	The appellant also complained as to the manner in which trial counsel cross-examined Ms Ostermeyer, including counsel’s apparent loss of temper at one point, which, it was said, may have unfairly influenced the jury and which was the subject of judicial comment. It is sufficient to say that there is no indication in the section of the transcript to which the appellant referred, or in the exchanges immediately preceding it, of any improper questioning. If the appellant intended to refer to what might be read as a subsequent sharp exchange with the trial judge, that only reflected trial counsel making clear to his Honour the questions he wanted to put to Ms Ostermeyer, and it occurred in the absence of the jury and of Ms Ostermeyer.
	
	
	The Crown, in its submissions, pointed to some nineteen sections of transcript in which trial counsel took objection to evidence and other matters occurring in the course of the trial. These objections and the applications for the discharge of the jury demonstrate that trial counsel in this case was both vigilant and careful in objecting to the evidence and in making applications as he considered appropriate. The affidavit evidence also demonstrates that he also followed instructions as and when required by the appellant. Another indicator of the vigilance with which trial counsel attended to the defence of the appellant was that his Honour delivered nine judgments in response to applications made by counsel during the course of the trial.
	
	
	In further response to that aspect of this ground of appeal that relied upon trial counsel’s manner of questioning Ms Ostermeyer, the Crown referred the Court to the following statement of trial counsel in his closing address to the jury, which demonstrated that he had taken a tactical decision as to how to conduct the cross-examination:
	


“Admittedly, I was vigorous when I first started to cross-examine her, my apologies for that because I wanted you to see her as she is, is she a feeble timid sort of person or is she someone that could hold her own …”


	
	It is apparent that trial counsel was alive to the issues in the trial and competently represented the appellant. This ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Ground 1C: the appellant was unduly pressured into signing the agreed facts


	
	The appellant contended that he was pressured into signing a statement of agreed facts tendered during the trial pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 191.
	
	
	It is apparent that prior to the commencement of trial there had been discussions between the Crown and the appellant’s legal representatives as, in his opening address to the jury on 11 February 2015, the Crown referred to an expectation that agreed facts would be provided. The agreed statement of facts was signed by the appellant on 13 February 2015.
	
	
	The agreed facts related, essentially, to the GST fraud offences and attempted fraud offences brought against Ms Ostermeyer to which she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment (agreed facts 1, 2, 5 and 6). The agreed facts also stated that Ms Ostermeyer had created fictitious identities and bank accounts associated with the offences (agreed facts 3, 4, 7 and 8).
	
	
	Relevantly, in respect of the agreed facts as they related to the charge against the appellant, the document stated that the monies Ms Ostermeyer received from the ATO from the GST fraud offences were proceeds of crime: agreed fact 9; and that from those monies, over $100,000 was deposited into the appellant’s bank account during the period between June 2006 and September 2007 (agreed fact 10). Agreed fact 11 stated that the schedule of transactions annexed to the statement (and which was separately tendered in the trial) accurately reflected monies received by Ms Ostermeyer as proceeds of crime from the GST fraud offences and transfers she made into the appellant’s bank accounts.
	
	
	No complaint about the agreed facts was raised at trial, although this was understandable as the appellant’s trial counsel had signed the statement. In the circumstances, whilst leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required to raise this ground leave should be granted.
	
	
	In the supplementary written submissions on the appeal, no more was argued on this point than that regard should be had to the principles enunciated in Loury v R [2010] NSWCCA 158. As a result of the abandonment of ground 1C by counsel on the appeal, the appellant’s affidavit sworn 4 May 2016 was not read. As the ground has been reinstated, that affidavit should now be read on the appeal. Paragraph (7) of the affidavit stated:
	


“7.   After Judge’s repeated request to have facts agreed upon, I was advised it was in my best interest to sign so I did not aggravate the judge. I signed the agreed facts under duress. I stated I did not have a good understanding of what I was signing due to the legal jargon and it was not further explained to me.”


	
	The appellant’s trial counsel, Mr Klarica, responded to the assertion in para (7) of the appellant’s affidavit in an affidavit sworn 5 May 2016, as follows:
	


“4.   In response to paragraph 7 of the Affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 14 May 2016 at the time the appellant signed the Agreed Facts I was of the view he fully understood what he signed. I have the practice of making sure that any document signed is understood and adopted and always ask whether there are any concerns before signing. The document the appellant signed was in accordance with his instructions and to my knowledge the evidence that he gave at trial. I did not observe any duress. Mr Willis would have also assisted the appellant in understanding the Agreed Facts prior to the signing of the same.”


	
	In Loury, this Court set aside the appellant’s pleas of guilty to three charges of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence in company, on the basis that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant’s pleas were not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt but rather to the imprudent and inappropriate advice given by his counsel and solicitor.
	
	
	Whealy J, at [97], observed that an appeal will be allowed “where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred” and, at [98], that the ultimate question was not “the guilt or innocence of the accused person, but rather the integrity of the plea”. His Honour cited, at [99], the judgment of Howie J in Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at [33] as authority for the proposition that:
	


“[T]here will be no miscarriage of justice in situations where a plea of guilty has been entered for the purpose of gaining some perceived advantage, despite maintaining one’s innocence, so long as the plea was entered in the exercise of a person’s free choice or in his or her own interests.”


	
	His Honour, at [100], instanced a number of circumstances and factors which the courts have recognised as warranting the setting aside of a plea of guilty. These included circumstances such as an appellant having a lack of appreciation of the nature of the relevant charge, not being in possession of all the facts, not entertaining a genuine consciousness of guilt, having been induced to plead by threats or impropriety, or where there are questions about the quality and propriety of legal advice leading to the plea.
	
	
	Turning to the circumstances of the plea in question, Whealy J noted, at [103], that the appellant had “[a]t all times … denied that he was in any way involved” in one aspect of the incident, viz, the holding of an individual while he was struck with a bat, and, at [104], that there was “a clear triable issue that the appellant had no involvement” in that aspect of the incident. His Honour, at [105], observed that “[t]he appellant came to the District Court … without any knowledge that he would be required on that day to plead to the new charges” and was satisfied that the appellant:
	


“… did not understand them, they had not been explained to him in any meaningful way and he was unaware of the details of the negotiation between [his solicitor] and the Crown.”


	
	Whealy J also observed, at [107]-[108], that there were “important inconsistencies between the appellant’s statements to the police in the ERISP and the appellant’s position as reflected in the statement of facts”, and reached the view that the appellant had never been shown the agreed statement of facts. Accordingly, Whealy J, at [111], “was satisfied by the whole of the evidence that a serious miscarriage of justice had occurred” and that “it was imperative that the pleas entered by the appellant be set aside and that the convictions be quashed without delay”.
	
	
	Hodgson JA agreed with Whealy J’s reasons and added, at [3], that there was no evidence that the agreed statement of facts had been explained to the appellant or that the differences between his ERISP and the agreed statement of facts had been pointed out to him. Kirby J agreed with Whealy J and the additional observations of Hodgson JA.
	
	
	The Crown, in its written submissions, contended that Loury “is entirely distinguishable from this appeal”.
	
	
	In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. As the transcript of the Crown’s opening address and trial counsel’s statement to the Court during that address reveal, it was anticipated from the outset that there would be agreed facts. In particular, trial counsel, at the end of the first day of trial, when he indicated that he had added additional facts, informed the trial judge:
	


“I decided to put those other matters on that agreed – so it will be in about five minutes time I’ll just email it to my friend and let him have a look at it …”


	
	Thus, trial counsel was not only well appraised of the facts upon which the Crown sought agreement, he considered it appropriate, in his representation of the appellant, to add facts to it. The appellant and trial counsel signed the agreed facts. That indicates that the appellant read the agreed facts, which are less than two pages long and are not complex, and Mr Klarica’s affidavit supports the proposition that it is probable that the facts were explained to the appellant. It is also relevant to note that, unlike in Loury, there has been no suggestion of inconsistencies between the agreed facts and any prior statement made by the appellant. Indeed, the appellant has pointed to no particular fact with which he now takes issue. The agreed facts set out in the statement were supported by documentary evidence and to that extent were not contentious.
	
	
	However, for the reasons that follow, it is not necessary to make any findings as to whether the appellant in fact understood the agreed facts. To the extent that the agreed facts stated that the funds in respect of which the appellant had been charged had been obtained by Ms Ostermeyer fraudulently and were the proceeds of crime, that agreement did not impact upon the appellant’s defence that he did not know that the monies paid into his bank account had been fraudulently obtained by Ms Ostermeyer. As trial counsel emphasised to the jury in his closing address, there was no issue as to the facts: see above at [71].
	
	
	Accordingly, ground 1C of the appeal should be rejected. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	


SENTENCE APPEAL


	
	The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 25 February 2015 and expiring on 24 February 2019, subject to a recognisance to be of good behaviour: see above at [2]. The maximum penalty for the offence of which he was convicted was 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	By ground 2 of the appeal, the appellant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that it was manifestly excessive. This ground was supported by thirteen specific errors alleged to have been made by his Honour. It will be convenient to deal with each challenge seriatim by reference to the relevant parts of his Honour’s remarks.
	


(i) Taking into account in his reasons material supplied by the Crown without the consent of the defence, being a bail report


	
	This challenge to his Honour’s reasoning must be rejected. Whilst it is correct that initially, at the commencement of the sentence hearing, the bail report was tendered as part of the Crown bundle on sentence, when objection was taken by trial counsel, it was removed from the tender bundle and all that was tendered was a statement of the appellant’s criminal history. The transcript of the sentence proceedings records that the removal of the bail report and the tender of the appellant’s criminal history was done with the consent of trial counsel.
	


(ii) Taking into account material containing untested and confirmed allegations of motorcycle club associations


	
	His Honour, at [52], reviewed the psychological evidence that had been tendered on behalf of the appellant. The psychologist, Mr John Machlin, in a report dated 15 April 2015, assessed the appellant on 9 April 2015 for the purpose of preparing a report in anticipation of the sentence proceedings. In that report, under the heading “Other Activities”, Mr Machlin reported:
	


“I understand evidence was given to the court after trial that [the appellant] has had associations with outlawed motorcycle gangs. Upon my enquiry, [the appellant] stated only that he had a few friends from the Hells Angels in 2012, and denied that he was a member. He added that he has since ‘moved on with my life’.”


	
	The reference to “evidence given to the court after trial” in the report would appear to be a reference to evidence that was adduced in the bail application. Given the reference in Mr Machlin’s report, it appears to be uncontentious that the appellant had had some such connection as stated in the report.
	
	
	In his remarks dealing with “special circumstances”, his Honour stated, at [92]:
	


“Despite the offender’s relatively young age (31), I have particular concerns about his prospects of rehabilitation given his lack of remorse and his domestic circumstances. Evidence was given in the bail/detention proceedings by the relevant police officer of his relatively recent associations, which have been denied by the offender. That evidence has not been refuted in these separate sentencing proceedings – the offender electing not to give evidence in these proceedings.”


	
	The Crown submitted that there is no indication as to the manner in which his Honour took this factor into account. It is difficult to know from his Honour’s remarks whether this is so. The fact that his Honour made reference to “recent associations” when dealing with the question of special circumstances would seem to indicate that he was concerned about that matter when assessing the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation and whether a longer period under supervision post-incarceration was warranted. There is no indication in his Honour’s remarks that that factor was taken into account in any other way.
	
	
	There is, however, a curiosity in his Honour’s reference to the bail/detention application. As I have discussed in relation to the previous ground, the bail report was not before his Honour. His Honour’s reference to the evidence given on that occasion presumably, therefore, was a reference to his own recollection of the evidence, although it should be said that that matter was not made clear in submissions to this Court and cannot be determined with certainty from the material available on appeal.
	
	
	The only ‘evidence’ of this matter before his Honour on the sentence was the comment made by Mr Machlin in his report. As is apparent from that report, the appellant conceded some association with friends who were members of Hells Angels in 2012. There was some basis therefore for a concern as to the appellant’s associations, although on Mr Machlin’s report that had been some three years prior to the sentence proceedings
	
	
	Nonetheless, I consider, as a matter of caution, that this Court should accept that his Honour made an observation on a matter that was not in evidence and appears to have attached some weight to it. That was done in the context of determining whether to make a finding of special circumstances, and it appears that his Honour used it as countervailing factor in determining how to adjust the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence. As I explain below, his Honour erred in any event in engaging in a consideration of special circumstances.
	
	
	Thus, whilst in normal circumstances, the use of material not in evidence in the sentence material would constitute error, not only was this not the error alleged under this sub-ground, I consider that this matter is best dealt with as part of the challenge to his Honour’s finding in relation to special circumstances.
	


(iii) Finding that the appellant was not a young offender, notwithstanding that he was 21 to 22 years old at the time of the offending


	
	In his remarks on sentence, his Honour, at [40], stated that the appellant was “not a young offender in the way that term is traditionally understood”, but nonetheless noted that his age was 22 or 23 at the time that the offences were committed.
	
	
	Contrary to the appellant’s submission, his Honour did not err in his approach to the offender’s age. The focus in sentencing young offenders is on rehabilitation, in circumstances where, as stated in KT v R (2008) 182 A Crim R 571; [2008] NSWCCA 51, at [23], “the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence”. In those circumstances, it is accepted that “the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult”: see R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25]; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397 at [61].
	
	
	However, this was not a case where it could be or was suggested that the appellant’s immaturity was a significant factor in the appellant’s offending conduct. Indeed, there was no suggestion at all in the psychological evidence, the medical evidence or in the references tendered on his behalf on the sentence hearing that he was immature or otherwise acted immaturely. Rather, the focus of that evidence was on the appellant’s mental health.
	
	
	This alleged error should be rejected.
	


(iv) Not placing sufficient weight on the subjective factors such as courses whilst in custody in the relevant short period of time, prior strong work ethic, family circumstances and caring of two young children


	
	It is well established that the weight to be given to any relevant factor in sentencing process is a matter for the sentencing judge. As this Court stated in Bland v R (2014) 241 A Crim R 51; [2014] NSWCCA 82 at [112]-[113]:
	


“112   The failure of a sentencing Judge to attribute sufficient weight to an issue at sentence will not generally be a material error. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first-instance Judge, and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Yang v R (2012) 219 A Crim R 550; [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [25].

113   A ground of appeal asserting that a Judge attributed insufficient weight to an issue has the inherent problem of implicitly acknowledging that some weight has been placed on the issue: DF v R (2012) A Crim R 178; [2012] NSWCCA 171 at [77].”


	
	His Honour, in his remarks on sentence referred to the appellant’s subjective circumstances including his family circumstances: at [43]; the state of his father’s health: at [45]; and the fact that there was evidence that the appellant had applied himself in jail to obtain qualifications: at [87]. It was also apparent from his Honour’s finding, at [93], albeit in the context of making a finding of special circumstances that he took into account the appellant’s age and family circumstances. Although, as explained below, the Commonwealth sentencing regime does not call for a finding of special circumstances, it is apparent that this Honour attached weight to these subjective factors.
	
	
	Thus, having regard to the discretion exercised by trial judges in respect of the weight to be given to particular factors, no error has been demonstrated.
	


(v) Misapplying the evidence by stating that the appellant was not employed at the material times and this formed the basis of his motivation to obtain money from Ms Ostermeyer


	
	The appellant contended that this alleged erroneous finding was contrary to the evidence that at the time of the offending conduct the appellant was in full time employment. This submission does not accurately reflect the findings made by his Honour.
	
	
	The relevant part of his Honour’s remarks relating to employment and motive were as follows:
	


“41.   He left school before completing Year 10. After leaving school, he worked intermittently as a labourer, and for four years working as a concreter, and then in road and bridge maintenance until 2009 or 2010.

…

70.   I also have had regard to the motives of the offender: R v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 at 145. There is no evidence put forward by defence counsel to suggest that the offender was in any particular circumstance of need. The offender was clearly motivated by greed, as opposed to need. The Crown submits, and I accept, that the offender attempted to minimise his role, and gave an account of wanting the use of the money to restore cars – an account that was essentially unbelievable.”


	
	While his Honour did not specify the appellant’s employment status at the time of the offending, he made no finding that the appellant was unemployed. Furthermore, the finding as to motive at [70] was open on the evidence.
	
	
	There is no substance in this alleged error.
	


(vi) Conflating the distinct and separate charges and acts alleged against the appellant and Ms Ostermeyer


	
	In their submissions on sentence both the Crown and Defence counsel raised issues of parity relative to the sentence imposed on Ms Ostermeyer. Knox DCJ was thus obliged to deal with the topic. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour, at [13], observed that one area of distinction between the circumstances of Ms Ostermeyer and those of the appellant was that Ms Ostermeyer obtained GST refunds exceeding $440,000 by virtue of the frauds that she committed, whereas the amount proved against the appellant as having been paid into his accounts was $322,600.
	
	
	At [56], under the heading “Comparative sentences”, his Honour referred to the sentence that had been imposed upon Ms Ostermeyer and the difference between the maximum penalty for the offences committed by Ms Ostermeyer and the offence committed by the appellant. His Honour also noted that there were significant differences between the appellant and Ms Ostermeyer, including the appellant’s criminal history, which included offences for dishonesty; differences in the respective roles each played in the commission of the crimes; and that there was no discount to be applied in the sentencing of the appellant. In this regard, as his Honour recorded at [33] of his remarks on sentence, Ms Ostermeyer had received a 50 per cent discount for a guilty plea and past and future assistance.
	
	
	His Honour’s findings, in relation to the appellant’s offending conduct as compared to that of Ms Ostermeyer, were set out at in the following paragraphs of his remarks on sentence:
	


“59.   I find that what was involved was that the offender and Ms Ostermeyer were in an intimate relationship whereby the offender grew to be able to manipulate and control Ms Ostermeyer. I find that he was the one who suggested the scheme to Ms Ostermeyer following discussions between them. Having heard the evidence of Ms Ostermeyer and noting that the recipient of the funds was the offender, I do not accept defence counsel’s submissions that the offender did not play an active role in the frauds being committed, nor do I accept the repeated characterisation in submissions of Ms Ostermeyer as being the ‘primary offender’. Mr Klarica submits that without her, there would have been no offence. The Crown’s rejoinder is that without him, and without his activities, pressure, and ultimately threats, the offence would not have occurred, particularly given that the bulk of the funds went to him.

60.   Having presided over the trial and having heard all the evidence, I am satisfied and find that what was involved was a carefully calculated scheme instigated by Mr Younan, but carried out by Ms Ostermeyer and effectively supervised by him using (and abusing) his relationship with her. Their level of involvement was effectively equal in the execution of the overall scheme – although clearly, Ms Ostermeyer was using her specialist knowledge and position to perform the acts such as the entity creation, documentation and lodgement and transfer of funds.

61.   Nevertheless, the offender was the one who actually received the funds and applied them for his own use. There has been no reimbursement of any of those (substantial) monies, nor has there been any attempt or offer to do so. There may be negotiations with the Crime Commission seeking an order for the repayment of $300,000.”


	
	In my opinion, these remarks clearly show that his Honour did not conflate the distinct and separate charges and acts alleged against the appellant and Ms Ostermeyer. In fact, contrary to the appellant’s submission, his Honour compared and contrasted all relevant aspects of the offending conduct by reference to the differences in the offences charged; the maximum penalties for each; the relevant sentencing factors taken into account in respect of Ms Ostermeyer and the objective and subjective circumstances of the appellant.
	
	
	This alleged error should also be rejected.
	


(vii) Miscalculating the non-parole period, specifically having regard to the finding of special circumstances


	
	The trial judge, at [91]-[93], under the heading “Special circumstances”, considered that a finding of special circumstances was warranted such that the ratio of the non-parole period imposed was two-thirds of the head sentence. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour expressed the view that he had “particular concerns” in respect of the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation, having regard to his lack of remorse and his domestic circumstances.
	
	
	In that context, his Honour referred to the evidence in respect of the appellant’s associations with motorcycle gangs outlined above at [127].
	
	
	His Honour concluded, at [93], that:
	


“Against that guarded assessment, and as a mark of some generosity, I find that [the appellant’s] age, family circumstances, and the fact that this will be his first time in custody warrant a finding of special circumstances.”


	
	It should be noted that the appellant’s trial counsel had sought a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	To the extent that his Honour’s remarks indicate that he understood that there was a statutory ratio to be observed and that the statutory ratio could be varied by a finding of special circumstances, it would appear that his Honour was in error in his understanding of the Commonwealth statutory sentencing regime. There is no comparative provision in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 44, which specifies a statutory ratio as between the non-parole period and the parole period, and nor is there any statutory requirement in respect of a finding of special circumstances. Furthermore, the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 68 does not have the effect that s 44 applies when State courts sentence for Commonwealth offences: Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [22].
	
	
	Rather, as was pointed out in Hili, at [40], regard is to be had to the Crimes Act (Cth), s 16A which provides that a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence: see subs (1); and further provides specified matters that the court must take into account: see subs(2).
	
	
	In Hili the High Court, at [36] and [44], rejected the proposition that there was any ‘norm’ of 60-66 per cent of the head sentence for the period of imprisonment that an offender must serve or that such a figure would be “affected by special circumstances applicable to a particular offender”. Rather, the Court stated, at [44]:
	


“It is wrong to begin from some assumed starting point and then seek to identify ‘special circumstances’. Rather, a sentencing judge should determine the the length of sentence to be served before a recognisance release order takes effect by reference to, and application of, the principles identified by this Court in Power, Deakin and Bugmy.”


	
	In Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; [1990] HCA 18, the majority stated, at 536:
	


“The practical effect of fixing a minimum term is that thereafter the Parole Board may, but of course need not, grant the prisoner parole: Corrections Act, s.74(1). That is not to say that the minimum term should be seen as the shortest time required for a paroling authority to form a proper view of the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation. That approach was rejected in Power v. The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623. Referring to Power, this Court said in Deakin v. The Queen [1984] HCA 31; (1984) 58 ALJR 367, at p 367:

‘The intention of the legislature in providing for the fixing of minimum terms is to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence.’

The views expressed in Power have been affirmed on other occasions in this Court: see for instance Lowe v. The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606, at p 615; The Queen v. Paivinen [1985] HCA 39; (1985) 158 CLR 489, at p 495; The Queen v. Watt [1988] HCA 58; (1988) 165 CLR 474, at p 481; Hunter v. The Queen (1988) 62 ALJR 424; Griffiths v. The Queen [1989] HCA 39; (1989) 167 CLR 372, at p 396.”


	
	In determining this ground, I leave to one side whether it was appropriate for his Honour to have regard to the appellant’s recent “associations”, presumably being a reference to connections to “bikies”.
	
	
	His Honour, in his sentencing remarks, had regard to the degree to which the appellant had shown contrition: s 16A(2)(f); the appellant’s character, antecedents and age, means and physical and mental condition: s 16A(2)(m); the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation: s 16A(2)(n); and the probable effect of any sentence on the appellant’s family and dependents: s 16A(2)(p). Elsewhere in his reasons, his Honour had regard to such of the other factors that were relevant to the appellant’s case which he was bound to consider pursuant to s 16A(2).
	
	
	Notwithstanding that his Honour appears to have complied with s 16A, the language used by his Honour was redolent of the terms in which s 44 is framed. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that having regard to the provisions of s 16A and the sentencing principles for Commonwealth offences, his Honour erred in making a finding of “special circumstances” such that the ratio of the non-parole period was adjusted to two-thirds of the head sentence. I deal with the consequences of this error below.
	


(viii) Failing to conduct the sentence proceedings in accordance with the relevant Commonwealth law


	
	The appellant did not provide any particularisation of this alleged failure. To the extent that it raised the question of special circumstances, that matter has been dealt with above.
	


(ix) In findings as to the comparative objective criminality as between the appellant’s conduct and that of Ms Ostermeyer


	
	The appellant contended that his Honour erred in finding, at [13], that the amount not given to the offender, being $122,175, “does not appear to be a significant difference – particularly given the other amounts which need to be taken into account in assessing the total criminality”.
	
	
	This alleged error relates to the difference, to which reference has already been made above at [144], between the total amount of the frauds proved against Ms Ostermeyer in the sum of $442,775, and the amount that was proved to have been paid to the appellant, in the sum of $322,600. The appellant’s submission in respect of the difference of approximately $120,000 was that this was a “lot of money”.
	
	
	The Crown, in response to this alleged error, pointed out that there is an error in the formulation of the appellant’s contention in that it omitted any reference to “the context of the total amounts involved” as his Honour stated, at [13], and misquoted “other matters”, stating instead, “other amounts”. The complete observations of his Honour at that paragraph were as follows:
	


“One area of distinction appears to be that Ms Ostermeyer obtained GST refunds exceeding $440,000 by virtue of the frauds she committed, whereas all that could be proved against the offender was that $322,600 was paid into his accounts. In the context of the total amounts involved and the total scheme involved, that does not appear to be a significant difference – particularly given the other matters which need to be taken into account in assessing the total criminality.”


	
	The Crown also submitted that in assessing the appellant’s criminality, it was relevant that the amount with which the appellant was charged was over three times the threshold of $100,000 specified in the charge, as his Honour noted at [68], and that Ms Ostermeyer was charged with different offences carrying lesser maximum penalties.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is no merit in the appellant’s contention. His Honour, at the passage of his remarks in question, was dealing with differences between the objective seriousness of the offending by the appellant and that by Ms Ostermeyer. He observed that Ms Ostermeyer had received an amount of approximately $120,000 by virtue of her fraudulent conduct that had not been transferred to the appellant. The weight to be placed on that circumstance was an evaluative matter for his Honour in assessing the criminality involved. There was no error in his Honour determining that it was of minimal significance in the context of the appellant’s offending conduct.
	


(x) Finding that Ms Ostermeyer later repaid the $75,000 which she had borrowed from her earnings


	
	This asserted error was not subject to any amplification in written submissions and very little was advanced in support of it in oral submissions on the appeal. It appears to relate to evidence given by Ms Ostermeyer in cross-examination as to whether she had paid back the bank loans or the credit card loans or both. It is apparent that his Honour referred to the matter at [14] as part of his recitation of the history of the matter. It is not apparent that it played any role in relation to the sentencing of the appellant. In the circumstances, the appellant has not demonstrated that, even assuming that it was an irrelevant fact in relation to his sentencing, it affected the sentence that his Honour imposed. I would not find error on this basis.
	


(xi) Finding that “the offender’s actions displayed a degree of cunning to ensure that it was Ms Ostermeyer who carried the risk of detection”


	
	This alleged error, which relates to a finding made by his Honour at [27], was withdrawn by counsel on the hearing of the appeal. Accordingly, there were no written or oral submissions advanced in support of it. Counsel’s decision not to rely upon this alleged error was understandable. His Honour had presided over a trial lasting 11 days, in which Ms Ostermeyer and the appellant both gave evidence. This finding was well open to his Honour having regard to the whole of the evidence.
	


(xii)   Finding that the offender threatened to kill Ms Ostermeyer and her family


	
	This alleged error was also withdrawn by counsel on the hearing of the appeal. This finding was open on the evidence and was a relevant finding in determining the objective seriousness of the offence.
	


(xiii)   In making a reparation order against the Appellant and in favour of the Commonwealth of Australia, including as to the quantum of that order


	
	His Honour, in sentencing the appellant, made a reparation order in the amount of $322,600 in favour of the Commonwealth. His Honour ordered that this amount be reduced by any amount paid or forfeited to the New South Wales Crime Commission and any amount paid by Ms Ostermeyer with respect to the reparation order made against her in the sum of $442,775 in the New South District Court by Judge Williams on 13 July 2012.
	
	
	Although this alleged error was also withdrawn by counsel appearing on the appeal, it should be noted that there was no error in his Honour making the reparation order, as he was entitled to do pursuant to the Crimes Act (Cth) s 21B. That section provides, relevantly, that a person has been convicted of a federal offence, the court may, in addition to the penalty imposed, order that the offender make reparation to the Commonwealth.
	
	
	It is also relevant to note, as the Crown pointed out in its submissions, that as there was a concern as to double punishment by reason of the Crime Commission’s interest in the appellant’s property arising from this offence, the reparation order that was sought and that was made by his Honour expressly provided that the amount of reparation to be made was to be reduced by the amount that had been forfeited to the Crime Commission.
	


Conclusion on the appeal against sentence


	
	It follows from the above consideration of each of the particular errors alleged that the only possible error that has been demonstrated in his Honour’s remarks on sentence relates to his reference to special circumstances and the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence and, to that extent, his failure to properly apply the correct sentencing principles when dealing with a Commonwealth offence. It is also arguable that, in that regard, his Honour erroneously placed weight on the appellant’s motorcycle gang connection.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I consider that it should be accepted that error has been demonstrated. That being so, it is necessary to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: see the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3), which applies by force of the Judiciary Act, s 68; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 702; [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [79] and [99]-[100]; and Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [42].
	
	
	The appellant did not rely upon any comparable sentences to enable a comparison to be made to sentences imposed for similar offending conduct. The Crown, for its part, relied upon the decision in this Court in R v Ly [2014] NSWCCA 78.
	
	
	In that case, the offender was charged with an offence under s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth), being the same offence with which the appellant was charged. The offending took place over a period of 10 months. The trial judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. A reparation order in the sum of $331,862 was also made.
	
	
	On the Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence in Ly, this Court imposed a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. In imposing it that sentence the court stated that the offence was “a very serious one”. The Court based this conclusion on the amount involved, the period of time over which the offending took place, the deliberate pattern of offending, the significant financial benefit derived by the respondent, and the lack of any significant mitigating factors. The Court considered that the respondent’s conduct was somewhat above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In my opinion, the observations made by the Court in Ly apply in this case. The appellant engaged in a prolonged period of activity of criminal behaviour in circumstances where there were no mitigating circumstances, no demonstration of remorse and where the circumstances of the offending included threatening conduct directed to the other offender.
	
	
	It is correct, that as the trial judge in this matter noted, at [80], some distinction may be drawn between the two cases on the basis that, in Ly, the offender was slightly more involved in the actual commission of the fraud. Notwithstanding the correctness of that observation, I consider that the offending here was objectively serious.
	
	
	I am of the opinion that when regard is had to the objective seriousness of the appellant’s offending conduct, the paucity of subjective matters in his favour, including his lack of remorse and the factors that must be taken into account pursuant to s 16A(2),and in particular the factors in paras (a); (e); (f); (m); (n); and (p) as those factors have been referred to in these reasons, I would not, in the independent exercise of the sentencing discretion, impose any different sentence than was imposed by the trial judge. In reaching that conclusion, I have not taken into account any evidence as to the appellant’s motorcycle gang connection.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	I raise one final matter. Since preparing these reasons, the appellant has forwarded to the Court a letter annexing three documents. The letter raises the difficulties that the appellant’s family is experiencing as a result of his imprisonment. The annexures are from chaplains working in the Correctional Centre and a Certificate of Participation in the “Seasons for Growth” program.
	
	
	The documents were sent to the Court without leave and it is not proposed to take them into account. The appellant has already been given considerable leeway in the presentation of his appeal. However, it is appropriate to point out for the appellant’s benefit that the matters to which the letter referred had already been made known to the Court as part of his appeal and of which the Court has taken into account.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Appeal against conviction dismissed;

(2)   Leave to appeal against sentence granted;

(3)   Appeal against sentence dismissed.


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Beazley P.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of the President. I agree with the orders her Honour proposes and, subject to what follows, generally with her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	In the case of two grounds, I prefer to express my own reasons.
	


Ground 1A (iii): - Ms Ostermeyer defied the trial judge’s direction to limit her answers


	
	In my view the most probable inference to be drawn from the repeated references to “assaulted” in the evidence of Ms Ostermeyer quoted by the President at [67] is that Ms Ostermeyer deliberately sought to place the Appellant in a bad light and did so in defiance of his Honour’s instruction that she should limit her responses and “just answer the question”.
	
	
	However, whether considered on its own or together with other evidence tending to place the Appellant in a bad light, it is impossible to regard the evidence that the Appellant had assaulted Ms Ostermeyer as so prejudicial that it rendered the trial unfair. A fortiori is this so when regard is had to the admissible evidence that the Appellant had threatened to kill Ms Ostermeyer.
	


Ground 1C: the appellant was unduly pressured into signing the agreed facts


	
	The evidence adduced by the Appellant in support of this ground was as follows:-
	


After Judge’s repeated request to have facts agreed upon, I was advised it was in my best interest to sign so I did not aggravate the judge. I signed the agreed acts under duress. I stated I did not have a good understanding of what I was signing due to the legal jargon and it was not further explained to me.


	
	The “Agreed Facts” document signed by counsel and the Appellant contains eleven paragraphs typed over two pages together with a five page table divided into 4 columns bearing headings “Entity”, “ABN”, “Business Address” and “SON (Service of Notice Address)” Illustrative terminology of the document includes the following:-
	


Pursuant to section 191 of the Evidence Act 2005 the following facts are not in dispute in the current trial before His Honour Judge Knox.

1.   That Leah Ostermeyer committed criminal offences against the Commonwealth by defrauding the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) in excess of $420,000 in 2006 ad 2007, in that she submitted false GST returns and received GST refunds to which she was not entitled (“GST Fraud Offences”).

3.   That Leah Ostermeyer created all the fictitious identities and submitted all documentation and information relevant to the GST Fraud Offences and Attempt Fraud Offences.

4.   A list of the address details associated with the entities created by Ms Ostermeyer for the GST Fraud Offences and the Attempt Fraud Offences is attached as annexure “A”.

5.   That Leah Ostermeyer pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the GST Fraud Offences and Attempt Fraud Offences.

11.   That the schedule of transactions (Exhibit 8) accurately reflect the:

a.   Monies received by Leah Ostermeyer as proceeds of crime from the GST Fraud Ofences; and

b.   transfers made by Leah Ostermeyer into Mr Younan’s bank accounts.


	
	The Appellant was asked a few questions concerning the document. The questions and answers included the following:-
	


Q.   Now just going back to those agreed facts there’s nothing – you don’t dispute that you received money from –

A.   Not at all.

Q.   You don’t dispute that you looked up your bank accounts to see if money was put there or anything of that nature?

A,   Not at all.


	
	Counsel who appeared for the Appellant before Knox DCJ responded to the Appellant’s claim in this connection:-
	


In response to paragraph 7 of the affidavit of Raymond Younan sworn 4 May 2016 at the time the appellant signed the Agreed Facts I was of the view he fully understood what he signed. I have the practice of making sure that any document signed is understood and adopted and always ask whether there are any concerns before signing. The document the appellant signed was in accordance with his instructions and to my knowledge the evidence that he gave at the trial. I did not observe any duress. Mr Willis would have also assisted the appellant in understanding the Agreed Facts prior to the signing of the same.


	
	The Agreed Facts document contains nothing that could be described as legal jargon, certainly none that would not be readily understandable by any man in the street. The onus lies on the Appellant to establish the facts on which he relies and even without the response by counsel I would not regard the Appellant’s statements in support of this ground as credible.
	
	
	Thus I would not uphold this ground.

		09 November 2016",2016-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2878003,R v Blackman [2016] NSWSC 1579,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Gary Clifford Blackman, has been charged with murdering his partner, Nicole Weate, at the property where they lived together at Tomewin, between 2 and 6 April 2014. He has also been charged with an offence under s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of unlawfully killing Ms Weate and under s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.
	
	
	Shortly prior to the commencement of the hearing in May 2016, a question arose as to Mr Blackman’s fitness to be tried, with the result that the hearing was vacated.
	


The fitness inquiry


	
	An inquiry into Mr Blackman’s fitness to be tried was, accordingly, conducted under s 9 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). In accordance with s 6, the question of Mr Blackman’s fitness must be determined on the balance of probabilities. Section 12 requires that the inquiry not be conducted in an adversarial manner and that the onus of proof as to the question of Mr Blackman’s fitness does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings.
	
	
	An accused's fitness must be determined in the way discussed in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48, where Smith J said:
	


""[An accused] needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.""


	
	In Kesavarajah v the Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230; [1994] HCA 41, an accused with a seemingly unstable psychotic condition was initially found to be fit, but later in the trial there was what might have been a “flare-up” or “florid outbreak”. The question of fitness thus arose again for consideration, but was not further considered by the trial judge, in circumstances where the trial was close to its end. It was observed by the plurality at [35]:
	


“… In the context of a trial, fitness to be tried is to be determined by reference to the factors mentioned by Smith J in Presser and by reference to the length of the trial. It makes no sense to determine the question of fitness to be tried by reference to the accused's condition immediately prior to the commencement of the trial without having regard to what the accused's condition will or is likely to be during the course of the trial. There is simply no point in embarking on a lengthy trial with all the expense and inconvenience to jurors that it may entail if it is to be interrupted by reason of some manifestation or exacerbation of a debilitating condition which can affect the accused's fitness to be tried. Of course, that is not to exclude from the jury's consideration the question whether the condition is such that difficulties can be accommodated by an adjournment if and when they arise.”

The evidence of Mr Blackman’s lack of capacity


	
	Ms Weate’s body was found in Mr Blackman’s shed, after a friend who also resided at the property approached police. Mr Blackman was then in hospital, where he had been taken by ambulance, after a neighbour found him lying on the floor of the shed, naked, dirty and emaciated, in pain and with swelling to one of his legs, which he thought was the result of a spider bite, as well as cuts to his hands and knees.
	
	
	In hospital Mr Blackman made a number of admissions about Ms Weate’s killing to police, family members and hospital staff, which resulted in him being charged with her murder. Later, however, he denied responsibility for her death, identifying her killer to be the friend who had gone to police, after his admission to hospital. Mr Blackman’s condition eventually raised the question of his fitness to be tried and the reliability of the various incriminating statements which he had earlier made.
	
	
	A number of experts have examined Mr Blackman and his brain has also been examined. In evidence was the indictment; Crown case statement; an outline of the Crown evidence; May and September 2016 reports of the forensic psychiatrist Professor Greenberg; a September 2016 report of the psychiatrist Dr Nielssen; an August 2016 report of the forensic psychologist Dr Pulman; an April 2016 report of the forensic psychologist Mr Sheehan; and as well as the results of MRI imaging of Mr Blackman’s brain undertaken in June 2016.
	
	
	The experts each received a similar history from Mr Blackman, who presented on examination in a state described in various ways such as being unkempt; rather odd in presentation; polite but with limited engagement; not speaking spontaneously, but oriented in time and place; displaying a lack of insight; but denying psychotic phenomena and not expressing delusional beliefs.
	
	
	The history Mr Blackman, now aged 64, gave the experts was also similar. It included a stable upbringing in a family on the lower north shore of Sydney; completion of a motor mechanic’s apprenticeship; work in that trade for some years, before it was abandoned for more lucrative employment, which was also abandoned when Mr Blackman adopted a somewhat itinerant lifestyle, travelling around the country over the course of many years, interspersed with periods of employment; a criminal record, which included brief custodial sentences in Queensland and the Northern Territory for driving while intoxicated and for stealing a vehicle in Western Australia; the onset of heavy alcohol use in his early twenties; no long term relationships or children, apart from the relationship commenced with Ms Weate 12 months before her death; a history of alcohol and cannabis abuse, as well as use of methamphetamine in the weeks before Ms Weate’s death; and purchase of a three acre property at Tomewin in 2006 with an inheritance, where he lived in a shed when Ms Weate was killed.
	
	
	The experts referred to medical and Justice Health records which revealed that Mr Blackman was conscious on admission to hospital on 4 April 2014. On 5 April, he was vague and confused and assessed to be undergoing alcohol withdrawal of mild severity. He was given morphine and a drug to help him sleep and he required assistance showering. On 6 April he was transferred to Tweed Hospital, where he was stable, treated for septic arthritis and later discharged.
	
	
	In custody on 10 April, however, he was so aggressive, abusive and confused that he was readmitted to Grafton Hospital, where questions as to his mental health led to a review by a psychiatrist, to whom he also made some incriminating statements. On 16 April the question of delirium arose. He was transferred to Port Macquarie Base Hospital for surgery to his knee, where on 17 April his agitated, aggressive state raised the question of whether he was undergoing ice withdrawal. He was medically stable by 24 April, although his mental state was still problematic.
	
	
	On 25 April Mr Blackman was again reviewed by a psychiatrist and on 29 April he was discharged to Long Bay Hospital, where he was again psychiatrically reviewed. The severe psychotic symptoms he was then suffering, rambling, claiming to be fighting the devil as a dragon, presenting with bizarre facial gestures, laughing constantly and with spluttering speech, raised the question of whether he was suffering cognitive impairment, secondary to alcohol abuse. He was then aware, however of having been charged with murder, but reported that he had not killed “that girl”.
	
	
	There was little change in Mr Blackman’s state for some time, with possible alcohol dementia with delusions, then being raised. Improvement in his condition commenced at the end of May 2014. In August he commenced treatment for delusions and psychosis, which continued, with the result that he suffered no new episodes of delusions in 2015, but the effects of his treatment also included overall slow movement and speech, as well as a passive, blunted effect, slow mentation and no spontaneous speech.
	
	
	Mr Blackman’s trial was listed for a six week hearing commencing in May 2016. There was a legal question initially to be decided as to the admissibility of his admissions.
	
	
	In April 2016, Mr Sheehan came to consider that Mr Blackman was suffering some form of alcohol induced neurocognitive disorder, which was contributing to his symptoms and that there was also the possibility that he was suffering some alcohol-related dementia, major depressive disorder, or adjustment disorder. Psychometric testing did not give a result which met the threshold for cognitive impairment, but it was consistent with a cognitive decline, most likely attributable to Mr Blackman’s alcohol abuse. Mr Sheehan considered that there was ample evidence which raised doubts as to the reliability of the admissions which Mr Blackman had made in 2014 in hospital, at a time when his self reporting was unreliable.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan considered the Presser and Kesavarajah criteria and concluded that Mr Blackman had a basic understanding of the charges and behaviour underpinning it; that he was able to distinguish truth from falsehood in general terms; that he was also clear in his declaration of innocence; that he could articulate basic points relevant to his defence, such as his physical incapacity at the time of hospitalisation to have caused Ms Weate’s death; he could understand some aspects of the court process and the roles of those involved; and that with coaching he might be able to sufficiently form a view to provide some coherent instructions at trial.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan doubted, however, Mr Blackman’s ability to understand and contribute meaningfully to his defence at a trial, because that would impose a high cognitive demand, which he may be unable to meet. More extensive investigation into his neuropsychological functioning was recommended.
	
	
	In his May 2016 examination of Mr Blackman, Professor Greenberg considered that he was coherent and without thought disorder, but having word fluency difficulties, was not spontaneous in his accounts and needed prompting to answer questions. Professor Greenberg administered cognitive testing, in which Mr Blackman’s score on verbal fluency was found to be low. The Professor’s provisional diagnosis was that Mr Blackman was suffering alcohol use disorder, with mild cognitive impairment. He considered Mr Blackman’s history of alcohol abuse and being a boxer in his younger years, to account for possible mild brain damage. Alternatively, given his deteriorating functioning, with a documented history of psychotic illness. Professor Greenberg considered that he might have an undiagnosed underlying illness such as schizophrenia and that his chronic history of drug and alcohol abuse could also account for this decline.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg’s consideration of the Presser and Kesavarajah criteria led him to the view that in simple terms, Mr Blackman had an understanding of relevant matters and the capacity to decide on his defence and to instruct counsel. He would have minor problems in giving evidence, because of his difficulties in finding words and marked lack of spontaneity in speech, and he would have difficulty in fully appreciating the substantial effect of giving evidence and understanding the course of the proceedings, given his slow processing speed of thought. Professor Greenberg also considered that Mr Blackman would, as a result, be at considerable disadvantage at trial, with the result that while he was fit to plead, he was unfit to stand trial.
	
	
	In her August 2016 report Dr Pulman described Mr Blackman’s account of his alcohol use as inconsistent with other available information. On first interview in May 2016 he said that he was not a big drinker, consumed alcohol on average only once a week and would get drunk maybe every three months. When pressed he admitted consuming 6 beers a day and that he used to be a big drinker. He denied being an alcoholic, however. Dr Pulman considered these accounts to be unreliable. On second interview he admitted being an alcoholic, consuming a fair bit of alcohol prior to Ms Weate’s death, smoking six joints of marihuana daily for the past nine years and methamphetamine use in the week before his arrest.
	
	
	Dr Pulman referred to witness statements which referred to Mr Blackman having been on a pension since 1990, because of his alcoholism; that before Ms Weate’s death he was drinking heavily and losing weight; intoxicated to the point of staggering and being unable to remember anything; naked and covered in excrement; and his state on admission to hospital, when he was described to have been looking like “a prisoner of war”. Dr Pulman also referred to the results of CT and MRI scans of Mr Blackman’s brain in August 2015 and June 2016.
	
	
	Dr Pulman, too, administered neuropsychological testing, concluding that at the time of her examinations, that Mr Blackman presented with low average intellectual functioning, but with marked difficulties with initiation, slow processing speeds and executive impairment in conceptual reasoning, mental flexibility and preservation, as well as displaying moderate symptoms of depression. These results were consistent with changes in his brain, explained by vascular changes, chronic alcohol and marijuana use, psychotic illness and/or a neurodegenerative process. Further review and repeat of MRI imaging in 8 to 12 months was recommended.
	
	
	Dr Pulman’s consideration of the Presser and Kesavarajah criteria led her also to the conclusion that Mr Blackman was fit to plead, but unfit to be tried, given the consequences of his neurological problems on his ability to understand and participate in the court’s processes.
	
	
	In his 19 September report, Professor Greenberg referred to a neuropsychological report of Dr White of 4 August, which found that Mr Blackman had an average intellectual capacity falling within the low average range, with identified difficulties and an overall cognitive profile consistent with imaging which showed brain changes. She, too, recommended further review. Professor Greenberg’s diagnosis was that Mr Blackman suffered alcohol use disorder, with neurocognitive impairment secondary to micro-vascular lesions, alcoholism and pugilistic insults, with the possibility of underlying degenerative disorder not being excluded. He considered that there was also a possibility of underlying depression.
	
	
	Again, Professor Greenberg concluded that Mr Blackman was fit to plead, but unfit to stand trial, given that despite treatment and appropriate nutrition while in custody for some two and a half years, his mental state remained impaired and that he had suffered what the Professor considered to be permanent changes in his brain.
	
	
	In his 22 September report Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Blackman to be suffering alcohol use disorder and alcohol related brain damage, his current cognitive function being typical of front subcortical dementia, with marked slowness of movement, reduced intellectual function, and poverty of speech, which could be partly attributable to his ongoing anti-psychotic medication. Dr Nielssen considered that his long term abuse of alcohol was an obvious factor in Mr Blackman’s mental condition and that his drug use could have triggered a form of psychotic illness, with the result that his state may have affected the reliability of his memory and of any confessional statements he made.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen, too, concluded that Mr Blackman was not fit to stand trial.
	


Mr Blackman is unfit to be tried


	
	I am satisfied, in the face of all of this evidence, that the parties’ common position must be accepted.
	
	
	I find on the evidence I have discussed, that Mr Blackman has suffered damage to his brain and that he is also suffering mental disorders of the kind diagnosed by the experts who have examined him, as the result at least, in part, of his long term alcohol abuse.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having considered the principles discussed in Presser and Kesavarajah, that the common views of the experts as to Mr Blackman’s diminished capacity must be accepted, as the parties urged. In the result, it must be concluded that Mr Blackman is unfit to be tried.
	
	
	While Mr Blackman had sufficient capacity to have entered his plea of not guilty, as he did, there is no rational basis on which it can now be concluded, given the evidence of his current diminished capacity and what on the evidence appears to be his limited prospects of improvement, that at trial he will be able to follow the course of the proceedings; to sufficiently understand what is going on in court, particularly as to the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him, so as to enable him to make his defence; and to answer to the charges, including by giving instructions to his counsel.
	
	
	In the result, it must be concluded that orders under s 14 of the Act must be made, as the parties also agreed.
	


Orders


	
	For these reasons I order under s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act that:
	


1.   The accused Gary Clifford Blackman is currently unfit to be tried for the offences he has been charged with, of murdering Nicole Weate at Tomewin between 2 and 6 April 2014, the offence under s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of unlawfully killing Ms Weate and under s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent.

2.    The accused be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

3.   The accused be remanded in custody, pending further orders of the Court.

4.    Direct the Registrar to provide the following documents to the Tribunal:

(i)   A copy of this judgment.

(ii)    A copy of these orders.

(iii)    Copies of all exhibits tendered in this inquiry.

The present case has been brought before this court on the request of the public prosecutor that the High Court exercise its powers of revision under s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) to review the propriety of the charge and conviction and also the sentence imposed.
The accused in this case was charged with committing robbery with hurt pursuant to s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). This section reads as follows: 
 
If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person, jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.
 
 
 
He pleaded guilty and was convicted accordingly. The statement of facts which he admitted to stated that on 20 August 1991, at about 10.30am, the accused was in the same lift as one Muhammad Aswady bin Aman, then seven years old. He put his hand in Muhammad`s front shirt pocket and removed 40 cents, at the same time slapping Muhammad once on the face and ordering him not to take the same lift again. A sentence of seven years with effect from 22 August 1991 and 12 strokes of the cane was imposed. The sentence of caning has not been carried out yet.
Before me, the prosecution concedes that on the facts disclosed, an offence of robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Code was not made out.There was obviously a theft of 40 cents, but in order for theft to amount to robbery, the conditions specified in s 390(2) must be satisfied. Section 390(2) provides: 
 
Theft is `robbery` if, in order to commit theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, 
 for that end
, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Thus, any force or threat of force used in the course of a theft must be 
 for the purpose 
 of committing the theft or of carrying away or trying to carry away the property obtained by the theft. The facts in the present case do not show clearly that the slap which the accused dealt Muhammad was administered for the purpose of stealing the 40 cents from the boy or of making off with the money once he had obtained it. Since the offence of robbery simpliciter was not made out, there can be no question of conviction for aggravated robbery (ie robbery with hurt) under s 394.
However, this does not mean that the accused was not guilty of any offence. The statement of facts which he admitted to showed that he had stolen 40 cents from Muhammad and that in the course of stealing his money he had used criminal force upon Muhammad. This is an offence punishable under s 356 of the Code which reads as follows: 
 
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force on any person, in committing or attempting to commit theft of any property which that person is then wearing or carrying, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than seven years and shall also be liable to caning.
 
 
 
Section 356 prescribes a minimum custodial sentence of one year (maximum seven years) with or without caning.
For the reasons given above therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence in this case, pursuant to s 268 of the CPC read with s 256(b)(ii). Instead, the accused is convicted of using criminal force in committing theft under s 356 of the Code. The accused`s record shows ten previous convictions for theft. On the totality of the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that a sentence of two years` imprisonment would be appropriate, and I so order.

2881497,R v Tabalbag [2016] NSWSC 1570,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 26 October 2016 Roy Tabalbag was indicted on a charge that on 11 November 2013 he murdered Amin Sthapit. Mr Tabalbag pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown declined to accept that plea. Accordingly, a jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. The sole defence relied upon was the partial defence of provocation. On 2 November the jury, by a majority of 11 to 1, entered a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Mr Tabalbag now comes to be sentenced for that offence.
	


Circumstances of the Offence


	
	At the time of the offence Mr Tabalbag was living with his long term partner, Geecy Rebucas, in a small studio apartment at 2B Mona Road, Darling Point. She was working as a chef at the Golden Sheaf Hotel in Double Bay, as well as doing a cooking course at the TAFE at Ryde. He was working with Aussie Whitegoods, which at that time was stationed at Riverwood. They both came from the Philippines, where they had known each other since high school. When they were still at school they had had a short liaison, of about 6 months. Then, in 2007, they met up again and commenced an intimate relationship. They were living in Manila at the time. Ms Rebucas had a long term ambition to become a chef, and for that purpose she wanted to come to Australia in order to study commercial cookery. Mr Tabalbag agreed with that course, and the two of them came to Australia in 2012. At first they lived with Ms Rebucas’s relatives in the western suburbs of Sydney, and then moved to the Darling Point apartment, which was close to Ms Rebucas’s workplace. Mr Tabalbag had no relatives in Australia, but he forged a close relationship with Ms Rebucas’s Australian relatives.
	
	
	Unknown to Mr Tabalbag, in June or July of 2013 Ms Rebucas commenced an intimate relationship with Mr Sthapit, who was the head chef at the Golden Sheaf Hotel. In the month or so before the offence Mr Tabalbag sensed that there was something wrong. He asked Ms Rebucas on a number of occasions if she was all right, and if anything was wrong. He said in evidence that he was concerned for her health, as she had previously had lung surgery. She reassured him on each occasion that there was nothing wrong.
	
	
	An additional event occurred on the Friday evening immediately before the killing which might have ignited Mr Tabalbag’s suspicions. It is unnecessary for present purposes to go through the details here, but it involved an intense argument between Mr Sthapit and his fiancé outside the Golden Sheaf, which Mr Tabalbag observed when he came to collect Ms Rebucas after work.
	
	
	Mr Tabalbag and Ms Rebucas each had an iPhone operating on the same account, with a “Where’s my iPhone?” App. Mr Tabalbag had used it a couple of times a day in the week preceding 11 November in order to check Ms Rebucas’s whereabouts. On each occasion the response he obtained from the app was consistent with where she said she was.
	
	
	On the morning of Monday 11 November, Mr Tabalbag got up early, and left for work a little before 7 o’clock, as was his habit. Ms Rebucas was still asleep. Later in the morning there was an exchange of sms messages between them, largely concerning relatively trivial matters. On all accounts, this was a regular routine they had. During the morning Mr Tabalbag checked the location of Ms Rebucas’s iPhone. Given their previous messages, there was no doubt that she had it with her. Yet the app showed that the phone was still at the Darling Point apartment at a time when Ms Rebucas should have been at her cooking school. This raised Mr Tabalbag’s suspicions, so he gave his employer an excuse as to why he had to go home, and he drove back to the apartment building, parking his car nearby.
	
	
	When Mr Tabalbag reached the apartment itself he heard some noises inside. He opened the door and saw Ms Rebucas and Mr Sthapit, both naked, in bed having sexual intercourse. When they realised that Mr Tabalbag was there, Mr Sthapit ran into the bathroom and closed the door. Mr Tabalbag grabbed a chef’s knife, which was lying on top of a cupboard near the door. He broke open the bathroom door, and stabbed Mr Sthapit many times, to various parts of his body. The attacks continued after Mr Sthapit ran into the bedroom. As a result Mr Sthapit died shortly afterwards.
	
	
	As to Mr Tabalbag, he went back to his car and drove to St Mary’s, to the home of Ms Rebucas’s cousin with whom he had formed a close friendship. He told the cousin that he had stabbed somebody and that he should hand himself into the police. Accordingly, the two of them went to St Mary’s Police Station, where Mr Tabalbag told police what had happened. In due course it was realised that Mr Sthapit had died of his wounds. Mr Tabalbag was taken to Penrith Police Station where he was arrested and charged with murder. He has been in custody ever since.
	


The Course of the Trial


	
	The trial was a very brief one, as none of the essential elements in the Crown case was in dispute. The whole of the evidence occupied less than two days. The single factual issue related to Mr Tabalbag’s state of mind when he inflicted the fatal injuries, and in particular whether he had lost his self-control as a result of the actions of Mr Sthapit. Mr Tabalbag gave evidence in which he said that he had little memory of the stabbing itself – he could see his actions in the second or third person, but that was about all. He became extremely upset during the course of his evidence.
	
	
	The evidence indicated that Mr Tabalbag was a person of previous good character. He had no criminal convictions of any nature, and several witnesses spoke highly of him, saying that he had never previously displayed any signs of aggression. Accordingly, there was little issue as to the second requirement of the defence of provocation, namely that the conduct of the deceased was such that it could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to lose control and act, in effect, as Mr Tabalbag did.
	
	
	The jury was out considering its verdict for a considerable time, given the relative brevity of the evidence. Eventually, after more than 2 days of deliberations, the foreman came into the witness box and swore that it was not possible for them to reach a unanimous verdict. I accordingly directed them that the stage had been reached when they could return with a majority verdict of 11 to 1. A very short time later the jury returned with its majority verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	At this stage I turn to say something about Mr Tabalbag’s background.
	


Mr Tabalbag’s Background


	
	Mr Tabalbag was born in Pagadian in the Philippines on 13 July 1985 and is now 31 years old. His parents separated when he was at preschool, and he and his three siblings were brought up by their mother, with support from her extended family. He had little contact with his father, who died when he was 16. His mother taught chemistry at high school. She is now retired.
	
	
	After finishing his schooling, Mr Tabalbag went to Mindanao State University where he undertook a four year degree course in information technology. He graduated in 2006, after which he moved to Manila where he obtained employment. He remained with his principal employer for 6 years, and was promoted from technical support to supervisor and trainer.
	
	
	As already mentioned, in 2007 he commenced a relationship with Ms Rebucas. In 2012 they moved to Australia because of her desire to study cookery. She already had extended family here. He had no family here, but he quickly forged close relationships with Ms Rebucas's family members. At the same time he maintained contact with his own family and friends in the Philippines, as indicated by written references provided by a number of them.
	
	
	Mr Tabalbag already spoke English, and within a very short time of arriving in Australia he obtained a job with Aussie Whitegoods. He was still working there at the time of this offence. His employer, Liam Bartels, gave evidence at the trial. Mr Tabalbag's job was to field incoming calls from customers, book service jobs and arrange for contractors to go out and fix appliances. Mr Bartels spoke extremely highly of him, describing him as being very intelligent and having a ""terrific work ethic"". He was always at work on time, and was a very calm and non-aggressive person. This was an important trait for his work, Mr Bartels said, as he sometimes received difficult calls.
	
	
	Mr Tabalbag's relationship with Ms Rebucas remained a close, intimate and loving one, even after she had commenced her relationship with Mr Sthapit. As far as Mr Tabalbag was concerned, they were planning to get married and have children.
	
	
	As already mentioned, Mr Tabalbag has no previous convictions of any kind, either here or in the Philippines. Since his incarceration for this offence, he has undertaken a number of courses in prison, some of them of a religious nature: he has always been a committed Catholic. He has received extremely positive reports from Corrective Services staff members, and enthusiastic references from friends.
	
	
	I now turn to discuss the objective seriousness of this offence.
	


Seriousness of this Offence


	
	The range of seriousness for manslaughter is arguably greater than for any other offence. It can range from a foolish joke which went disastrously wrong, on the one hand, to something only a little short of murder on the other. By definition it involves the taking of a human life, and is therefore regarded as an extremely serious offence.
	
	
	The only aggravating factor relating to this offence which was suggested by the Crown, is that it involved the use of a knife, pursuant to s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (""the Act""). However, as Ms Rigg SC, who appeared for Mr Tabalbag, pointed out, this was an inherent part of the offence. Without it, there would have been no killing. In addition, the fact that a knife was used is in any event to be taken into account when assessing the extent of the violence involved in this offence. Accordingly, I decline to take it into account as an additional aggravating factor.
	
	
	The one mitigating factor, pursuant to s 21A(3)(b) of the Act, is that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this case falls slightly above the mid-line of seriousness for offences of this nature, given the sustained nature of the attack on the deceased, and the number of stab wounds inflicted. Ms Rigg conceded that, given the degree of violence inflicted on the deceased, who was entirely defenceless at the time, it is a serious offence. However the nature of the provocation itself and the immediacy of the response, are also relevant factors, which in this case serve to reduce Mr Tabalbag's objective culpability. This being the case, Ms Rigg submits that this is less serious than a mid-range offence.
	
	
	Taking all these factors into account, I consider that this offence falls slightly below the midline of objective seriousness for offences of manslaughter by reason of provocation. Certainly the violence involved was of a very serious and sustained nature. On the other hand, although Mr Tabalbag undoubtedly had his suspicions about his partner at that stage, it remained a close, loving relationship - at least as far as he was concerned. It was clearly a huge shock when he opened the door to reveal what was happening inside the apartment. A report of the psychologist, Anna Robilliard, was tendered on sentence. She said that Mr Tabalbag's account of his feelings at the time were consistent with his having undergone an autonomic limbic response to a perceived threat, with a defensive (fight) response of aggressive action. In other words, he truly had no control over his actions. In the present case, it is probable that the extent of the violence Mr Tabalbag exhibited, was indicative of the extent of his loss of self-control, rather than of any innate tendency to violence. In addition, the knife - a large, sharp-pointed weapon - just happened to be in easy reach immediately after he opened the door.
	


Other Aggravating and Mitigating Factors


	
	I turn to discuss the aggravating and mitigating factors relating to Mr Tabalbag personally.
	
	
	There are no aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	There are a number of mitigating factors under s 21A(3). First, Mr Tabalbag was a person of good character and had no previous convictions, under paragraphs 3(e) and (f). He has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend, under paragraphs 3(g) and (h). He has shown remorse for his actions, and has accepted responsibility for those actions by pleading guilty to manslaughter, pursuant to paragraphs 3(i) and (k). That last factor, his plea of guilty, is particularly significant. Both counsel agree that, in all the circumstances of this case, Mr Tabalbag should be given a 25% reduction in his sentence by reason of his plea of guilty.
	


The Appropriate Sentence


	
	The purposes of sentencing are set out in s 3A of the Act. Very briefly, they are: to punish the offender, to deter the offender and others, to protect the community, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct, and to recognise the harm done to the community. A number of these purposes point in opposite directions, and the sentencing process requires a delicate balancing of them, according to the facts of the immediate case.
	
	
	In relation to the harm done to the community, a very moving victim impact statement was tendered by Mr Sthapit’s long term partner. On behalf of the Court, I extend my deep condolences for her loss.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Mr Tabalbag has also been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in relation to a cut to Ms Rebucas’s finger which she suffered during the encounter which led to Mr Sthapit’s death. He has requested that this be taken into account when sentencing him for the present offence. Given that both offences arise out of the same circumstances, it is, in my view, highly appropriate that I do so. Accordingly, in sentencing Mr Tabalbag for the offence of manslaughter, I am taking that further offence into account.
	
	
	Mr Tabalbag has been in custody since 11 November 2013, and his sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Were it not for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a head sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. Applying a 25% reduction for his plea of guilty, I reach the following sentence:
	
	
	Roy Tabalbag, for the manslaughter of Amin Sthapit, and taking into account the offence on Form One, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole of 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 11 November 2013 and expiring on 10 May 2018, with an additional term of 18 months, commencing on 11 May 2018 and expiring on 10 November 2019.

		10 November 2016",2016-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2881514,R v Zolfonoon [2016] NSWCCA 250,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In November 2011, the NSW Police commenced an investigation under the name Strike Force Taipan into the supply of prohibited drugs by the respondent, Mr Zolfonoon, and others. As a consequence of the investigation, Mr Zolfonoon was charged with two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug in contravention of s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Mr Zolfonoon pleaded guilty to both offences.

The maximum penalty for each offence was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. Pursuant to s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the standard non-parole period was 15 years.

On 11 December 2015, Whitford SC DCJ sentenced Mr Zolfonoon to an aggregate head sentence of 10 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence from the date of his arrest on 29 August 2013. The sentencing judge assessed the respondent’s offending as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour considered that the respondent had excellent prospects of rehabilitation, was at a minimal risk of reoffending, and had shown genuine remorse. In separate proceedings, Whitford SC DCJ sentenced a co-offender of the respondent, Mr Wilson, to an aggregate head sentence of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.

The Crown appealed the respondent’s sentence pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.

The principal issues for determination were:

(i)   Whether the sentencing judge erred by double counting the respondent’s subjective features by taking them into account in fixing an overall sentence and in making a finding of special circumstances;

(ii)   Whether the sentencing judge erred by having regard to extraneous considerations not relevant to the sentencing exercise;

(iii)   Whether the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider principles of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation in fixing the overall sentence and non-parole period;

(iv)   Whether the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly inadequate by reference to the sentence imposed on Mr Wilson;

The Court (Beazley P, Garling and Fagan JJ):

In relation to (i): 

(1)   Principle and authority indicate that subjective factors are relevant both to fixing the components of a sentence and in finding special circumstances, and there may be overlap in the features to be taken into account in these two parts of the sentencing exercise. [70].

In relation to (ii):

(1)   The sentencing judge’s remarks about the absence of alternative sentencing options did not in any way influence his approach to the sentencing exercise. [71].

In relation to (iii):

(1)   The non-parole period must be the minimum period of custody appropriate to all the circumstances of the offence. [77]

Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 18; (1990) 169 CLR 525; Power v R [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623.

(2)   The adequacy of the non-parole period is to be approached by considering the mathematical ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence, the actual length of the non-parole period, and the purposes of sentencing laid down in the legislation. [76]

(3)   The purposes of sentencing laid down in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must be taken into account in determining the non-parole period, but these purposes are, at times, in conflict, and are not ranked by the legislature in order of priority. [76]

Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

(4)   The sentencing judge erred by imposing a non-parole period which failed adequately to reflect the principles of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation. [79]

In relation to (iv):

(1)   The non-parole period was manifestly inadequate having regard to the non-parole period imposed on Mr Wilson, in circumstances where the respondent’s criminality was of a higher order than Mr Wilson’s but the respondent was required to serve a shorter non-parole period than Mr Wilson. [80]-[81]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed in the District Court by his Honour Judge Whitford SC on 11 December 2015.
	
	
	On 17 July 2014, the respondent, Mr Kamran Zolfonoon, pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The first count concerned approximately 3.5 kgs of methylamphetamine and the second concerned approximately 9 kgs of the same drug. The maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment for life, a fine of $550,000, or both. A standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.
	
	
	On 11 December 2015, Whitford SC DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing on 29 August 2013.
	


Facts


	
	The facts, as set out by Whitford SC DCJ in his Remarks on Sentence, may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	In November 2011, NSW Police commenced an investigation under the name of Strike Force Taipan into the supply of prohibited drugs by the respondent and others. Two registered informers, a male and a female, were used in the investigation.
	
	
	On 24 November 2011, the female informer introduced the respondent to an undercover police officer (“the UCO”). The respondent indicated that he had access to large quantities of heroin and methylamphetamine. The UCO asked the respondent for samples of these drugs so that she could assess whether it was worth purchasing larger quantities. After this meeting, the respondent contacted AH, a co-offender, and asked if AH could provide him with samples.
	
	
	On 6 January 2012, after several weeks of difficulty acquiring the samples, the respondent supplied the UCO with 28.35g of methylamphetamine and 19.83g of heroin for $13,500. Surveillance indicated that the respondent obtained the samples from AH.
	
	
	On 10 January 2012, the female informer ordered 1kg of heroin from the respondent for purchase by the UCO. The respondent then met with AH. During that meeting, he called the UCO to inform her that the heroin could be supplied on 17 January 2012.
	
	
	On 17 January 2012, AH met Dashti, another co-offender, and obtained 1kg of heroin, which he then on-supplied to the respondent. The respondent then met with the UCO at the Wu Shu Academy in Rozelle and supplied 993g of heroin in exchange for $150,000.
	
	
	On 1 February 2012, the female informer ordered 0.5kg of heroin from the respondent for purchase by the UCO on 6 or 8 February 2012. The respondent then placed an order for 0.5kg of heroin with AH, who in turn placed an order for that heroin with Dashti. On 6 February 2012, Dashti supplied the heroin to AH, who in turn supplied it to the Respondent. That same day, the respondent supplied 496g of heroin to the UCO for $75,000.
	
	
	On 8 February 2012, the female informer ordered a further 2kg of heroin from the respondent for the UCO to purchase. The drugs were procured in the same way as described above, with the respondent contacting AH and AH contacting Dashti. However, on 9 February 2012, when the supply of the drugs to the UCO was to take place, Dashti was arrested at a storage facility in Artarmon. Consequently, this transaction did not proceed.
	
	
	In May 2012, in two meetings with the female informer, the respondent indicated that he had access to multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine. On 24 June 2012, at a meeting with the UCO, the respondent supplied the UCO with a sample of methylamphetamine (0.48g) and discussed supplying large quantities of the drug. The next day, the respondent left Australia and returned to the country on 2 September 2012.
	
	
	Between September 2012 and May 2013, the male informer met the respondent on 9 occasions. On 24 May 2013, the respondent provided the male informer with a sample of heroin (0.44g) and indicated that he had access to 4-10kg of the drug. On 30 May 2013, the respondent provided the male informer with a sample of methylamphetamine (0.23g) and indicated that he had access to 10-15kg of the drug. At this point, the police initiated further investigations into the respondent’s activities, as a result of which the police identified Haissan Saleh as an up-line supplier to the respondent.
	
	
	On 10 July 2013, the informers introduced the respondent to another UCO (“UCO 2”). At this meeting, the respondent arranged to supply UCO 2 with a kilogram “sample” of methylamphetamine on 19 July 2013. The transaction was subsequently postponed to 22 July 2013. At 4:46pm on 22 July 2013, the respondent met with UCO 2 at the Wu Shu Academy and indicated that he could no longer provide a kilogram of methylamphetamine. The respondent then called Saleh in an attempt to source a smaller quantity of methylamphetamine. Saleh then took steps to source methylamphetamine from his associates. At approximately 6:05pm, at the Wu Shu Academy, the respondent supplied UCO 2 with a sample (0.21g) of methylamphetamine. UCO 2 then expressed interest in obtaining more of the drug. The respondent then telephoned Saleh, saying “tell her it’s okay” and “just bring it”. A short time later, Saleh retrieved a small dark package from a vehicle of an associate, which he gave to UCO 2 at the Wu Shu Academy. The package contained 97.31g of methylamphetamine for which UCO 2 paid $21,000.
	
	
	On 29 July 2013, the respondent had a telephone conversation with UCO 2 and inquired when UCO 2 would be available to purchase the one kilogram “sample” of methylamphetamine to which earlier reference has been made. UCO 2 indicated that she would most likely be available on 5 or 6 August 2013. Also on 29 July 2013, the respondent met the female informer and supplied her with a sample (0.4g) of heroin and informed her that he would be able to supply multiple kilograms of heroin for $210,000 to $220,000 per kilogram.
	
	
	Shortly before 1pm on 6 August 2013, the respondent met with UCO 2 at Mascot. Saleh was in a vehicle nearby. The respondent informed UCO 2 that they had to travel to an address in Greenacre to obtain the kilogram of methylamphetamine. The respondent instructed UCO 2 to follow Saleh’s vehicle, in which the respondent would be travelling. On the way, Saleh called AB several times to inform him that he and the respondent were approaching the Greenacre address. Upon arriving at the address, the respondent went into the house, while UCO 2 waited in his vehicle. A short time later, the respondent emerged from the house carrying a purple bag. The respondent then supplied UCO 2 with 999.6g of methylamphetamine for $235,000. As this transaction was taking place, UCO 2 placed an order of 8 to 10kg of methylamphetamine with the respondent. After the transaction, the respondent took the purchase money into the house in a brown paper bag.
	
	
	On 26 August 2013, the respondent met UCO 2 and another UCO (“UCO 3”). UCO 2 asked about the progress of the order for multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine made on 6 August 2013. The respondent indicated that he had located an alternative supplier. The respondent then supplied a sample (0.31g) of methylamphetamine to UCO 2.
	
	
	At around 9pm on 27 August 2013, the respondent met with Saleh and his nephew, co-offender Kassim Saleh. At the meeting, the respondent was introduced to another co-offender, Jay Wilson, who Saleh and his nephew had identified as a potential alternative source of multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On or around 28 August 2013, Wilson provided the respondent with a Nokia mobile phone similar to one used by Wilson. The respondent and Wilson used those phones to communicate exclusively with each other.
	
	
	On 29 August 2013, the respondent and Wilson met UCO 2 at a warehouse in Kingsgrove for the purpose of supplying 8kgs of methylamphetamine in exchange for $1.8M. At the meeting, UCO 2 and Wilson counted the money, after which Wilson left the warehouse in a taxi and returned in a white vehicle. Wilson then removed an orange bucket from the boot of the vehicle, containing methylamphetamine. Wilson then supplied 7.977kg of methylamphetamine to UCO 2 for $1.8M, of which the respondent took a cut of $240,000. Wilson then placed the money in the white vehicle and attempted to drive away, but was stopped and arrested by police. The respondent attempted to hide in the warehouse but was eventually arrested.
	
	
	Subsequent to the respondent’s arrest, search warrants were executed at the Wu Shu Academy, where police found small amounts of heroin, opium and methylamphetamine, as well as drug paraphernalia.
	
	
	Overall, the respondent supplied 3.5kgs of heroin over the course of six transactions (including 2kgs of heroin the respondent agreed to supply but did not in fact supply), and 9.1kgs of methylamphetamine over the course of seven transactions.
	


Notice of Appeal


	
	On 15 December 2015, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions filed a Notice of Appeal against the respondent’s sentence relying upon the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing Judge, Whitford SC DCJ, delivered carefully prepared and comprehensive Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	His Honour began by noting that in sentencing the respondent for the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, he would take into account three additional offences of possession of prohibited drugs contained on a Form 1.
	
	
	His Honour set out in detail the facts which have been summarised above. His Honour assessed the respondent’s offending as falling below the mid‑range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. In coming to that conclusion, his Honour noted the number of transactions in which the respondent supplied prohibited drugs and the quantity of drugs involved in those transactions. In particular, his Honour noted that the purity of the heroin and methylamphetamine supplied was not high, particularly in the context of wholesale supply. His Honour identified the respondent as being one of several middlemen in a chain of supply. He concluded that the respondent was not operating as part of an organised hierarchy, but as an individual who used his connections to identify sources of drugs to be supplied to the UCOs. His Honour was satisfied that the respondent was a willing and enthusiastic participant in the transactions.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied that the respondent, at least in respect of the two largest methylamphetamine transactions, was motivated primarily by personal financial gain. Such financial gain was significant for the respondent as he was suffering a degree of financial stress. That financial stress was likely a consequence of his limited success in legitimate commercial endeavours and a lifestyle which he lacked the capacity to support.
	
	
	Leaving aside the final and largest transaction, his Honour concluded that the requests for supply made to the respondent by the two informants and the undercover police operatives:
	


“… provided the offender with an opportunity, which he willingly accepted, to benefit financially from insinuating himself into the chain of supply between them and the ultimate sources of supply to which his intermediary connections gave him indirect access”.


	
	His Honour separately considered the final transaction, which he concluded represented a substantial escalation in the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offending in comparison to the earlier transactions. The quantity of methylamphetamine supplied in this transaction significantly exceeded the large commercial quantity. The transaction involved a degree of sophistication and organisation that was not a feature of the earlier transactions. However, his Honour noted that the sophistication and organisation of this transaction was attributable primarily to the respondent’s co-offender, Mr Jay Wilson.
	
	
	His Honour then discussed a number of matters which tended to reduce the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offending, including that the offending was initiated and directed by the authorities such that none of the drugs entered the community, and the respondent’s offending was allowed to continue well beyond the point at which the respondent might have been arrested.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to consider the subjective features of the respondent. He noted that the respondent was born in Iran and was aged 47. He noted that the respondent had been in a longstanding relationship with his wife, and that they had an 11 year old daughter. His Honour referred to the report of a psychiatrist, which he assessed as having limited weight. His Honour then turned to consider more than 15 referees’ reports which were tendered on behalf of the respondent. He noted that these references reflected the respondent’s deep roots in the Persian community. His Honour summarised these references by saying that the common opinion among all the referees was that the respondent’s offending was “… an uncharacteristic aberration”.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to consider the question of the respondent’s rehabilitation and found that the respondent had excellent prospects of rehabilitation. He based that conclusion on the following:
	



	
	the continuing depth and strength of the support that the respondent enjoyed from his wife, family and broader community;
	
	
	the respondent’s history of consistent employment;
	
	
	the respondent’s conduct in prison which, according to Corrective Services records, had been exemplary and included making a positive contribution to the life of other prisoners, being polite and respectful to staff and inmates, and having a strong and professional work ethic;
	
	
	the fact that the respondent’s time in prison had already had a salutary effect upon him such that he was motivated to ensure that he would never find himself in prison again; and
	
	
	the fact that the respondent had no prior convictions save for one past driving-related offence.
	



	
	His Honour noted the genuine remorse of the respondent and expressed this conclusion:
	


“All these various matters I have outlined point strongly, in my assessment, to the likelihood of the offender making a law abiding return to the community. He has the inclination and the capacity for community service generally. He is motivated to provide for the family he has so horrendously let down by his conduct. I am satisfied on the whole of the material that the prospect of him ever reoffending is at best slight”.


	
	His Honour turned to consider the need for general deterrence, specific deterrence and rehabilitation. His Honour expressed these conclusions:
	


“121.   The various considerations I have outlined must be taken into account in a way that reflects appropriate proportionality between the circumstances of the crime committed and the sentence imposed, taking appropriate account, too, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect the fundamental notion of individualised justice underpinning the exercise of the sentencing discretion.

…

123.   However, the best interests of the community, to which the task of sentencing must ultimately be directed, are not served in my view by imposing a sentence which would be both crushing and operate to deny the community the considerable contributions which the offender is capable of making and, in my assessment, determined in the future to make.

124.   Furthermore, it seems to me that the various countervailing objectives of sentencing can be adequately addressed in this exercise by an appropriately structured sentence. Considerations of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation can be well addressed by a head-sentence proportionate to, in particular, the objective circumstances of the offending. It seems to me that a head-sentence so determined will also contribute a necessary dimension of specific deterrence. Any risk of re-offending, to the extent it exists, can be well addressed by the knowledge that if he reoffends when he is released to parole, the offender faces the prospect of completing the whole of a substantial term of imprisonment”.


	
	His Honour then reiterated that there was a “… real likelihood of the offender in the future making a substantial, law abiding contribution to the life of the community and his family”. His Honour found special circumstances which he regarded as significant.
	
	
	His Honour noted the Crown submission that there should be some accumulation between the two sentences “… but not to any significant degree”. His Honour accepted that submission and found that some accumulation was warranted. His Honour recorded that the respondent was entitled to at 25% discount in respect of each offence to reflect the utilitarian value of his early guilty plea.
	
	
	Having reviewed of all of these matters at some length and, as we have remarked earlier, quite carefully and comprehensively, his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 29 August 2013 and expiring on 28 August 2017, and a balance of term of 6 years and 9 months expiring 28 May 2024.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	Although the Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate by reference to general sentencing standards, the Crown pointed to a number of specific matters which it submitted contributed to that erroneous outcome.
	
	
	First, the Crown submitted that his Honour double-counted the respondent’s subjective circumstances by taking them into account in fixing an overall sentence and in making a finding of special circumstances. The Crown’s submission was directed at the following paragraph of his Honour’s reasons:
	


“126.   Having regard to the various matters I have outlined, I am satisfied that the minimum period that the offender must serve, in order to reflect the objective gravity of his offending and the circumstances in which it was committed, and taking appropriate account, too, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect the fundamental notion of individualised justice to which I have already referred, admits of a significant finding of special circumstances in his favour”.


	
	Second, the Crown submitted that the learned sentencing Judge was “distracted” from giving proper weight to the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offending because he “… [took] into account a series of what could be described as extraneous and irrelevant ‘policy considerations’ ”. At [127], his Honour made the following remarks:
	


“127.   [I]t is unfortunate that there is not more flexibility in the options available to a sentencing judge to achieve justice in individual cases … In the present day our prisons are filled to overflowing. The daily cost of keeping a prisoner in custody is substantial. The adequate resourcing of the criminal justice system seems beyond the fiscal capacity of governments … [W]here the immediate protection or safety of the community is not otherwise an issue, there seems to be much to recommend alternative forms of punishment.”


	
	The Crown submitted that these considerations were irrelevant to the sentencing exercise upon which his Honour was engaged and to the purposes of sentencing prescribed by the legislation.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submitted that his Honour had regard to the principles of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation only in the fixing of the total sentence. The Crown submitted that those principles of sentencing were also relevant to the fixing of the non-parole period. The Crown submitted that the non-parole period was manifestly inadequate in part because of his Honour’s failure to consider those principles in fixing the non-parole period.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that his Honour provided for inadequate accumulation between the two indicative sentences. The Crown submitted that the effective accumulation of the indicative sentences was only 6 months on the non-parole period and 1 year on the head sentence.
	
	
	In oral submissions to this Court, the Crown did not challenge the sentencing Judge’s assessment of the respondent’s offending as falling below the mid‑range of objective seriousness. However, the Crown maintained that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour was so low as to be demonstrative of error.
	


Respondent’s Submissions


	
	The respondent’s submissions commenced by drawing attention to the principle that a manifestly inadequate sentence is one that is “… unreasonable or plainly unjust”: see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.
	
	
	The respondent then pointed to particular matters of significance to the respondent’s offending and subjective circumstances which had been referred to in his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence. The respondent also submitted that the sentencing Judge carefully considered the facts in accordance with settled principle and, in particular, took into account in accordance with the relevant legal authorities the nature and conduct of police who had directed the informants and the UCOs.
	
	
	The respondent’s submissions then addressed each of the four submissions made by the Crown.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown’s first submission, the respondent submitted that it accords with principle for a sentencing Judge to consider all the relevant attributes and matters peculiar to an offender. It follows in the respondent’s submission that it is not illegitimate, nor double counting, for a sentencing Judge to consider the whole of the relevant material in assessing the offender’s subjective case and in determining whether the threshold of special circumstances has been met. The respondent submitted that the sentencing Judge appropriately took into account the respondent’s subjective case in order to determine the minimum term of incarceration that was necessary to reflect the seriousness of his offending, and ensured that adequate consideration was given to the respondent’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	In particular, the respondent submitted that the decisions of this Court in R v El‑Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [105] and Mitreski v R [2015] NSWCCA 137 indicate that factors relevant to the imposition of a non-parole period and the total sentence may also be taken into account in finding special circumstances, without offending any rule against double counting.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown’s second submission, the respondent submitted that the remarks of the sentencing Judge concerning the lack of alternative sentencing options did not inform the exercise of his Honour’s discretion in sentencing the respondent. The respondent submitted that all the sentencing Judge was doing was highlighting, as is entirely appropriate from time to time, the lack of flexibility in sentencing options. The respondent submitted that it could not be said that these matters infected the sentencing Judge’s discretion in circumstances where his Honour carefully considered all of the principles relevant to the sentencing exercise before sentencing the respondent.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown’s third submission, the respondent submitted that it would be an erroneous approach for this Court to confine its focus to the comparatively low percentage proportion that the non-parole period bore to the overall sentence. Here that percentage proportion was 37.2%. The respondent submitted that it did not automatically follow that in such circumstances either the non-parole period or the total sentence was manifestly inadequate. In support of that submission, the respondent pointed to the decision of this Court in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7. In that case, R A Hulme J at [28] expressed the uncontroversial view that the focus of this Court on an appeal against sentence should not solely be upon the percentage proportions that the non-parole and parole period bear to the total term. Rather, the actual periods involved ought to be the focus because they are “equally, and probably more, important”.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown’s fourth submission concerning inadequate accumulation of the sentences, the respondent, noting that the sentences referred to were only indicative sentences and therefore of no dispositive relevance, drew attention to Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27], where Howie J said:
	


“In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? …”


	
	The respondent submitted that an answer to the question posed by Howie J would depend on the variable factors present in each individual case, and that what was called for was an analysis of the nature and seriousness of each offence and the factors relevant to the assessment of the totality of criminality. The respondent submitted that the series of individual drug transactions in which he was involved took place over an 18 month period and could properly be understood as a single continuing enterprise that was extended primarily because of police operations.
	
	
	Finally, the respondent submitted that even if the Court took the view that the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate, the Court should nevertheless exercise its residual discretion not to intervene and dismiss the appeal. In support of that submission, the respondent drew attention to the following matters:
	



	
	the precise role the respondent played in the offences relative to other offenders;
	
	
	the involvement of the authorities in the commission of the offences;
	
	
	the delay between the respondent’s arrest and the imposition of sentence at first instance;
	
	
	the subjective circumstances of the respondent, including his rehabilitation during his time in custody; and
	
	
	the fact that the respondent had already spent 2 years and 9 months in custody prior to the appeal coming on for hearing.
	


Other Relevant Sentences


	
	The Crown drew attention to the sentences imposed on a range of individuals who were dealt with for involvement to varying degrees in the police operation. Two sentences imposed on individuals who were connected with the supply by the respondent of methylamphetamine were of potential relevance. Neither of these sentences was the subject of an appeal to this Court.
	
	
	The first sentence related to an offender identified by the initials “JK”. JK stood for sentence before Whitford SC DCJ having pleaded guilty to one count of knowing participation in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being 7.977kg of methylamphetamine. As has already been discussed, this supply of methylamphetamine took place at a warehouse in Kingsgrove and culminated in the arrest of the respondent and Mr Jay Wilson.
	
	
	JK was associated with Mr Wilson. JK’s involvement in the transaction at the warehouse was at a very low level. The sentencing Judge accepted that the extent of JK’s involvement in the transaction was facilitating the introduction of Mr Wilson to the respondent, Mr Saleh and Mr Saleh’s nephew. It was in that way that JK knowingly participated in the supply of the 7.977kg of methylamphetamine. The sentencing Judge noted that JK did not profit from this action, and was not relevantly part of any hierarchy of supply in respect of the commercial dealing of drugs.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge was impressed with the subjective case advanced on behalf of JK. He noted JK’s ongoing drug use. He found that JK’s risk of reoffending was low to medium. The sentencing Judge also found that JK’s case was exceptional. He said of JK that:
	


“The offending represents the naïve act of an immature young man who foolishly acceded to the request that was made of him. He was not motivated by any desire or intention himself to engage in criminal activity, nor to profit from that activity by others. He was asked to make an introduction and he did so, not wishing himself to be a party to any sale or purchase of drugs, but presumably seeking for himself some cachet or social capital in the antisocial milieu into which his own escalating drug use had drawn him.”


	
	JK was sentenced to a total term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. The sentencing Judge accorded JK a 25% discount on the sentence on account of his early guilty plea.
	
	
	This brief summary indicates that there are significant differences between JK and the respondent. We do not regard JK’s circumstances and sentence as being of any relevance in considering the adequacy of the respondent’s sentence.
	
	
	The second matter, which was of direct relevance, was the sentence imposed by Whitford SC DCJ on Mr Wilson. As has already been mentioned, Mr Wilson sourced the 7.977kg of methylamphetamine which he and the respondent supplied to the UCOs before they were arrested. Mr Wilson pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and stood for sentence on 1 May 2015, some seven months prior to the respondent.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge found that Mr Wilson was part of an organised group involved in the supply of drugs and was not operating alone. The group was well organised and employed a degree of sophistication in order to avoid detection. His Honour found that Mr Wilson was an authorised and trusted member of the group who was capable of arranging, and did arrange, the supply of a large commercial quantity of drugs to the respondent. He was a person who was acting with autonomy and in a manner that was coherently planned. The sentencing Judge was satisfied that Mr Wilson’s primary motivation was personal financial gain.
	
	
	Mr Wilson was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years and 6 months with a non‑parole period of 6 years. He was allowed a 25% discount for his plea of guilty.
	


Discernment


	
	It is convenient to commence consideration of this Crown appeal with two observations. The first is that the sentencing Judge’s Remarks on Sentence were thorough and careful. It was not suggested that his Honour failed to have regard to any relevant factor or legal principle, nor that he did not identify, or have regard to, all of the relevant facts.
	
	
	The second observation is that the Crown appeal does not point to any discrete error in the sentencing Judge’s Remarks on Sentence, but rather claims that error emerges once one views his Honour’s sentence in light of “… all the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence”: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [60].
	
	
	In light of these observations, the question upon which this Court is embarked is that expressed by the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39; (2015) 244 A Crim R 280 at [27], namely:
	


“Appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excessiveness or inadequacy is not warranted unless, having regard to all of the relevant sentencing factors, including the degree to which the impugned sentence differs from sentences that have been imposed in comparable cases, the appellate court is driven to conclude that there must have been some misapplication of principle.”


	
	The Crown did not seek to make good its appeal by taking the Court to comparable cases in this Court, or sentencing statistics. Rather, the Crown, by pointing to the matters to which reference has earlier been made, attempted to demonstrate that too much or else inadequate weight had been given to particular features of this case. Even if the Crown succeeds on questions of weight, it still must persuade the Court that the sentence imposed on the respondent was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	As well, the Crown relies upon the principle that although indicative sentences are not of themselves amenable to an appeal, an erroneous approach in the indication of the sentences, including the extent to which they are accumulated, may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence imposed: R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [15].
	
	
	As this is a Crown appeal, it is important to keep in mind the approach which this Court must follow. That approach is, with respect, well stated by Johnson J, with whom Gleeson JA and Garling J agreed in R v Wood [2012] NSWCCA 231; (2012) 84 NSWLR 581 where his Honour said at [50]-[51]:
	


“50.   In order for the Crown to make good its claim of manifest inadequacy, it must satisfy this Court that the sentencing Judge’s discretion miscarried in the sense that the sentence imposed was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistent with sentencing standards: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at 588 [24]. In other words, it must be shown that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].

51.   Of course it is well established that, absent error, this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-478.”


	
	As to the first of the matters raised by the Crown, we are not persuaded that the sentencing judge impermissibly double counted the respondent’s subjective features in determining the total sentence and the non-parole period on the one hand and in finding special circumstances on the other. We accept the respondent’s submission that principle and authority indicate that subjective factors are relevant both to fixing the components of a sentence and in determining whether special circumstances exist. There may, but will not always, be overlap in the features to be taken into account in these two parts of the sentencing exercise. A different way of putting the Crown’s argument in this case is that the sentencing Judge placed too much weight on the existence of special circumstances in determining what non-parole period ought to be fixed. That argument can only be made out if the non-parole period is regarded as manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	As to the second matter raised by the Crown, we are not persuaded that the sentencing Judge’s remarks about the absence of alternative sentencing options in any way influenced the task upon which his Honour was engaged. His Honour made those remarks in a way which indicated that whilst he regretted the absence of those options, he was nevertheless required to sentence the respondent having regard to the principles and matters to which he was entitled and obliged to have regard. Indeed, a few paragraphs earlier, at [122] of his remarks, his Honour stated that “[t]he nature of [the respondent’s] offending is such that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate”.
	
	
	In considering whether the sentence (or any component of it) which his Honour imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust, it is necessary to consider the legislative guideposts for the offence in question. The maximum penalty for an offence against s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.
	
	
	In addition, the Court needs to contextualise the respondent’s sentence by viewing it prior to the application of the 25% discount for his early guilty plea. The respondent’s total undiscounted sentenced was 14 years and 4 months. Careful attention must also be paid to the non-parole period. The respondent’s undiscounted non-parole period was 5 years and 4 months.
	
	
	It is obvious that the non-parole period imposed upon the respondent represented a marked reduction from the standard non-parole period of 15 years. However, it is an error for this court in reviewing the sentence to focus on the maximum penalty fixed by the legislature or the standard non-parole period to the exclusion of all other factors. These legislative guideposts are factors to which a sentencing Judge, together with all other relevant matters, must have regard: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
	
	
	The sentencing Judge clearly gave significant, but in our view excessive, weight to the subjective case of the respondent and, in particular, to the finding that he was unlikely to reoffend. There was material upon which such findings could be made. It is undoubted that, as the sentencing judge concluded, a lengthy period on parole will provide a salutary constraint on the respondent’s behaviour should he be tempted to reoffend. However, this was a matter which needed to be kept in balance with the other matters.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission that the non-parole period failed to reflect the sentencing objectives of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation must be approached by considering not just the mathematical ratio of the non‑parole period to the total sentence (37.2%), but also by focussing on the actual length of the non-parole period. It is correct that the purposes of sentencing as laid down in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 apply to all parts of a sentence imposed. But it must be kept in mind that these purposes which are, at times, in conflict, are not ranked by the legislature in order of priority: Muldrock at [20].
	
	
	A non-parole period is correctly to be seen as a mitigation of punishment in favour of rehabilitation through conditional freedom by parole. Ultimately, the non‑parole period actually imposed must be the minimum period of custody appropriate to all of the circumstances of the offence: Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 18; (1990) 169 CLR 525; Power v R [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623.
	
	
	This Court has very recently considered the adequacy of a non-parole period imposed in the case of two offenders who were sentenced for offences against s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. For an aggregate sentence imposed for two offences, one of which involved 1kg of methylamphetamine which was below the mid-range of objective seriousness “but not appreciably so”, and the second which involved 13.384kg of methylamphetamine which was in the mid-range of objective seriousness, Hoeben CJ at CL (with whose reasons and orders Fullerton J and RS Hulme AJ agreed) considered, in R v Hatzisavvas; R v Lopez-Rios [2016] NSWCCA 147, that a non-parole period of 5 years for one offender, and 5 years and 6 months for the second offender was so inadequate as to warrant appellate intervention. At [92], the Chief Judge concluded:
	


“Against a standard non-parole period of 15 years the non-parole periods of 5 years and 5 years 6 months for two large commercial supply offences cannot be justified even on the most favourable view of the respondent’s criminal offending and their subjective cases. I have concluded that the aggregate sentences are so inadequate as to amount to “an affront to the administration of justice which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system” (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [42]; R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [282]).”


	
	Whilst it is not obvious that the sentencing Judge ignored matters of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation when fixing the non-parole period in this case, the focus of His Honour’s remarks when he dealt with the “sentence structure” – an expression which is to be understood in this case as meaning the determination of the non-parole period – was on the importance to the respondent (and the community) of rehabilitation, the respondent’s low risk of re‑offending and the respondent’s strong prospect of making “a substantial, law abiding contribution to the life of the community and his family”. Although the sentencing judge undertook an evaluation of the minimum period of custody which the respondent ought to serve in all of the circumstances, we have concluded that there must have been a misapplication of principle because the result of the careful sentencing process which was undertaken in this case cannot be justified. The Crown’s submission about the inadequacy of the non-parole period imposed on the respondent ought to be accepted.
	
	
	The manifest inadequacy of the non-parole period also emerges from a comparison of the sentence imposed on the respondent with the sentence imposed on his co-offender, Mr Wilson. It is to be recalled that the respondent was sentenced for two offences comprising 13 separate transactions of prohibited drugs. His total sentence of 10 years and 9 months was only three months longer than the total sentence imposed upon Mr Wilson, who was sentenced only for one offence comprising a single transaction in which the respondent also participated. As well, the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period on Mr Wilson which was two years longer than the respondent.
	
	
	The features identified in the sentencing Judge’s remarks do not seem to be capable of accounting for the sentences imposed on each of Mr Wilson and the respondent. It is true that, unlike the respondent, Mr Wilson did not have a strong subjective case and was not found to be at a minimal risk of reoffending. This notwithstanding, we are persuaded that the respondent’s sentence was manifestly inadequate by reference to the sentence imposed on Mr Wilson. The respondent’s criminality was of a higher order than Mr Wilson’s, given the quantity of drugs involved in his offending and the duration of that offending.
	


Conclusion


	
	This was an unusual case which presented itself for the sentencing Judge’s assessment. He was required to keep in mind a sense of relativity to, and parity with, the sentences he imposed on other offenders. He was required to balance the particular and unusual subjective circumstances of the respondent. He was dealing with serious offences of a kind which this Court has emphasised require careful attention to the principle of general deterrence. The offences were committed in circumstances where, as His Honour noted, the assessment of objective criminality was influenced by the criminal conduct being permitted (if not encouraged) by police to continue for a long period after initial discovery, when the respondent could have been arrested.
	
	
	Although the sentencing Judge was entitled to conclude that a degree of leniency ought to be extended to the respondent, we are driven to the conclusion that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate, both in respect of the non-parole period, and the total sentence. The Crown has demonstrated error by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	This conclusion necessarily resolves the Crown’s submission that there was too little accumulation of the indicative sentences.
	


Residual Discretion


	
	Even though the Crown has established error in the sentence imposed, the Court needs to consider whether the Crown has persuaded it that it should intervene to re-sentence the respondent. This Court has a “lively” discretion to exercise in determining whether to intervene to resentence: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 242 CLR 462; R v Wood [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]; R v Mereb; R v Younan [2014] NSWCCA 149 at [30]-[31], [40].
	
	
	The respondent submitted that a number of matters tended against this Court intervening to re-sentence him. As I have earlier mentioned at [54], he relied upon the precise role which he played in the offences compared with the other offenders; the involvement of the authorities in the commission, and prolongation, of the offences; the considerable delay between his arrest and sentencing at first instance; his subjective circumstances, including his rehabilitation whilst in custody; and the fact that, to date, he has spent over three years in custody.
	
	
	The facts show that the respondent’s offending occurred during 2012 until his arrest on 29 August 2013. He has remained in custody since that time. Proceedings on sentence took place on 5 June 2015 and 30 October 2015. No explanation has been provided to this Court which would address the near two year delay between the respondent’s arrest and the commencement of the sentence proceedings. Sentence was imposed on 11 December 2015. The Notice of Appeal was served on the respondent within a few days. The appeal was heard within 6 months of the sentence being imposed, which is not an unreasonable period.
	
	
	The effect of this chronology is that the respondent will have served about three-quarters of his non-parole period by the time the Court comes to resentence him if the Crown appeal is upheld. This is often an important factor for this Court to consider, but it is neither the only relevant matter, nor is it a determinative one.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court’s residual discretion ought not be exercised because of the importance of laying down principles for the “…governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons …” (see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [1]). The Crown submitted that such was the disparity between the sentence imposed, and a proper sentence, that guidance to sentencing judges was essential given the serious nature of the criminality which existed in this case.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that it is for the Crown to persuade the Court that it should intervene: CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 317 ALR 308. It is for the Crown to “… to negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised”: R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; (2002) 136 A Crim R 451. This statement of Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) was approved by the High Court in CMB by French CJ and Gageler J at [34], and by Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ at [56].
	
	
	As was said in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [2], circumstances relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion can include consequential disparity relative to an unchallenged sentence imposed on a co-offender, and any delay in the appeal process which may disrupt an offender's progress towards rehabilitation. I see no reason why delay in the sentencing process as a whole which is not demonstrated to have been the result of an offender’s conduct cannot also be taken into account. On some occasions, the resentencing of a respondent can result in manifest unfairness, particularly where a considerable part of the non-parole period of a sentence has been served.
	
	
	Ultimately, the question for the Court is whether the Crown has demonstrated that it would not be unfair or unjust to this respondent for the Court to intervene, having regard to the principles applicable to upholding a Crown appeal. The matters to which reference has just been made all weigh in favour of the exercise of the Court’s residual discretion. However, in our view, such is the extent of the discrepancy between the sentence imposed and an appropriate sentence that it would be inappropriate for the Court to exercise its residual discretion in this case. The respondent’s sentence needs to be corrected to provide guidance to sentencing judges dealing with offences of this kind.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court should proceed to resentence the respondent.
	


Resentence


	
	As the facts outlined above at [4] to [22] indicate, the offences were objectively serious. Although the Crown did not challenge the sentencing judge’s conclusion that the offending fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness, we are not constrained in resentencing the respondent by that assessment. However, while that assessment may have been unduly favourable to the respondent, we think it fairer in all the circumstances to proceed to resentence on that basis.
	
	
	The quantity of the drugs involved in the respondent’s offending was significant: 3.5kg of heroin and 9.1kg of methylamphetamine. In addition to the two principal offences, there were three additional offences of drug possession to be considered and taken into account on a Form 1. The offending took place over a reasonably lengthy period of time, and comprised 13 transactions. It was not a one-off case of criminal behaviour. The respondent was involved only for financial gain, and was a willing and enthusiastic participant in the events. The transaction involving the supply of 9.1kg of methylamphetamine was particularly sophisticated and organised. And as we have identified above at [81], it is necessary in resentencing the respondent to recognise the higher level of criminality involved in his offending vis-à-vis Mr Wilson’s offending.
	
	
	We accept that the respondent has strong subjective circumstances of the kind detailed above at [31] to [33]. As well, the respondent has continued to make good progress towards rehabilitation whilst in custody. A finding of special circumstances should be made. We also accept that it was appropriate for the sentencing judge to allow a 25% discount for the respondent’s early guilty plea. We follow that course here.
	
	
	We propose to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence. The indicative sentences, after allowing for the discount for the respondent’s plea of guilty, are as follows:
	


Count 1: 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.

Count 2: 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.


	
	The sentence for Count 2 should be accumulated on the sentence for Count 1.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence which is appropriate to impose on the respondent, after allowing for the discount for his plea of guilty, is one of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years.
	


Orders


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed;
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 11 December 2015;
	
	
	In lieu of that sentence, impose an aggregate sentence on the respondent of a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing 29 August 2013, and concluding on 28 August 2023, with a balance of term of 5 years, concluding on 28 August 2028.

2881515,DN v R [2016] NSWCCA 252,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The complainant was an employee of the video store which the appellant managed. The appellant was convicted of one count of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 61J(1) and one count of inciting a person under the age of 16 years to commit an act of indecency with knowledge it was being filmed for the purpose of the production of child abuse material contrary to s 61O(2A) of the same. Both offences occurred on 8 March 2012 at the house of the appellant.

The appellant was cross-examined at trial as to what had happened to the mobile phone on which the photos of the complainant the subject of the s 61O(2A) offence were said to have been taken and stored. In closing, the Crown prosecutor referred to the disposal of the phone as corroborating the complainant’s account of the events the subject of the trial if the appellant’s evidence in relation to the phone was not believed.

No direction was sought at trial, and none was given, in relation to consciousness of guilt reasoning. The Crown did not submit on appeal that such a direction would have been inappropriate and acknowledged that the statement to the jury in closing could have been understood as an invitation to engage in consciousness of guilt reasoning.

On 24 July 2015 the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 10 months imprisonment with respect to the s 61O(2A) offence and a six year term of imprisonment for the 61J(1) offence with a non-parole period of four years. In imposing the sentence the trial judge considered as relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence the fact that the appellant was in a position of dominance as the complainant’s employer and was in a particular position of trust at the time the offending conduct occurred. The trial judge found that the appellant had demonstrated no remorse.

The appellant sought leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence. The matters to be determined on appeal were:

i)   Whether a substantial miscarriage of justice had been occasioned as a consequence of either the Crown’s use of consciousness of guilt reasoning and/or the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury regarding consciousness of guilt reasoning; and

ii)   Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Held:

In relation to i)

1.   In cases where a lie is relied upon as probative of guilt the jury must be directed that they may take the lie into account only if they are satisfied that it reveals knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and it was told because the accused was aware that the matter about which he or she lied would implicate him or her in the offence. [61]-[62]

Edwards v R (1998) 178 CLR 193 at 208-11; [1993] HCA 63.

2.   There are some circumstances where it may be the case that the risk of misunderstanding on the part of the jury as to the use that lies may be put to is such that a direction in accordance with Edwards is appropriate notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. [64]-[68]

Zoneff v the Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234; [2000] HCA 28; McKey v R (2012) 219 A Crim R 227; [2012] NSWCCA 1; R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52; R v GJH (2001) 122 A Crim R 361; [2001] NSWCCA 128

3.   A direction concerning consciousness of guilt was appropriate in these circumstances as, if they did not accept the appellant’s account, the jury would have been led to treat the disposal of the phone as almost indisputable evidence that the appellant had committed the offence contrary to s 61O(2A). [77]

4.   However, having regard to the whole of the evidence, the appellant had not demonstrated a substantial miscarriage of justice occasioned by the failure to direct the jury in relation to consciousness of guilt reasoning. [88]

Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300; [2005] HCA 81; Darkan v The Queen (2006) 227 CLR 373; [2006] HCA 34; Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29.

In relation to ii)

1.   In circumstances where no specific error is identified in the sentencing process of the trial judge it is incumbent on the party seeking to demonstrate manifest excess to show that the result embodied in the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. [105]

Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25.

2.   No such error was demonstrated in the trial judge’s reasoning in relation to the sentence to be imposed. [110]-[111]

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: The appellant appeals from his conviction of one count of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 61J(1) and one count of inciting a person under the age of 16 years to commit an act of indecency with knowledge it was being filmed for the purpose of the production of child abuse material contrary to the Crimes Act, s 61O(2A). The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 61J(1) is 20 years imprisonment. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The maximum sentence for an offence contrary to s 61O(2A) is 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 24 July 2015, the appellant was sentenced for the s 61O(2A) offence to a fixed term of 10 months imprisonment and for the s 61J(1) offence a non-parole period of 4 years with the balance of term of 2 years. The sentences were ordered to be served wholly concurrently. The first date upon which the appellant will be eligible for parole is 23 July 2019.
	
	
	The appellant seeks leave to appeal from his conviction on the following grounds:
	


(1)   That a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of:


	
	The prosecutor’s use of consciousness of guilt reasoning; and/or
	
	
	The trial judge’s failure to direct the jury regarding consciousness of guilt reasoning: ground 1.
	



	
	The appellant seeks leave to appeal from sentence on the following ground:
	


(2)   The sentence is manifestly excessive: ground 3.

(Ground 2 was abandoned before the hearing of the appeal.)

Background facts


	
	The appellant, at the time of the occurrence of the offences, worked in his father’s video hire business. He was then aged 25 years and 11 months. The complainant, in response to an advertisement, applied for a casual position at the video shop. When making her application, she provided a brief typewritten resume which included her date of birth. She commenced working in the shop after school, working two to three shifts per week, usually between 5.30pm and 8.30pm. Her parents usually collected her from work.
	
	
	On the Crown case, the appellant began touching the complainant inappropriately when she was working behind the front counter of the shop. He continued doing so, notwithstanding the complainant’s verbal resistance to his doing so. The complainant alleged that a number of incidents occurred which formed the subject of counts 1, 2 and 3 on the indictment, in respect of which the jury returned verdicts of not guilty.
	
	
	The incidents the subject of the charges of which the appellant was convicted occurred on 8 March 2012. On that occasion, the complainant worked at the video store from 5.30pm to 8.30pm with the appellant. She was asked to work late. The appellant telephoned her stepmother and obtained permission for her to do so and for him to drive the complainant home after work. During the course of the shift, the appellant gave her a new mobile phone, saying to her, “[t]his is your new phone, because your phone is barred”. This was a reference to the fact that the complainant’s mobile phone was barred because she had gone past the $400 cap limit on her service. The complainant used the phone on that day and for a couple of days thereafter.
	
	
	At the end of the shift, the appellant and complainant closed up the video store. After a short stop at a nearby pizza outlet, the complainant told him she wanted to go home. The appellant did not drive her straight home but rather went to his home, parking the vehicle in the driveway. When the complainant asked what they were doing there, the appellant told the complainant that he “wanted to put the money in the safe, and collect his dad’s keys so he could drive his dad’s car”. The complainant went inside the house with him and, at his direction, went into his sister’s room at the front of the house. The appellant then called to her from his bedroom and she joined him there and sat on the queen-sized bed as the appellant put his clothes away.
	
	
	The appellant then removed the complainant’s work shirt. In examination, the complainant said, “he told me that I would be walking home if he did not take another photo”. The complainant was frightened and allowed him to pull her shirt off. She was wearing a cream-coloured bra. The appellant then forced the complainant to have oral sex with him. This conduct was the subject of count 4 on the indictment, being the offence contrary to s 61J(1).
	
	
	The appellant then, using his iPhone, took one or two photographs of the complainant’s bare breasts before she got dressed. Although her evidence varied as to the state of her clothing, her final position was that when the appellant took a photo of her, she only had her pants on, the appellant already having removed her bra as well as her shirt. The complainant could not recall where the appellant was when he took those photographs. This conduct was the subject of count 5 on the indictment, being the offence contrary to s 61O(2A).
	
	
	On Saturday 10 March 2012, the complainant disclosed to a number of school friends that the appellant had tried to force her to have oral sex with him in the video shop. The complainant conceded in evidence that this had not occurred, but said that it was her way of telling her friends that something had happened. She accepted in evidence that what she had told her friends was a lie but said that she was upset and wanted to tell them something about the appellant. She said that she started to cry on this occasion. She said in cross-examination that she had not told her friends of the incidents on 8 March 2012 as she was “too scared” and that “talking about it … wasn’t an option”.
	
	
	A number of school friends gave evidence and confirmed that the complainant had been upset, “was a mess” and had started to cry. The friends confirmed that the complainant told them of sexual activity that the appellant made her engage in but did not tell them of the incident at his house on 8 March 2012.
	
	
	The complainant also complained to her father and stepmother about the appellant’s conduct. One evening, which he put at about 10 March 2012, the complainant’s father came home from work and found his daughter in her bedroom crying. She told him that the appellant had “grabbed her on the breasts and put his crotch in her face”. The complainant’s father told her not to go back to the video store. Later that night, he went to the video store, returned some DVDs and also gave back the iPhone. When returning these items the complainant’s father said to the appellant, “[the complainant’s] told me what’s happened and if you ever see her I will fillet you you fat fuck”.  
	
	
	The complainant’s stepmother said that on 12 March 2012 she became aware of a text message on her son’s mobile phone to the effect that the appellant had pushed the complainant’s head into his crotch. She said she and the complainant’s father spoke to the complainant, asking if she enjoyed working at the video store and said:
	


“I asked her where this could have possibly happened, and she said it was in the back room of the video store. I asked her if it happened before, and she said that he often touched her. And she was still crying, and I said, ‘You will never have to work there again.’ From that point I then asked her where she had this new phone – she had a new iPhone that we did not buy for her, and she said that [the appellant] had given it to her, and I said, ‘Why?’ And she said, ‘Because I need a new phone.’ It was one of those new Apple phones.

…

She was very upset and I asked her what she wanted to do about it, and she said, ‘I want to go to the police.’ And I said to [the complainant] – I reiterated it, I said, ‘Are you sure you want to go to the police?’ I said, you know, ‘This comes with consequences and can affect other people’s lives; do you really want to go?’ And she said, ‘I really want to go to the police station.’ So when [the complainant’s father] returned I drove [the complainant] to the Waratah Police Station that evening.”


	
	On the same night, shortly after this conversation, the complainant attended with her stepmother to report the matters to the police. On the Crown case, the complainant had terminated her employment at the video store by the time she went to the police.
	
	
	One of the complainant’s co-workers at the video store gave evidence that the appellant had said to her on one occasion that he had had an argument with the complainant’s father and that he was “worried what she could say cause she’s only, like, a certain age”. She thought the age the appellant had mentioned was 14 or 15.
	
	
	The complainant’s co-worker was also cross-examined concerning the potential presence of photos of the complainant and a friend on the work computer at the video store. The appellant in cross-examination said that he believed, when the complainant phoned him to ask about photos, that she was referring to the photos on the work computer. The appellant accepted that he had never discussed the presence of any photos of the complainant on the work computer with the complainant. The complainant denied any knowledge of the photographs of her and a friend on the work computer at the video store.
	
	
	Following her complaint to the police, the complainant made a number of telephone calls to the appellant, which were formally recorded pursuant to a Surveillance Advice Warrant issued on 23 March 2012. The conversations recorded pursuant to the warrant were as follows.
	
	
	On 24 March 2012, the complainant telephoned the appellant and had the following conversation with him (“V.3” is the complainant, “V.2” is the appellant):
	


“V.3   Hey D, it’s T.

V.2   Yeah, what’s up.

V.3   Um, I was just wondering when I could collect my last pay?

V.2   Um, I need the keys and all that back.

V.3   Yeah, I can do that.

…

V.2   O.K. Um, just a question.

V.2   Yep.

V.3   You know that other night?

V.2   Huh?

V.3   You know that other night at your house?

V.2   No.

V.3   Yeah. When you were dropping me home but then we went back to your house?

V.2   Yeah, what are you, yeah, what?

V.3   Why?

V.2   Huh?

V.3   I just want to know why, like you know how I gave you oral?

V.2   No.

V.3   Yeah.

V.2   T, I’m busy I’ve got stuff I’ve got to get done.

V.3   I just want to talk about that just quickly.

V.2   Well, if you want to talk to me you can talk to me face to face.

V.3   O.K.

V.2   O.K. But I’m busy I’ve got work to do.

V.3   O.K.

V.2   Bye.

V.3   Bye.”


	
	On 26 March 2016, at 2.14pm, the complainant again made a recorded telephone call to the appellant’s mobile number, but received a message that the number had been disconnected.
	
	
	The complainant then phoned the telephone number of the video store and had the following conversation with the appellant:
	


“V.3   Hi D, it’s T again.

V.2   Yeah.

V.3   Your mobile number’s been disconnected.

V.2   Yeah.

V.3   How come?

V.2   Because I don’t have it anymore I got another number, why what’s wrong?

V.3   O.K. I was just like freaking out for a bit, I was just wondering, you know those topless photos that you used to have on your phone, do you still have them or did you delete them?

V.2   I haven’t got anything T and I’ve got, I don’t even know what’s going on but I’ve been told not to talk to you so that’s what I’m going to do, O.K. I’ve got work to do here?

V.3   Are you serious? Just tell me if you’ve deleted them or not?”

The appellant then hung up.


	
	On 17 April 2012, the complainant went to the video store. The conversation the complainant had with the appellant was also recorded by the use of a listening device. When she first attempted to speak to the appellant, he was attending to a customer. The complainant had a further conversation with him about 15 minutes later, as follows (“V.1” is the complainant, “V.2” is the appellant):
	


“V.1   … D … What did you with them?

V.2   I didn’t do anything with them …

V.1   But make sure you delete the. I’m like freaking out dude.

V.2   I haven’t got anything.

V.1   Huh?

V.2   I haven’t got anything.

V.1   But you did delete them? They’re gone?

V.2   Mmm. Gone.

V.1   Good good. I’m freaking out.

V.2   I could have done a lot worse and shown some of your photos.

V.1   Pardon?

V.2   I could have done a lot worse [and] showed some of your photos over the internet.

V.1   What could you have done?

V.2   I could have made sure … fuck your dad … one … going out to the … take care of … I was fucking pissed, I was fucking furious. The way he fucking stormed in.

V.1   He was just angry.

V.2   Why did you try and call me that day?

…

V.2   … So what happened?

V.1   What do you mean?

V.2   In general … photos on your phone love.

V.1   Huh? What photos on my phone?

V.2   Of me … If I didn’t … an arsehole … somebody else, there’s nothing else. I’m just curious as to what the fuck happened … one day you’re carrying on all good and then you ring me and you … to me and then the next thing your Dads …

V.1   Yeah, but … I don’t even know, I just didn’t want to come to work anymore because of everything that happened.

V.2   Well that’s fine with me …”


	
	The complainant had another conversation with the appellant on 24 April 2012, which was also recorded, as follows (“V.1” is the complainant, “V.2” is the appellant):
	


“V.1   … Can I ask you something D?

V.2   Mmm.

V.1   Okay. You know how. This is the last time we talk about it okay. Okay.

V.2   You like to piss me off, don’t you?

V.1   No, no, no, I’m not trying to piss you off.

V.2   What are you trying to do then, what?

V.1   Well, you know just how you made me give you oral?

V.2   Yes, yes, yes, yes.

…

V.2   I have a quick question. I have got a question. I am curious why you bolted to Daddy?

V.1   I didn’t bolt to Daddy.

V.2   Why?

…

V.2   How did he know. How did he get fired up?

V.1   ‘Cause I spoke to a friend about it and my friend is friends with my brother and my brother told my step mum and my step mum told my Dad. And Dad found out. He doesn’t know everything. He just knows a few things, knew a few things and then he just cracked it. But he. It was a bit wrong of him to come down like that but he’s my Dad. You would do the same if you were someone else’s Dad. I mean if you were a Dad to someone else.”


	
	An arrangement was made in this conversation for the complainant to come to the video store the following Sunday, 24 April 2016, to collect money that was owed to her. However, on that day, the complainant rang the appellant to say she could not come in. The telephone call was again recorded as follows (“V.3” is the complainant, “V.2” is the appellant):
	


“V.3   Um, just letting you know that I’m sorry I couldn’t come in today ‘cause I had soccer on and then I just …

V.2   Yeah, no, I’m flat chat too at the moment so I’ll catch up with you soon.

V.3   O.K. Have you got a second to talk?

V.2   No, not really. Why?

V.3   ‘Cause I just wanted to have a chat quickly.

V.2   About what?

V.3   Um, I just wanted to let you know that you know that, everything that happened I want, I just wanted to tell you that I forgive you for it.

V.2   Um, righto.

V.3   Yeah, how come you’ve never apologised to me though?

V.2   I told you I can’t talk. I’m busy.

V.3   Are you serious …

V.2   Huh?

V.3   You talk to me when I’m there so why can’t you just talk to me now?

V.2   Yeah, see you. Yeah, well, I’m flat chat. I’m busy. I’ve got, it’s a Sunday. I’ve got heaps of stuff to do.”

Whether leave to raise ground 1 should be granted: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4


	
	The appellant acknowledged that, as no direction had been sought from the trial judge, leave to raise this question required leave pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules r 4, which provides:
	


“4   Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.”


	
	The appellant read the affidavit of Terrence Healey, who appeared for him at trial. In his affidavit, affirmed on 1 September 2016, Mr Healey, having been provided “with the relevant transcript of the closing address and the cross-examination of the appellant”, deposed that he had “no memory of making any tactical decision regarding such a direction”.
	


Principles governing the grant of leave


	
	In Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297; [1999] HCA 37, McHugh J, at [72], explained that the grant of leave under r 4 requires an appellant to establish:
	


“... the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant.”


	
	In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ stated the principles in relation to the operation of r 4 as follows:
	


“[148]   Subsequent cases [to Papakosmas] have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4:

The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].48].”


	
	Although I have a concern that trial counsel’s omission to seek a direction was a considered decision, given the Crown’s acknowledgement that had a direction been sought, it would have been appropriate for the trial judge to give a direction and it was likely that a direction would have been given, I am of the opinion that leave to raise this ground should be granted.
	


Ground 1: consciousness of guilt reasoning

The case at trial


	
	The appellant’s defence was that the conduct alleged by the complainant did not occur. In particular, insofar as it is relevant to the issues on the appeal, the appellant denied that he had taken any photographs of the complainant. It was the defence case that the complainant had made false allegations against the appellant in retaliation for him sacking her on 10 March 2012 because of her poor work performance and her increasing indebtedness to the store for purchases of soft drinks and confectionary and the rental of DVDs.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence. It was a significant aspect of the Crown’s attack on the appellant during his cross-examination that he had disposed of his phone because it contained the photographs of the complainant that he took, relevantly, on 6 and 8 March 2012, as the complainant had alleged. The appellant denied that this was the case. He agreed that his mobile phone number was disconnected on 26 March, but also said he could not be 100 per cent sure that he disconnected it, as he “might have just changed SIM cards or let it run out”. He agreed that he possibly had got a new number, but did not agree that he had got a new phone. He accepted that he did not have the iPhone when he was arrested on 8 October 2013. He was not able to provide a definitive answer as to why he had changed his mobile number, saying that there might have been a better deal that had come up with a different provider.
	
	
	The Crown questioned him as to whether, at the same time that his mobile phone number was disconnected, or was no longer available, he “got rid of the phone?” The appellant responded, “I cannot be 100% sure whether I got rid of the phone”. The cross-examination continued:
	


“Q: Where is it the phone?

A: Three years ago, I could have sold it, I could have swapped it, I could have broken it; I can’t be 100% sure.”


	
	The appellant denied that he got rid of the phone because it had the topless photographs on it. He said “No, because I never took any photos”.
	
	
	It was again put to him in cross-examination that he had got rid of his mobile phone number and his phone. He responded, “I had gotten rid of my mobile phone number but I can’t – I can’t 100% say that I got rid of a – got rid of the phone”. The cross-examination continued:
	


“Q. You did get rid of the phone, didn’t you?

A. No I didn’t. I don’t think I did.

Q. Where is it?

A. As I said, it was three years ago – I could have sold it; I could have broken it; swapped it.

Q. What I’m putting to you is it the reason that you were worried; the reason that you changed the number, is because you did do the things to her that she alleged in this trial that you did?

A. No, no, I have never done anything to T.”


	
	In closing address to the jury, the Crown stated:
	


“The accused’s case was that the allegations are untrue, they’re made up maliciously, and they’re all lies. The motivation for those lies is his sacking of her on 10 March because she was not working well, and also because she wanted to avoid paying the amount of money that she owed him for not returning videos and taking stock from the video shop.

If you think about that issue of the complainant faking this evidence, or this allegation against him, just consider this.”


	
	The Crown then enumerated the complaints that the complainant made to her friends, to her parents and to the police, as well as her evidence in court. The Crown reminded the jury that the complainant acknowledged that what she had told her friends was a lie, a matter that she had volunteered in her evidence, and advanced that as indicative of her frankness. The Crown then turned to the cross-examination of the appellant:
	


“In the cross-examination of the accused at the beginning of it I put to him that he had told a number of direct lies to you in giving his evidence, including that he had sacked the complainant on 10 March. The second one was that he had parted company with the complainant after work on 8 March, after closing the shop. If you find that he did tell you a deliberate lie in giving his evidence, and if you think it is about a material issue in this case, then you may take that fact into account in assessing his credibility generally on other matters. The Crown says that you would be able to find that he did tell you a deliberate lie about sacking the complainant on 10 March, and that lie can be proved by the terms of that recorded conversation [to] which I just directed your attention, and in light of all of the evidence, and the Crown says it is material because it is given to support the suggestion that she had this motive to lie, this feeling of malice because he had sacked her and she was trying to get him back, she complained of sexual assault.

So her evidence was she denied she ever received the sacking text. [Her father’s] confrontation of the accused on 12 March. Her evidence that she never went back to the shop. Burgess’ evidence about the accused saying after [her father] had come in, that he was worried about what she could say. The fact that on the 17 April conversations – [The complainant] doesn’t seem to realise that she has been sacked. She seems to be asserting that she left on her own because she didn’t want to come back because of what had happened. All of that evidence you can take into account in deciding whether you think he has lied to you, whether it is deliberate and whether it is material. If you are satisfied of those things, you can [take] that lie, that deliberate lie into account in assessing his credibility generally on other matters such as whether he remained home on 6 March and didn’t go to work, whether he parted company with [the complainant] on 8 March, even though the Crown says that is a deliberate lie as well.” (emphasis added)


	
	There next followed the impugned passage:
	


“So in conclusion, the Crown says you would find [the complainant] to be a reliable witness, a witness of truth. She is supported by other evidence in the case, which is independent of her; namely, the accused’s admissions in the recorded conversations, and his conduct, disconnecting the phone number. On the Crown case getting rid of the phone in which the Crown says these photographs were contained, the topless photographs. The Crown says it is a matter for you that the evidence in the accused’s case would not raise a reasonable doubt in your mind about her credibility or that the Crown has proved its [case] on each count on the basis of all of the evidence in the case.” (emphasis added)


	
	Trial counsel for the appellant then addressed the jury. He pointed out, inter alia, that “[e]verything depends upon really what [the complainant] has said”:
	


“Everything. No photographs. No mobile phone …”

…

He is entitled to get another phone. Why transfer the onus onto him? The accused. He owes no explanation at all. He has given his explanation on oath … even if you disbelieved everything that he said, you would have to be satisfied that [the complainant] is telling you the truth. You can put his evidence in the bin. Do you still accept her? ... She tells different stories …

There is a reasonable doubt in this case.”


	
	The trial judge, in his summing up to the jury, in the course of summarising the evidence, pointed out the appellant’s evidence in relation to his phone as follows:
	


“… he said he just changed the number on the phone, he does not know if he got rid of it or not, but that was just something that occurred normally, not because of this matter.”


	
	Later, when summarising the appellant’s case as advanced by his counsel, his Honour made the following observations:
	


“[Trial counsel] talked to you about the importance of serving as a juror and it is the State that brings the charge and the Crown, the State has to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. These are the principles of justice, all the counts and all the elements for the particular count. [Trial counsel] submits it is a difficult Crown case when you look at it because what the complainant has done is lie to her friends about what happened, she said something took place at work which she now says did not take place. [Trial counsel] says there is not a jot of evidence about the topless photographs, apart from what the complainant says.

[Trial counsel] refers to the Crown suggesting there is some form of support for [the complainant’s] evidence, but that is not enough and the Crown has got to have more than just a bit of support … The accused does not have to prove anything, there is no onus on him …

…

… You have not got the phone, you have not got the photographs, and why would the accused not be concerned when someone comes in the shop and threatens to fillet him, why would he not be worried about that, why would he not try to reconstruct what possibly it could be about.

…

And the ultimate submission is you will find the accused not guilty; even if you did not believe his evidence, and put it aside, you would still find the accused not guilty because you would not be satisfied on the complainant’s evidence of the elements of the particular offences.”


	
	Earlier, at the commencement of the summing up, his Honour had given the conventional directions that the onus was on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	His Honour added:
	


“That never alters, it does not alter because the accused happens to give evidence or calls evidence. The onus does not shift.”

Submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that the cross-examination of him invited the jury to reason that his conduct in disposing of the phone and changing the number revealed that he had a consciousness of guilt in respect of the offences. This approach was underscored, it was submitted, in the Crown’s statement to the jury set out above at [37]. The appellant contended that post-offence conduct may support consciousness of guilt reasoning and, in that regard, attracted the same principles as applied in respect of lies told by an accused person: McKey v R (2012) 219 A Crim R 227; [2012] NSWCCA 1 at [26]-[27]. The appellant submitted that this principle was confirmed in Kuehne v R; Humphries M v R; Humphries A v R [2012] NSWCCA 270 where Latham J observed, at [6]:
	


“… before any post offence conduct can … qualify [as a legitimate indicia of a consciousness of guilt] it must bear a particular character. It must be capable of constituting an admission against interest. It must be capable of meeting the conditions analogous to those discussed in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 applying to lies. The relevant conduct must be precisely identified and proved by evidence, it must be concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence and it must be carried out in circumstances in which the explanation for the conduct is a realisation of guilt on the part of the accused.” (emphasis added)


	
	Latham J noted that destruction of evidence was capable of constituting consciousness of guilt: see also McKey at [26].
	
	
	The evidence established that the appellant changed his phone number between 12 March 2012 and 26 March 2012. By that time, the appellant was aware that the complainant had made allegations against him. The appellant submitted, however, that the post-offence conduct upon which the Crown relied was not capable of constituting an implied admission against interest or supporting an inference of guilt. In particular, the appellant submitted that his disposal of the phone could not support an inference of guilt unless it was presumed that the phone contained the photos that it was contended the appellant had taken of the complainant.
	
	
	The appellant complained that the use of evidence that he had got rid of the phone as evincing a consciousness of guilt was an exercise in circularity in circumstances where the Crown sought to rely upon that evidence as independent evidence in support of the complaint. The appellant submitted that the Crown had failed to observe the injunction in Edwards v R (1998) 178 CLR 193 at 208-11; [1993] HCA 63 that where a lie was relied upon as an implied admission of guilt to corroborate the evidence of a complainant, it was necessary to rely upon other evidence to establish the asserted facts to establish the lie. The appellant further submitted that this circularity of reasoning deprived the evidence of the capacity rationally to support an inference of guilt, as had been explained in Kuehne at [69].
	
	
	The appellant, in the course of argument on the appeal, drew attention to the cross-examination, set out above at [34], in which he was questioned about two distinct matters: the first, that he had changed his mobile telephone number; the second, that he had “got rid of the phone”. The appellant submitted that underlying the Crown’s questioning in respect of the second of these matters was that the appellant did not want to be found in possession of the phone because it had, on the Crown case, the incriminating photos on it. The appellant pointed out that he did not make any direct or clear admission that he had disposed of the phone. It followed that there was also no evidence that he had changed his mobile number and at the same time got rid of the telephone.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the Crown, in the passage reproduced above at [37], did not precisely identify or articulate how the conduct of disposing of the phone led to a consciousness of guilt, in circumstances where the appellant had not been able to say what had happened to the phone three years after the event and, in particular, had not admitted that he had deliberately disposed of the phone knowing that the photographs were on it. The appellant pointed out, for such conduct, that is, disposing of the phone, to amount to an admission against interest, it was necessary that the complainant’s account, that there were photographs of her on the phone, be correct.
	
	
	The appellant contended that in circumstances where there was a real question as to whether the appellant had got rid of the phone at all, its capacity to provide independent evidence in support of the complainant’s account was doubtful. The appellant submitted that had a direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning been given, the jury would have been invited to focus upon the paucity of the evidence as to what actually happened to the phone.
	
	
	This last submission was a direct response to the Crown’s written submission that had a direction been given, it would have drawn attention to the damning effect of the evidence of the destruction of the phone to the appellant’s defence. The Crown submitted that this was why trial counsel did not seek a direction as it would have been to the disadvantage to the appellant to do so.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the passage to which reference has been made in the Crown’s closing address, set out above at [37], could be characterised as involving consciousness of guilt reasoning. However, the Crown submitted that there was no error in the Crown referring to this evidence in the closing address. The Crown submitted that the relevant conduct had been precisely identified, namely, the deletion of the photos and the disconnection of the phone number. There was no dispute that the appellant no longer had the phone and, on the Crown case, the appellant had admitted in the recorded conversation of 17 April that he had deleted the photos. It was also submitted that the evidence was clearly capable of supporting the inference that the appellant had got rid of the phone because he was concerned that it might implicate him in the offences with which he was ultimately charged.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no circularity of reasoning in the use of this evidence and that in this regard, Kuehne was distinguishable. In that case, the Crown had relied upon the accused’s delay in giving an exculpatory version to the police as evidence of consciousness of guilt, but had failed to identify how the delay in presenting to the police supported an inference of guilt save that it was suggested that in delaying going to police the accused had concealed their guilt. It was submitted that the present case was markedly different. Evidence that the appellant had deleted the photographs and his evidence that he did not have the phone was directly connected with the offence in that had the phone been available its contents would have revealed evidence that would have directly proved the offence.
	
	
	That being so, the Crown submitted that the real issue on the appeal was not that the Crown had made the statement to the jury in the terms set out at [39] above, but whether the trial judge was required to give an Edwards-type direction. It was accepted by the Crown that no such direction was given.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the appellant’s emphasis on the distinction between his changing his telephone number and the disposal of his phone, if that occurred, was a false one, in circumstances where during cross-examination, the Crown sought to link both together. This was apparent, it was submitted, from the cross-examination reproduced above at [32]-[34].
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s reliance upon the three-year time difference between the events subject of the charge and the trial was a distraction, because the appellant was aware from 12 March 2012, when he was confronted by the complainant’s father, that there was an allegation that he had taken photographs of the complainant on his phone. Further, the appellant knew from the time of his arrest in October 2013 of the allegation that he had taken photographs on his phone. Accordingly, there had been two occasions, one proximate to the time of the offending conduct, and another some 18 months later, in respect of which the appellant knew that the whereabouts of his phone was a matter in issue.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that, contrary to the appellant’s submission that there were two independent acts that were relied upon by the Crown as consciousness of guilt reasoning, in fact, the Crown had at all times linked the two acts, one of changing the telephone number and the second of disposing of the phone, as part of the same conduct.
	
	
	The Crown accepted, however, that there was no evidence that the appellant had destroyed the phone. The only evidence relating to the whereabouts of the phone was that given by the appellant in the course of cross-examination and the fact that the phone was not seized by police at the time of his arrest in October 2013, although, as the Crown acknowledged, there was no obligation for the appellant to hand over his phone to the police in the absence of a search warrant. In this regard, the Crown accepted that the fact that no phone was produced at the time of his arrest could not be the basis for any inference to be drawn against the appellant.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the weight of authority is that it is highly desirable that a trial judge give a direction to the jury when there is reliance upon consciousness of guilt reasoning and that a failure to do so may result in a miscarriage of justice. The Crown submitted, however, that a direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning is not mandatory and every case must depend upon its own circumstances.
	
	
	In this case, the Crown contended that to give a direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning would most likely have had the effect of focusing unwarranted attention upon what had happened to the phone. The Crown submitted that, in giving a conventional direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning, the trial judge would have directed the jury that before they could have used the evidence of the destruction or absence of the phone as something that pointed towards guilt, they had to be satisfied he had got rid of the phone.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that, in his summing up, his Honour had reminded the jury that the appellant had said that he did not know whether he had got rid of the phone or not, or whether that was something that had occurred normally and was not in any way associated with this matter.
	


Legal principles


	
	Both parties accepted that the principles governing what is required in the giving of a direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning were stated by the High Court in Edwards. In that case, the plurality, at 209, explained why, in certain circumstances, the telling of a lie, or in this case, engaging in certain post-offence conduct, is probative of guilt as opposed to merely affecting the credit of the witness who tells the lie, or engages in the post-offence conduct, as follows:
	


“But not every lie told by an accused provides evidence probative of guilt. It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him. In other words, in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty. It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell. That is why the lie must be deliberate. Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt. And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged. It must be for that reason that he tells the lie. To say that the lie must spring from a realization or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing. It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that ‘if he tells the truth, the truth will convict him.’” (footnotes omitted)


	
	The plurality further stated, at 211.
	


“… the jury should be instructed that they may take the lie into account only if they are satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence, or, as was said in Reg. v. Lucas (Ruth), because of ‘a realization of guilt and a fear of the truth’.

Moreover, the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realization of guilt. A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission. It should be recognized that there is a risk that, if the jury are invited to consider a lie told by an accused, they will reason that he lied simply because he is guilty unless they are appropriately instructed with respect to these matters. And in many cases where there appears to be a departure from the truth it may not be possible to say that a deliberate lie has been told. The accused may be confused. He may not recollect something which, upon his memory being jolted in cross-examination, he subsequently does recollect.

If the telling of a lie by an accused is relied upon, not merely to strengthen the prosecution case, but as corroboration of some other evidence, the untruthfulness of the relevant statement must be established otherwise than through the evidence of the witness whose evidence is to be corroborated. If a witness required to be corroborated is believed in preference to the accused and this alone establishes the lie on the part of the accused, reliance upon the lie for corroboration would amount to the witness corroborating himself. That is a contradiction in terms.”


	
	In Zoneff v the Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234; [2000] HCA 28, the Court was again concerned with the circumstances in which a direction as to consciousness of guilt reasoning should be given.
	
	
	The plurality stated, at [16], that the circumstances in which such a direction ought to be given are as follows:
	


“There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an Edwards-type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt.”


	
	In Zoneff the prosecutor had not, during the course of cross-examination, suggested that any answer given by the accused was a lie, told out of consciousness of guilt. Nor was anything said to the jury to that effect, the circumstances being unusual in that the prosecutor did not address the jury. The High Court was of the opinion that it would have been undesirable for the trial judge to give an Edwards-type direction, as it would have required the judge to decide which of the appellant’s answers were or were not capable of being regarded as lies indicative of consciousness of guilt and would have had the effect of highlighting issues of credibility so as to give them an undeserved prominence in the jury’s mind to the prejudice of the appellant in that case. The Court concluded that a direction should not have been given in those circumstances.
	
	
	The appellant also relied upon McKey; R v GJH (2001) 122 A Crim R 361; [2001] NSWCCA 128; and R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 as circumstances in which the Court granted leave where the trial judge had omitted to give an Edwards-type direction. In McKey the Court, at [42], considered that an Edwards-type direction should have been given in circumstances where the cross-examination of the appellant in that case had unequivocally suggested that his conduct constituted an implied admission of guilt. The Court was of the opinion that the jury ought to have been directed that they were required to examine whether an inference of guilt was a reasonable and justifiable one and were required to exclude any alternative inference that was inconsistent with guilt.
	
	
	In GJH the Court held that a direction should have been given as to the use to which lies told by the accused, upon which the Crown relied, were to be put. The Court, at [62], relied upon the direction to the jury that the High Court in Zoneff had considered appropriate where there was a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies. Such direction should include a warning to the jury, “do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt”.
	
	
	In Cook, the Court held, at [52], that a direction should have been given to the jury as to the use that could be made of the evidence of flight. The Court was of the opinion that a direction should have been given.
	


Consideration


	
	It will be recalled that the Crown did not submit that such a direction was inappropriate and acknowledged that the Crown’s statement to the jury could have been understood as an invitation to the jury to engage in consciousness of guilt reasoning. Accordingly, I agree with the Crown submission that the real question on the appeal is not whether a substantial miscarriage of justice arose because of what the Crown said to the jury but whether the Crown’s statement to the jury could have led the jury to reason that changing the telephone number and disposing of the phone, (if the jury accepted that happened) involved consciousness of guilt reasoning such that it was necessary, in all the circumstances, that a direction be given to ensure that there was no confusion as to the way the prosecution put its case: see Zoneff at [16]-[17].
	
	
	The Crown, in that part of the address immediately before the impugned statement, had drawn attention to matters that raised for the jury’s determination whether the appellant’s evidence was credible, it being suggested that he had lied in his evidence to support the proposition that the complainant had a motive to lie about the sexual assault out of malice because he had sacked her. The Crown had further suggested to the jury that if they were satisfied that the appellant had deliberately lied in his evidence about that matter, they could take that into account in assessing his credibility generally.
	
	
	In the impugned passage, the prosecutor relied upon the evidence that the appellant changed his telephone number and, on its case, disposed of the telephone as corroborative of the complainant’s evidence. The qualification, that it was “on the Crown case”, is of significance. The qualification that, on the Crown case, the appellant has disposed of the phone, was an acknowledgement that there was no evidence that the appellant had done so.
	
	
	It was also, in my opinion, an invitation to reject the appellant’s evidence about the phone. The jury were told that the appellant’s getting rid of the phone, if they accepted that is what occurred, was independent evidence that corroborated the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	The appellant’s trial counsel pointed out to the jury that the appellant was entitled to get another phone, there was no onus on him and he owed no explanation. The trial judge effectively treated the matter the same way in his summing up to the jury.
	
	
	The case was therefore advanced by the Crown, the appellant and the trial judge as involving first, the credit of the complainant as opposed to the credit of the appellant and secondly, as on the basis that the appellant bore no onus in the matter. It was the Crown’s onus to prove the guilt of the appellant.
	
	
	If the jury had accepted the appellant’s evidence on the specific matters to which the Crown referred, the inevitable outcome would have been an acquittal on counts 4 and 5. However, there is a real question as to what the jury was to do with the evidence if they did not accept the appellant’s version of what had happened to the phone, which was itself vague and inconclusive. That question, in my opinion, critically focuses attention on whether an Edwards-type direction should have been given.
	
	
	The effect of the way the matter was left to the jury was that the jury was asked to infer that the appellant had got rid of the phone because it had topless photographs of the complainant on it, taken on 8 March. That had been the focus of the cross-examination on this point. If the jury accepted the Crown’s contention and reasoned in accordance with the way the cross-examination proceeded that would have led the jury to treat the disposal of the phone as almost indisputable evidence that the appellant had committed the offence subject of count 5.
	
	
	Once it is understood that that was the effect of the impugned part of the Crown address to the jury, I am of the opinion that an Edwards-type direction was required. That direction would not, in my opinion, have had the effect of unnecessarily drawing attention to the question as to what had happened to the phone as the Crown contended. The phone and what was on it was of the essence of the Crown case on count 5. It follows that I consider there has been a miscarriage of justice in the omission of giving such direction, notwithstanding that none was sought.
	


No substantial miscarriage of justice


	
	Notwithstanding my conclusion that the trial judge erred in not giving an Edwards-type direction, I am of the opinion that it has not been established that a substantial miscarriage occurred as a result of the omission to do so: see the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1).
	


Legal principles

The case law


	
	In Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300; [2005] HCA 81, the Court set out the principles that apply in the court’s determination, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1) that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred” as follows:
	


“[41]   That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty …

[42]    …The appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; the task is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; the standard of proof is the criminal standard. …

[43]   … the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. … But there are cases in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial. Secondly, it is necessary always to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials such as the present and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.

[44]   … It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	This principle has been consistently applied by the High Court. Thus in Darkan v The Queen (2006) 227 CLR 373; [2006] HCA 34 the Court stated, at [84]:
	


“An appellate court invited to consider whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred is to proceed in the same way as an appellate court invited to decide whether a jury verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the natural limitations that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” (footnote omitted)


	
	More recently, the High Court in Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 has elaborated upon the meaning of “substantial miscarriage of justice” within the three limbs of s 6(1) as follows:
	


“13   Turning to the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it will be seen that to some extent it overlaps the first. A ‘wrong decision of any question of law’ includes misdirections on matters of substantive law as well as misdirections on matters of adjectival law. And, as with the first limb, the question under the second limb will be whether the error constitutes a miscarriage of justice in the sense of a departure from trial according to law.

14   The third limb covers cases where, by reason of irregularity or otherwise, an accused has not received a trial according to law or has not received a fair trial.

15   That leaves the proviso, which in terms is applicable to all three limbs of s 6(1). It directs that, even where error of the kind identified in any of the three limbs is established and amounts to a miscarriage of justice, the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the error has not been productive of a substantial miscarriage of justice. By ‘substantial miscarriage of justice’ what is meant is that the possibility cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him or her or that there was some other departure from a trial according to law that warrants that description. Consequently, if the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded that the first limb applies, it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. In contrast, where the second limb applies, the circumstances in some cases may be such that, despite the judge making ‘the wrong decision of [a] question of law’, the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded that the error could not have deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her. In that case the proviso will operate. Where the third limb is engaged, if the Court of Criminal Appeal has concluded that the appellant has not received a fair trial it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. But where, despite some other identified irregularity, the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has received a fair trial according to law and not otherwise been deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her, once again the proviso will operate. It is also to be borne in mind, as was explained in Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen and more recently noticed in Lindsay v The Queen, that, although the proviso is expressed in permissive terms, ‘if the condition (the conclusion that no substantial injustice has actually occurred) is satisfied’ the proviso must be applied.”

Consideration


	
	The appellant submitted that this court should apply the principle as stated by the High Court in Weiss, in circumstances where it was not clear whether the Court in Filippou stated or intended to state any new or qualified principle.
	
	
	If it were necessary to decide that question, I would suggest that the High Court in Filippou was not stating any new principle, but rather was explaining that, in circumstances where the first or third limb of s 6(1) were in play, by virtue of the nature of the error to which those limbs are directed, a substantial miscarriage of justice would be involved by the fact of such error. However, as this case falls into the second limb, it is not necessary to come to any decided opinion as to whether that is the correct understanding of the Court’s reasons in Filippou.
	
	
	There is also a question whether and if so the extent to which an appellate court may have regard to the jury’s verdict of guilt. The High Court in Weiss stated that this was a relevant consideration. However the weight to be given to relevant matters will always depend on the circumstances. Thus, in R v Ciantar; DPP v Ciantar (2006) 167 A Crim R; [2006] VSCA 263 the Court of Appeal of Victoria (Warren CJ, Chernov, Nettle, Neave and Redlich JJA), observed, at [113], that the Court gave little weight to the guilty verdict in that case because, in the absence of an Edwards-type direction, the verdict may have been affected by impermissible reasoning.
	
	
	In this case, the evidence relating to the disposal of the phone was but one of a number of different pieces of evidence upon which the Crown relied to support the appellant’s credit. The plan that the complainant drew of the appellant’s home was significant corroborative evidence of the complainant’s version of events. On her evidence, she had been to the appellant’s home only once before and on that occasion had not gone into the appellant’s sister’s bedroom. Although there had been plans of the appellant’s home at the video store, there was no evidence that the complainant had ever looked at those plans, let alone memorised them sufficiently to enable her to make a sketch plan of the appellant’s house.
	
	
	In addition, there was the evidence of the telephone intercepts and the recorded conversation the complainant had with the appellant on 26 March and again on 17 April, which were available as admissions by the appellant as to the photographs being on his phone. The guilty verdict is indicative that the jury accepted that the appellant had made the admissions as the Crown contended. I consider that the appellant admitted in those conversations that the photographs were no longer on the phone and that the photographs to which he was referring were the photographs he took of the complainant at his home on 8 March. I do not accept that the references in the recorded conversations to photographs were to any photographs on the appellant’s work computer.
	
	
	There was also the early complaint to friends, but more particularly, there were early complaints to the complainant’s father and stepmother and then to the police. Finally, there was the appellant’s gift of a mobile phone to the appellant, which could be viewed as an attempt to discourage the complainant from making any complaint against him.
	
	
	It is true that the complainant’s complaints to her friends to which reference has already been made were inaccurate. The complainant explained why she had not been accurate in what she recounted to her friends. Regardless of whether that explanation be accepted, the other evidence to which I have referred is such that I have not been left in a doubt as the guilt of the appellant on counts 4 or 5. I have come to this conclusion on the whole of the evidence, including having regard to the guilty verdict, in accordance with the principles in Weiss. It follows that I do not consider that a substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred. I would add that even leaving aside the guilty verdict, I would have come to the same conclusion.
	


Leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that the sentence imposed for count 4 is unreasonable and plainly unjust, essentially on the basis that the trial judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was not reasonably open.
	
	
	The trial judge, after setting out his findings as to the conduct that constituted the offence and the circumstances in which the conduct occurred, summarised his findings as follows:
	


“So what do I make of all that. The age is an element of the offence; she was close to 16, I accept that. I need to consider actually what happened, and what happened was fellatio, which is something said to be less heinous than other forms of sexual intercourse, though the legislation does not make any distinction. The offender clearly endeavoured to coerce her into sexual activity and he used some physical force to guide her head towards his penis. He was in a position of dominance being the employer, and that very day he had spoken to her stepmother, KB, and arranged to drive the complainant home. Indeed he was entrusted to do that by KB. He wanted her to work late and he was going to drop her off and her mother entrusted him.”


	
	The Crown submitted that there should added to these factors the fact that the offence occurred in the appellant’s home and was preceded by a threat that the appellant would make the complainant walk home, it already being night time, if she did not let him take another photograph, and the added humiliation of being photographed immediately after the offending conduct had occurred.
	
	
	His Honour continued:
	


“So where does it fit? Well it is not a low range offence and it is not above the mid-range, I find it approaches the mid-range. It is between the lower mid-range but closer to the mid-range. This is a very serious offence.”


	
	His Honour then dealt with the offence of aggravated assault and act of indecency with filming contrary to s 61O(2A), finding that the offence occurred for the appellant’s own gratification and that although the offence was serious, having regard to the ten year maximum penalty, it was not a particularly serious example of that type of offence.
	
	
	His Honour noted that at the time of the offence, the appellant was on a good behaviour bond in respect of a Commonwealth offence and that the offending in breach of that bond was an aggravating circumstance, but not one that related to the objective gravity of the offences.
	
	
	The appellant did not give evidence on sentence. There was, therefore, little material before his Honour in relation to the appellant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour had the benefit of a pre-sentence report dated 23 July 2015. That report recorded that the appellant had been brought up by foster parents from the age of six months and that the appellant’s foster parents had always treated him as their child and the appellant’s children as their grandchildren. The appellant has two children from a prior relationship and, notwithstanding the breakdown of that relationship, had fully accepted his parental responsibilities. He was reported to have a “good work ethic”.
	
	
	There was some indication that the appellant had previously exhibited signs akin to depression although it appears that there was no evidence before the court that that was the case, nor was there any diagnosis to that effect. The appellant had been assessed by the author of the pre-sentence report as having a “low to medium risk of re-offending”. Nonetheless, his Honour considered that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend in this way again. Given his denial of the offences, his Honour found that the appellant had not shown remorse. Nonetheless, his Honour considered his prospects of rehabilitation to be good.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 3A, including the need to impose adequate punishment, both specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the conduct, the protection of the community, the recognition of harm to the victim and the community and the rehabilitation of the offender.
	
	
	In circumstances where the two offences arose out of the same incident, his Honour considered that it was appropriate that the sentences be served concurrently. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances, stating that he had “struggled with this a little”. Although finding that the appellant’s background in foster care did not seem to have disadvantaged him, his Honour considered that the appellant had had a more difficult upbringing than otherwise would have been the case and noted that there were attendant emotional problems.
	


Submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that, contrary to his Honour’s finding, the objective seriousness of the offence in this case fell significantly below mid-range, having regard to the range of conduct potentially covered by such offences. The appellant pointed to the fact that the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent covers a broad range of conduct and widely differing levels of objective seriousness.
	
	
	This was apparent, on the appellant’s submission, from the scope of the circumstances of aggravation for which the offence provided in s 61J(2), including whether there was a threat of or actual bodily harm, the age of the victim, whether the victim had a serious physical disability or a cognitive impairment, whether the victim had been deprived of liberty before or after the commission of the offence and whether the offence had occurred as part of a break and enter offence with the intention of committing the offence under s 61J or any other serious indictable offence.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that as the only circumstance of aggravation in this case was the complainant’s age, namely, being under the age of 16 years, the seriousness of aggravation was limited as the complainant was 15 years and 8 months at the time of the offence. In support of this submission, the appellant referred to the comments of Latham J in R v KNL (2005) 154 A Crim R 268; [2005] NSWCCA 260, at [42]-[43], as follows:
	


“42   It is trite to observe that sexual intercourse with a child of 12, knowing the child’s age, is objectively more serious than sexual intercourse with a child of 12, in ignorance of the child’s true age. However, it is also the case that, in terms of the position occupied by a given offence on the spectrum of offences of this kind, the younger the child, the more serious the offence; R v T (1990) 47 A Crim R 29.

43   The complainant was just over 12 years of age. She was closer to ten than she was to 16, yet that feature of the offence was largely disregarded, in favour of the mitigation constituted by the Respondent’s mistaken belief as to her age.”


	
	With respect to their Honours in that case, I would not endorse that reasoning, should it be intended to lay down some general principle of sentencing law in respect of sexual offences. The Legislature did not see fit to do so and it makes assumptions as to the effect on an individual complainant that may not be supported on any other evidentiary basis.
	
	
	The general principles governing an appeal against sentence were not in dispute. It is accepted that “there will be a range of possible sentences that [may] be imposed without error”: AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111; [1999] HCA 46 at [128]. See also Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 at [27], where the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) reiterated:
	


“As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	The sentencing task involves a discretionary judgement and as such, it is necessary to demonstrate error in the sense explained in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40 at 504-505. In the present case, as no specific error in his Honour’s sentencing process was relied upon, it was incumbent upon the appellant to demonstrate that “the result embodied in the [sentence imposed was] unreasonable or plainly unjust”: see Markarian at [25].
	
	
	The principle to be applied when sentencing for an offence which covers a range of different conduct was considered by the High Court in Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447; [1987] HCA 46 at 452 as follows:
	


“When an offence is defined to include any of several categories of conduct, the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not on the statute defining the offence but on the facts of the case. In a case of sexual assault, a sentencing judge has to consider where the facts of the particular case lie in a spectrum at one end of which lies the worst type of sexual assault perpetrated by any act which constitutes sexual penetration as defined. As Dwyer C.J. said in Reynolds v. Wilkinson (1948) 51 WALR 17, at p 18:

‘Crimes bearing the same general description have not equally evil content or characteristics, and offenders also differ in themselves.’” (footnotes incorporated into text)


	
	Factors that are relevant to sentencing for an offence under s 61I, being an offence that encompasses a range of offending conduct include the degree of violence, any physical injury inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and any circumstances of humiliation and the duration of the offence: R v Hibberd (2009) 194 A Crim R 1; [2009] NSWCCA 20 at [56]
	
	
	The authorities are emphatic that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is one that falls within the discretion of the sentencing judge. Reference has already been made to the observations of the High Court in Markarian and in AB. There may be added to those the observations of Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], that:
	


“This court is very slow to determine [the objective seriousness of an offence] for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which [the sentencing judge] gave to the circumstances of the offence was open ...”


	
	In the same case, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) added, at [46], that:
	


“… the importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge.”


	
	The appellant did not refer the Court to any cases that were factually comparable and that might indicate that, despite the respect that must be afforded to the trial judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, the sentence imposed was not one that was available to him. For my part, I see no error in His Honour’s finding of objective seriousness. It was relevant, as his Honour found, in assessing the objective seriousness of the appellant’s offending conduct, that the appellant was in a position of dominance having regard to his status as the complainant’s employer. He was in a particular position of trust on this occasion, having arranged to drive the complainant home from work in circumstances where she was usually picked up by a parent. The sexual activity was forced upon the complainant during that period of trust, in circumstances where the appellant was in a position of dominance, as her employer.
	
	
	As I consider that there was no error in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, and having regard to his Honour’s finding of lack of remorse on the part of the appellant, I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed has not been demonstrated to be manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would propose the following orders:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal against conviction;

2.   Appeal against conviction dismissed;

3.   Grant leave to appeal against sentence;

4.   Appeal against sentence dismissed.


	
	DAVIES J: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley P. I also agree with her Honour’s reasons except that I do not express any view about the correctness or otherwise of the reasoning in R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; 154 A Crim R 268 referred to by her Honour at [102].
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by the President for the reasons contained in her judgment.
	
	
	I prefer to express no view about the decision of this Court in R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260, as it is unnecessary so to do.
	
	
	There is no merit in the submission in effect made by the applicant that the age of the victim in this case is not a circumstance of aggravation to be taken into consideration to any real extent. It is an important matter to be considered. The sentencing Judge did so appropriately. No error has been shown.

2881518,Silvestri v R [2016] NSWCCA 245,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Hidden AJ.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Hidden AJ.
	
	
	HIDDEN AJ: The applicant, Marco Paulo Silvestri, was sentenced in the District Court for three charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The offences arose from a serious accident caused by his driving to the incorrect side of the road and colliding with an oncoming vehicle. That vehicle was driven by Mr Timothy McNamara and in it were two passengers: Mr Jonathan Sparks and Ms Jaqueline Sparks, Mr McNamara’s brother and sister. All three occupants were seriously injured, but the consequences were particularly grave for Jaqueline Sparks. Quite apart from the injuries she suffered, she was pregnant at the time and lost her baby as a result of the accident.
	
	
	The offence, under s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 7 years. On the count relating to Mr McNamara, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years, commencing on 1 October 2014. On the count relating to Mr Sparks, he was also sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, but to commence a year later, on 1 October 2015. On the count relating to Ms Sparks, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 1 October 2017. Accordingly, that sentence was made wholly accumulative on the sentences passed on the other two charges. The aggregate sentence, then, was imprisonment for 8 years with an effective non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal only against the sentence for the charge related to Ms Sparks. The application is substantially out of time, for reasons outlined in an affidavit by his solicitor. He seeks an extension of time, and the position of the parties was that the merit of the matter should be determined and, if it were to be found without merit, the extension of time should be refused.
	


Facts


	
	The accident occurred in the early evening of Monday, 30 September 2013 on the Mullett Creek bridge in the Dapto area. The bridge provides one lane of traffic in either direction, and at the time it was well lit, the weather was fine and visibility in both directions was good. The applicant was driving south, very close to the rear of a Holden sedan in front of him. He drove to the other side of the road to overtake that car and his vehicle collided head-on with the vehicle driven by Mr McNamara, which was travelling in the opposite direction. The Holden sedan was lower in height than the applicant’s vehicle and would not have impeded his vision of the road ahead.
	
	
	A blood sample taken from the applicant disclosed the presence of small quantities of amphetamine and methylamphetamine, and the report of a forensic pharmacologist expressed the opinion that his driving ability would have been impaired to some extent by the methylamphetamine. The applicant told a police officer at the scene that he had had a “brain fart” and thought that there were two lanes provided for south bound traffic. The sentencing judge had difficulty accepting any such suggestion, particularly as the applicant lived not far from the site of the accident. His Honour observed in his remarks on sentence that, if the applicant were having a “brain fart” as he claimed, the only rational explanation would be that he was drug affected.
	
	
	Mr McNamara suffered a fractured right clavicle, multiple left sided rib fractures with associated pulmonary contusions, and fractures of his left malleolus and right calcaneum with associated swelling to both ankles and his right foot. Mr Sparks suffered multiple right rib fractures, contusion of the right lung, right haemothorax, laceration of the liver and fractures of several vertebrae. He needed to be airlifted to St George hospital for treatment. The applicant himself suffered a broken right wrist, two broken right ribs on the left side, torn biceps, concussion and associated injuries.
	
	
	Ms Sparks, who was about 32 weeks pregnant, had to be extricated from the front passenger seat by emergency services and was airlifted to Liverpool Hospital. She had suffered a ruptured uterus, a right ulna fracture and a bilateral acetabular fracture. She underwent an emergency laparotomy, extraction of the foetus, a sub-total hysterectomy, temporary closure with review in 24 hours and then full closure. The baby was intubated immediately upon its removal but there were no signs of life, no heart rate and no response to ventilation. Ms Sparks is left with long term effects of her injuries, including infertility.
	
	
	In assessing the gravity of offences, the sentencing judge emphasised the seriousness of drivers allowing their vehicle to travel onto the wrong side of the road. He said that to describe such occurrences as “unfortunate accidents” was “totally inappropriate”, and that they “constitute nothing less than serious criminal conduct”. He described the obligation of drivers to keep their vehicle on the correct side of the road as most significant “owing to the potential of devastating and often fatal consequences”. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had abandoned his responsibility to other users of the road and that, accordingly, his moral culpability was high.
	
	
	His Honour considered the seriousness of Ms Sparks’ injuries to fall “at the very top end of the range”. In so doing, he had regard to the loss of her unborn child, although he acknowledged that it was not possible for the applicant to be charged with dangerous driving causing death “as the law at this stage does not recognise the death of an unborn child in these circumstances”.
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant was 41 years old at the time of the offences and is now 44. He made out a favourable subjective case. He had a minor criminal history and an unremarkable traffic record, neither of which his Honour saw as significant for the purpose of sentencing. He is the father of four children from a marriage which broke down. The breakdown of the relationship led to his suffering from depression over a period up to the time of the accident. He had used illicit drugs in his early twenties, and he resumed his drug use after the marriage breakdown. He had sought psychological treatment prior to the accident, and after it the psychologist observed him to present with symptoms “consistent with post-trauma”. At the time of sentence he had been responding well to continued treatment.
	
	
	He had an excellent employment history. His Honour found him to be genuinely remorseful for the offences and to have good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour treated him as a person of prior good character but noted that, given the nature of the offences, that was a factor “usually of limited significance”.
	
	
	As the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court, his Honour considered him to be entitled to a discount of about 25% for the utilitarian benefit of those pleas in respect of the offences involving Mr McNamara and Mr Sparks. However, he allowed a discount of about 20% in relation to the offence involving Ms Sparks, saying that to allow any greater discount “would have the effect of reducing the sentence to be imposed to a level below that which will be required to accurately reflect my assessment of the objective gravity of the offending conduct”.
	


The application


	
	Mr Boulton SC, for the applicant, argued 4 grounds of appeal:
	



	
	that the sentence on the charge relating to Ms Sparks is manifestly excessive;
	
	
	that his Honour erred in allowing a discount of only 20% for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty to that charge;
	
	
	that his Honour erred in ordering that sentence to be served entirely cumulatively upon the other two sentences; and
	
	
	that there was a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant in relation to the bases upon which his Honour found special circumstances.
	


Manifestly excessive?


	
	Mr Boulton noted that, in describing the applicant as having abandoned his responsibility to other users of the road, so that his moral culpability was high, his Honour was using the language to be found in the guideline judgment for sentencing in matters such as this in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, revisited in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, [2002] NSWCCA 343. It is necessary to return to that familiar guideline and it is sufficient to to do so by reference to Whyte.
	
	
	Relevantly, the guideline is that where an offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial sentence for an offence involving grievous bodily harm of less than 2 years would not generally be appropriate: Whyte at [229] (287). The typical offender in cases such as this was described in Whyte at [204] (284) as follows:
	


“A frequently recurring case of an offence under s 52A has the following characteristics.

(i) Young offender.

(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.

(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person.

(iv) The victim is a stranger.

(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates.

(vi) Genuine remorse.

(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.”


	
	Mr Boulton noted that the applicant could not be described as a “young offender” while, on the other hand, his plea of guilty was of more than “limited utilitarian value”. Certainly, Ms Sparks could be said to have suffered permanent injury but the applicant himself suffered significant injuries. Otherwise he shared the characteristics of the typical offender, being of good character with limited prior convictions and having demonstrated genuine remorse.
	
	
	In Whyte at [216]-[218] (286), Spigelman CJ reviewed and revised the aggravating factors described in Jurisic which may indicate that an offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct. These are:
	


(i)   extent and nature of the injuries inflicted;

(ii)   number of people put at risk;

(iii)   degree of speed;

(iv)   degree of intoxication or of substance abuse;

(v)   erratic or aggressive driving;

(vi)   competitive driving or showing off;

(vii)   length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk;

(viii)   ignoring of warnings;

(ix)   escaping police pursuit;

(x)   degree of sleep deprivation;

(xi)   failing to stop.


	
	Mr Boulton accepted that, of those characteristics, the present case raised (i), the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, and (iv), degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. He acknowledged the serious injuries sustained by Ms Sparks (noting that the injuries sustained by Mr Sparks and Mr McNamara were not as serious). As to the degree of intoxication or of substance abuse, he noted that the degree of intoxication here was not high although it was sufficient to have impaired the applicant’s driving. He pointed out that there was no suggestion of excessive speed or of erratic driving, although there is force in the observation of the Crown prosecutor in this Court that there was a measure of aggressive driving as it appears that the applicant had been “tailgating” the Holden sedan. None of the other aggravating features set out in Whyte were present. Mr Boulton submitted, and I accept, that (ii), the number of people put at risk, is directed to people other than the victims of the offence. It is not apparent that there were such people in the present case.
	
	
	In relating those aggravating factors to the guideline in Whyte, Spigelman CJ said at [228] (287):
	


“In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii)–(xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion.”


	
	Mr Boulton pointed out that the effect of the guideline where there is a finding of high culpability, arising from abandonment of responsibility, is that a custodial sentence of at least 2 years is normally appropriate. He pointed out that the sentence of 5 years for the count relating to Ms Sparks, after a 20% discount for the plea of guilty, meant an undiscounted starting point of 6 years and 3 months. He argued that, giving due weight to the severity of the consequences of the accident for Ms Sparks, the absence of many of the aggravating features identified in Whyte demonstrates that a starting point so close to the maximum sentence of 7 years was not called for.
	
	
	Mr Boulton supplied Judicial Commission statistics for offences of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm in the Local Court (93 cases between April 2012 and March 2016) and in the District Court (69 cases between January 2009 and December 2015). Of course, it is the District Court statistics which are of more significance. It appears that the sentence passed on the applicant in respect of the charge relating to Ms Sparks is the highest disclosed by the figures, both as to the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	Both Mr Boulton and the Crown prosecutor referred to decisions of this Court concerning sentences for dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. In none of them was a single count visited with a sentence as high as that complained of here. Nor, in cases involving more than one count, was there a total sentence as high as that passed in the present case. Mr Boulton focussed upon cases involving a sustained course of dangerous driving.
	
	
	In Harrigan v R [2005] NSWCCA 449, the offender drove aggressively, exceeding the speed limit, and from time to time swerving to the incorrect side of the road. He collided with the rear of another vehicle, causing it to collide with a telegraph pole. A 20 year old woman in that car, who was 7 months pregnant, suffered a ruptured uterus which led to a hysterectomy, lost her baby, and suffered fractures to her pelvis and her left ankle. She had continuing physical and emotional problems. The offender had a fairly lengthy criminal history, including driving offences.
	
	
	After a 20% discount for his plea of guilty, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 9 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months, that sentence being accumulated upon a fixed term of 18 months for a related offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. (The non-parole period of 3 years 3 months exceeds the figures in the Judicial Commission statistics, but it should be noted that the case was decided in 2005, before the period covered by the figures.) Accordingly, the starting point for the driving offence was 6 years. The offence was accepted as towards the top of the range. An appeal against that sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	In Black v R [2010] NSWCCA 321, the offender had picked up a number of people at a hotel in Newcastle. Immediately after they had got into the car he accelerated away, while four people in the back seat were not wearing seat belts and one of them was still trying to close the rear door. He did a U-turn across a raised median strip, causing the vehicle to bounce, and one of the passengers was ejected head first through the door, suffering a fractured skull and severe brain damage, as well as a fractured jaw. She was left with lifelong disabilities. The offender had a criminal history, including what was described by Schmidt J, delivering the leading judgment, as a “poor driving record”: [9].
	
	
	After pleas of guilty to dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm and several related offences, the offender was sentenced on the dangerous driving charge to imprisonment for 2 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. He received a 25% discount for his plea of guilty, so that the starting point was 3 years. The total effective sentence was 2 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months. Again, an appeal against the sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 was a successful Crown appeal against sentences imposed for 3 charges of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. In that case the offender was driving a utility, in which the passengers were two of his sons and one of their friends (referred to in the proceedings as DW). He was driving in the Southern Highlands area at high speed, such that DW asked him to slow down and, indeed, to stop so that he could get out. The vehicle failed to take a bend and careered off the road, eventually colliding with a tree, which was uprooted, and rolling onto its roof. The offender had a blood alcohol reading of a little over .09 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. The two sons were seriously injured, one of them suffering a traumatic amputation of his left arm above the elbow. DW suffered catastrophic injuries to his spine and was left a tetraplegic.
	
	
	Johnson J, delivering the leading judgment, said at [104]:
	


“The Crown submission that the offence involving DW is close to a worst-category offence of this kind is correct. The driving of the Respondent, as the sentencing Judge found, involved a high level of moral culpability. Added to this were the devastating consequences for DW, a teenager whose life has been altered profoundly. It is difficult to envisage a more serious example of ‘grievous bodily harm’ than that relating to DW. It was and remains important that the grave seriousness of the Respondent's crime against DW be marked by a significant period of imprisonment referrable to that offence alone.”


	
	The offender had a criminal record and a history of driving offences, including one some years earlier of driving in a manner dangerous. Johnson J observed at [110] that he had “few factors operating in his favour on sentence”. The Court intervened, not by altering the sentences passed in the District Court but by increasing the measure of accumulation between them. Initially the Court re-sentenced the offender to an aggregate term of imprisonment pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but it was necessary to revisit the matter primarily because the offender’s pleas of guilty had been entered before that provision came into effect: R v AB (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256.
	
	
	Apart from the three counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, the offender was also dealt with for deemed larceny of a motor vehicle (s 154A of the Crimes Act 1900) because the utility was taken from his place of work without his employer’s permission. The Court imposed partially accumulated sentences for each of the four counts, leading to a total term of 6 years 5 months with an effective non-parole period of 4 years 9 months. A discount of 25% was allowed for the pleas of guilty. The sentence for the offence relating to DW was 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months. It was accumulated almost entirely upon the other sentences (the overlap being only 1 month).
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor referred to two other cases of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm which should be noted. In Stanyard v R [2013] NSWCCA 134, the offender was convicted at trial of two such offences. He was driving a four wheel drive convertible over a sand dune when it became airborne, struck the sand and flipped over. The trial judge found that he was driving at a speed which, while moderate, was excessive in the circumstances. His conduct was the product of “youthful exuberance” and he failed to appreciate the danger posed by it. He was found to have been “showing off”, driving intentionally so as to cause all four wheels of the vehicle to leave the surface of the sand. Two young women who were passengers in the vehicle were injured, one of them being rendered a tetraplegic. The trial judge found the offender’s moral culpability to be high, and the injuries to that woman to be in the worst category.
	
	
	The offender was a young man with no criminal record but with a history of traffic offences, including a number of speeding offences. For the two counts he was sentenced to terms aggregating 5 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 3 ½ years. The sentence for the count relating to the woman who was rendered a tetraplegic was 4 ½ years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years. His appeal against these sentences was dismissed.
	
	
	In Primmer v R [2015] NSWCCA 155, the offender was driving at an excessive speed and to some degree under the influence of drugs. While executing a right hand turn, the vehicle veered to the wrong side of the road, the offender lost control of it and it collided heavily with a power pole. A passenger in the car, a 14 year old girl, suffered irreversible brain damage and was left with permanent disabilities as a result. The offender’s moral culpability was found by the sentencing judge to be high.
	
	
	The offender was 19 years old at the time. He had a significant history of traffic offences. He also had an intellectual disability, which this Court found to be relevant to his moral culpability and the need for general deterrence. His appeal against sentence was successful. The Court quashed a sentence of 3 ½ years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years, and he was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 7 months. The Court arrived at the sentence after a reduction of 25% for the offender’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	Mr Boulton also referred to two cases of dangerous driving causing death, the offence under s 52A(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment. In Hughes v R (2008) 185 A Crim R 155, [2008] NSWCCA 48; the offender was driving a laden semi-trailer while under the influence of cannabis. His 18 year old partner, who was three months pregnant, was a passenger in the vehicle. At a right hand bend he lost control of the vehicle, colliding with a concrete median barrier, and proceeding on top of the barrier for some distance until the vehicle ended up on its passenger side on the opposite side of the road. He managed to get out of the driver’s door, but the prime mover caught fire and he was unable to get his partner out. She was consumed by the fire and her foetus did not survive.
	
	
	He had some minor prior convictions and a traffic record which included some speeding offences. After a 25% discount for his plea of guilty, he was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 4 ½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years. His appeal was successful, and he was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	R v Price [2016] NSWCCA 50 was a successful Crown appeal in a case in which the offender had pleaded guilty to two counts of dangerous driving causing death and one of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. He had been driving in a rural area while affected by methylamphetamine. His two year old son was in a booster seat which was not appropriate for a child of his age. While taking a left hand bend, the vehicle veered to the wrong side of the road and collided with a car travelling in the opposite direction. The driver and passenger in that car, a married couple, were killed. The offender’s son suffered a traumatic brain injury, leading to paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the offender had been driving aggressively or impetuously, and attributed his conduct to the effect of the drug. Nevertheless, Button J, delivering the leading judgment, characterised his driving on the wrong side of the road as “flagrantly dangerous”: [90]. The offender had a criminal history and a traffic record which, Button J noted, “extended over many years and was extremely poor”: [58]. Upholding the Crown appeal, the Court substituted an aggregate sentence of 8 ½ years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months. Each indicative sentence was reduced by 25% on account of the pleas of guilty. The indicative sentence for the count relating to the offender’s son was 4 ½ years, the starting point being 6 years.
	
	
	As to the examination of the features of the present case in the light of the guideline judgment in Whyte, the Crown prosecutor reminded us of the following passage from the judgment of Johnson J in the original judgment in AB, referred to above, at [103]:
	


“It is important that the guideline judgment in R v Whyte does not become the undue focus of attention on the part of a sentencing Judge, with less attention being paid to the maximum penalty for each offence (in this case imprisonment for seven years). The guideline is a ""guide"" or ""check"" with the sentence to be imposed to be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all relevant factors, including the maximum penalty: R v Whyte at 288 [232]. As Spigelman CJ said in Legge v R [2007] NSWCCA 244 at [59], ""a guideline is not a tramline"".”


	
	The Crown prosecutor also emphasised the seriousness of driving a vehicle onto the incorrect side of the road in the face of oncoming traffic, whatever the circumstances might be, relying upon the characterisation of that conduct by Button J in Price (supra) as flagrantly dangerous. She pointed out that in the present case the accident occurred on a bridge where the oncoming vehicle had no opportunity to take any action to avoid a collision. No doubt, to be confronted with an imminent and inevitable head-on collision with a vehicle on its incorrect side of the road is every driver’s nightmare. That said, the point Mr Boulton sought to make was that the applicant’s conduct was an error of judgement, albeit a serious one, rather than a more sustained course of dangerous driving such as that to be found in most of the cases cited in argument.
	
	
	As to those cases and the statistics, the limitations on the use of material of that kind, spelled out in Hili and Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520, [2010] HCA 45, are familiar and have been recognised in numerous decisions of this Court before and after that High Court decision. The limited use of statistics, saying “nothing about why sentences were fixed as they were”, was referred to by the High Court in Hili at [48] (535). As to other cases involving a sentence for the offence at hand, the High Court at [54] (537) cited with approval the judgment of Simpson J (as she then was) in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1, at [303]-[305] (70-71), [2010] NSWCCA 194. The High Court summarised her Honour’s observations as follows:
	


“… As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ‘Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.’ But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ‘the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence.’ Past sentences ‘are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence’ (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ‘it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned’.”

[Footnotes omitted]


	
	In my view, the cases cited here do provide a useful yardstick against which to examine the sentence passed upon the applicant. In four of the cases this Court passed sentence after successful appeals by the Crown or the offender: AB, Primmer, Hughes and Price. In each of the five cases involving grievous bodily harm only there was a more or less sustained course of dangerous driving leading to very serious injury. One of them, Harrigan, also involved the death of a foetus. The highest sentence for a single count was 4 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months (Harrigan), and in cases involving more than one count, the highest aggregate sentence was 6 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months (AB).
	
	
	Of the two cases involving death, the victim in Hughes was a woman bearing a child and this Court intervened to reduce the sentence to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. Price, a case also involving a head-on collision in which the offender was drug affected, involved not only the death of two people but very serious injury to a child. The indicative sentence for the count relating to the child was 4 ½ years, and the aggregate sentence was 8 ½ years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months. Thus, as Mr Boulton pointed out, the sentence for the grievous bodily harm count was less severe than that passed on the applicant and, as to the aggregate sentence, the head sentence was only marginally greater, and the non-parole period a little less, than the total sentence and effective non-parole period in the present case. It should also be noted that that offender had a poor traffic record (as was also the case in Black and AB).
	
	
	In the light of these cases, the sentence for the count relating to Ms Sparks does appear to be severe, as does the aggregate sentence for all three counts, to which it was the major contributor. However, I do not find it necessary to determine the ground that it is manifestly excessive because, as I perceive error on other grounds, it would be open to this Court to re-sentence in its own discretion.
	


Discount for plea


	
	As I have said, his Honour discounted the sentence for the count relating to Ms Sparks by 20% on account of the plea of guilty, whereas the pleas of guilty to the other two counts were recognised by a discount of 25%. His Honour distinguished the discount for the count relating to Ms Sparks on the basis that the effect of a greater discount would be to reduce the sentence below that which was necessary to reflect the objective gravity of the offence: a recognition of the requirement in s 22(1A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that a lesser sentence imposed on account of a plea of guilty “must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”.
	
	
	This is not the occasion to revisit the guideline judgment in relation to reduction of sentence for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty in Thomson and Houlton v R (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, [2000] NSWCCA 309. It is accepted that the discretion to allow a reduction of sentence for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty remains a wide one. Nevertheless, there is some incongruity in reducing the sentence for two counts by 25% but for the other by 20%. Given the conclusion I have reached about the severity of the sentence for the relevant count, it is difficult to see how a 25% discount would have produced a sentence less than was required to mark the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	If this were the only ground of the application, one would not expect that this Court would intervene because the difference is a matter of a few months only. However, as I consider that there is merit in the next ground, and I consider that the combination of errors has caused the sentencing process to miscarry, I would uphold this ground.
	


Accumulation


	
	In considering the question of accumulation, his Honour referred to R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288. That was a case involving two counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm arising out of the same accident, in which Hunt AJA (with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed) considered the issue of concurrency and accumulation in cases of this kind. His Honour considered cases in which one incident gives rise to different charges with different victims. He divided that category of case into two sub-categories. An example of the first was where an offender repeatedly fires a gun, injuring a number of different people in the same incident, where it would be appropriate “to take into account the fact that the offences were substantially contemporaneous and connected …”. The second was where “the one action by the offender causes a number of people to be injured and where separate charges are laid in respect of each victim”: [21].
	
	
	Hunt AJA continued at [23]:
	


“In a case falling within the second sub-category, separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. The extent to which there should be an overlap in the partial accumulation will depend on what is required to represent the totality of the criminality involved in the one act of the offender. This, it seems to me, follows naturally from Pearce at [45]–[48] — and cases such as Regina v Weldon (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at [46]–[53] and Regina v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [38], [49] — when applying the general principles relating to the aggregation of sentences to this particular sub-category.”


	
	As I have said, his Honour accumulated the sentence for the count relating to Ms Sparks wholly upon the sentences for the other two counts. He gave no reason for taking that course. Presumably, it was because he considered the overall sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years necessary to reflect the applicant’s total criminality. Of course, courts have a wide discretion in dealing with questions of accumulation and concurrence, and totality is an important consideration. Total, or near total, accumulation in sentencing for multiple counts in cases such as this arising from the same accident are not unknown: see, for example, AB (No 2) (supra). However, consistently with the view expressed by Hunt AJA in the quoted passage, partly accumulative sentences are the normal practice.
	
	
	I see no reason why that course should not have been adopted here. Certainly, given my view of the severity of the sentence for the count in question, I cannot see that totality required such an approach. I find this ground also established.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am of the view that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. That being so, it becomes unnecessary to determine the fourth ground, alleging a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant in relation to the bases upon which his Honour found special circumstances. In any event, I would not have upheld that ground. It is based upon an exchange in argument between his Honour and counsel then representing the applicant which, in my view, does not bear the interpretation which Mr Boulton sought to place upon it.
	


Re-sentence


	
	The offence in question remains very serious. Undoubtedly, his Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise in a distressing case, and one could not but have the deepest sympathy for the unfortunate victim.
	
	
	In the event of resentence, the Crown sought to rely on additional material updating Ms Spark’s condition. This is an exceptional course, as the Crown usually leads evidence on resentence only in response to further evidence relied upon by the applicant. However, this is not the occasion to decide the permissibility of that course. It is sufficient to say that what emerges from the new material is consistent with the trial judge’s findings about the lasting effects upon her of the offence and does not require any re-examination of those findings. Accordingly, I would decline to receive that additional material in evidence.
	
	
	I would reduce the sentence on the count relating to Ms Sparks to a modest extent, I would allow a reduction of 25% for the plea of guilty, and I would direct that it be served concurrently to the extent of 6 months with the sentence on the count relating to Mr Sparks. Because of the degree of accumulation, I would find special circumstances, so as to depart from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. In the result, the effective non-parole period would also depart from the statutory proportion in its relationship to the overall sentence, but only to a modest extent. The period of parole eligibility, in my view, would be adequate to foster the applicant’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	I would allow the necessary extension of time, grant leave to appeal, and allow the appeal. The sentences on the counts related to Mr McNamara and Mr Sparks would stand. However, I would quash the sentence on the count relating to Ms Sparks and re-sentence the applicant on that count. My starting point would be 6 years, producing a sentence of 4 ½ years after a 25% reduction. I would fix a non-parole period of 2 ½ years.
	
	
	Accordingly, on the count relating to Ms Sparks, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 ½ years, commencing on 1 April 2017 and expiring on 30 September 2019, and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 1 October 2019 and expiring on 30 September 2021. The overall sentence, then, would be imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 1 October 2014. The applicant would become eligible for release on parole on 30 September 2019.

2881521,"R v Saleh, Haissan [2016] NSWCCA 216","HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The respondent pleaded guilty to one charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and a second charge under the same section of having knowingly taken part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

The aggregate sentence imposed at first instance was a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance term of 1 year 2 months. The indicative sentences were a non-parole period of 2 years 7 months and a balance of term of 11 months for count 1, and a non-parole period of 3 years 1 month and a balance term 1 year 1 month for count 2.

The Crown appealed on the ground that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate, particularly on account of the 20% discount allowed for assistance to authorities was excessive.

Per the Court

(i) The sentencing judge, in applying the 20% discount for assistance to authorities, was in error. The combined discount he allowed for the plea and assistance on count 1 was 45%. That is near to the figure of 50% which this Court has said should not normally be exceeded. The Court considered a discount of 10% for the limited assistance provided was appropriate: [17] – [18].

(ii) Having regard to comparative cases and accounting for the full range of circumstances which may bear upon the relative seriousness of any particular instance of offending against s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), the discount for assistance applied by the trial judge was unsupportably high: [19] – [20].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Haissan Saleh, the respondent to this Crown appeal, pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Sydney on 15 July 2015 to a charge that he supplied methylamphetamine, not less than the large commercial quantity. The charge was laid under s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The period of the offence was between 19 July 2013 and 6 August 2013. Slightly over 1 kg of the drug was involved.
	
	
	The respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court at Sydney on 25 May 2015 to a second charge under the same section, of having knowingly taken part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, in this case 2 kg for which he introduced a buyer to a seller between 5 August 2013 and 30 August 2013.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Whitford SC, which the Crown contends is manifestly inadequate, was imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year 2 months (total 4 years 8 months). The sentence commenced on 29 August 2013, the day the offender was arrested. He had been in custody from then until sentence was passed. His Honour nominated indicative sentences for the two charges respectively as follows:
	



	
	for count 1 (supply of approximately 1 kg), a non-parole period of 2 years 7 months and a balance of term of 11 months (overall 3 years 6 months); and
	
	
	for count 2 (knowing concern in supply of 2 kg), a non-parole period of 3 years 1 month and a balance of term 1 year 1 month (overall 4 years 2 months).
	


Facts of the offences


	
	Count 1 arose out of supply of the drug by the respondent to an undercover operative (“UCO”). The UCO met with a co-accused, Kamran Zolfonoon, on 10 July 2013 and tentatively arranged to purchase from him 1 kg of methyl amphetamine. Intercepted telephone calls show that Zolfonoon sought to obtain a quantity of the drug to fill this order from the respondent who ultimately acquired it from an associate named Negash. On 22 July 2013 the respondent provided Zolfonoon with a small sample to give to his buyer, the UCO. Zolfonoon met with the UCO and handed this over.
	
	
	When the UCO said he was content with the sample Zolfonoon telephoned the respondent who then brought to this meeting 97.1 g of the drug and gave it to the UCO directly. The price to the UCO was $22,000, of which Zolfonoon retained $5,000. The balance, $17,000, was paid by Zolfonoon to the respondent who in turn paid most of it to Negash. The respondent subsequently told police he had received only $300 for this transaction
	
	
	Between 2 and 3 August 2013 Zolfonoon arranged with the UCO for the 1 kg which had originally been discussed between them to be supplied on 6 August 2013. The respondent was informed of this and arranged for the 1 kg to be made available from his upline supplier. On 6 August 2013 the respondent and Zolfonoon drove to a house in Greenacre where the handover was to take place. The UCO followed behind by arrangement. The respondent went inside the house followed by Zolfonoon, who shortly afterwards brought out 999.6 g of methylamphetamine to the UCO and was handed $35,000 cash in exchange. The offender received $1,200 of this.
	
	
	The 97.1 g which had been supplied on 22 July 2013 was 85.5% pure. The 999.6 g supplied on 6 August 2013 was 59% pure. In total, including the small sample given on 22 July 2013, 1,096.91 g had been supplied. The threshold for the large commercial quantity is 1 kg.
	
	
	Count 2 concerns a further order which the UCO placed with Zolfonoon in August 2013 for multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine. Zolfonoon communicated to the respondent a wish to purchase 8 kgs. The upline supplier who had provided the 1,096.91 g the subject of count 1 left Australia at about this time and could not assist. The respondent contacted a cousin, Kassim Saleh, and they discussed a possible alternative supplier. This person, in the event was unable to supply such a large quantity.
	
	
	The respondent and his cousin met with yet a third potential upline supplier on 25 August 2013 to try to arrange a purchase. In the event this supplier dealt directly with Zolfonoon and the buyer. The respondent and his cousin were cut out, against their wishes. The respondent was sentenced on the basis that he had concerned himself in the supply of at least 2 kgs.
	
	
	Self-evidently the respondent’s role was that of an intermediary, fielding orders for significant quantities of this drug and contacting one or more of a number of upline suppliers of whom he was aware, for the purpose of filling the order and reaping a small profit, either as a markup or as a transaction fee.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The respondent was nearly 43 years old when the offences were committed. He was born in Lebanon in 1970 and moved to Australia with his family when he was very young. He commenced his schooling in this country at 8 years of age but after a few years the family returned to Lebanon. The respondent received no formal education there during the next 5 years. He came back to Australia in 1989, at age 19. He has only ever had unskilled work. He married in 2006 at age 36 and now has 4 children. When sentence was passed the children ranged in age from 7 years to 18 months, the youngest having been born whilst the respondent was on remand in custody for these offences.
	
	
	The respondent’s criminal record included a conviction for malicious wounding and four convictions for offences of dishonesty, the most serious of which was possession of identity information to commit an indictable offence dating from 26 August 2010. For this he was made subject to an intensive correction order of 18 months duration. That had only just come to an end when he committed the subject offences. He has not served a sentence of full-time custody for any previous offence. The learned sentencing judge considered that he was not entitled to any leniency on account of his record.
	
	
	His Honour was not satisfied that the respondent had suffered from a major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder or from alcohol or substance abuse, as he contended. It was accepted, with some hesitation on his Honour’s part, that the offender could be regarded as in a low to moderate range for risk of reoffending. The learned sentencing judge treated the respondent’s expressions of remorse with scepticism as being “more calculated to benefit his sentence hearing than reflecting any genuine concern for the consequences of his conduct”.
	
	
	The respondent had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to count 1, for which a 25% discount was allowed. A plea to count 2 was entered only on the day fixed for trial. His Honour allowed a 10% discount for that. An additional 20% discount was allowed in the sentences for both counts under s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). His Honour apportioned this discount one third to past assistance and two thirds in respect of future assistance. With respect to this the Remarks on Sentence contain the following at [53]:
	


“The extent of the assistance provided was clearly circumscribed by the offender and whilst such information as he provided appears from comparison with other sources to have been accurate, it seems to have limited utility. That utility primarily resides in a willingness to give evidence against two co-offenders.”


	
	The starting point for His Honour’s indicative sentences, given that they were reduced by 45% and 30% respectively must have been:
	



	
	for count 1, a non-parole period of 4 years 8 months with a balance of term of 1 year 8 months (total 6 years 4 months);
	
	
	for count 2, a non-parole period of 4 years 5 months with a balance of term of 1 year 7 months (total 6 years).
	



	
	The proportion of the balance of term to the non-parole period in the indicative sentences is, for count 2, 35.5% and, for count, 35.1%. His Honour made no finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44. The ratios applied in the indicative sentences are consistent with that. With equal consistency the ratio in the aggregate sentence is 33%.
	


Excessive discount for assistance


	
	On the appeal the Crown has contended that the discount allowed was excessive. The Court has reviewed the confidential exhibits on sentence, D and F, which record the nature of the assistance provided. By reference to the criteria in s 23(2), the respondent’s assistance may be evaluated as very limited. Because he remains in custody and because any degree of assistance to authorities may expose him to retribution, it would be inappropriate to refer in detail in these reasons to the nature and extent of the information the respondent has disclosed or the evidence he is willing to give. It is sufficient to say that his disclosure has been partial, selective and far short of the full extent of the knowledge which the respondent must necessarily have gained, from his own involvement in relevant events. There is no indication that assistance provided by the respondent was significant to the furtherance of police investigations or that it contributed to the police being in a position to apprehend any additional offender.
	
	
	Having regard to these considerations I accept that Crown submission that a 20% discount was excessive. The combined discount for the plea and assistance on count 1 was 45%. That is near to the figure of 50% which this Court has said should not normally be exceeded: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [3], [53]; AAT v R [2011] NSWCCA 17 at [31]; R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43 at [94]; (2011) 205 A Crim R 222; R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65 at [42]; (2011) 205 A Crim R 429. The Court considers that an allowance of 10% for the limited assistance provided by the respondent would have been appropriate and that two thirds of this should be regarded as attributable to future assistance.
	


Manifest inadequacy, sentences passed in comparable cases


	
	In order to establish manifest inadequacy it is not necessary that the Crown should demonstrate specific error. However the specific error with respect to allowing the unsupportably high discount for assistance is capable of lending weight to the Crown’s contention of inadequacy. Further support for the Crown’s position is found in a comparison of the starting point sentences which are implicit in his Honour’s indicative terms with sentences which have been passed in comparable cases. In this comparison of course due allowance must be made for differences in both objective and subjective features and adjustments are required where discounts for pleas or for assistance have been allowed.
	
	
	In Toole, Kurt v R; Toole, Joshua v R [2014] NSWCCA 318 at [86] – [99] RS Hulme AJ collected citations of a number of cases which are more or less comparable with the present, subject to allowance and adjustment for differences of the kind referred to above. This comparison shows that the learned sentencing judge’s starting point sentences in the present case were very significantly below sentences which have generally been passed for offences of this type and gravity. In making the comparison the Court has given consideration to the full range of circumstances which may bear upon the relative seriousness of any particular instance of offending against the relevant section of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, including but of course not limited to the quantity of drug involved in, its purity and the role of the offender. In this case the respondent was effectively a middle man or procurer of two wholesale quantities from separate upline suppliers.
	


Residual discretion to refrain from resentencing


	
	As this Court finds error in the sentencing judge’s decision, the question remains whether, nevertheless, the Court should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene: CMB v Attorney-General for New South Wales (2015) 256 CLR 346; [2015] HCA 9 at [34], [66]. The onus is on the Crown to persuade the Court to intervene. Considerations relevant to the exercise of this residual discretion were restated in R v Mereb; R v Younan [2014] NSWCCA 149 at [30] – [32]. A most important consideration in the present case is that the sentence imposed is, in the Courts view, significantly less than adequate and involves an excessive discount for very limited and parcel assistance to authorities.
	
	
	There has not been such significant delay in the appeal process as to warrant, of itself, exercise the residual discretion. Sentence was passed on 16 December 2015 and the Crown served its notice of appeal on 17 February 2016. The appeal was heard on 8 June 2016. It is not apparent that the course of the appeal has caused prejudice to the respondent. This is a relevant matter: R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80D. The significant delay in relation to the respondent’s case, which has led to the Crown’s appeal now being decided only months before expiry of the non-parole period fixed in the District Court, has been the lapse of time between the laying of charges on 29 August 2013 and the sentence hearing, more than two years later, on dates in October, November and December 2015.
	
	
	The proximity of this Court’s decision, increasing the term of imprisonment, to what would otherwise be the earliest date on which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole under the Whitford DCJ’s orders is unfortunate. Notwithstanding that, the disparity between the sentence imposed by his Honour and the sentence we consider appropriate for two serious drug offences involving kilogram quantities of methylamphetamine, is such that the residual discretion to refrain from intervening should not be exercised.
	


Orders


	
	For reasonable consistency with sentences passed in other cases of this kind and taking into account the objective seriousness of these offences and the weak subjective case, the Court considers the undiscounted or starting point sentences should have been:
	



	
	for count 1, a non-parole period of 6 years 2 months with a balance of term of 2 years (total 8 years 2 months);
	
	
	for count 2, a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 4 months (total 9 years 10 months).
	



	
	With combined discounts for the plea and assistance of 35% and 20% respectively, the indicative sentences would then have been:
	



	
	for count 1, a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 1 year 4 months (total 5 years 4 months);
	
	
	for count 2, a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 2 years (total 8 years).
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge’s aggregate sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months which was only 5 months longer than the longest non-parole period of the two indicative terms he nominated, namely that for count 2. This reflects an effective accumulation of only 5 months which does not adequately reflect the entire criminality of the respondent’s involvement in these two distinct large commercial supplies. A proper reflection of the total criminality would be achieved by imposing an aggregate which incorporates effective accumulation of 12 months of non-parole. That is, an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 2 years 4 months (overall, 9 years 4 months).
	
	
	Comparison may be made with the case of Kamran Zolfonoon for a count concerning supply of 3.5 kgs of heroin by way of several transactions over the first two months of 2012. At that time the statutory definition of “large commercial quantity” was the same for methylamphetamine as for heroin, namely 1 kg. Following a Crown appeal heard on the same day as the present appeal, this Court resentenced him to an aggregate term, based upon an indicative sentence for the count concerning 3.5 kgs of heroin of 6 years non-parole period and a balance of term of 4 years. His discount was 25% for an early plea and special circumstances were found, justifying an adjustment of the proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence to 60%.
	
	
	Accordingly the orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Whitford DCJ on 16 December 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof Haissan Saleh is sentenced to an aggregate sentence for both counts of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years to commence 29 August 2013 and to expire 28 August 2020 and a balance of term of 2 years 4 months to commence 29 August 2020 and to expire 28 December 2022. Haissan Saleh will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiry of the non-parole period of the aggregate sentence.

2881536,R v Dashti [2016] NSWCCA 251,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In November 2011 the NSW Police commenced an investigation under the name Strike Force Taipan in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs by respondent, Mr Dashti, and others. As a consequence of the investigation Mr Dashti was charged with two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and one count of agreement to supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug in contravention of s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Mr Dashti pleaded guilty to all three offences.

The maximum penalty for each offence was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 54B(2) the standard non-parole period was 15 years.

On 4 December 2015 Madgwick QC ADCJ sentenced Mr Dashti to an aggregate head sentence of 20 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years to commence from the date of his arrest on 9 February 2012. In the same proceedings the sentencing judge sentences two additional co-offenders of Mr Dashti, AB and RH. In sentencing Mr Dashti the sentencing judge took into account the fact it was Mr Dashti’s first period of incarceration, and that he was socially isolated and lonely due to poor English and estrangement from his wife and family.

The Crown’s appeal against sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of Mr Dashti was heard concurrently with, inter alia, the appeal of a co-offender, Mr Zolfonoon (see R v Zolfonoon [2016] NSWCCA 250).

The principal issues for determination were:

(i)   Whether the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried by reason of his Honour engaging in sequential reasoning rather than sentencing on the basis of instinctive synthesis;

(ii)   Whether the sentencing judge had erred by failing to take into account the legislative guideposts of the relevant maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods;

(iii)   Whether the sentencing judge erred by making a finding of special circumstances that was not open on the evidence;

(iv)   Whether the aggregate sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly inadequate

The Court (Beazley P, Garling and Fagan JJ):

In relation to (i):

(1)   It is well established that the process to be followed when sentencing an offender is one of “instinctive synthesis”. [41]-[42]

Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

(2)   Despite acceptance that in some simple cases “some indulgence in an arithmetical process” is appropriate in sentencing, this was not such a case. The sentencing judge erred in arriving at a sentence on the basis of a “two-tiered” approach to sentencing. [44]-[46]

Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.

In relation to (ii):

(1)   The sentencing judge did not outline in a structured and directed way the reasons for his reduction of the non-parole period pursuant to ss 54B(4) and (5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 (NSW). [70]

(2)   However, the sentencing judge’s remarks (as appeared in the transcript of the sentencing proceedings) in relation to both the respondent and one of his co-offenders disclosed the reasons underlying his Honour’s departure from the standard. [71]-[73]

In relation to (iii):

(1)   A finding of special circumstances is integrally linked with the determination of an appropriate non-parole period. [84]

R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704.

(2)   A finding of special circumstances based upon it being the offender’s first time in custody will ordinarily bear little, if any, weight unless the finding of special circumstances can be supported by other factors. [92]

Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213; R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1.

(3)   The sentencing judge did not err in taking into account the fact it was the respondent’s first time in prison in circumstances where there were other factors relevant to his imprisonment. [93]

(4)   The sentencing judge did not err in taking into account the respondent’s difficulties with English, notwithstanding a psychological report stating that the respondent was able to express himself in English without obvious difficulty, in circumstances where the sentencing judge had the opportunity to observe the respondent in the witness box. [93]

In relation to (iv):

(1)   The sentencing judge did not err in applying a 15% discount on the basis of the respondent’s guilty plea in circumstances where, notwithstanding a long sentencing hearing, the plea saved a substantial amount of court time. [106]

Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41; R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219.

(2)   The sentence was manifestly inadequate having regard to the limited number of mitigating circumstances and the need to take into account the five Form 1 offences. [118], [122], [135]

Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146; Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58; R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287; 142 A Crim R 101; Vigo v R [2009] NSWCCA 98.

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: In this matter, the Crown appeals, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5D, against a sentence imposed on the respondent, Mohammad Dashti. Mr Dashti pleaded guilty to three drug offences: two counts of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s 25(2), being the offences of supplying 49.85 kg of opium and 47.56 kg of methylamphetamine respectively; and one count of agreeing to supply 2 kg of heroin.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each offence was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 54B(2). There was a prescribed standard non-parole period of 15 years for each offence.
	
	
	Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ss 32 and 33, three further supply offences, contrary to s 25(2), and two offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 193B(2), were taken into account (the Form 1 offences).
	
	
	On 4 December 2015, his Honour Madgwick QC ADCJ sentenced Mr Dashti to an aggregate head sentence of 20 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years, to commence from the date of his arrest on 9 February 2012.
	
	
	The Crown’s appeal in respect of Mr Dashti was heard concurrently with Crown appeals against sentences imposed on Kamran Zolfonoon and Haissan Saleh and with an appeal against sentence brought by Kassim Saleh. Mr Dashti was a co-offender with Mr Zolfonoon but not with Mr Haissan Saleh or Mr Kassim Saleh, and their appeals are not relevant to the determination of this appeal.
	
	
	The Crown raised four grounds of appeal in respect of Mr Dashti, as follows:
	


“Ground 1: His Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of him engaging in sequential reasoning, rather than him sentencing by instinctive synthesis.

Ground 2: His Honour erred by failing to take into account the legislative guideposts of the relevant maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods.

Ground 3: His Honour erred by making a finding of special circumstances that was not open on the evidence.

Ground 4: The aggregate sentence passed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate.”


	
	For the reasons that follow, the Court has determined that error on the part of the sentencing judge has been made out and that this is not an appropriate case to exercise the residual discretion. Accordingly, it will be necessary to resentence Mr Dashti.
	
	
	The Crown appeal in respect of Mr Zolfonoon is dealt with in a separate judgment: see R v Zolfonoon [2016] NSWCCA 250.
	


Factual background


	
	In November 2011, the NSW Police commenced an investigation under the name Strike Force Taipan in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs by Mr Zolfonoon and others. Two registered informers, a number of undercover police officers and surveillance and electronic intercepts were used in the investigation. As the investigation progressed, it expanded to include the activities of others, including Mr Dashti.
	
	
	Mr Zolfonoon was introduced by an informer to an undercover police officer on 24 November 2011. During that meeting, Mr Zolfonoon indicated that he had access to large quantities of prohibited drugs, including heroin and methylamphetamine. The officer requested samples of the drugs so that she could assess their quality prior to purchasing larger quantities. Mr Zolfonoon supplied to the officer 28.35 g of methylamphetamine and 19.83 g of heroin on 6 January 2012 for a total price of $13,500. Surveillance indicated that the drugs had been sourced from RH, who was subsequently charged with drug offences.
	
	
	On 10 January 2012, an informer placed an order with Mr Zolfonoon for 1 kg of heroin to be purchased by the undercover officer. On 17 January 2012, RH obtained 993 g of heroin from Mr Dashti, which he provided to Mr Zolfonoon, who supplied it to the undercover officer in exchange for $150,000. The supply to the officer occurred at the Wu Shu Academy, a martial arts training facility run by Mr Zolfonoon. The proceeds of sale were then passed back to RH and Mr Dashti. This transaction formed the basis of a supply charge against Mr Dashti which was taken into account on the Form 1 in respect of the opium charge to which he pleaded guilty.
	
	
	On 6 February 2012, Mr Zolfonoon supplied 496.7 g of heroin to the undercover officer at a cost of $75,000. Again, the drug was obtained from Mr Dashti by RH, who passed it to Mr Zolfonoon for sale to the undercover officer. This was the second supply offence taken into account on the Form 1 in respect of the opium charge.
	
	
	Surveillance of the 6 February transaction led police to a Kennards storage unit in Artarmon, Sydney, which was used by Mr Dashti and another offender, AB. The unit was used to store drugs which had been imported from Iran, concealed in pallets of fruit juice. On 7 February, police conducted a partial covert search of the facility and seized 16.886 kg of methylamphetamine and 13.334 kg of opium, together with indicia of supply, including numerous empty resealable plastic bags and electronic scales. Police installed a video camera in the storage unit.
	
	
	On 8 February 2012, the informer contacted Mr Zolfonoon and placed an order for a further 2 kg of heroin. The order was relayed to RH and, through him, to Mr Dashti. The supply was arranged for 9 February. Mr Dashti attended the Kennards unit on that day and was observed on the video camera. It was the Crown case that he was searching the unit for the opium which had been seized the day before, a portion of which he intended to add to 154.5 g of heroin found in the unit to make up the order for 2 kg of heroin. Mr Dashti was arrested on leaving the unit. This conduct comprised Mr Dashti’s agreement to supply the 2 kg of heroin. The supply of 154.5 g of heroin was taken into account on the Form 1 in respect of that offence.
	
	
	The police then conducted a full search of the Kennards unit. Apart from the 154.5 g of heroin referred to above, 9.449 kg of methylamphetamine and a further 35.736 kg of opium were found. That opium, along with that found in the previous search, made up the opium which was the subject of the first supply offence on the indictment against Mr Dashti. A total of $210,000 in cash was also found, which was the subject of a proceeds of crime offence taken into account on the Form 1 attached to the opium charge.
	
	
	Subsequent investigations into the affairs of Mr Dashti and AB resulted in the discovery of two more storage units. In the first, a Storage King unit also in Artarmon, Sydney, a further 4.231 kg of methylamphetamine was found. A further 18.164 kg of the drug, along with $540,000 in cash, was found in the second unit, which was near Perth Airport. The methylamphetamine seized from the three storage units was the subject of the second supply offence on the indictment against Mr Dashti. A proceeds of crime charge relating to the $540,000 in cash was taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of the methylamphetamine charge.
	
	
	Investigations subsequently revealed that Mr Dashti had hired a car and stayed in a hotel in Perth when the unit was accessed and when AB was overseas.
	
	
	AB was charged with and pleaded guilty to supply offences in respect of the same quantities of methylamphetamine and opium which founded the charges against Mr Dashti, but was not charged with any offence in relation to heroin. Two Form 1 offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime were taken into account on the plea. One of those offences related to the same $210,000 taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of the opium charge to which Mr Dashti pleaded guilty; the other related to a separate sum of $12,180 deposited by AB into the bank account of RH.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	Mr Dashti was sentenced at the same time as AB. Madgwick QC ADCJ also sentenced a third co-offender, RH, on a different occasion. The offenders, Mr Zolfonoon, Mr Haissan Saleh and Mr Kassim Saleh were sentenced in separate proceedings before Whitford SC DCJ.
	
	
	Madgwick QC ADCJ found that AB did not have a role involving direct contact with purchasers in the drug supply chain. Rather, AB’s role involved the facilitation of drug importation and of delivery to and transport between the storage units and the making of money payments.
	
	
	His Honour considered that AB’s preparedness to give evidence against Mr Dashti was likely the key factor in precipitating Mr Dashti’s guilty pleas and that the value of his assistance was “pretty high”. AB served time in protection as a result, and his Honour commented that that made his incarceration “markedly more difficult”.
	
	
	AB was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. In imposing this sentence, Madgwick QC ADCJ took into account in mitigation his difficult background and his addiction to opium. His Honour allowed a total discount of 33 per cent for the plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities. His Honour also made a finding of special circumstances, including on the basis of the difficult time AB would have in custody, part of which would be served on protection. His Honour stated that he took into account the Form 1 offences.
	
	
	There was a dispute in the sentencing proceedings as to which of AB or Mr Dashti was the principal in respect of the opium and methylamphetamine charges, with the Crown and AB contending that Mr Dashti was the driving and effective force in the drug operations and that therefore his culpability was much greater, and Mr Dashti contending to the contrary. His Honour held that, in respect to the opium, he was “ultimately left with a doubt that [Mr Dashti] could even be called a full co-equal with AB”. However, his Honour concluded as follows:
	


“[Mr Dashti’s] very significant heroin dealing in the kilo and half kilo amounts are to be taken into account in relation to the opium dealing, so that, in the result, the sentence for him for the opium dealing must be of the same order, conceptually, as that for AB, leaving aside other subjective matters …”

That is to say, all things taken into account, his Honour concluded Mr Dashti’s objective criminality was comparable to that of AB.


	
	Mr Dashti was, however, found to be the principal in respect of the methylamphetamine, “because of his general perspicacity, business sense, and self-discipline compared to AB”. His Honour also considered that Mr Dashti was the principal in respect of the offence of 2 kg of heroin. His Honour noted that, had the Crown not made concessions in respect of AB and approached the matter on the basis that he was less culpable than Mr Dashti, AB’s sentence would have been more severe. That circumstance formed the basis of a reduction in Mr Dashti’s sentence by reference to parity considerations.
	
	
	Madgwick QC ADCJ noted that Mr Dashti had no criminal history. His Honour described the circumstances in which Mr Dashti came to Australia from Iran following political persecution of his family, including the killing of his brother, and noted that he suffered from a spinal injury or disease that left him with a chronically bad back. His Honour rejected a claim by Mr Dashti that he was an opium addict at the time of the offending. His Honour described Mr Dashti’s other subjective features as follows:
	


“The picture is of a mature and middle aged man with a physical disability married to a very intelligent woman with children who has simply decided to be in business as a drug dealer. He did not care what might be the effects of the ice and heroin on the predominantly young people that ultimately consume those drugs. He did not care how much misery and degradation would be suffered by some proportion of those who used the opium …

Additional subjective matters include that [Mr Dashti] has as a result of his crimes and arrest lost his family – his wife has left him and has clearly taken the view that his children will be better off not seeing him and so he has not seen them; this is a matter of great pain to him, particularly, the separation from his children. He has been in no trouble since he has been in gaol …

[Mr Dashti] has expressed remorse for his drug dealing. This is … of little weight. I think the best could be said for him is, as I have said, that he had a hard life and physical disability that disqualified him for various fields of work that he was fit for in Australia and that he turned to drug dealing.”


	
	In arriving at Mr Dashti’s head sentence of 20 years, Madgwick QC ADCJ stated:
	


“Were there nothing at all to be said in his favour as to subjective matters and had he been convicted after trial for the various matters I think that an aggregated head sentence of not less than 30 years would be appropriate. Because of the subjective factors to which I have referred that should be reduced by about 10% to 27 years. For his plea of guilty I would give him a discount of 15% … That would notionally reduce the sentence to 23 years. Because of what I think is the parity consideration referred to in relation to AB, I reduce that to the aggregate period of 20 years …”


	
	His Honour’s reasoning process in this passage forms the basis of ground 1 of the appeal.
	
	
	His Honour made a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory standard ratio: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 44. His Honour described Mr Dashti’s special circumstances, on being reminded by counsel of the need to do so, as follows:
	


“It is his first time in prison, his English is not perfect and he is in circumstances, I think, of extreme loneliness and social isolation after the – understandable enough – departure from the marriage of his wife and children.”


	
	The Crown challenges the finding of special circumstances: see ground 3 of the appeal.
	
	
	Madgwick QC ADCJ stated as the indicative sentences for the offences charged on the indictment as being: in respect of the attempt to supply heroin, 15 years; in respect of the supply of methylamphetamine, 20 years; and in respect of the supply of opium, 15 years. His Honour held that the sentences should be fully concurrent, reasoning that:
	


“Although there are separate drugs and separate operations, they were concurrent and part of [Mr Dashti] presenting, as it were, a composite persona of a go-to man for a number of drugs at wholesale level, and there is the question of totality to consider, so I think it is reasonable, even if unusual, that those sentences should all be concurrent, hence again the period of 20 years as the aggregate head sentence.”


	
	RH and Mr Zolfonoon were both sentenced after Mr Dashti. RH pleaded guilty to the offences of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of heroin, being the 993 g supplied to the undercover police officer on 17 January 2012: see above at [11], and agreeing to supply a large commercial quantity of heroin, being the 2 kg to be supplied on 9 February 2012: see above at [14]. The former charge arises from the same transaction as the Form 1 offence with respect to the opium charge against Mr Dashti and the latter charge arises from the same transaction as the primary heroin charge against Mr Dashti. RH also had three Form 1 offences taken into account. RH was sentenced to an aggregate head sentence of 5 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. His Honour allowed a discount of 45 per cent for the plea and for assistance.
	
	
	Mr Zolfonoon pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being one count relating to a total of 3.5 kg of heroin supplied or agreed to be supplied over the course of six transactions and one count relating to 9.1 kg of methylamphetamine supplied over the course of seven transactions. Three possession charges were taken into account on a Form 1. Mr Zolfonoon was sentenced by Whitford DCJ to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of four years. That sentence included a 25 per cent discount for a plea of guilty.
	


Principles relating to Crown sentence appeals generally


	
	The primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence pursuant to s 5D is “to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]. Such appeals raise a tension with “the common law’s antagonism to double jeopardy”: Lacey v Attorney-General (Qld) [2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573 at [15], and the High Court has commented a number of times that they should be brought only in “exceptional circumstances”: see Lacey at [15]-[20] and the cases cited therein.
	
	
	In order to succeed in an appeal against sentence, the Crown is required to make out error on the part of the sentencing judge of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. That test was described in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] in the following terms:
	


“… is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ‘manifest excess’, or in a prosecution appeal, as ‘manifest inadequacy’.”

Ground 1: sequential sentencing process


	
	In respect of ground 1, the Crown principally relied on the statements of Madgwick QC ADCJ in the passage set out above at [26] as demonstrating that his Honour adopted a sequential and therefore erroneous approach to the sentence to be imposed, contrary to the principles stated in Markarian.
	
	
	The Crown identified four stages of sequential reasoning in that passage: first, coming to a commencing aggregate sentence of 30 years; secondly, the deduction of 10 per cent by reference to subjective factors; thirdly, the reduction by 15 per cent for a guilty plea; and fourthly, a deduction of 3 years for parity with AB.
	
	
	In oral argument, the Crown relied principally upon error in the first two of those stages and accepted that a percentage reduction in respect of a guilty plea was not erroneous. The Crown also contended that his Honour did not take into account the Form 1 matters in his sentencing process. That submission is considered below in dealing with ground 4.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the present case was similar to Greenaway v R [2013] NSWCCA 270. In that case, R A Hulme J, with whom Gleeson JA and Adamson J agreed, held at [31] that:
	


“… [the sentencing judge’s] approach was two-staged. He arrived at a sentence of 20 years without regard to subjective matters and then reduced it for the plea and other mitigating features. Such an approach is erroneous in itself.” (citations omitted)


	
	Mr Dashti’s principal contention in respect of ground 1 was that his Honour’s remarks on sentence, read fairly and in the context of the exchanges with counsel, demonstrated that his Honour did not engage in sequential reasoning as submitted by the Crown, albeit that his Honour had used some arithmetical quantification to give transparency to his reasoning process. Mr Dashti relied in particular upon the following exchange between counsel and his Honour as indicating that his Honour’s attention was expressly drawn to the correct approach:
	


“HIS HONOUR: … it seems to me the intellectual approach is what would your client get after a trial if there was no reason at all to moderate the sentence, what would he get after a trial if there was some reason to moderate the sentence … how much does he get off for the plea of guilty and an effort to assist the police, other special circumstance and what should be the non-parole period. [Counsel for AB] from Victoria was a bit amazed that in New South Wales this might be approached in that explicit way rather than finding shelter in the instinctive synthesis.

[COUNSEL FOR MR DASHTI]: Markarian.

HIS HONOUR: Everybody’s much better off to the extent the sentencing judge exposes his reasoning processes, and so if I’m wrong either way, then it can be fixed up.

[COUNSEL FOR MR DASHTI]: Your Honour, clearly when assessing an appropriate sentence your Honour is looking at Markarian instinctive synthesis, your Honour’s looking at Muldrock …”

It is convenient to observe at this point that the Crown submitted that this passage in fact was indicative of the error in his Honour’s ultimate approach.


	
	In the alternative, Mr Dashti contended that even if his Honour had engaged in sequential reasoning, the circumstances were such that “some indulgence in an arithmetical process” was not impermissible and the sentencing discretion therefore did not miscarry: Markarian at [39].
	


Consideration of ground 1


	
	The relevant principles in relation to the process to be followed in sentencing an offender were stated by McHugh J in Markarian at [51]. McHugh J distinguished between “two-tier” sentencing, which he held was erroneous, and the process of sentencing by “instinctive synthesis”, as follows:
	


“By two-tier sentencing, I mean the method of sentencing by which a judge first determines a sentence by reference to the ‘objective circumstances’ of the case. This is the first tier of the process. The judge then increases or reduces this hypothetical sentence incrementally or decrementally by reference to other factors, usually, but not always, personal to the accused. This is the second tier. By instinctive synthesis, I mean the method of sentencing by which the judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. Only at the end of the process does the judge determine the sentence.”

See also Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [26].


	
	The majority in Markarian, at [39], in a passage upon which Mr Dashti placed some emphasis, described the instinctive synthesis approach in the following terms:
	


“Following the decision of this Court in Wong [[2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584] it cannot now be doubted that sentencing courts may not add and subtract item by item from some apparently subliminally derived figure, passages of time in order to fix the time which an offender must serve in prison. That is not to say that in a simple case, in which, for example, the circumstances of the crime have to be weighed against one or a small number of other important matters, indulgence in arithmetical deduction by the sentencing judges should be absolutely forbidden. An invitation to a sentencing judge to engage in a process of ‘instinctive synthesis’, as useful as shorthand terminology may on occasions be, is not desirable if no more is said or understood about what that means. The expression ‘instinctive synthesis’ may then be understood to suggest an arcane process into the mysteries of which only judges can be initiated. The law strongly favours transparency. Accessible reasoning is necessary in the interests of victims, of the parties, appeal courts, and the public. There may be occasions when some indulgence in an arithmetical process will better serve these ends. This case was not however one of them because of the number and complexity of the considerations which had to be weighed by the trial judge.” (Mr Dashti’s emphasis)


	
	This was not a simple case, so that the observation in Markarian does not, in our opinion, apply. Subject to the percentage deduction for the plea of guilty, indulgence in an arithmetical process was not an appropriate approach to the sentencing task in which his Honour was required to engage.
	
	
	However, the specification of the percentage deduction for the plea of guilty involved, as accepted by the Crown, orthodox sentencing principle. It accorded with s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which provides for the imposition of a “lesser penalty” than would otherwise have been imposed, on the basis of a guilty plea.
	
	
	However, there was error in his Honour’s approach in arriving at an aggregate sentence which he then reduced by a stated percentage for the respondent’s subjective features. This was clearly a stepped or two-tiered approach to sentencing, contrary to what is required by the principle of instinctive synthesis stated in Markarian.
	
	
	The Court is of the opinion that the Crown has established error in respect of ground 1.
	


Ground 2: failure to take into account the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period for the offences


	
	The Crown acknowledged that his Honour, in the course of sentencing AB, referred to “the standard non-parole period as a marker or guide of the seriousness with which Parliament views this matter” but submitted that his Honour’s omission to refer to the standard non-parole period when sentencing Mr Dashti was indicative that his Honour had not taken it into account.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that his Honour failed to indicate non-parole periods in respect of the individual counts on the indictment, when stating the indicative sentence to be imposed in respect of each offence, contrary to the requirements of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 54B(4). Although acknowledging that that omission did not invalidate the sentence: see s 54B(7), the Crown submitted that it was indicative of his Honour’s overall error in failing to take the standard non-parole period into account in dealing with each offence.
	
	
	Mr Dashti made reference to a large number of submissions made to his Honour, both oral and written, by which all parties to the sentencing proceedings referred to both the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. Mr Dashti also pointed to two exchanges in the sentence proceedings in relation to AB and RH in which his Honour mentioned the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the supply offences.
	


Maximum penalty for the offence


	
	There is no dispute that sentencing judges must have regard to the prescribed maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods: Muldrock at [27]. As has already been stated, the maximum penalty for an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s 25(2) is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000.
	
	
	His Honour made no express reference to the statutory maximum of life imprisonment in his remarks in respect of either Mr Dashti or his co-accused AB, who was sentenced at the same time. Mr Dashti, however, relies upon the comments made by his Honour in the course of the sentencing hearing on behalf of RH. By way of example, his Honour, in response to a submission by counsel for RH that a starting point for the appropriate sentence was less than 18 years, stated: “but this carries life”.
	
	
	Later, during the course of submissions being made on behalf of AB, his Honour stated:
	


“The worst case scenario after a trial if it were the worst class of case it would be life or trying to say it in the terms of a discrete sentence, something of the order of 30 years …”


	
	Mr Dashti’s reliance on such remarks raises the question whether, and, if so, in what circumstances a judge’s remarks in the course of argument may be relied upon as being part of or explaining the judge’s reasons.
	
	
	The circumstances in which resort may be had to comments made during the course of a hearing to explain a judge’s reasoning are limited. An obvious use is to demonstrate bias. That, of course, was not this case. There may be occasions where a reference to the transcript may explain an observation by the judge in the reasons or demonstrate that an apparent mistake is merely typographical or otherwise irrelevant.
	
	
	There may also be occasions where there is such a clear reference to a matter in the course of argument that it may be inferred that notwithstanding an omission in the reasons, the judge was at all times aware of the matter and took it into account. Care needs to be exercised in this last circumstance as it does not necessarily follow that because a matter was adverted to in argument, the judge did not overlook it in the reasons.
	
	
	In the present case, the transcript raises the clear inference that his Honour understood that the maximum sentence in this matter was life imprisonment. His Honour’s statement that the offence “carries life” was emphatic and leaves no doubt that he knew that that was the penalty prescribed for an offence contrary to s 25(2).
	
	
	It is less clear as to his Honour’s meaning in his comment that a “discrete sentence” for the worst case was “of the order of 30 years”. If his Honour was intending to indicate that that would be the approximate highest sentence that was to be imposed for an offence under the section, that would be in error. However, it is not necessary to speculate further on that matter, in circumstances where the ultimate question in issue in this case is whether the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	However, in respect of this aspect of ground 2, we are not satisfied that his Honour erred as alleged.
	


The standard non-parole period


	
	The offences to which Mr Dashti pleaded guilty were subject to a standard non-parole period of 15 years, as also was the case with AB. Standard non-parole periods are governed by Pt 4, Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Relevantly, s 54A provides that for the purposes of sentencing, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for a specified offence that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.
	
	
	Section 54B(2) provides that the standard non-parole period is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account. In this regard, s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act prescribes the matters to be taken into account in sentencing.
	
	
	Section 54B(3) provides that a court must make a record of its reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and must identify each factor that it took into account in so determining. Section 54B(5) makes like provision in respect of aggregate sentences.
	
	
	In Muldrock, the High Court stated, at [26], that s 54B(2), read with ss 54B(3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act required an approach to sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian: see above at [41].
	
	
	The Court explained, at [27]:
	


“Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ‘the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness’. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.” (citation omitted)


	
	The High Court further pointed out, at [29], that a central purpose of the standard non-parole period provisions was to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. As the Court stated:
	


“[Section 54B(4) requires] the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed.”

(It should be noted that s 54B has been amended subsequent to the decision in Muldrock. However, the High Court’s observations remain applicable to s 54B in its present form).


	
	As we have indicated, his Honour made findings as to the role Mr Dashti played in respect of the offences: see above at [23]. In the course of sentencing AB, his Honour referred to the seriousness of trading in opium and of being willing to trade in methylamphetamine as being very high.
	
	
	His Honour held that AB had “engaged in no more than the middle range of seriousness of crimes of this kind”. His Honour “would have … regarded [AB] as a full principal in relation to the opium” but because of the way the Crown put the case, relying upon AB’s diminution of his own role relative to that of Mr Dashti, his Honour treated AB’s offending with respect to the opium as at about the mid-range. In relation to the methylamphetamine his Honour said that AB “was a mid-range player”.
	
	
	His Honour described the charges against Mr Dashti of supplying nearly 1.5 kg of heroin in two transactions, which appears to be a reference to the three Form 1 drug offences, as, of themselves, constituting “quite serious, indeed very serious criminality”. These remarks indicate that his Honour considered that the offending conduct overall was very serious and certainly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	His Honour’s remarks make it reasonably clear that because of the comparability of Mr Dashti’s role with that of AB, Mr Dashti’s offending in relation to the opium charge should also be seen at about the mid-range of seriousness. His Honour also said that, with respect to the methamphetamine, Mr Dashti “could fairly be called ‘the principal’, although I think that AB was his high-level and greatly trusted lieutenant”. This exposes his Honour’s reasoning to the conclusion that, upon consideration of objective gravity alone, Mr Dashti’s offending was to be seen at above the mid-range in respect of this drug also.
	
	
	At the conclusion of his remarks in respect of AB, which were delivered orally, his Honour referred to the “standard non-parole period as a marker or guide of the seriousness with which Parliament views this matter but the prisoner has of course pleaded guilty”. Those remarks were his Honour’s only reference to the standard non-parole period in his remarks in respect of AB or Mr Dashti. However, as his Honour immediately continued with the sentence in respect of Mr Dashti, it is reasonable to infer that his Honour was at least aware that a standard non-parole period was prescribed for the s 25(2) offences with which Mr Dashti was charged and that he was required to take it into account.
	
	
	With respect to the requirements of s 54B(4) and (5), his Honour did not spell out in a structured and directed way the reasons why he would have reduced the non-parole period below the standard of 15 years for the indicative sentences.
	
	
	Nonetheless, although the remarks are not structured in a way which clearly isolates in one place his Honour’s reasons for finding where Mr Dashti’s activities in respect of each charge placed him on the scale of seriousness, it is possible to glean from a reading of the remarks in relation to both offenders how his Honour arrived at his view. In addition, to the extent that it is appropriate to refer to the transcript to understand his Honour’s reasoning, he had commented, during the submissions being made on behalf of AB, that Mr Dashti “is well above mid-range”, which confirms that was the approach his Honour took to the objective seriousness of Mr Dashti’s offending conduct.
	
	
	His Honour’s placement of Mr Dashti’s two offences at or above the mid-range of seriousness would attract the standard non-parole period for each of the indicative sentences. His Honour’s reasons were required, therefore, to disclose why he departed from the standard. Again, although not collected in one place or explicitly made referable to subs (4) and (5) of s 54B, his Honour’s remarks identify discounts and subjective factors which, on a fair reading, are to be understood as his reasons for indicating non-parole periods below the standard in relation to both the opium and the methamphetamine counts.
	
	
	It follows that we would also dismiss this aspect of ground 2.
	


Ground 3: special circumstances


	
	By ground 3, the Crown contended that his Honour erred in respect of his finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In finding special circumstances, his Honour took into account that it was Mr Dashti’s first time in prison and that he was socially isolated and lonely, having little English and being estranged from his wife and children.
	
	
	The Crown challenged each aspect of his Honour’s finding.
	
	
	As to the first component, the Crown submitted that the fact that it was Mr Dashti’s first time in custody was not alone a basis for finding special circumstances: R v Wood [2014] NSWCCA 184; 244 A Crim R 501 at [44]. The Crown further submitted that the evidence did not establish the second component of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances, that of social isolation. In respect to the finding as to Mr Dashti’s English language skills, in particular, it pointed to a psychological report of Ms Robillard tendered in evidence on the sentence hearing, which stated that Mr Dashti “had no obvious difficulty expressing himself in English”.
	
	
	In the alternative, the Crown contended that even if it was open to his Honour to find special circumstances, the circumstances did not warrant the variation of the statutory ratio to the extent that occurred. In this regard, it was contended that an 8 year period of parole was excessive.
	
	
	Mr Dashti contended that the finding of special circumstances was open on the evidence, particularly in circumstances in which the Crown did not respond at trial to his submissions that a finding of special circumstances ought to be made. He contended that this Court on appeal will “not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea”: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [81].
	
	
	In further response, Mr Dashti contended that there was no error in a sentencing judge taking into account, along with other matters, the fact that this would be the first occasion he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Mr Dashti also submitted that the primary judge’s finding in respect of Mr Dashti’s language skills was open, in circumstances where there had had been an extensive opportunity to observe him in the witness box.
	


Consideration of ground 3


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 44(1) requires the court, unless imposing an aggregate sentence, when sentencing an offender, first to set a non-parole period. Subsection (1) describes the non-parole period as being “the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence”.
	
	
	Section 44(2) provides that the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless there are special circumstances. If the court makes a finding of special circumstances, it must make a record of its reasons. Subsections (2A), (2B) and (2C) make like provision where the court imposes an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [73], Spigelman CJ described the process involved in finding special circumstances:
	


“The decision is first one of fact – to identify the circumstances – and, secondly, one of judgment – to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence.”


	
	There is no statutory definition of “special circumstances”. However, as the authorities explain, a finding of special circumstances is integrally linked with the determination of an appropriate non-parole period, being “the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence”. In Simpson, Spigelman CJ stated:
	


“62   The issues of law that may arise are the same as those which arise on appeal from other discretionary decisions, including whether or not, on the facts of a particular case, a specific fact, matter or circumstance is, either alone or in combination with other facts, matters and circumstances, capable of constituting ‘special circumstances’ of the requisite character, that is, that it is capable of justifying a variation in the statutory proportion which the legislature has enacted.

63   More significantly, there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.”


	
	Earlier, at [57], the Chief Justice had observed:
	


“… the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of ‘special circumstances’ must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole.”


	
	The Chief Justice accepted, at [58], that consideration of “the desirability of a longer than computed period of supervision” so as to assist or promote an offender’s rehabilitation, will be an appropriate approach in many cases. However, it was not the only perspective to be considered in determining whether to make a finding of special circumstances. The Chief Justice pointed out, at [65], that the exercise of the discretion to depart from the statutory ratio is limited both by the need to find “special circumstances”, and by:
	


“… the need to ensure that the time an offender must spend in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender – including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence – operates to confine the proper range for the exercise of the discretion.”


	
	The Chief Justice, also at [73], referred to the restraint on appellate intervention when a challenge was made to the adjustment made for special circumstances:
	


“There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.”


	
	These principles are well established and were most recently confirmed in AC v R [2016] NSWCCA 107.
	
	
	Thus, a very wide range of factors are capable of constituting special circumstances, although the particular circumstance must be “sufficiently special” to justify a departure from the statutory ratio in a particular case: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22].
	
	
	In Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213, McClellan CJ at CL (R A Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing) expressed doubt that the fact of being in custody for the first time was capable of constituting special circumstances. As his Honour stated, at [36]:
	


“The fact that a person has no previous criminal record and, accordingly, has not previously been incarcerated is a matter relevant to the total sentence and non-parole period. However, it is unlikely to be a circumstance warranting further leniency to an offender by a reduction in the term of the non-parole period: R v Fidow … at [18] (Spigelman CJ). Many persons who are sentenced will receive a sentence of imprisonment for the first time. That fact alone is unlikely to justify a finding that the offender's circumstances are special.”


	
	In R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [200] R A Hulme J (Leeming JA and Johnson J agreeing), after referring to cases raising doubts about the soundness of findings of special circumstances based on the fact that a person will be in custody for the first time, held that there had been no error in the making of such a finding in circumstances in which there was another more significant basis for it, namely, the need for a lengthier non-parole period for treatment purposes.
	
	
	The authorities establish, therefore, that a finding of special circumstances based upon it being the offender’s first time in custody will ordinarily bear little if any weight unless the finding of special circumstances can be supported by other factors.
	
	
	His Honour’s finding as to special circumstances has been set out above at [28]. In our opinion, there was no error in his Honour taking into account that it was Mr Dashti’s first time in prison in circumstances where there were other factors that were relevant to, and would impact upon, his imprisonment, including loneliness and social isolation due to his language difficulties and his estrangement from his wife and children. Nor has it been shown that his Honour erred in taking into account Mr Dashti’s language difficulties. His Honour was able to observe Mr Dashti in court and was entitled to come to his own conclusion, notwithstanding Ms Robillard’s opinion expressed in her report that he was able to adequately express himself.
	
	
	Accordingly, we have concluded that there was no error in his Honour’s finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	That leaves for resolution the Crown’s alternative submission that, even if there was no error in his Honour making a finding of special circumstances, there was an error in the ratio of the non-parole period of 12 years imprisonment to the parole period of 8 years. That submission raises for consideration the adequacy of the non-parole period, with which we deal below in connection with ground 4.
	


Ground 4: manifest inadequacy


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 53A(1) provides that when a court is sentencing an offender for more than one offence, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any two or more of the offences may be imposed instead of a separate sentence of imprisonment for each offence. The court is required, pursuant to s 53A(2), to record the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed and to state the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. In common with certain other provisions of the Act, an aggregate sentence is not invalidated by failure to comply with the section: see s 53A(5).
	
	
	As stated above, Madgwick QC ADCJ sentenced Mr Dashti to an aggregate sentence of 20 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years. His Honour, in his sentencing remarks, as required by s 53A(2)(b), specified the indicative head sentences that he would have imposed had he sentenced Mr Dashti in respect of each offence: see above at [30].
	
	
	His Honour determined that the sentences should be fully concurrent, finding that they reflected Mr Dashti presenting “a composite persona of a go-to man for a number of drugs at wholesale level”.
	
	
	His Honour did not specify a non-parole period in respect of each offence.
	
	
	A claim of manifest inadequacy does not depend on the establishment of specific error: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6], but the identification of error may assist to explain why a sentence is manifestly inadequate:  R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81 at [46]. In that regard, the Crown pointed to the errors alleged in grounds 1-3, as well as two additional matters in support of its contention that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The first additional matter was that the 15 per cent discount given for Mr Dashti’s guilty plea was excessive in circumstances where Mr Dashti challenged various factual matters for which the Crown had contended on the plea, resulting in a lengthy sentencing hearing of over 10 sitting days. It was submitted that in circumstances where the factual matters were determined adversely to Mr Dashti, the utilitarian value of the plea had effectively dissipated by the time the sentencing hearing was complete.
	
	
	The Crown had submitted to his Honour that an appropriate discount for the plea would be 10 per cent. Mr Dashti had contended that a discount of 25 per cent was appropriate. He also sought a discount for providing assistance to the authorities, which was not accepted by His Honour. On the appeal, Mr Dashti submitted that, in circumstances where his plea saved a 6 week trial and avoided the need to play thousands of telephone calls and other surveillance records, there was a strong utilitarian value in the plea. The Court also notes that there must be factored into the hearing time the fact that AB and RH were sentenced in the same proceedings.
	
	
	The second additional matter upon which the Crown relied was his Honour’s determination that the sentences imposed should be fully concurrent. The Crown contended that there were distinct aspects of criminality as between the offences relating to the drugs found in Sydney and those found in Western Australia which warranted some accumulation. The Crown also alleged that error was demonstrated by the fact that the aggregate head sentence was the same as the indicative head sentence for the methylamphetamine supply offence alone, such that there was no meaningful punishment for the other offences.
	
	
	Mr Dashti contended that there was no error in the sentence imposed by his Honour. He submitted that Madgwick QC ADCJ’s remarks made it clear that he had fully considered the totality of Mr Dashti’s offending, and had imposed an appropriate aggregate sentence. Mr Dashti accepted that the sentence imposed was lenient, but contended that having regard to questions of parity with AB, it was not “plainly unjust”. He also pointed to the importance of judicial restraint in Crown appeals against sentence, and to the importance of the sentencing judge’s discretion in order to achieve individualised justice: R v Latouff (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1996).
	


Consideration of ground 4


	
	Although we consider that there was error in his Honour’s sentencing approach as established by ground 1 and partially in respect of ground 2, it is appropriate to consider the two additional errors upon which the Crown relied in support of ground 4.
	


The discount for the plea


	
	We do not consider there was any error in the discount allowed for the plea of guilty. The extent of any discount is essentially one for the sentencing judge and there was no challenge to the fact that there was a utilitarian benefit in the plea. Although Mr Dashti mounted a significant challenge to many of the facts upon which the Crown sought to have him sentenced, the reality was that there was a saving of approximately four weeks of court time with the consequent saving in time and expenditure of public monies.
	
	
	Furthermore, it is necessary to take into account that, contrary to the Crown’s submission, the factual matters disputed before his Honour were not all determined adversely to Mr Dashti. In particular, his Honour did not find that Mr Dashti was the sole principal in respect of the opium supply, as the Crown had alleged.
	


Concurrence or accumulation


	
	The question whether the punishment imposed for two or more offences should be concurrent or cumulative arises in the context where, in accordance with settled principle, a court is required to pass or indicate a sentence in respect of each offence. In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, the plurality, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ, observed at [47] that, if proper principle was not applied in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, “orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation”. At [48], their Honours held:
	


“… the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences.” (citation omitted)


	
	The underlying principle is one of totality. In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41. Howie J, with whom Adams and Price JJ relevantly agreed, explained, at [27]:
	


“[T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	Questions of concurrence or accumulation are relevant to the imposition of an aggregate sentence, notwithstanding that a single sentence is imposed in respect of all charges of which the offender has been convicted. That this is so is apparent from the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 53A(2) which requires the court to specify the indicative sentence that would have been imposed if the offender were sentenced in respect of each offence. As McClellan CJ at CL observed in R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [32], a sentencing judge is accordingly required:
	


“… to give consideration to the criminality involved in each offence and, where appropriate, have regard to any matters on a Form 1 when defining the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence.”


	
	The manner in which the charges were brought against Mr Dashti made this a difficult sentencing exercise, insofar as questions of concurrence and accumulation were concerned. Count 5 on the indictment was the agreement to supply 2 kg of heroin. Mr Dashti had proposed to source most of that heroin from the supply that was kept in one of the two Artarmon storage facilities. Count 7 on the indictment related to the supply of 49.85 kg of opium, all of which was stored in one or other of the two Artarmon storage facilities. Count 8 on the indictment related to the supply of 47.56 kg of methylamphetamine, which was stored in part at the Artarmon storage facility and in part in the storage facility in Perth.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions drew attention to the fact that there was no accumulation of sentences for the distinct aspects of the criminality as between Sydney and Western Australia. Presumably, what lay behind this submission was that the supply of the methylamphetamine was to be distinguished from the supply of the opium, as there was a separate and distinct activity involved in arranging for the 18.164 kg of methylamphetamine found in the Perth storage facility to be transported from the Artarmon storage facility, that quantity being added to the quantity found in the Artarmon storage unit for the purposes of count 8.
	
	
	The three offences of which Mr Dashti was convicted each involved distinct aspects of offending. The agreement to supply was distinct from the supply offences. The offence of supply opium was distinct from the supply methylamphetamine offence, at least to the extent that distinct arrangements were made in respect of the drugs in Perth. Accordingly, it would have been open to his Honour to partially accumulate the sentences.
	
	
	His Honour recognised that it was an unusual approach to conclude that there should be concurrency in respect of the three offences. The fact that the approach was unusual is not sufficient to indicate error. Given the discretion conferred in respect of this aspect of sentencing, we have concluded that no error has been demonstrated in his Honour treating Mr Dashti as, in effect, carrying on the one, substantial drug supply business, and that in that context he was the “go-to man” for the supply of drugs.
	
	
	However, as we explain, the failure to demonstrate error in that finding does not answer the question whether the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	


Manifest inadequacy


	
	As we have indicated, it appears that his Honour considered that Mr Dashti’s offending conduct was above the mid-range of objective seriousness. In our opinion, no other finding could have been made, having regard to the very large quantities of drugs involved and Mr Dashti’s role in the supply of those drugs. In that regard, it is relevant to note that the heroin, opium and methylamphetamine subject of the charged offences were respectively approximately two, twelve and ninety-five times the thresholds for large commercial quantities specified in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, Sch 1. It was in the context of that assessment of objective seriousness that regard was to be had to the maximum sentence for the offences, namely, life imprisonment, and to the standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	Further, as his Honour observed, there were few mitigating circumstances in Mr Dashti’s case. He was found to be an untruthful witness and his Honour did not place weight on his statements of remorse. As his Honour found:
	


“I think the best could be said for him … is that he had a hard life and physical disability that disqualified him for various fields of work that he was fit for in Australia and that he turned to drug dealing.”


	
	In imposing sentence, his Honour also had to have regard to the fact that in addition to the three principal offences of which he was convicted, it was necessary to take into consideration the five Form 1 offences. His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, made specific reference to each of the offences and expressly stated that he would take those matters into account. However, the sentence imposed is such that it must be concluded that his Honour did not do so adequately, if at all.
	
	
	The proper approach to Form 1 offences in sentencing was considered by Spigelman CJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed, in the guideline judgment Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. His Honour summarised the position as follows:
	


“42   The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.

43   … The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence.”

See also Alrubae v R [2016] NSWCCA 142 at [40]; Abdulrahman v R [2016] NSWCCA 192 at [53].


	
	Two of the Form 1 offences were drug offences involving 993 g and 469.7 g of heroin, respectively, each of which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The third Form 1 offence involved 154 g of heroin and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years. The fourth and fifth offences were of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime, being sums of $210,000 and $540,000. The maximum penalty for each of those offences was 15 years.
	
	
	The quantities of drugs and the amounts of cash involved in the Form 1 offences were substantial and the criminality involved was less objectively serious than the principal offences only by reason of the quantity of the drugs. His Honour recognised this in describing the Form 1 offences of supply of nearly 1.5 kg of heroin as constituting “quite serious, indeed very serious criminality”.
	
	
	It will be necessary, in resentencing Mr Dashti, to impose a longer sentence having regard to the Form 1 offences than would otherwise be the case, notwithstanding that the primary offences were already very serious.
	
	
	There is then the question as to whether, although his Honour did not err in making a finding of special circumstances on the basis of Mr Dashti’s poor language skills and isolation, he erred in the extent to which he departed from the statutory ratio such that, overall, the non-parole period was manifestly inadequate. The non-parole period imposed by his Honour was 12 years. Pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a finding of special circumstances was necessary to impose a remainder of sentence of greater than four years, being one-third of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The remainder of sentence imposed by his Honour was twice that long. That is a very substantial departure from the statutory ratio and it was based on what is, on any view, a relatively minimal finding of special circumstances, especially where his Honour did not find that Mr Dashti’s rehabilitation required a longer period on parole. We consider that that is also indicative of error.
	
	
	In considering the question of manifest inadequacy, we acknowledge that his Honour was concerned with the question of parity with AB. AB was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. The charges against AB, which included one offence of supply methylamphetamine and one offence of supply opium and Form 1 offences relating to the proceeds of crime, were less than those against Mr Dashti, albeit still very serious.
	
	
	Further, AB’s mitigating factors, which included an addiction to opium, were stronger than Mr Dashti’s; his role in respect of the methylamphetamine was held to be less than that of Mr Dashti; the value of his assistance to authorities was held to be “pretty high”; and he suffered from being in protection in prison: see above at [21]. Given those matters, the question of parity with AB’s sentence should have played little part in the sentencing of Mr Dashti.
	


Comparative cases


	
	The Court was provided with a list of cases indicating the range of sentences that have been imposed for offences for the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. In some cases there were additional counts of dealing with the proceeds of crime or receiving stolen property or offences on a Form 1. Most of the cases were assessed as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness or moderately or just above the mid-range.
	
	
	Only one of the cases to which the Court was referred, namely, R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287; 142 A Crim R 101 involved a quantity of drugs anywhere near the quantities involved in Mr Dashti’s offences. The accused in Shepherd was charged with the importation of not less than the commercial quantity of ecstasy, being 34 kg, contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The offender had been found to be a key figure in facilitating the importation of the drug. This Court resentenced the offender and imposed a sentence of 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months. The sentence included a reduction of 45 per cent for a plea of guilty and for past and future assistance. The Court stated, as required by the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 21E, that the sentence that would have been imposed but for the undertaking to give future assistance was 16 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 9 months.
	
	
	The extent of Mr Dashti’s offending is far in excess of the offending in the case of Shepherd in respect of the quantity of drug involved, if nothing else. Further, it is necessary to keep in mind the 45 per cent reduction in the sentence imposed in Shepherd given for the plea and for past and future assistance.
	
	
	Regard may also be had to two further decisions: Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58 and Vigo v R [2009] NSWCCA 98.
	
	
	In Barbaro, the appellants were convicted of offences against the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), being one count relating to 1.4 tonnes of ecstasy, one count relating to a further 50 kg and one count relating to 100 kg of cocaine. The total wholesale value of the drugs was in the hundreds of millions of dollars and the profit value sought from trafficking the drugs was many millions of dollars.
	
	
	A life sentence with a non-parole period of 30 years was imposed on the appellant Barbaro, who was described as being at the “apex”, as the trial judge put it, at “the very top of the tree in this country”: Barbaro v The Queen [2010] VSCA 288; 226 A Crim R 354 at [44]. The other offender, Zirilli, was found to have less involvement than Barbaro, being described, at [44], as Barbaro’s “right-hand man and trusted lieutenant”, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 26 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. Both appellants had pleaded guilty, however, having been charged with offences governed by the Crimes Act there was no reference to the extent to which the plea of guilty had been taken into account.
	
	
	In Vigo, the appellant was convicted of supplying in excess of 40 kg of methylamphetamine over a four year period, contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s 25(2). He was sentenced to a total term of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. The offence was said, at [12], to be “in a category of most serious instances of drug trafficking”. The appellant had been found guilty after a trial and the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation were assessed as not being good. There was a finding of special circumstances, to take into account the effect of incarceration on the offender’s children and his marriage.
	
	
	The offending in Vigo was less serious than that in the present matter, involving approximately half the quantity of methylamphetamine. There was also only one offence charged and there were no Form 1 matters to be taken into account. Nor was there any question of parity to be considered. As is apparent the non-parole period imposed in Vigo was the same as that imposed on Mr Dashti.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that these cases provide some assistance, the question for this Court is whether the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate. That determination is to be approached by reference to the objective seriousness of the offences, the significance of the Form 1 matters, the substantial departure from the statutory non-parole ratio in his Honour’s sentence and the relative absence of mitigating factors. Having regard to those factors, we have concluded that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour, including both the non-parole period and the overall term, were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Ground 4 of the appeal is allowed.
	


The residual discretion


	
	The Court, having found error in the House v The King sense, retains a residual discretion to dismiss the appeal. A primary consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the purpose of s 5D appeals. As noted above, that purpose is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts. In Green at [36], the majority said that:
	


“That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.”


	
	At [42], the majority further commented that:
	


“A case might arise in which the Court of Criminal Appeal concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to ‘an affront to the administration of justice’ which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case the Court would be justified in interfering with the sentence …”


	
	The Crown submitted that the errors alleged in ground 1, the use of sequential reasoning, and ground 3, a finding of special circumstances which was not supported on the evidence and an excessive adjustment of the ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term, raised points on which this Court should lay down guiding principles.
	
	
	Before determining whether this is an appropriate case to resentence, it is necessary to note the Crown’s acknowledgement that there was a delay in the lodging of the appeal between the handing down of sentence on 4 December 2015 and the lodging of the appeal on 19 February 2016. However, contrary to Mr Dashti’s submission, the Crown contended that, while delay may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion, the 28 day time limit for bringing an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 10 does not apply to Crown sentence appeals. That submission may be accepted: see R v Ohar [2004] NSWCCA 83; 59 NSWLR 596 at [62].
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the delay was not prejudicial to the respondent such that it should not lead to Court to exercise the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal: R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80. In particular, the Crown pointed to the circumstance that Mr Dashti’s non-parole period was not to expire until February 2024, such that he faces a considerable period in custody regardless of the outcome of the appeal. The Crown also pointed out that the delay did not result in a later hearing date for the appeal than would have otherwise been the case, because it joined the 8 June 2016 hearing date which had already been set down for the other matters heard on that day. These submissions should also be accepted.
	
	
	This is not an appropriate case in which to exercise the residual discretion. Although the principles underlying grounds 1 and 2 upon which the Crown has succeeded are well established, the very fact of the errors made by the sentencing judge suggests the need to reinforce those sentencing principles. Further, this is a clear case in which the manifest inadequacy of the sentence is so marked as to amount to an affront to the administration of justice: Green at [42]. As his Honour recognised, Mr Dashti was conducting, with apparent impunity, a very large criminal enterprise, storing his ‘product’, very large quantities of prohibited drugs, in a number of easily accessible suburban commercial storage units. There can be no question that the sentence imposed was so inadequate as to constitute such an affront.
	


Resentencing


	
	The circumstances relevant to Mr Dashti’s sentence have been set out above and Mr Dashti did not rely on any updating material should this Court decide to resentence him. Accordingly, our reasons for the sentence we consider ought to be imposed may be expressed more briefly than would otherwise be the case.
	
	
	Reference has already been made to the relevance of the sentence imposed on AB in so far as parity considerations are concerned. There is also a question as to whether the sentences imposed on Mr Zolfonoon and RH, which were handed down after the sentence imposed on Mr Dashti, raise questions of parity.
	
	
	There is no bar in principle to the application of parity considerations as between offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise but who have committed different crimes: Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [202] per Campbell JA. However, practical difficulties frequently arise by reason of co-offenders being charged with different offences as the sentencing considerations relating, in particular, to the objective seriousness of the offending, will differ in such cases from one offender to another. Further, the “legislative guide posts” of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period, if applicable, may be different.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to examine the question of parity in any detail, particularly given that the only question of parity to which reference was made on the appeal related to the sentence imposed on AB. We have already expressed our view on that question. To the extent that parity with the sentences imposed on Mr Zolfonoon and RH are relevant, there were substantial differences between the objective criminality of the offences of which Mr Dashti was charged and those with which Mr Zolfonoon and RH were charged, different circumstances in which they were committed and significantly different quantities of drug involved.
	
	
	In determining the appropriate aggregate and indicative sentences, regard has been had to the objective seriousness of the offences to which Mr Dashti pleaded guilty, which as we have stated, was substantially above the mid-range of objective seriousness. The Form 1 offences which are to be taken into account were also serious offences, as his Honour recognised. We have also had regard to the mitigating circumstances in favour of Mr Dashti, although they were not significant. The trial judge placed little weight on his expressions of remorse and nothing was advanced on the appeal to suggest that any other view ought to be taken in this regard. We accept that the 15 per cent discount for his plea of guilty is appropriate.
	
	
	Although we do not consider that his Honour erred in making a finding of special circumstances, we consider that the circumstances do not warrant any adjustment of the statutory ratio, having regard to the length of the sentence we propose to impose.
	
	
	Whilst we have accepted that the Crown has not demonstrated error in his Honour imposing concurrent indicative sentences, that is not an approach that has commended itself on resentence. There should be a partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the very substantial and independent offending involved in each of the three charges.
	
	
	In accordance with s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the indicative sentences for the individual offences are as follows:
	



	
	for the agreement to supply 2 kg of heroin, taking into account the Form 1 offence of the supply of 154.4 g of heroin, 10 years and 6 months non-parole period with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months;
	
	
	for the supply of 49.85 kg of opium, taking into account the Form 1 offences of supplying 993 g and 469 g of heroin and knowingly dealing with $210,000, being the proceeds of crime, 17 years and 6 months non-parole period with a balance of term of 5 years and 10 months;
	
	
	for the supply of 47.56 kg of methylamphetamine, taking into account the Form 1 offence of knowingly dealing with $540,200, being proceeds of crime, 20 years non-parole period with a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months.
	



	
	We have determined that the appropriate aggregate sentence is imprisonment for a non-parole period of 21 years and 6 months commencing on 9 February 2012 and a balance of term of 7 years and 2 months.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders of the Court are as follows:
	


(1)   Allow the appeal;

(2)   Quash the sentence imposed on Mr Dashti on 4 December 2015 and in its place impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment comprising of a non-parole period of 21 years 6 months to commence on 9 February 2012 and to expire on 8 August 2033, with a balance of term of 7 years and 2 months to commence on 9 August 2033 and expire on 8 October 2040.

		10 November 2016",2016-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2881580,R v Carbone [2016] NSWSC 1591,"Judgment


	
	The Accused is charged with murdering Bradley Dillon on 11 August 2014. The Crown now seeks to lead hearsay evidence of a witness Kale Turner on the basis that Kale Turner is not available to give evidence. A Notice under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) was given on 1 November 2016.
	
	
	The evidence sought to be adduced is contained in a statement made by Mr Turner to the NSW Crime Commission on 25 May 2015. As paragraph 5 of the statement makes clear the statement was an induced statement made after police investigating the deceased's death attended at Mr Turner's unit to enquire about his knowledge of the deceased's murder. It has been agreed between the Crown and those acting for the Accused that much of the material contained in the statement will not be adduced. The material sought to be adduced consists of some background information showing how Mr Turner came to meet the Accused. This happened by virtue of their membership at a Fight Gym called “St Michael’s Christian Fight Club” in Petersham or Lewisham. Mr Turner knew the accused as Beaver although he also knew his correct first name was Diego. On the apparently few occasions on which Mr Turner met or saw the Accused it was through a mutual friend with whom Mr Turner shared a flat called Tom Sayer.
	
	
	The particular evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce is as follows:
	


37.   I don't remember the exact date but it was either the same night as the murder of Dillon or the night or two after, …

39.   Either Tom or I received another call from Beaver. I can't remember if Beaver spoke to me or Tom but he said, ""It’s Beaver. It's Important I'll be at your in 10 mins (sic). Can I come past?"" I agreed. Beaver sounded normal.

…

40.   Not long after within minutes, the door buzzer started ringing. Our unit was on level nine. It was Beaver on the intercom from the front security door.

He said, ""Do youse have money? Come down you have to pay for the cab."" Tom went down. Next thing, I heard both Beaver and Tom getting out of the lift on our level and they walked into the unit.

41.   As soon as Beaver walked in he said, ""Some hectic shit went down. We fucked this guy up. We were in a fight with a guy from school. I was into it with this guy. [Tones] comes in and shot him."" Beaver always referred to Tony [Tony Bang] as 'Tones,'

I was shocked and said, ""Where did this happen?""

Beaver said, ""Leichhardt.""

I said, ""Where is Tony?""

He said, ""Tony has left the country.""

I said, ""What the hell are you still doing here?""

He said, ""I'm planning to go overseas as well. Come I'll show ya on the news.""

He picked our Foxtel remote and was trying to show us the news item but he couldn't.

42.   Bever (sic) said, “Tones said I might be able to get money off you guys. He’s gone overseas.” Bever (sic) was sounding erratic. We did not ask him why he wanted cash and we assumed that he needed the cash to get away


	
	The remainder of the evidence sought to be adduced concerns Mr Turner and his flatmate Tom giving the Accused about $1,500 or $1,800 that they had in the house.
	
	
	Section 65 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
	


65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(1)   This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2)   The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a)   was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or

(b)   was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or

(c)   was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or

(d)   was:

(i)   against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii)   made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.


	
	Clause 4 of the Dictionary sets out the situations where a person is taken not to be available to give evidence as follows:
	


4 Unavailability of persons

(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:

(a)   the person is dead, or

(b)   the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence, or

(c)   the person is mentally or physically unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practicable to overcome that inability, or

(d)   it would be unlawful for the person to give the evidence, or

(e)   a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or

(f)   all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success, or

(g)   all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.

(2)   In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.


	
	The s 67 Notice seeks to rely on s 65(2)(d). The Crown submitted that the representation was against the interest of Mr Turner because it tended:
	


To damage the person’s reputation; Mr Turner discloses his use of drugs, association with St Michael’s Fight Club and involvement in criminal activities;

To show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted; Mr Turner admits to participating in the supply of drugs. The statement also refers to and discloses knowledge of the murder of Bradley Dillon, which would constitute the offence of Concealing a Serious Indictable Offence.


	
	The Crown submitted that Mr Turner was not available because:
	


(f)   All reasonable steps had been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success.


	
	The Accused opposes the admission of the evidence.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Crown to establish:
	


(a)   That Mr Turner is not available to give evidence within the meaning of clause 4 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act; and

(b)   That the provisions of s 65(2)(d) have been made out.

Unavailability of the witness


	
	There is a statement from Senior Constable Marie Sawtell from the Queensland Police Service. She said that on 24 October 2016 she attended at an unnamed address and spoke to two persons who said that they were Mr Turner’s parents. Her statement said that she asked them of the whereabouts of Mr Turner. The statement then goes on to say:
	


[The mother] stated to me that Kael (sic) is overseas but would not disclose his location, Kale has received an email from NSW police but will not respond to it as he and his family are of the belief that because he gave evidence to the crime commission he was further told he did not have to give any further evidence.

Kael (sic) has apparently been contacted by persons involved in the court matter being a murder and although no direct threats have been made they have made it clear they know where he lives and where his family are - these persons have approached Kael (sic) as they want to know what he has said to the crime commission. After this Kael (sic) has left the country leaving the family in turn quite fearful of any retribution that may occur.


	
	An email from the Officer in Charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Hunt, to the DPP disclosed that investigations with the Immigration Department showed that Mr Turner had departed Australia on 11 June 2015 and had not returned. That was consistent with information obtained from an estate agent that Mr Turner and his girlfriend had moved out of premises they were renting in about June 2015.
	
	
	Email addresses were obtained for Mr Turner and his girlfriend and on 19 October 2016 another officer of the Homicide Squad sent an email to Mr Turner informing him that the trial was due to commence on 7 November, that it was believed Mr Turner might be residing in the United Kingdom, that he was required to give evidence and that arrangements could be made to do this via AVL. The officer asked for Mr Turner to contact her at his earliest convenience.
	
	
	Mr Turner replied by email on 28 October 2016 and said this:
	


Unfortunately I won’t be able to assist on this. I’ve been trying for quite some time now to break all ties with everyone from that gym and my involvement now would only cause my family and I significant stress and concern. Because of this I will not be of any value to the case. I really hope you can please understand.


	
	Detective Hunt gave evidence before me on the application. His evidence was that he first found out two weeks ago that Mr Turner had left Australia in June 2015. He understands that Mr Turner is travelling around Europe but he does not know where he is. He has no address for him.
	
	
	Although, in the first instance, it might be thought that making attempts to have a witness attend to give evidence some two or three weeks before a trial does not demonstrate that all reasonable steps have been taken, the circumstances of Mr Turner’s whereabouts must be considered. Even if the Crown had sought some months earlier to locate Mr Turner and make arrangements for him to give evidence, whether by AVL, or by being brought home to do so, it seems clear that the outcome would have been the same as it now is. Mr Turner appears not to want to give evidence and will not co-operate to enable that to occur.
	
	
	A similar situation arose in R v Kazzi; R v Williams; R v Murchie [2003] NSWCCA 241; 140 A Crim R 545. That was an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the decision by the trial judge refusing to admit the evidence of a statement by a Mr Gujral who was unable to be found. It seemed that Mr Gujral was somewhere in India and, although the police made extensive inquiries about his whereabouts within Australia, they did not make enquiries about his whereabouts in India.
	
	
	Justice Ipp (Grove and Dowd JJ agreeing) said:
	


[10]   On behalf of the respondents, it was forcefully submitted that the police had been neglectful in only commencing their inquiries on 26 July 2003. The trial commenced on 5 August 2003 and, as I have pointed out, Mr Gujral had left Australia nearly two years before that date.

[11]   I accept the submission that the police should have commenced making their inquiries at a far earlier date, particularly having regard to the fact that the case was listed for trial last year. However, any inquiries made by the police at a time earlier than August 2001, as regards Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in Australia, would have proved to be fruitless.

[12]   The information as to Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in India is non-existent. It is not even known in which city he resides. It would have been a lengthy and expensive task for the police to make appropriate inquiries as to his whereabouts in that country. In my view it was not incumbent on the police to make inquiries in India. I do not mean to suggest, in expressing this view, that the police would never be required to attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of a witness, once it was learned that that witness was in another country. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, where nothing was known as to the individual’s address or business or family, and where the country concerned was as large and as populous as India, I think it is understandable that the police did nothing more.

[13]   Thus, in my opinion, the delay on the part of the police in making inquiries does not constitute a failure to take reasonable steps within the meaning of cl 4(1) of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act.


	
	In circumstances where it seems only to be speculated where Mr Turner is or was at any given time, the Crown does not fail by showing that all reasonable steps have not been taken notwithstanding the fairly recent commencement of their enquiries.
	


Is s 65(2)(d) satisfied?


	
	Section 65(2)(d) has recently been considered by the High Court in Sio v The Queen [2016] HCA 32; (2016) 90 ALJR 963. The Court there stressed that a compendious approach to the evidence sought to be adduced does not conform to the requirements of the Act. Attention needs to be given to each relevant fact sought to be proved by tendering the evidence under s 65. The Court said:
	


[56]   It may also be noted here that s 65(2)(b) makes it clear that when the provisions with which it is collocated speak of ""a representation"", they are speaking of the particular representation that asserts a relevant fact sought to be proved. That this is so is confirmed by s 65(2)(d)(i), which requires that the representation tendered against the other party is able to be seen to be against the interest of the maker of the statement.

[57]   It can be seen that the application of s 65(2) proceeds upon the assumption that a party is seeking to prove a particular fact relevant to an issue in the case. It then requires the identification of the particular representation to be adduced in evidence as proof of that fact. The circumstances in which that representation was made may then be considered in order to determine whether the conditions of admissibility are met. This process must be observed in relation to each relevant fact sought to be proved by tendering evidence under s 65.

[58]   It is apparent in the present case that neither the trial judge nor the Court of Criminal Appeal considered any particular representation upon which the Crown sought to rely in this way; rather, the application of the provision was approached on a compendious basis whereby an overall impression was formed of the general reliability of the statements made by Mr Filihia and then all his statements were held to be admissible against Mr Sio. That compendious approach does not conform to the requirements of the Act.

…

[60]   It is no light thing to admit a hearsay statement inculpating an accused. Where s 65 is successfully invoked by the prosecution, the accused will have no opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the statement with a view to undermining the inculpatory assertion. Further in this regard, the present case is a case in which, had Mr Filihia pleaded not guilty, and he and Mr Sio been tried together, Mr Filihia's hearsay statements would not have been admissible in that trial against Mr Sio. That is because s 83 of the Evidence Act preserves the exclusionary operation of the hearsay rule in respect of evidence of an admission by a co-accused.

[61]   The serious consequences of the successful invocation of s 65(2)(d) emphasise the need for compliance with the conditions of admissibility prescribed by the section. The focus demanded by the language of s 65 is inconsistent with the impressionistic evaluation involved in the compendious approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The language of the statute assumes the identification of each material fact to be proved by a hearsay statement tendered in reliance on s 65 and the application of the section to that statement, whereas the compendious approach applied by the trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal is not focused in this way. In addition, the approach which is focused upon the particular representation tendered to prove a particular fact in issue has the associated benefit of being conducive to the preservation of clarity, good order and fairness in the conduct of criminal trials.

…

[63]   Section 65 gives effect to the view that the circumstances of the making of an out of court statement conveying an assertion of a relevant fact may be such as to indicate that the representation is likely to be reliable – and the asserted fact likely to be true – notwithstanding the hearsay character of the evidence. The section operates on the footing that the circumstances in which the representation was made may be seen to be such that ""the dangers which the rule seeks to prevent are not present or are negligible in the circumstances"". In such a case, ""there is no basis for a strict application of the rule.""

…

[72]   Section 65(2)(d)(ii) requires the making of an evaluation by the trial judge which positively satisfies the trial judge that the representation is likely to be reliable by reason of the circumstances in which it was made. As was noted in IMM v The Queen [[2016] HCA 14; (2016) 90 ALJR 529 at [54]], s 65(2)(c) and (d) and s 85 provide ""[t]he only occasion for a trial judge to consider the reliability of evidence, in connection with the admissibility of evidence"". It is desirable to emphasise, however, that the whole point of s 65(2)(d)(ii) is that, where the circumstances in which the statement is made are likely to ensure, as a practical matter, that the asserted fact truly occurred, the fairness of the trial does not require a positive judgment by the tribunal of fact about the reliability of the maker of the statement. Attention is directed by the language of s 65(2)(d) to an assessment of the circumstances in which the statement was made to establish its likely reliability, rather than to a general assessment of whether or not it is likely that the representor is a reliable witness. This is precisely because the representor will not be a witness at the trial.


	
	In the present case, the significant representations sought to be relied upon are those contained in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the statement. It is apparent that, when what is there set out in that statement is regarded separately, it cannot be said that the representation was against the interests of Mr Turner by reason of his involvement with drugs, the St Michael’s Fight Club or other involvement in criminal activities. There is simply nothing in the conversation recorded that relates to those matters. In any event, there is nothing in the statement which suggests any criminality or wrongdoing associated with the Club, nor is there anything else in the statement concerning wrongdoing on Mr Turner’s part except for his involvement with drugs.
	
	
	On the other hand, the statement suggests that, having received the information he did about the shooting of the “guy from school” Mr Turner did not, until he made the statement now sought to be adduced in evidence, take any action to report the involvement of the Accused or Tony in a serious indictable offence. Moreover, Mr Turner said that he assumed that the Accused wanted the money he asked for and was given “to get away”. That would make Mr Turner an accessory after the fact to the offence constituted by the shooting.
	
	
	I am satisfied, therefore, that the representation in paragraph 41 of the statement was made against the interests of Mr Turner at the time it was made. It is also necessary for the Crown to show that the representation was made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.
	
	
	Detective Baskar, who in 2015 was with the Homicide Squad, gave evidence about the making of the statement. He said that Mr Turner wanted to make an induced statement because of concern about his own involvement in drugs and his association with drug dealers. Detective Baskar said that Mr Turner had a criminal record but he did not know for what offences he had been convicted.
	
	
	The Crown points to other evidence in the brief of evidence to point to the reliability of the information provided. That evidence shows the presence of the accused at the scene including DNA evidence. It shows evidence of intended flight and other evidence of the money the accused had at the airport when he attempted to leave Australia. The Crown submits that what was said by Mr Turner in paragraphs 41 and 42, when he did not know about the DNA evidence or the finding of money on the Accused at the airport, is consistent with that other evidence and therefore points to its reliability.
	
	
	When viewed as a whole in that way there is some support for its reliability but as noted earlier the High Court said it is necessary to consider each particular representation relied upon. The most significant is what is contained in what Mr Turner asserts the Accused said in the first three lines of paragraph 41 which was this:
	


As soon as Beaver walked in he said, 'Some hectic shit went down. We fucked this guy up. We were in a fight with a guy from school. I was into it with this guy. Tones comes in and shot him'. Beaver always referred to Tony as Tones.

This will be relied upon by the Crown as evidence of involvement in a joint criminal enterprise. Other evidence that the accused was present or that his DNA was found in the places it was does not point to the reliability of those inculpatory statements.


	
	Further, the fact the statement was induced because of concerns by Mr Turner about his own position, his involvement with drugs, his assistance to the accused, and his failure to report a serious indictable offence, do not necessarily lead to a conclusion of reliability. Indeed the contrary may be true. In Sio the Court said at 65:
	


Evidence by an accomplice against his or her co-offender has long been recognised as less than inherently reliable precisely because of the perceived risk of falsification. Statements by an accomplice afford a classic example of a case where a “plan of falsification” may be expected to be formed, given the obvious interest of one co-offender to shift blame on to his or her accomplice especially where the circumstances also include the opportunity to seek to curry favour with the authorities. That the evidence of accomplices is evidence apt to be unreliable by reason of a motive to shift blame to the co-offender is recognised by s165(1)(d)of the Evidence Act which expressly treats it as “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable” evidence.

Although Mr Turner was not a co-offender he was to some extent an accomplice by what he did and failed to do after the accused spoke to him following the altercation with the deceased.


	
	There is certainly nothing in the timing of the making of the statement which points to reliability. It was not, as in Sio, so contemporaneous with the events that made it unlikely that the statement was a fabrication (as in s 65(2)(b)).
	
	
	I cannot be satisfied from the paucity of the evidence that the representation was made in circumstances that make it likely that it was reliable.
	
	
	Even if s 65(2)(d) had been satisfied it would be incumbent upon me to take into account the matters in s 192(2) and in particular paragraph (b) being the extent to which the right to rely on the statement would be unfair to the Accused. Coupled with that is the necessity of refusing the admission of evidence in s 137 if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused. The probative value is high but, for that very reason, the unfair prejudice to the Accused in not being able to test the evidence is significant. As the High Court said in Sio at [60]:
	


It is no light thing to admit a hearsay statement inculpating an accused. Where s 65 is successfully invoked by the prosecution, the accused will have no opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the statement with a view to undermining the inculpatory assertion.


	
	On one view there is a lower threshold of unfairness under s 192(2)(b) that is involved in the balancing exercise under s 137 which in any event concerns unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In any event two matters in particular satisfy me that unfair prejudice would be caused to the Accused by the admission of the statement. First, Mr Turner's credit would a significant issue, given his background and involvement with drug dealers, his behaviour after the post offence contact with the Accused, his criminal record and his knowledge asserted by the defence of the deceased's involvement with drugs.
	
	
	Secondly, and significantly, the Crown has said it is not calling Tom Sayer who was Mr Turner's flatmate and who, according to Mr Turner's statement, was present at the time of the crucial event and conversation recorded in paragraphs 41 and 42. The absence of Tom Sayer adds further unfairness to the Accused's position if this statement is admitted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that any unfairness or unfair prejudice could be met by clear direction to the jury concerning the fact that Mr Turner's evidence has not been tested. Although the Court of Criminal Appeal has said more than once that it is necessary to work on the basis that juries obey directions given to them, any direction here would involve an evaluative judgment on the weight to be given to untested evidence and in circumstances where the recipient of the inculpatory statement is not called.
	
	
	In my opinion the requirements of s 65(2)(d) are not satisfied, and even if they were I would refuse to admit the evidence by reason of its unfairness to the Accused and because its probative value is outweighed by unfair prejudice.

		17 November 2017",2016-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2881602,Sutton v R [2016] NSWCCA 249,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Anthony Graham Sutton, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the District Court at Tamworth on 7 December 2015.
	
	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty to the following offences:
	



	
	Count 1 – between 30 May 2014 and 25 July 2014, at South Tamworth, knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 2 – on 25 July 2014, at South Tamworth, unauthorised possession of a prohibited pistol (a seven shot .22 calibre revolver), contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and, as at the relevant time, a standard non-parole period of three years.
	



	
	The applicant also asked for his guilt in respect of three further offences listed on a Form 1 to be taken into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act). Those offences were committed on 25 July 2014, namely:
	



	
	possessing ammunition without a permit contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act, for which the maximum penalty is 50 penalty units;
	
	
	possessing an unregistered firearm contrary to s 36 of the Firearms Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years if the firearm is a pistol or prohibited firearm, or imprisonment for five years in any other case. (The seven shot .22 calibre revolver was a prohibited firearm within the meaning of s 4C of the Firearms Act); and
	
	
	possessing a prohibited weapon (a silencer) contrary to s 7(1) of the of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
	



	
	At the time of all of these offences the applicant was on parole for an armed robbery offence committed in November 2007 for which he was sentenced on 31 October 2008 to imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years (commencing on 14 November 2008) and a balance of term of three years (the 2007 sentence). The applicant's parole, which had commenced on 13 November 2012, was revoked on 8 August 2014, backdated to the date of his arrest for the subject offences (25 July 2014). He has served the balance of the term of his 2007 sentence until 13 November 2015 in custody.
	
	
	The sentencing judge allowed a 25% discount for the applicant’s early plea on the drug supply offence, and a 10% discount for the utilitarian value of his late plea on the firearms offence (on the first day the matter was fixed for trial).
	
	
	The sentence imposed was an aggregate sentence of three years non-parole commencing on 1 May 2015 and a balance of term of one year. The judge specified indicative sentences for count 1 (the drug supply offence) of two years imprisonment and for count 2 (the firearms offence, including the three matters on the Form 1) of two years and six months imprisonment.
	
	
	It is to be observed that the aggregate sentence imposed for the 2014 offences was backdated to commence on 1 May 2015 during the balance of the term of the 2007 sentence, in respect of which the applicant’s parole had been revoked. Thus the aggregate sentence imposed for the subject offences was made concurrent with the 2007 sentence by 6 ½ months.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in taking into account a standard non-parole period of four years in relation to the firearms offence when the applicable standard non-parole period was three years.
	


Circumstances of the offending


	
	The applicant came to the attention of police in 2014 during an investigation of the supply of methylamphetamine and illegal firearms in the Tamworth area. In June 2014, the applicant arranged for his nephew to meet an upper-level supplier in the Tamworth area, and later organised the supply to his nephew of 5 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $400. That supply took place on the Central Coast on 16 June 2014. After the applicant’s nephew left the premises where the supply took place, he was stopped and searched by police who located 4 grams of methylamphetamine on him.
	
	
	On 25 July 2014, police arrested and cautioned the applicant for the supply of methylamphetamine to his nephew. On the same day, police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s home in Tamworth directed to the possession of a revolver, a silencer and drugs. The applicant was brought to his home by police during the execution of the search warrant. He cooperated and showed police the location of a black canvas toiletry bag inside one of the drawers of a plastic stack of sliding drawers in a detached garage which contained:
	



	
	a seven shot .22 calibre revolver;
	
	
	a plastic resealable bag containing .22 calibre bullets (comprising 87 .22 cartridges and 46 .22 Long rifle cartridges); and
	
	
	a steel silencer.
	



	
	A subsequent ballistics examination showed that the revolver was in working order, although the cylinder was required to be manually rotated for each shot. The end of the barrel was threaded (for attachment of the silencer). The revolver had a barrel length of less than 100 mm and accordingly was a prohibited pistol within the meaning of s 4C(1)(c) of the Firearms Act. The .22 calibre bullets were suitable for use in the revolver.
	
	
	The firearm was unregistered and the applicant was not the holder of a firearms licence or permit. Nor was the applicant the holder of a permit or authorised to have in his possession a prohibited weapon, namely the silencer.
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant had a mostly unfavourable subjective case. The applicant was aged 51 at the time of sentence. He had not engaged in much work over his life. He had a lengthy criminal history for drug and property related offences (commencing in 1982 in New South Wales) and since 1990 had spent considerable time in gaol both in New South Wales and Queensland.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report recorded that whilst the applicant has a history of drug dependence, he stated that he was not using illicit drugs at the time of his arrest. He claimed to have ceased using heroin upon the birth of his son in 2000. He had commenced on a pharmacotherapy program (suboxone) around 2010 and remained on that program whilst in custody.
	
	
	The applicant has a number of disabilities, some related to his history as a heroin addict, and others relating to injuries to his lower back suffered in two motor vehicle accidents in his early twenties.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	The sentencing judge found that the firearm had been left at the applicant’s residence by another person. This finding was most favourable to the applicant because his Honour expressed scepticism about the applicant’s evidence on that topic. For this asserted fact to be a mitigating factor, the applicant was required to prove it on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54 at [41]-[42]. His Honour’s reasons did not refer to the standard or burden of proof for this fact, submitted as it was in the applicant’s favour.
	
	
	The judge found that the firearms offence was below the middle of the range of relative seriousness, “but not by that much”. In arriving at that conclusion the judge referred to a standard non-parole period of four years as a guidepost, and continued:
	


One needs to characterise the objective seriousness of that particular crime for the purposes of determining its influence upon the sentencing process as a guidepost in sentencing, consistent with both the act and what the High Court has had to say in Muldrock (ROS 8-9).


	
	In sentencing for the firearms offence, the judge took into account the three matters on the Form 1. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Abbas v R [2014] NSWCCA 188, that the effect of taking matters into account on a Form 1 would be to increase the sentence which otherwise would be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances. The judge found (as was conceded by the applicant) that there were no exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	The judge regarded the firearms offence as the more serious offence. He found that the applicant knew the consequences of what he was doing. He observed that the applicant was on parole at the time of the 2014 offences and that the 2007 offence involved the use of a firearm and must have been a serious offence because it attracted a head sentence of 7 years and a non-parole period of 4 years. The judge also observed that the applicant had very deliberately involved himself in the drug supply offence.
	
	
	The judge found that that there were no special circumstances to vary the statutory ratio under s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act).
	
	
	The judge referred to the applicant’s subjective case outlined above, including his physical disabilities and his having spent a large part of his life as a heroin addict and a relatively petty criminal.
	
	
	Taking into account the respective discounts for the guilty pleas, the judge imposed the aggregate sentence indicated.
	


Ground 1


	
	The applicant pointed to the judge’s incorrect statement of the standard non-parole period for count 2 as being four years. The applicable standard non-parole period was in fact three years.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the error in the indicative sentence for count 2 was material because it did affect the aggregate sentence imposed. The applicant pointed to the passage in the remarks on sentence set out at [17] above.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the judge incorrectly stated the standard non-parole period at two points in his reasons. The Crown accepted that the judge’s misstatement of the standard non-parole period for count 2 led to error in the indicative sentence specified for count 2. However, the Crown emphasised that the applicant’s appeal related to the aggregate sentence imposed upon him and not the judge’s error in relation to the indicative sentence. Reliance was placed on the statement in Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 (Kentwell v The Queen) at [42] that not all errors in the sentencing process vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the error in the indicative sentence for count 2 had no material effect on the aggregate sentence imposed. This argument relied on treating the indicative sentence for count 2, (taking into account the three charges on the Form 1) of two years and six months, as a head sentence, and given that no special circumstances were found, calculating the non-parole period for count 2 as 22 ½ months applying the usual statutory ratio under s 44 of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	The Crown suggested that another way of assessing whether the error was material to the aggregate sentence was to consider the accumulation of the indicative sentences. It was submitted that the aggregate sentence is well within the range given the seriousness of the two offences, the applicant’s previous criminal history, and that he was in breach of parole at the time of the subject offending.
	


Decision


	
	Unfortunately, during the sentencing hearing, the judge was inadvertently misled by the Crown and counsel for the applicant who both informed him that the standard non-parole period for count 2 was four years. That overlooked that the increase in the standard non-parole for an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act from three years to four years, only applies to offences committed on or after 21 August 2015: Part 5 of Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Firearms Offences) Act 2015 (NSW). Here, the firearms offence occurred on 25 July 2014.
	
	
	It was common ground that the misstatement by the sentencing judge in the standard non-parole period for the firearms offence led to error in the indicative sentence specified for count 2. The question raised by this appeal is whether that error, which was undoubtedly material to the indicative sentence for count 2, enlivens the Court’s power to intervene and it becomes its duty to resentence. That raises the question of the function of this Court under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act).
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen at [42] the plurality of the High Court, after referring to the differing views affecting the interpretation of s 6(3) expressed by the members of this Court in Baxter v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 284; [2007] NSWCCA 237, indicated that the analysis of Spigelman CJ should be accepted. The plurality explained at [42]:
	


When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. (Citations omitted)


	
	The example given by the High Court of an error in sentencing which would not vitiate the exercise of discretion is instructive. Reference was made to an error by the court which sentences an offender to imprisonment contrary to the requirement in s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act, by first setting the term of the sentence, rather than to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission that the aggregate sentence imposed here is well within the range of an appropriate sentence is answered by another passage in Kentwell v The Queen. Assuming error in the House v R ((1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40) sense is established, the plurality of the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen explained at [44]:
	


In assessing the prospects that the appellant's appeal would succeed, it was wrong to determine that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that substantial injustice was occasioned by the sentence. This is best understood as a conclusion that the aggregate sentence did not impress the Court, upon summary review, as excessive. The appellant is entitled to be sentenced according to law. The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody and current mental state, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.


	
	The Crown referred to AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31 as an example of an error in the statement of a maximum penalty of an indicative sentence which was held not to be material to the aggregate sentence. That case is distinguishable from the present. There an aggregate sentence of 17 years with a non-parole period of 14 years was imposed for 15 offences and the offender had asked for his guilt in respect of a further 12 offences listed on Form 1 documents be taken into account. Two of the offences charged involved acts of indecency upon a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act. The sentencing judge had misstated the maximum penalty under s 61N(1) as being seven years, when it was in fact two years. For those two offences, the judge indicated sentences of six months. Although no ground of appeal was directed to this error, the Crown had properly drawn the matter to this Court’s attention on the appeal. RA Hulme J (Beazley P and Schmidt J agreeing) said at [68] that “the error as to the statement of the maximum penalty had no material bearing upon the assessment of the aggregate sentence. No correction by way of resentencing was called for”.
	
	
	The conclusion in AB v R that the error in the statement of the maximum penalty for the s 61N(2) offences was not material to the aggregate sentence imposed is explained by the particular circumstances of that case where indicative sentences of six months for each of the indecent assault offences reflected, among other considerations, the objective seriousness of those offences, the maximum penalty being two years, and the large number of offences which were the subject of the aggregate offence imposed.
	
	
	The present case is quite different. The misstatement of the standard non-parole period for the firearms offence in the course of sentencing is plainly an important error. The standard non-parole period was described in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at [27] as one of the two legislative guideposts; the other being the maximum sentence. The High Court described the significance of the standard non-parole period (at [31]) as follows:
	


The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case.


	
	Here the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence in respect of two counts, one of which attracted a standard non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for the firearms offence was a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence by way of an aggregate sentence: s 54B(2) Sentencing Act. The sentencing judge was also required in determining an aggregate sentence to indicate and make a written record of the non-parole period he would have set for the firearms offence, being an offence to which a standard non-parole period applied: s 54B(4) Sentencing Act. His Honour failed to do so.
	
	
	Accepting that the error in the indicative sentence for count 2 was material, the sentencing judge mistook one of the two legislative guideposts when sentencing the applicant. Kentwell v The Queen at [42] makes clear that such an error having been established in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court need not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The sentencing discretion has miscarried; therefore it is the duty of this court to exercise the discretion afresh.
	
	
	One further matter should be mentioned. Neither party sought to characterise the error in the present case, where an aggregate sentence was imposed, as of a limited type which only affected a discrete component of the outcome. The correct approach to such errors in sentencing was not the subject of argument, nor is it necessary to express any view on that matter for the disposition of the appeal. Accordingly it is not necessary to consider whether, in cases where the error is limited and only affects a discrete component of the outcome, a more confined approach to the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion is consistent with Kentwell v The Queen: see the differing views discussed in Martin v R [2016] NSWCCA 104 at [93]-[111] (RA Hulme J); cf at [2]-[4] (Bathurst CJ).
	
	
	Ground 1 of the appeal has been made out and there should be a grant of leave to appeal.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Error having been established, it becomes this Court’s duty to re-sentence unless in the exercise of its discretion it concludes that no sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted and should have been passed: Kentwell v The Queen at [38].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that if the Court concludes there was error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, then no lesser sentence is warranted in law taking into account the full range of factors affecting sentence: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant relied in this Court upon an affidavit from the applicant’s solicitor as to the applicant’s current ill-health, specifically abdominal pain related to gallstones which seems to have been first reported whilst in custody in January 2016. Evidence of events that have occurred post-sentence, including current ill-health, is admissible for the purpose of determining whether a sentence should be substituted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: Douar v R (2005) 159 A Crim R 154; [2005] NSWCCA 455 at [124] (Johnson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adam J agreeing).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant did not rely on this evidence for a submission that imprisonment would be a greater burden on the applicant by reason of ill-health, or that there is a serious risk that imprisonment would have a grave adverse effect on the applicant’s health.
	
	
	Nor was there any challenge to the authorities referred to by the Crown to the effect that it is only in a relatively rare case that ill-health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment: R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589 (King CJ), referred to with approval in R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395 (R v Badanjak) at [9] (Wood CJ at CL, McClellan AJA and Smart AJ agreeing): Anastasiou v R [2010] NSWCCA 100 at [22]-[23] (Rothman J, McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreeing); Leighton v R [2010] NSWCCA 280 at [35]-[36] (Price J, Simpson J and Howie AJ agreeing).
	
	
	Rather, counsel for the applicant relied upon this evidence for a submission that there should be a finding of special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s ill-health.
	
	
	It was asserted that the applicant has not received appropriate medical care since he has been at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. The applicant’s solicitor gave evidence, on information and belief, of one occasion (on 27 September 2016) where the applicant said he was in pain, ended up on the floor of his cell in agony, and it was some three hours before prison guards arrived to assist. The applicant also complained of trouble with pain relating to gallstones in early October 2016.
	
	
	To the extent that the applicant’s medical records whilst in custody are in evidence, they demonstrate the provision of medical care for the applicant since 19 January 2016. That care has included assessments, tests with respect to the detection of gallstones in January and February 2016, referral for an ultrasound to his upper abdomen on 10 March 2016, and further tests when the applicant was admitted to Bathurst Base Hospital in July 2016 and again in August 2016. The applicant’s medical records record that he has been prescribed various medications for pain relief, as well as anti-inflammatory medications.
	
	
	Notes from Bathurst Base Hospital dated 7 August 2016 record that a cholecystectomy operation has been recommended. In the ordinary course, such invasive treatment would not occur until anti-inflammatory medications had taken their course. The applicant is presently held at the Long Bay Correctional Centre where the recommended operation can be performed nearby in a public hospital. The evidence does not establish that the applicant is not being provided with appropriate medical care by way of pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication in the meantime.
	
	
	In R v Badanjak it was observed (at [11]) that it remains the responsibility of Corrective Services to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners and that most conditions can be adequately managed by those authorities without the need for mitigating the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the applicant is, from time to time, in pain related to his gallstones. Having regard to the recommendation in the hospital notes, it can be expected that if the gallstones do not pass, the applicant will likely undergo the operation that has been recommended. The fact that the applicant has not been advised of a date for such operation, apparently for security reasons, does not mean that the applicant has been denied appropriate medical care.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that a finding of special circumstances should be made on the ground of the applicant’s ill-health relating to gallstones.
	
	
	It was not submitted by the applicant that this Court should make any different finding to that of the sentencing judge in relation to the objective seriousness of the firearms offence. That is not surprising given the nature of that offending. The authorities emphasise that the possession of firearms, except where necessary and by persons authorised to have them, is calculated to lead to substantial injury. Accordingly sentences imposed for such offences must “operate as real disincentives to those otherwise attracted to the illegal possession of firearms”: R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 at [71] (R S Hulme J; Giles JA and Latham J agreeing). See also R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 (R v Howard) at [66] (Spigelman CJ; Grove J and Smart AJ agreeing).
	
	
	As mentioned, the applicant had the benefit of a favourable finding that the firearm had been left at his home by somebody else. In his evidence during the sentencing proceedings, the applicant identified the firearm as belonging to his nephew Nathaniel Penn. The applicant gave evidence on sentence that Mr Penn and his friend, Mr Malavey, who were homeless, stayed at his house for about week and brought the pistol with them without his knowledge. He claimed he had only discovered it when moving the clothes they had left behind from the shed where they stayed into the house, and only had contact with it when storing it in the bottom drawer of the plastic drawers in the garage. He said he had not contacted police because he did not wish to “dob them in”. He gave some contradictory evidence about his subsequent contact with those persons. He said first that he had not had contact with them since they had left, then that he had got in touch with them and “[t]hey’ve made their admissions to me”, but that they did not appear to give evidence for fear of self-incrimination.
	
	
	His Honour was rightly sceptical of the applicant’s evidence on that topic. Nonetheless, the Crown did not contend for any different finding on appeal. Accepting that there was no evidence that the firearm was either used by or intended to be used by the applicant in some criminal activity, it remains significant that the applicant was keeping the firearm for somebody else. There is no reason to depart from the sentencing judge’s finding that the objective seriousness of the firearms offence is just below mid-range.
	
	
	First, compact firearms are particularly dangerous because of their capacity for concealment: R v Brown [2006] NSWCCA 249 at [23] (Spigelman CJ; Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing). This makes them suited for serious criminal activity. Here, the firearm was in working order, although the chamber had to be rotated manually between shots.
	
	
	Secondly, the related matters on the Form 1 are also serious. There could be no legitimate purpose for the possession of a silencer. A silencer “is quintessentially a feature of weapons used in violent crimes”: R v Howard at [66] (Spigelman CJ). It has been said that the possession of a silencer and pistol in relation to a drug supply business “adds a more serious connotation” to the firearm offence (R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [56] (Hall J, Tobias JA and Kirby J agreeing). The same may be said in the present case, even though there was no finding by the sentencing judge that the revolver and silencer was used or intended to be used by the applicant in some criminal activity. The applicant was holding the revolver, silencer and ammunition for others, who had no legitimate purpose for their possession of those items.
	
	
	While the maximum penalty for the unauthorised possession of ammunition is only a fine (50 penalty units), in the context of the related prohibited firearms offence, the unauthorised possession of ammunition was nonetheless serious: R v Farrell [2015] NSWCCA 68 (R v Farrell) at [52] (Bellew J, Simpson and Rothman JJ agreeing) quoting Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170 at [88].
	
	
	There is little that operates in mitigation of sentence. The applicant’s prior offences included armed robbery (in 2007) and possession of a prohibited weapon (in 1999). Those prior offences must have brought home to the applicant the illegality of what he was doing in possessing the firearm the subject of the current charge. Yet when cross-examined about the nature of his previous offence of armed robbery, the applicant was evasive, saying he could not remember what the prohibited weapon was that he was charged with possessing, and gave inconsistent evidence – first saying of the armed robbery “[t]here was a firearm involved”, then asserting that “[t]there was no weapon. It was all the hearsay of witnesses”.
	
	
	The applicant’s attempts to deflect responsibility for his prior offending involving the use of firearms, is indicative of an inability to accept responsibility for what is a serious offence. That the applicant’s prior offences related to possession and use of prohibited firearms is relevant to the need for personal deterrence: R v Farrell at [42].
	
	
	Further, the applicant was on parole at the time of the subject offences for armed robbery and related offences in 2007 which his Honour observed must have been serious having regard to the length of the sentence imposed. He has a lengthy criminal history. Against this, he has some physical difficulties arising from a back injury suffered as a result of motor cycle accidents and is also suffering pain from gallstones.
	
	
	It is common ground that the aggregate sentencing provisions in s 53A of the Sentencing Act should be applied on re-sentence, as the sentencing judge had done. In relation to count 1, the drug supply offence, no submissions were advanced by the applicant complaining as to the indicative sentence of two years imprisonment, taking into account the 25% discount for the early guilty plea. Exercising my discretion afresh, I see no reason to vary that indicative sentence which should be treated as an indicative head sentence.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, the firearms offence (including the three matters on the Form 1), I would be inclined to indicate a slightly higher head sentence of three years. Given the absence of any finding of special circumstances I would indicate a non-parole period of two years three months for count 2.
	
	
	Nevertheless, having regard to the totality principle, I would allow for a greater degree of concurrency between those sentences. In my view, an aggregate sentence of three years non-parole and a balance of term of one year is within the range of appropriate sentences for the applicant’s offending. No complaint was made by the applicant as to the backdating of the aggregate sentence to 1 May 2015. Accordingly I am not persuaded that a lesser (or greater) sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	For these reasons, I would propose the following orders:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal.

2.   Dismiss the appeal.


	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I agree with Gleeson JA. In the exercise of my sentencing discretion I too am satisfied that no lesser sentence is warranted in law for the reasons expressed by his Honour.

 Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:
Introduction 
1       This is an action commenced by the plaintiff, Mohammad Nazeem bin Mustafah Kamal, who suffered personal injuries on property occupied by the defendant, the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3023. The property in question is known as Eunos Technolink, 5 Kaki Bukit Road 1, Singapore 415936 (“the Property”). The plaintiff fell through what was described as gypsum flooring onto the basement one floor below and sustained injuries.
Background
2       The plaintiff was at the material time a service technician employed by Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd (“Colt”). Pursuant to a letter of award dated 5 May 2010, Colt was engaged by the defendant to provide quarterly engineering smoke control system maintenance and servicing for one year.
3       On 22 June 2010, two service technicians, Wong Kong Wai (“Mr Wong”) and the plaintiff, went to the Property to attend to routine servicing of the smoke control system. Mr Wong, a self-employed service engineer, was a sub-contractor engaged by Colt. The plaintiff, who was despatched to the Property with Mr Wong, was employed as a service technician by Colt. Mr Wong was the senior member of the team. On arrival, Mr Wong and the plaintiff proceeded to the office of the defendant’s managing agent and met the defendant’s building manager, Mr Aung Sein (“Mr Aung”). The defendant’s managing agent was Melana International Pte Ltd. Mr Aung told Mr Wong and the plaintiff to proceed to the smoke extraction fan starter panel riser located at Level 1 (“the Riser”) to check the fan starter panel (“the FS panel”) as one of the lights on the FS panel was out of order.
4       At about 10.20am, Mr Wong and the plaintiff arrived at the Riser and proceeded to unlock the door to the Riser. Mr Wong had previously been to this particular riser on a few occasions to service the FS panel.
[note: 1]
 On this occasion, while Mr Wong remained outside selecting his tools,
[note: 2]
 the plaintiff stepped inside the Riser to check the lights on the FS panel.
[note: 3]
 This was the plaintiff’s first time in the Riser.
[note: 4]
5       At the entrance of the Riser looking in, extending from the wall on the left side to roughly 40% of the doorway is a concrete beam. To its right approximately 58cm below is an internal open space, which we now know, after the accident, was covered by gypsum plasterboard (hereinafter referred to for convenience as “the gypsum flooring”, although the plaintiff’s expert said that it was technically not “flooring but was in fact the top of the gypsum plasterboard basement ceiling below”
[note: 5]
).
6       The FS panel was mounted on the wall facing the doorway. Seen from the doorway looking in, the FS panel was mounted more to the left above the concrete beam. However, based on the dimensions provided by the plaintiff’s expert, the latter estimated that mounted on the wall, about 34.5% of the FS panel was over the concrete beam and the remaining section of the FS panel was over the gypsum flooring.
[note: 6]
 According to Mr Wong, on the previous occasions when he serviced the FS panel in the Riser, he stood on the concrete beam,
[note: 7]
 which was wide enough for service personnel to stand on to access the FS panel mounted on the wall.
7       In the present case, the plaintiff entered the Riser and stood on the concrete beam to check the lights on the FS panel. Whilst the plaintiff was removing a faulty spring-loaded light bulb from the FS panel, he accidentally dropped the bulb, which landed on the gypsum flooring. He decided to retrieve the bulb. From the concrete beam, he said, he “jump [
sic
] onto” the gypsum flooring, which was approximately 58cm below.
[note: 8]
 Unfortunately, the gypsum flooring gave way under his weight and the plaintiff fell through to the basement one floor below, thereby sustaining personal injuries.
8       It was common ground that the gypsum flooring was of a similar hue as the concrete beam.
[note: 9]
The opposing contentions
The plaintiff’s case
9       The plaintiff claimed that his bad fall was caused by the negligence of the defendant and/or its servants. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant actually knew or ought to have known of the danger posed by the gypsum flooring because the gypsum plasterboard was not a load-bearing material. He further alleged that the defendant should have put up a sign or notice in the Riser or in the vicinity to warn persons entering the Riser of the gypsum flooring. This was done sometime after the accident. The plaintiff further argued that he should have been told orally, at the time he was directed to go to the Riser, that the internal open space in the Riser was covered by a layer of gypsum plasterboard and that the latter material was not load-bearing. The plaintiff also relied on the aforementioned facts to allege that the defendant had breached its duty of care as the occupier of the Property.
10     In his closing submissions, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Anand K Thiagarajan (“Mr Thiagarajan”), said that the main issue in this case was whether the defendant had breached its duty of care as the occupier of the Property.
[note: 10]
 In his Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff claimed that he was a contractual entrant and/or invitee to the Property. However, the plaintiff was an invitee rather than a contractual entrant as there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant; the relevant servicing contract was between Colt and the defendant (see [2] above).
The defendant’s case
11     The defendant denied the plaintiff’s allegations of negligence and liability as the occupier of the Property. The main thrust of the defendant’s case was that it never knew of the gypsum flooring in the Riser until after the accident. In particular, the defendant’s counsel, Mr Michael Eu Hai Meng (“Mr Eu”), submitted that after the defendant took possession of the common areas in the Property from the developer in December 2005, the defendant did not make any physical changes to the buildings, rooms, walls, floors, ceilings and so on in the common areas of the Property.
[note: 11]
 The existing construction, design and layout of the common areas of the Property had been designed and approved by consultants employed by the developer, and had also been approved by the relevant statutory authorities. In the light of the aforesaid matters, Mr Eu submitted that there was no reason for the defendant to suspect that the internal open space in the Riser was covered by gypsum plasterboard instead of concrete.
12     In any event, the defendant further submitted, the plaintiff had contributed to the accident by his own carelessness and conduct as he should not have jumped from the concrete beam without first ascertaining that it was safe to do so.
Relevant legal principles
13     The common law distinguishes between injuries sustained on account of the defective static condition of a property and injuries sustained on account of activities or operations carried out on a property. If injury is sustained due to the defective static condition of a property, as was the case here, the court is only concerned with the defendant’s duty of care as the occupier of the property. Michael F Rutter, 
Occupiers’ Liability in Singapore and Malaysia
 (Singapore Butterworths, 1985) (“
Rutter
”) explains the legal significance from the viewpoint of the relevant duty of care in the two different situations as follows (at p 107):
… Thus, assuming that the damage was not caused by a current activity or operation, it presumably will have been caused by the defective, static condition of the premises. The common law does not impose the ordinary 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 duty of care upon the occupier in respect of the static condition of his premises …
14     The applicable duty of care owed by an occupier to an invitee for injury caused by the defective static condition of its property was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and another appeal
 
[1996] 2 SLR(R) 223
 at [47]:
The only duty [the defendant], as an occupier, owed to the plaintiff was to use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual dangers which the former knew or ought to have known about. 
This relates to the physical condition of the premises, as opposed to current operations at the site.
 [emphasis added]
15     Turning to the law on occupiers’ liability in Singapore, the Court of Appeal in 
Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa En
g 
[1995] 2 SLR(R) 385
 (“
Tan Swa Eng
”) at [15] reminded:
The law of occupiers’ liability in Singapore is derived from English common law and … legislation in England has been passed which has made significant changes to the common law. In Singapore, there is no such parallel legislation, and the English statutes on occupiers’ liability are not applicable.
16     The Court of Appeal restated (at [16] of 
Tan Swa Eng
) the well-accepted principle that:
At common law, a person is an invitee if he is on private or public premises for a business purpose of material benefit to the occupier. This is usually referred to as a “common interest” as the invitee himself more often than not also has an economic interest in being on the premises.
In contrast, licensees are those who have been given permission, whether express or otherwise, to enter premises and who are neither trespassers nor invitees. It was undisputed that the plaintiff in the present case was an invitee and not a licensee.
17     The test of an occupier’s duty of care 
vis-à-vis
 invitees may be found in the case of 
Indermaur v Dames
 (1866) LR 1 CP 274, and is based on the occupier taking reasonable care to prevent damage to the invitee from unusual danger. The test (at 288 of 
Indermaur v Dames
) was accepted and followed in 
Tan Swa Eng
 (see [17] to [19]). In short, an occupier is liable to an invitee for injuries and damage suffered only when 
all
 of the four elements below are satisfied (see 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Gary Chan Kok Yew gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2011) (“
The Law of Torts in Singapore
”) at para 10.014):
(a)
 
The occupier 
 
actually knew or ought to have known of the unusual danger
;
(b)
The danger was unusual to that class of plaintiffs having regard to the nature of the place and the knowledge of the invitee;
(c)
The danger was unknown to the plaintiff and the significance was not appreciated by the plaintiff;
(d)
The occupier failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring.
[emphasis added]
18     In the English case of 
Hawkins v Couldson and Purley Urban District Council
 
[1954] 1 QB 319
 (“
Hawkins
”), Denning LJ suggested that there was a confluence between the laws applying to invitees and the laws applying to licensees. Thus, while 
Hawkins
 was strictly a case on licensees as it involved a visitor to a home in the possession and control of the defendant, Denning LJ’s reasoning can nonetheless be similarly applied to cases involving invitees.
19     Denning LJ held (at 334 of 
Hawkins
) that for acts of omission:
“...
liability depends on whether the occupier has actual knowledge of the state of affairs existing on the land
, no matter whether he himself created it or someone else. Once he has that knowledge, then if he knows or ought to know that it is a danger, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to prevent damage from that danger. [emphasis added]
When Denning LJ spoke in terms of the occupier’s “actual knowledge” of the existing state of affairs, he also included knowledge that could be imputed to the occupier (at 336).
20     On the meaning of the phrase “ought to know”, Denning LJ stated (at 335, citing with approval an explanation by Lord Greene in 
Baker v Bethnal Green Borough Council
 [1945] 1 All ER 135 at 140):
… It is this: if the occupier 
actually knows the physical condition of the premises
, and a reasonable man would have realized that it was a danger, the occupier must be taken in law to have knowledge of the danger, because he ought to have realized it too. 
He ought to know what a reasonable man would know
. ... When the statements of their Lordships are read against that background, it becomes clear that what they mean is this: 
once an occupier has actual knowledge of the state of affairs existing on his land, then if he knows or ought to know it is a danger he is under a duty to warn a visitor of it unless, of course, the danger is obvious
. [emphasis added]
21     On the facts of 
Hawkins
, Denning LJ found that the defendant ought to have known about the danger as 
it knew that the step in question was broken
, and a reasonable man in the position of the defendant would have realised that the broken step was a danger to visitors (at 338). Thus, the basis of the decision in 
Hawkins
 was the defendant’s knowledge of the existing state of affairs, 
ie
, the defective step, such that it could be said that any reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to know about the danger.
22     In 
Tan Swa Eng
, the appellant was the ground floor tenant of Hotel New World, which collapsed on 15 March 1986. On the day of the collapse, there were tremors and other warning signs. The appellant’s officers, after checking cracks in a pillar, concluded that there was no significant danger and did not take any steps to evacuate the appellant’s customers from the premises. The appellant was later sued, and it was asserted that the appellant’s officers ought to have known of the danger of the building collapsing after experiencing the warning signs and had failed to take the necessary precautions to evacuate the appellant’s customers from the premises.
23     In allowing the appellant’s appeal, the Court of Appeal, applying the English decision of 
Roe v Minister of Health
 
[1954] 2 QB 66
, held that in assessing whether the appellant had breached its duty by risking the dangers that were known or ought to have been known to it, one must examine the dangers within the state of knowledge at the time, namely, that in 1986, no one would contemplate that a building which had stood for more than ten years would suddenly collapse. The Court of Appeal agreed that the officers of the appellant should only be imputed with the state of knowledge of a reasonable man in 1986. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that there was no failure on the part of the appellant to use reasonable care to prevent the damage from occurring. It is clear from the decision that any temptation to view evidence on liability with hindsight must be avoided.
24     The plaintiff’s counsel referred me to some authorities. At this juncture, I will mention the two cases cited in support of the proposition that the defendant had a duty to inspect the flooring in the Riser. The first is 
Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd
 
[2010] 1 SLR 786
, which is distinguishable as it concerned an employer’s liability and not an occupier’s liability. The other case is 
Marnet v Scott
 [1899] QBD 986, which the plaintiff cited in support of the proposition that there was a duty on the defendant’s part to inspect the flooring in the Riser. 
Marnet v Scott
 accepted and applied the test in 
Indermaur v Dames
 quoted earlier (see [17] above).
25     In relation to the law on negligence, the critical question is similarly whether or not the defendant actually knew or ought to have known of the gypsum flooring. This is ultimately a question of the standard of care expected of the defendant as the occupier of the Property. This is also a factual issue requiring an objective determination after evaluating the facts and the circumstances of the case (see 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 at paras 05.006 - 05.008 and 05.012).
26     Interestingly, in the recent case of 
See Toh 
Siew 
Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd 
and others
 
[2012] 3 SLR 227
 (“
See Toh
”), Woo Bih Li J found at [109] that occupiers’ liability was part of the law of negligence. The learned judge came to his conclusion after drawing support from 
British Railways Board v Herrington
 
[1972] AC 877
 and textbooks like 
Rutter
. In the learned judge’s view, there was no reason why an occupier should have concurrent liabilities when others had only one (see [109] of 
See Toh
).
27     On the other hand, the author of 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 takes the opposite view, noting the following at para 10.048:
There is interstitial evidence from the cases indicating the close connection between occupiers’ liability and negligence. In the author’s opinion, 
they are not sufficient in themselves to warrant occupiers’ liability being entirely subsumed under the tort of negligence
. It is ideal to adopt a consistent standard, such as a negligence standard, for all occupier 
vis-a-vis
 the different categories of entrants into the premises, if the test is sufficiently certain, as well as flexible, to accommodate a myriad of scenarios. However, the ideal of consistency should not be implemented for the sake of consistency without sufficient appreciation of the different categories. [emphasis added]
28     Further, the author of 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 explains at para 10.054:
The state of the law on occupiers’ liability is not entirely satisfactory. Reforms should be considered as to whether the course of the common law in this area should be altered by changing or amalgamating the tests for occupiers’ duties towards invitees, licensees and trespasses. There is good reason for considering the amalgamation of the occupiers’ duties towards invitees and licensees. On the other hand, on the issue of whether occupiers’ liability should be “shunted” onto the negligence “track”, the difficulties of subsuming occupiers’ liability under the tort of negligence have been discussed above, including the problem of imposing the negligence standard on the occupier’s relationship towards trespassers.
29      
See Toh
 is currently under appeal to the Court of Appeal. In my view, in the light of the pending appeal and the nature of the present case, there is no need for this court to enter into the debate about whether the law on occupiers’ liability should be subsumed under the general law of negligence.
Issue before the court
30     The defendant accepted that it was the occupier of the Property, and the plaintiff’s case was argued on that footing. The key issue in dispute was whether the defendant was aware of the gypsum flooring in the Riser before the accident. As regards this issue, the court will first consider whether the defendant had actual knowledge of the state of affairs existing in the Riser before the accident. The relevant state of affairs comprises three elements: (a) the internal open space in the Riser; (b) the fact that one layer of gypsum plasterboard was used to cover the internal open space; and (c) the fact that gypsum plasterboard was not a load-bearing material. These facts would go to show that the gypsum flooring would constitute an unusual danger. To succeed in his claim, the plaintiff has to prove either that: (i) the defendant had knowledge (whether actual or imputed) of these facts and knew that the gypsum flooring was a danger; or (ii) short of knowledge of danger, the defendant’s knowledge of the relevant state of affairs (
ie
, (a) to (c) above) was such that any reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to know about the danger. If either of these conditions is satisfied, the plaintiff would have established his case for breach of occupiers’ duty. Conversely, if neither of these conditions is satisfied, the plaintiff’s case would fall apart.
31     Indeed, as discussed above, regardless of whether one views the current case from the prism of the law of negligence or the law on occupiers’ liability, one common threshold element that the plaintiff has to establish is that the defendant 
actually knew about or can be imputed with knowledge of
 the gypsum flooring (see condition (a) of [17] above).
Discussion and decision 
32     As just mentioned, the key issue in this case relates to the first condition set out in 
Indermaur v Dames
 (
ie
, condition (a) of [17] above). From the overall evidence before the court, my view, on the balance of probabilities, is that the plaintiff has not satisfied this condition for the reasons set out below.
The defendant had no actual knowledge of the gypsum flooring in the Riser
i. The gypsum plasterboard was there because of an original design flaw
33     The plaintiff called an expert witness, Mr Philip Edward Marshall (“Mr Marshall”) of Construction Solutions Consultancy. Mr Marshall has spent over 50 years in the construction industry, with 14 years spent as a quantity and building surveyor and 36 years spent in project management as a project manager. Of those 36 years, 14 years involved project management in Singapore.
34     Mr Marshall stated in his expert report dated 18 January 2011 (“the January report”) that he did not carry out a site visit, but that he had seen photographs taken by one Aedan Phua of Colt on the day of the accident after the plaintiff was taken to hospital. The January report was based on the photographs and the plaintiff’s responses to Mr Marshall’s questionnaire. Subsequently, Mr Marshall made a site visit on 27 July 2011. He produced a supplementary report dated 29 July 2011. After this site visit, Mr Marshall took site dimensions and prepared an approximate drawing of the Riser. A further report dated 21 October 2011 was issued by Mr Marshall to comment on the loss adjuster’s preliminary report dated 6 August 2010. The January report remained the principal report.
35     Mr Marshall opined in the January report that an original design flaw led to the internal open space of the Riser being covered with one layer of gypsum plasterboard. Paragraph 3.1.2 of the January report states:
3.1.2 From Photographs Nos 5-9 (Appendix F) of the Riser where the accident occurred, 
it can be clearly deduced that at the time of the construction of the concrete superstructure, the 
full design co-ordination of the Mechanical and Electrical installation with the structural work had not been carried out
, 
as the Structural Engineering Consultant had only included in their construction drawings an oversized opening in the floor of the Riser
 for the smoke extract ductwork and the trunking to the Fan Starter Panel, as demonstrated in the above mentioned photographs.
 
If at the time of the construction of the concrete superstructure the full design co-ordination of the Mechanical and Electrical installation and the structural work had been carried out, then the Structural Engineering Consultant would have designed for a concrete slab to the floor to the riser and included on their construction drawings for openings in the concrete slab for the smoke extract ductwork and the trunking to the Fan Starter Panel
. The openings would have been some 50 mm larger than the size of the smoke extract ductwork and the trunking to the Fan Starter Panel, to allow for ease of installation of the ductwork and the trunking. 
On completion of the installation of the ductwork and the trunking, the resultant gap between the concrete slab and the ductwork and the trunking, would have been filled with suitable fireproof stopping material.
[emphasis added]
36     In para 3.1.3 of the January report, Mr Marshall opined that as the design process described was not properly co-ordinated and carried out, the structural engineer did not design a concrete slab to cover the opening in the floor of the Riser following the installation of the smoke extract ductwork. Mr Marshall further opined that this large opening in the floor of the Riser (
ie
, the internal open space of the Riser) had to be either covered or infilled in a safe and proper manner for the following reasons (at para 3.1.4):
a.    To provide a level and safe platform to the entire open space of the Riser for access to the Fan Starter Panel for maintenance and servicing of the said panel by a Service Engineer.
b.    To provide adequate fire integrity within the Riser between the Basement and Level One.
c.    To ensure that the ceiling in the basement was continuous from a finishes [
sic
] perspective only.
37     Mr Marshall noted at paras 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 of the January report that while the various consultants and/or the main contractor involved in the construction of the Property ought to have ensured that the infill satisfied all the requirements set out in sub-paras (a)–(c) of para 3.1.4 of the January report, the gypsum flooring satisfied only the requirement in sub-para (c). Furthermore, the following pertinent points were noted:
(a)     Whoever supervised the installation of the said infill ceiling in the basement would have been aware of the inadequacy of the installation from a safety aspect 
vis-à-vis
 the Riser above, and should have raised this with the relevant person in charge so that the appropriate instruction could be given. Clearly, this process did not occur (see para 3.1.6 of the January report).
(b)     During the formal handover inspection of the Property after it was completed, when an inspection of the interior of the Riser should have been carried out, it would have been plainly clear to the person in charge of the inspection that there were problems with the Riser in that the requirements set out in paras 3.1.4(a) and 3.1.4(b) of the January report had not been satisfactorily achieved (see para 3.1.7 of the January report).
(c)     A Qualified Person (“QP”) was statutorily required to certify the completed works for, 
inter alia
, fire integrity and safety aspects. To do so in a proper manner, the QP would have required a detailed inspection of the completed works. According to the January report, either: (i) an inspection of the interior of the Riser was carried out by the QP and he reported the problems, but these problems were not corrected by the relevant party; or (b) there was an oversight and an inspection of the Riser was in fact not carried out (see para 3.1.8 of the January report).
38     The above points from his January report were confirmed by Mr Marshall during cross-examination.
[note: 12]
39     During cross-examination, Mr Marshall elaborated on his view that the gypsum plasterboard used to cover the internal open space in the Riser was part of the architect’s direction:
[note: 13]
...
A:
So at the point in time when the construction was being done, the painter painted the wall of the basement and went up and painted the wall—part of the wall in the riser which is shown on photograph 6 on page 66. So from my experience, I can anticipate what happened at the end. The architect was walking round, they painted up into the riser and said “Look, I haven’t got a level ceiling, fill it in”. He may have said “with plaster” or just said “contractor, fill it in”. He’d have probably said “Plaster”, but I don’t--- this would have been a late instruction towards the end when the job was nearly finished, and the contractor then put in plasterboard. 
So I would accept that plasterboard was part of the original, not design, more of an instruction
. 
I doubt you’ll find on an architect’s drawing, it was an oversight. When they look at the relationship of the structure and the ductwork, they suddenly said “We have a hole, we better fill it in”. This often happens. And they filled in, but with the wrong---the architect instructed the wrong material.
 It should have been---because it’s a riser above, he should have instructed either to get the structural engineer to do a floor or done something different, but not what was instructed. 
But it’s still part of the architect’s designing quote/direction or instruction
.
...
[emphasis added]
40     While Mr Marshall’s views were based on deduction as he never had sight of the relevant construction drawings,
[note: 14]
 he said that his views were based on his experience as the project manager of many construction projects over the course of 36 years, and I accept that his opinion is not without some degree of credence. I note that Mr Marshall was shown the as-built drawings of the Riser that were provided by the defendant. Although Mr Marshall said that his brief did not include reviewing the as-built drawings, he went on to explain that without the necessary mechanical and electrical drawings and the structural engineer’s drawings, the as-built drawings by the architect in themselves were incomplete. He said:
[note: 15]
…
A:
… So in fact this as-built drawing, if you want to use that, it’s incorrect. If you want, but only--- it’s incomplete. I want to see the structural engineer. This is not the structural engineer’s drawing. This is to my conclusion, er, mechanical drawing showing mechanical ductwork. But it doesn’t show the plan of the room and the mechanical engineer saying, “Where you positioned the duct in the opening?” 
And the structural engineer says how is his structure in relation to the riser, to this ductwork as I expressed earlier should be within 15 millimetres. So this
---
these drawings may be indicative, give me some indication but it doesn’t give me the story and in fact it’s incorrect because we know by inspecting it, there’s no concrete …
[emphasis added]
41     Mr Marshall went on to point out several other flaws in the as-built drawings and opined that he did not have “great faith” in the as-built drawings.
[note: 16]
 However, Mr Marshall revealed that as-built drawings were supposed to serve the important purpose of recording accurately what was built, and that they were “a very critical part of the process of handing over the building from the contractor to the owner” and would be relied on by “future owners who may want to make a change”.
[note: 17]
42     Mr Marshall’s other evidence is that if the contractor or whoever installed the gypsum plasterboard had erected a metal frame first, it would have put people on notice that the Riser’s flooring was not made of concrete. It could even have stopped the fall of the plaintiff.
[note: 18]
 Mr Marshall further added that when construction of the Property was completed, it was likely that the architect would have noticed that the Riser’s floor was not level and would have instructed that the opening be filled (see [39] above).
[note: 19]
43     It is clear that Mr Marshall’s opinion evidence shifts the blame away from the defendant as it was a design flaw: an original design flaw led to the internal open space of the Riser being covered with one layer of gypsum plasterboard. The facts in evidence support the defendant’s case that before the accident it did not know about the internal open space, and that it was covered by the gypsum plasterboard. As the facts in evidence show, this was 
not
 a case of an occupier who had the means to find out about a concealed danger but omitted to take action to make its premises safe for invitees.
ii. The defendant was not the developer of the Property
44     The foregoing paragraphs throw into sharp focus the main difficulties in the plaintiff’s case, not least the fact that the defendant was neither the original developer of the Property nor the original party that actually contracted with the relevant consultants involved in the construction of the Property (
eg
, the architect and other professionals), but was instead the management corporation formed on 20 December 2005 to take over the common areas in the Property. Given Mr Marshall’s testimony on design flaw and architect’s direction in [39] above, and his further testimony that the as-built drawings provided by the architect to the original developer were, on Mr Marshall’s evidence, incomplete or inaccurate, on the overall evidence, on a balance of probabilities, I find that that the defendant, as the management corporation of the Property, would not have known from its occupation of the common areas of the Property of the design flaw or from the as-built drawings themselves about the design flaw in the Riser, including the fact that gypsum plasterboard was used to cover the internal open space in the Riser.
iii. The defendant did not know of the gypsum flooring until after the accident
45     The main witness for the defendant was Mr Aung. He has been the defendant’s building manager since 2007. Mr Aung steadfastly maintained during his cross-examination that he had never been inside the Riser,
[note: 20]
 and that he and the defendant only found out about the gypsum flooring after the accident.
[note: 21]
46     During the cross-examination of Mr Aung, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Thiagarajan, attempted to rely on the 
preliminary report
 of Ms Toh Hui Hong (“Ms Toh”), a loss adjuster with Crawford & Company International Pte Ltd, to suggest that Mr Aung had informed Ms Toh that the defendant was aware of the gypsum flooring 
before
 the accident. The relevant part of Ms Toh’s preliminary report (“the Crawford Report”) reads as follows:
[note: 22]
We were told by Mr Aung that this was the original architect’s design that was in place since the development was constructed, i.e., in 2004. We requested for a copy of the floor plans and will submit the same when received. However Mr Aung informed that the management is aware of the design as the same floor position is found in the other control panel room.
47     Mr Thiagarajan sought to rely on the last sentence of the above paragraph to suggest that the defendant’s management was aware of the design of the Riser’s flooring before the accident. Mr Aung’s reply, however, made it clear that that was not in fact the position:
[note: 23]
…
 
Q:
… Since when were the management aware?
A:
After the accident, I in---I told this loss adjustor we’re aware.
Q:
So this is the management was aware after the accident?
A:
After accidents, yes.
...
 
48     Mr Thiagarajan used the same line of inquiry for the next paragraph of the Crawford Report, and he was given the same answer by Mr Aung. The relevant paragraph of the Crawford Report reads:
[note: 24]
We inquired on whether the contractor had been informed of the potential danger/design of the floor and to this Mr Aung related that he brought Colt’s employees on orientation rounds when they first attended at the development although he did not forewarn/inform them of the flooring design.
49     The line of cross-examination on this particular paragraph proceeded as follows:
[note: 25]
...
 
Q:
---is it seems to suggest that you actually have been to the accident riser before because you seem to have taken the employees on an orientation round.
A:
Okay, this, er---
Q:
You---
A:
---same as the one will [
sic
] handover time, I just show that Colt employ ---Colt employees inside, er, one DB [distribution board] have. I just assure them it’s your --- we never open the door.
Q:
But it went on to say that he took them on round but you “did not forewarn or inform them of the floor … design.”
A:
Yes because, Sir, I also don’t know the---what is the design inside. Sir, this---this, er, is a small place so I’ve, er, other place, er, ducting, DB, then DB, other place have--- there are other place [sic] more important than the---this one.
...
 
50     Finally, the Crawford Report concluded with the following:
[note: 26]
The insured [
ie
, the defendant], being aware of the flooring design in the control panel room failed to forewarn/inform the appointed contractor of the potential danger...
51     Mr Aung, however, again clarified the defendant’s position in his answers:
[note: 27]
...    
A:    So---so---I want to tell two portion[s]: First, we [are] not aware of the floor design.
Q:    Yes.
A:    The second one, as such, we didn’t inform the contractor the danger---potential danger of the---this---er, this, er, compartment. We didn’t inform. We didn’t remind.
...    
52     Later in his cross-examination, Mr Aung went on to confirm that he had not informed Ms Toh that the defendant’s management was aware of the design of the Riser’s flooring before the accident.
[note: 28]
53     At this juncture, it ought to be pointed out that Ms Toh herself appeared to have taken a somewhat contrary position from Mr Aung. I am minded to reach the conclusion that her questioning of Mr Aung, who is from Myanmar, could have led to confusion and misunderstanding. I begin with Mr Thiagarajan’s cross-examination of Ms Toh on the paragraph quoted at [46] above. Ms Toh’s answers to Mr Thiagarajan’s questions showed that the “design” she was referring to was the “split level” due to the existence of the concrete beam that occupied the left side of the Riser and the lower section to the right. At this part of her testimony, Ms Toh was not talking about the gypsum flooring itself:
[note: 29]
Q:
When you mean you were told “original architect design that was in place” what is the design? What design are you talking about?
A:
I’m referring to the … er, if you have seen in the photograph, there’s one of higher level.
Q:
Yes
…
 
A:
... so I’m actually asking him, er, why is there such ... such design. Then he ... he answer me that is the original architect.
Q:
 
You 
 
... 
 
you 
 
... 
 
are you telling me...you are referring to the top part which is the cemented
?
A:
 
Yah, okay.
 
Q:
Yes
A:
 
What I asked him is that instead of a whole level … level ground, why is it like one section is lower and one section is higher
?
Q:
 
And that’s your reference to design?
 
A:
 
Yah
.
Q:
And you said you requested for a copy of the floor plans. Did you get a copy?
A:
Er, later on.
…
 
Q:
You said the management is aware of the design, Who told you this? Aung?
A:
Yes
Q:
 
And what did you mean when you said that you were aware? That … that Aung informed that the management is aware.
 
A:
 
That means the … one section is higher, one section is lower. So I’m just asking is he aware
.
Q:
 
And what was the answer
?
A:
 
Yes, he’s aware
.
Q:
Was your … aware prior to the accident?
A:
Cannot remember did I specify it. It was after or it was before the accident.
Q:
You can’t remember whether the management was aware after or before or you can’t remember what Aung ...
A:
From the second paragraph … it would … it … it would be before.
Q:
So just to recap. That means the management was aware of the design of the riser floor before the accident.
A:
Yes.
[emphasis added]
54     It was later on, when this court sought clarification from Ms Toh, that she said that her reference to “design” had included “the floor board at the lower level”, 
ie
, the gypsum flooring:
[note: 30]
 
Court:
 
 
So are you also referring to the floor board at the lower level as well, as part of the design?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Yes
 
Ms Toh referred the court to the Crawford Report, where she wrote:
[note: 31]
Mr Aung related that the [plaintiff] fell through the lower level floor of the control room. We ascertained this section although appears to be cemented floor forms part of the ceiling at the lower level. We show below photographs of the relevant section with the sections of the collapsed board in place.
Nothing on the face of this paragraph can be attributed to Mr Aung’s alleged comment that the “cemented floor” was the original architect’s design. It was in answer to the court’s question that Ms Toh explained that she had asked Mr Aung about the “cemented floor” and had been told that it was the original architect’s design:
[note: 32]
 
Court:
 
 
Okay. So when you talk about design, ... you also mean the section as you [referred] to in 397 (
ie
, Crawford report internal p 4).
 
 
A:
 
 
Yes 
 
55     In another part of her cross-examination, Ms Toh was informed by Mr Thiagarajan that Mr Aung had been shown the Crawford Report and had denied having informed her that the defendant’s management was aware of the gypsum flooring. Ms Toh said:
[note: 33]
A:
Er … subsequently he did clarified [
sic
] with me, er, through an email, er, but actually it’s not from himself but rather from his supervisor that, er he is … he’s not an expert in.. in reading all these drawings. And so he’s not in a position to … to commit himself and say whether he’s are or not aware.
Q:
But this statement says that the management is aware. You said …
A:
Yah, correct. This … okay, this report was put up straight, er …
Q:
Sorry.
A:
… a few days after my … my site attendance. That means my first gathering of information, okay. So subsequently I asked for the drawing and all that. Then Mr Au [
sic
] superior okay clarified with me.
...
 
Q:
So what did you do with the email, Ms Toh?
A:
I forward this to insurer.
...
 
Q:
So are you saying that … are you maintaining that your report is accurate on that part today?
A:
It’s accurate because there and then this is the information I received in the first instance.
Q:
Thank you. So management was aware?
A:
That was what I gather [
sic
].
56     Notably, during her re-examination, Ms Toh shifted from her earlier testimony. In her re-examination, she conceded that the question which she had posed to Mr Aung had been somewhat unclear, and she herself was unable to recall the precise question which she had asked. Her answers to the questions posed by the defendant’s counsel, Mr Eu, during re-examination were as follows:
[note: 34]
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
Yes. So just one--- the last question on---on this point is so when you said that Mr Au told you that the management is aware of this design, do you mean that they are aware of an opening or do you mean that they are aware of this gypsum board covering the opening?
 
 
A: 
 
 
I cannot remember the specific question that I’ve, er, asked him. I think, on the whole, I just asked him, this design, whether the management is aware of this design. So he could, I mean, er, he could have misinterpreted my---my questions.
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
Sorry, what was your question? I mean you said he misinter---
 
 
A: 
 
 
Yah, he could have mis---
 
 
Court:
 
 
---misunderstood, right, your question so there must have been a question right? So what was your question?
 
 
A: 
 
 
What I see on that day is that, erm, there---there---there was an opening.
 
 
Court:
 
 
Opening as in the---the gypsum board having given way?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Yes, correct. And then there’s the gypsum covering it. So, to me, it seems like a---a---a design so I asked Mr Aung---Aung on the whole---this whole design--- this design.
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
57     I am mindful that Ms Toh had stated earlier that Mr Aung had informed her during the site attendance that the defendant’s management was aware of the defect in the floor design of the Riser 
before
 the accident.
[note: 35]
 She then prepared the Crawford Report, which was a preliminary report. From my reading of the overall evidence, there is in my view real doubt that Mr Aung had told Ms Toh that the defendant’s management was aware of the “cemented floor”, meaning the gypsum flooring.
58     In any case, the Crawford Report, being a preliminary report, is not determinative of the defendant’s knowledge of the state of affairs in the Riser. Ms Toh did not issue a further report after she received some drawings from the defendant. She passed the drawings to the defendant’s insurers, who asked her to speak to Mr Aung about them. According to Ms Toh, a few days later, she received an email from Mr Jason Teo (“Mr Teo”) of Melana International Pte Ltd, whom she believed was Mr Aung’s supervisor. Mr Teo had emailed her to clarify that as Mr Aung was not an expert in reading drawings, he was accordingly not in a position to comment on whether the defendant’s management was aware of the design flaws in the Riser’s flooring.
[note: 36]
59     As between Ms Toh and Mr Aung, I prefer the evidence of Mr Aung. Mr Aung’s position – 
ie
, the defendant’s management was unaware of the gypsum flooring – is more credible. I also reach this conclusion supported by other objective evidence. First, the Crawford Report was based on hearsay evidence. It was a preliminary report that was made after talking to people, and Ms Toh’s conclusions were drawn from those conversations. There was no objective collaborative evidence to verify or test the veracity of what she was told or her own understanding of the situation. Secondly, other than forwarding Mr Teo’s email to the defendant’s insurers, there was no investigation by Ms Toh to follow up on Mr Teo’s email.
[note: 37]
 Thirdly, the as-built drawings (also produced in discovery) were sent to Ms Toh after she prepared the Crawford Report and they gave no indication of any design flaw in the Riser including the fact that gypsum plasterboard was used to cover the internal open space in the Riser. Maintenance works had been carried out on the FS panel in the Riser over the years by Colt’s employees without incident. There was little reason for the defendant to suspect that something was amiss.
60     Moving on from Ms Toh’s statements in the Crawford Report, the evidence before me did not support a finding that the defendant was aware of the existence of the gypsum plasterboard used to cover the internal open space in the Riser.
61     First, all the witnesses for both sides testified that visually, the colour of the gypsum plasterboard was similar to that of the concrete beam in the Riser.
[note: 38]
 This was also accepted by the plaintiff’s expert, who opined:
[note: 39]
plasterboard when laid horizontally for some six years (as it has been in this case) will darken to a similar colour to concrete, which together with the accumulation of dust and dirt on its surface that would have ingressed through the louvred doors to this riser (see Photograph No 1- Appendix B of our Supplementary Expert’s Report dated 29 July 2011) will give the appearance of a cemented floor”, as demonstrated in Photographs Nos 7,8, and 9 included in Appendix F in our Expert’s Report dated 18 January 2011, where both the concrete floor and the plasterboard clearly have the a similar colour.
In short, there was no evidence that the gypsum plasterboard was visible to anyone including the defendant’s servant or agent.
62     Second, the as-built drawings which the defendant obtained when it took possession of the common areas of the Property. I have already touched on this evidence above when dealing with Mr Marshall’s evidence on the as-built drawings and his opinion of a design flaw in the Riser. As stated above, the as-built drawings gave no indication of any design flaw in the Riser including the fact that the internal open space in the Riser was covered by gypsum plasterboard.
63     Third, there was also no evidence of any previous incident in the Riser or evidence to suggest that any of the service technicians who had previously worked in the Riser had alerted the defendant to the danger posed by the gypsum flooring. Even during servicing, there was usually no need for a service technician to stand on the gypsum flooring as it was too low to reach the FS panel mounted on the wall. Given the layout of the Riser and the FS panel, the gypsum flooring was not the usual area for a service technician to stand on to access the FS panel.
64     This was attested to by Mr Wong, who had previously carried out work in the Riser:
[note: 40]
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
So from 2009 to 2010, before 22
nd 
of June 2010, you were there, you---you went to that particular riser 5 to 6 times?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Er, about 3 times like that.
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And on those occasions ... were there any occasion in which you actually [needed] to go down to the lower level of the platform or flooring?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Mm, mm, no.
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
And in carrying out the work on the panel, you ... can carry out the work standing on the upper level, is that correct?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Er, yes, right, mm.
 
65     The only reason the plaintiff stood on the gypsum flooring was because he had dropped a light bulb. In the words of the plaintiff himself, he jumped down to retrieve the bulb because “it looked of a similar material from the place that I was working”.
[note: 41]
 This was confirmed by the plaintiff during re-examination:
[note: 42]
...
 
Q:
And you were asked before you jumped down, did you not---did not occur to you to check with Wong before doing so and you said, “It did not occur to me.” Is there any reason?
A:
Yes, there was no indication of danger of the lower floor not being load bearing and so I would expect the lower floor to be made of concrete, similar to the platform I was standing on.
Q:
Why was that so?
A:
They looked exactly alike.
...
 
66     This is a convenient juncture to digress for a moment to mention the use of the phrase “load bearing” in the evidence. It was the plaintiff who explained that he had used the expression “load bearing” and not “weight bearing” because of his size and weight. He said:
[note: 43]
Q:
A non load bearing or something that can’t support your weight basically in that sense.
A:
I was saying non load bearing.
Q:
Non load bearing. Why? Why this specific non load bearing?
A:
Well, I will assist... well. A lighter weighted person than I would also not be supported. That’s what I mean.
67     Finally, Mr Aung testified that the door to the Riser was usually locked to prevent vandalism, with access given only for servicing:
[note: 44]
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
All right, I’ll ask you just one question. This is just for completeness. Why---why is the access door to the riser locked?
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
So---all our riser are too---are locked. When for servicing or authorized access only, we issue the key. Always locked.
 
 
Court: 
 
 
Is there a reason for that?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
Court: 
 
 
Why? What is the reason for that?
 
 
A: 
 
 
Because there are odds---in this, er, Riser, we have Sumi riser, in the riser, we have a electrical riser, telcom---communication risers, telephone riser, TV riser, all these, er, locked because, er, we afraid this---the, er, vandalism. If, er, we---we did not lock, somebody they will go and, er, damage our---
 
 
Court: 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
A:
 
 
---equipment in the---damage our telecommunication system. Then the electrical riser also very important for us. Once the electric power shut down, we have to suffer a lot.
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
68     In the light of all these pieces of evidence taken cumulatively, it is more likely than not that the defendant was unaware of the gypsum flooring in the Riser, and I so hold. In my view, the first condition in 
Indermaur v Dames
 has not been satisfied (see condition (a) at [17] above).
Other matters
69     The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was under a duty to inspect or warn of the danger constituted by the gypsum flooring. Applying the principles enunciated in 
Indermaur v Dames
 (see also 
Hawkins
 at 338), I hold that there is no such duty unless the plaintiff has satisfied the requirement of proving that the defendant knew of the gypsum flooring in the Riser and either knew or ought to know of the danger posed by the gypsum flooring. It is only then that the defendant would be under a duty to use reasonable care to prevent damage from that danger. In that scenario, the exercise of reasonable care, depending on the facts, may include a duty to inspect the gypsum flooring and to warn the plaintiff of the danger.
70     Given my findings at [68] above, the alleged duty to take reasonable care does not arise for determination.
Conclusion
71     To summarise, for the reasons stated above, the defendant was not aware of the gypsum flooring in the Riser. It was not aware of the internal open space in the Riser; that a layer of gypsum plasterboard was used to cover the internal open space in the Riser, and that gypsum was not a load-bearing material and thus posed a danger to service technicians working in the Riser like the plaintiff. In the result, I agree with Mr Eu that the plaintiff has not established on the overall evidence the threshold requirement for the existence of a duty of care on the defendant’s part as the occupier of the Property. For the same reason, the plaintiff’s claim in negligence is also not made out. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed. I reach this decision with regret, being acutely aware of the consequences of the accident to the plaintiff, for whose injuries one can have sympathy.

 Quentin Loh J:
1       This is a case involving overseas training centres for the training, testing and certification (under the requirements of the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”)) and subsequent mobilisation of construction workers from Bangladesh to Singapore.
2       There were three applications in these two actions before me:
(a)     In Suit No 63 of 2012 (“Suit 63”), Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd (“Virsagi”) sued Welltech Construction Pte Ltd (“Welltech”) (both being Singapore-incorporated companies) for an injunction to restrain Welltech from interfering with an agreement entered into between Virsagi and Gazipur Air Express International on or about 26 April 2009, (“the Gazipur Agreement”) in general, and in particular to allow Virsagi to resume registration of certain tests, processing the test results and to mobilise the workers who have passed the test, or alternatively for unlawful interference with the operation of the Gazipur Agreement, as well as for damages and an account of profits.
(i)       In Suit 63, Welltech took out an application, Summons No 829 of 2012 (“Summons 829”) to stay Suit 63 on the ground of 
lis alibi pendens
 and/or 
forum non conveniens
 and to extend time to file its defence until Summons 829 was disposed of.
(b)     In Suit No 64 of 2012 (“Suit 64”), Virsagi sued Ferdous Ahmed Badel (who claims it should be spelt “Fardous Ahamad Badal”) trading as Gazipur Air Express International (“Badal” or “Gazipur” as the case may be), a sole proprietorship registered in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for wrongful termination and/or breach of the Gazipur Agreement, an injunction to restrain Gazipur from terminating the Gazipur Agreement in general and in particular to allow Virsagi to resume registration of certain tests, processing the test results and to mobilise the workers who have passed the test under the Gazipur Agreement, and for damages and an account of profits.
(i)       In Suit 64, Virsagi took out an application, Summons No 869 of 2012 (“Summons 869”), for an interlocutory injunction restraining Gazipur from bringing any worker tested at the Welltech Test Centre (also referred to as “WTPL’s OTC” in these grounds of decision) in Dhaka, Bangladesh into Singapore unless Gazipur complied with the Gazipur Agreement and included Virsagi in its overseas testing centre business in Dhaka, Bangladesh; alternatively, that Gazipur provides security in the sum of $1,224,000 every six months in lieu of an interlocutory injunction; and
(ii)       Gazipur has taken out an application, Summons in Chambers 985 of 2012 (“Summons 985”), to stay Suit 64 on the ground of 
lis alibi pendens
 and/or 
forum non conveniens
 and to extend time to file a defence until Summons 829 is disposed of.
3       After hearing the parties, I dismissed Virsagi’s application in Summons 869 and granted Gazipur’s and Welltech’s applications in Summons 985 and Summons 829 respectively for a stay in Suit 63 and Suit 64 with the usual cost orders in favour of the successful parties. Virsagi has appealed against my decision and I set out the reasons for my decision.
Facts
The joint venture for overseas test centres
4       The facts in [4] to [9] herein are not in dispute. In 2006, the BCA invited companies to set up authorised overseas test centres (“OTCs”) in India and Bangladesh in a bid to get workers for the construction industry to be trained, tested and certified before bringing them into Singapore. Welltech was established in the construction industry in Singapore and met the eligibility criteria set out by the BCA. Virsagi had the necessary expertise in operating an OTC but did not meet BCA’s criteria. Virsagi’s Mr Victor Lee (“Victor”) approached Welltech to collaborate. Welltech agreed.
5       On 6 December 2006, BCA granted Welltech approval to operate an OTC in Dhaka, Bangladesh (“Dhaka”). This approval or licence was for 3 years from 6 December 2009 and would be reviewed on a yearly basis thereafter. It was a condition of the approval that Welltech set up a company in Bangladesh to manage the OTC and retain at least a 30% shareholding.
6       Virsagi introduced a Bangladesh company, Rupsha Overseas Ltd, (“Rupsha”), to Welltech to be their local partner for the joint venture. A joint venture company was incorporated on 25 November 2011 and called Welltech Test Pvt Ltd (“WTPL”). An agreement, which was undated, was entered into between Welltech, Virsagi and Rupsha (“the Rupsha Agreement”), and this was submitted to the BCA by Welltech in a letter dated 24 November 2006. One Mr Jalal Yunos, a director of Rupsha, signed the Rupsha Agreement on behalf of Rupsha.
7       Sometime in early 2007, Virsagi and Welltech entered into a written agreement (“the Principal Agreement”), the relevant terms of which were:
(a)     A joint venture company, to be called WTPL, was to be incorporated with Virsagi holding 40%, Welltech holding 30% and the local partner holding the remaining 30% of the share capital;
(b)     Virsagi would bear all costs and expenses in the set up of WTPL and the OTC – Welltech was not required to put in any funds for this purpose;
(c)     Virsagi would establish the OTC, obtain all government, regulatory and other approvals required in Bangladesh to establish and operate an OTC;
(d)     Welltech would receive a payment of $200 per worker who passed the test;
(e)     The agreement was not terminable for the first 3 years. Thereafter either party could terminate the agreement by serving 6 months’ notice to the other party;
(f)     The agreement was governed by Singapore law and the parties irrevocably submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of Singapore courts.
8       Virsagi entered into an agreement dated 26 April 2007 with a local partner in Dhaka, GN International, to establish the OTC (“the Virsagi-GNI Agreement”). The OTC was duly set up and put into operation. As mentioned above (at [6]), WTPL was incorporated in Dhaka in November 2007. WTPL’s shares were held by representatives of the participant companies of the joint venture and not the participant companies themselves as provided for in the Principal Agreement (see [7(a)] above). Hence, out of the 100 shares that were issued, Victor held 40 shares as a representative of Virsagi, Mr Woon Wee Phong, a director of Welltech, held 30 shares and Badal/Gazipur held or came to hold 30 shares. Welltech and Badal further contend that WTPL remained dormant and operations and payments to and from the OTC (“WTPL’s OTC”) were made independently of WTPL between the parties by mutual agreement.
9       By a letter dated 10 January 2011, Welltech served a written notice of termination of the Principal Agreement as required under Clause 7 of the said agreement. Although Clause 11 of the Principal Agreement provided for a notice period of 6 months, at Victor’s request, Welltech extended the termination date to 31 December 2011. It is not disputed by any party that the Principal Agreement was validly brought to an end by Welltech on 31 December 2011.
10     Welltech alleged that the Rupsha Agreement was not properly implemented and without its knowledge, Rupsha was replaced with GN International and yet later with Gazipur. Welltech further alleged that Virsagi did not provide any funds and it later found out that almost all the funds were put up by Gazipur. Virsagi pleaded in Suit 64 that on or about 26 April 2009, GN International’s responsibilities under the Virsagi-GNI Agreement were assigned to Gazipur. Pursuant to this, Virsagi and Gazipur entered into the Gazipur Agreement.
11     Virsagi’s claims against Welltech did not, and indeed could not, arise under the Principal Agreement as all parties accept that the Principal Agreement was lawfully brought to an end on 31 December 2011. Virsagi instead sued Welltech in tort for inducing a breach of Gazipur Agreement and for unlawful interference with that agreement. Virsagi alleged that Welltech had taken steps together with Gazipur, to set up another OTC called Welltech Education Centre Pvt Ltd to divert the training and testing of workers away from WTPL, thereby bypassing Virsagi. Virsagi therefore sought an injunction to restrain Welltech from interfering with the Gazipur Agreement in general and in particular to allow Virsagi to resume registration for the tests, processing of test results and mobilisation of workers who have passed the tests as these were within Virsagi’s scope of works under the Gazipur Agreement.
The Gazipur Agreement
12     The relevant portions of the Gazipur Agreement are as follows:
(a)     Clause 1, the “Introduction” clause to the Gazipur Agreement, recited some background to the BCA approving the setting up of overseas test centres, including those in Dhaka, Bangladesh and states that Virsagi, “... thru its nominee, WellTech Construction Pte Ltd, applied to set up a new OTC’s it has since been successful, and has now obtained an in principle approval from BCA”.
(b)     In Clause 3, the subject matter was described as an “agreement to establish a BCA approved OTC in Dhaka Bangladesh as well as facilities for training or workers to take the test at the OTC and the mobilization of the workers to work in Singapore”;
(c)     In Clause 4, the Gazipur Agreement provided that Gazipur had to deal with all the paperwork and permits from the Government of Bangladesh, procure a piece of land and erect a building suitable for the OTC at its cost, have the capacity to accommodate 500 workers, take full responsibility for the OTC as Virsagi will only be working from the Singapore side, train up the required number of workers with 3 months training and testing, make all payments for the registration and mobilization of the workers, pay the annual fee for the BCA test computers, pay $1,000 per month and all air fare, accommodation, meal and transport costs for Virsagi’s “Liaison Person” who is “to support” the BCA test (
ie
 the tests to the standards or requirements set by the BCA), and comply fully with all instructions and directions that were given by the BCA and Welltech;
(d)     Under Clause 5, Virsagi had to respond to the BCA as necessary, send its employee to Dhaka each month “to support the BCA test”, process the test results, and mobilize workers to work in Singapore as soon as they passed their tests including arranging for approval for these workers to be employed in Singapore;
(e)     Under Clause 6, Gazipur was to be fully responsible for the entire cost of training and testing the workers in Dhaka, including payment of fees to Virsagi for registration and BCA test fees;
(f)     Under Clause 7, Gazipur had to send the list of workers who pass their tests with $1,000 per worker to Virsagi for the latter to obtain in-principle approval (“IPA”) from the Ministry of Manpower for their employment in Singapore. Upon receiving IPA, Gazipur would pay the remaining balance of $3,130 per worker 5 days before their flight to Singapore;
(g)     Clause 12 was a termination clause which provided:
This agreement is non terminable so long as the Second Party [Virsagi] principal continues to possess a license for the testing or worker. However, if the license obtained by the Second Parties is cancelled for any reason whatsoever, then the agreement is deemed to be cancelled, and its provision is rendered null and void.
(h)     Clause 14 provided:
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties have an exclusive relationship with one another in respect of their operations at the training and test centre known as the WellTech Test Centre.
(i)     Clause 16, the “Governing Law” clause, read:
The parties hereto agree that matters pertaining to the training of workers in Dhaka, the operations of the WellTech test centre, the mob of workers to the centre for training, i.e., matters arising on the Dhaka side shall be governed by the laws of Bangladesh. On the other hand, matters pertaining to the registration of workers for test, the rules and directions of the BCA and the license, etc i.e. matters arising on the Singapore side shall be governed by the laws of Singapore.
13     It should be mentioned that the Virsagi-GNI Agreement was very similar to the Gazipur Agreement. It provided that GN International would procure the land and construct the OTC building at its own cost and Virsagi would invest a sum equivalent to S$200,000 to equipt the OTC. There was an apparent falling out between Mr Aminul Hossain Sarker (“Mr Sarker”) of GN International and Badal, who was also a partner in GN International, and a fresh agreement – the Gazipur Agreement – thus came into being.
14     Welltech contended that Virsagi entered into these agreements without its knowledge or participation and Welltech was not a party to the same and denied that it was ever a “nominee” of Gazipur as set out in the recital at [12(a)] above.
15     The commercial attraction of the venture to Welltech was that it did not have to come up with any funds or expend much time effort to run this venture in Bangladesh. It merely had to obtain the BCA licence and everything else would be run by Virsagi and Welltech would be paid $200 per worker. Virsagi would have to find the local Bangladesh partner, who would then secure the land, construct the OTC building to accommodate 500 workers at a time, operate the test centre and liaise with the Bangladesh authorities. It appears, and it is not necessary for me at this stage to make any findings on this score, that Virsagi got the Bangladesh party to obtain the land, erect the building and was itself paid a sum of money per worker, but Virsagi was of course much more involved in the testing of workers, obtaining certification for the workers and in the mobilisation of these workers to Singapore. Virsagi was paid fairly significant sums per worker, although some of which went towards defraying the costs of housing the worker and putting the worker through the tests at the OTC.
16     There were some further factual allegations that should be set out for completeness at this interlocutory stage:
(a)     In a court document (that bore resemblance to a petition) filed in Company Matter No 8 of 2012 in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh at Dhaka (“Dhaka CM 8/2012”), Victor sued WTPL as 1
st
 Defendant, Mr Woon Wee Phong as 2
nd
 Defendant and Badal as 3
rd
 Defendant; (there were other respondents, referred to as “pro-forma parties” like the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, the Secretary, Ministry of Expatriates, Welfare and Overseas Development, Bangladesh Secretariat, and the Director General, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, stated to be added for efficacious disposition of the proceedings, but no issues arise on that score). Victor’s action was based on the minority oppression provision, section 233, of the Bangladesh Companies Act.
(b)     Dhaka CM 8/2012 stated that originally, Virsagi entered into an agreement with Rupsha for the establishment of the OTC on 24 November 2006 in anticipation of Welltech obtaining the licence to do so from BCA. Rupsha was subsequently no longer interested to collaborate with Virsagi and Welltech (Welltech denies any knowledge of this), and Virsagi approached (although it should be noted that the language used in Dhaka CM 8/2012 was ambiguous and it could be interpreted to mean Welltech and Virsagi made a joint approach to) GN International to collaborate as the local partner. It was also alleged that Badal, a partner in GN International, had his own recruitment licence from the Bangladesh authorities under “The Gazipur Air International”. Dhaka CM 8/2012 went on to state that an agreement was entered into between Gazipur and GN International, whose managing partner was Mr Sarker.
(b)    This agreement between “...Sarker, Managing Partner, GN International...” and Virsagi, (
ie
 the Virsagi-GNI Agreement) was dated 26 April 2007.
(c)    Dhaka CM 8/2012 also stated that WTPL was set up with the representatives of the participant companies holding its shares (as stated at [8] above), but explained that GN International’s shares were issued in the name of Badal, one of the partners of GN International. It did not otherwise explain why Mr Sarker’s name was not used.
(d)    Dhaka CM 8/2012 then stated that the monies collected for the purposes of WTPL’s OTC and the training, testing and mobilisation of the workers were not banked into WTPL’s bank account but was, by mutual agreement, disbursed amongst Welltech, Virsagi and GN International.
(e)    Dhaka CM 8/2012 also stated that since January 2009, certain differences arose between the shareholders of WTPL and it was said that the disputes arose because Badal wanted to replace GN International with Gazipur as the local partner.
(f)    This explained why the Gazipur Agreement, dated 26 April 2009, contained Recital (d) which referred to Sarker’s inability to discharge its obligations and that Gazipur was brought in as a substitute. Recital (d) also provided that if Mr Sarker or GN International sought legal redress against Virsagi in the Bangladeshi courts, Gazipur would be liable for all expenses or payments that were made to Mr Sarker or GN International.
(g)    Dhaka CM 8/2012 also recited that, (and unfortunately the document is badly photocopied and cut-off at the end, but doing the best interpolation that I can), Badal began to deal with Welltech circumventing Virsagi. It also stated that Badal sought to do business with one Mr Taneem Hasan, with whom Virsagi had disputes. Consequently, to settle these disputes, Virsagi and Gazipur entered into the Gazipur Agreement and later a Supplementary Agreement dated 19 August 2009.
The Bangladesh proceedings: Dhaka CM 8/2012
17     Virsagi did not dispute that Victor commenced Dhaka CM 8/2012 on 5 January 2012 in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division (Statutory Original Jurisdiction) in Dhaka (“Dhaka High Court”). Its complaint was that the other majority shareholders were carrying out the business of an OTC and mobilising workers with other parties without the participation of WTPL and Virsagi. Virsagi sought in Dhaka CM 8/2012:-
(a)     a direction to the other shareholders of WTPL “... to continue their business as an Overseas Testing Centre in Bangladesh through [WTPL] with the active participation of the petitioner”;
(b)     pending Dhaka CM 8/2012, an ad-interim order restraining Mr Woon Wee Phong and Badal “from doing Overseas Testing Center business in Bangladesh for export of manpower to Singapore by themselves, or through any company in which they are an officer or a shareholder, except through the Overseas Testing Centre operated by [WTPL] and with the active participation of the petitioner”.
18     On 9 January 2012, Victor obtained an ad-interim order from the Dhaka High Court restraining Welltech and Gazipur from doing OTC business in Bangladesh for export of manpower to Singapore by themselves or through any company except through WTPL and with the active participation of Virsagi/Victor Lee. It appeared that a stay on this order was granted on 15 January 2012.
19     It is of some significance that Dhaka CM 8/2012 also referred to some further factual allegations:
(a)     there was a reference at paragraphs 12 to 14 of Dhaka CM 8/2012 that when Welltech terminated the Principal Agreement, there was some offer that Virsagi’s shares in WTPL be bought over by the other two shareholders;
(b)     it was alleged that there was a subsequent agreement (which appeared to be partly oral and partly confirmed in certain emails between the parties) for Welltech and Gazipur to buy out Virsagi at a price equivalent to $250 per worker who passed the tests at WTPL’s OTC in 2012 and subject to the condition that WTPL and Badal did not do any business with Mr Taneem Hasan and thereafter Victor’s role was subsequently carried out by a person named Mr L K Peh;
(c)     Victor alleged that he subsequently found out that Badal was engaged in business with Mr Taneem Hasan and a meeting was held in Singapore between Virsagi and Welltech in November 2011;
(d)     Victor then made further allegations of, 
eg
, his concerns of Mr Taneem Hasan’s use of the WTPL’s OTC and his discovery of a transfer of business from WTPL’s OTC to somewhere else. A disagreement later broke out and Victor withdrew his offer to sell Virsagi’s shares in WTPL.
20     There was an affidavit filed by Mr Muntasir Uddin Ahmed on 23 February 2012 which deposed to the backlog facing the judiciary of Bangladesh. He stated that for civil cases involving a “money suit”, it would take 5 to 10 years in Bangladesh before the outcome would be known.
21     Notwithstanding this, the Dhaka High Court delivered its judgment in Dhaka CM 8/2012. The written judgment recorded that Dhaka CM 8/2012 was heard on 15 and 16 April 2012 and a written judgment was delivered on 21 June 2012. In a detailed 22-page judgment, Abdur Rahman J found, 
inter alia
, that WTPL was a non-functioning company, Victor and Badal were running the OTC business under a private arrangement, Mr Woon Wee Phong (of Welltech) was only liable to lend its licence from the BCA for establishing and running the OTC business in Dhaka and the OTC business set up under the private arrangement had no connection with WTPL. Abdur Rahman J dismissed the petition for minority oppression and discharged the injunction. The Dhaka High Court also stated that the respondents, Mr Woon Wee Phong (of Welltech) and Badal were free to continue with the business of the OTC in accordance with the private arrangement between the parties. Victor has appealed against the Dhaka High Court’s decision and the appeal is pending.
Analysis
22     Having set out these undisputed facts and factual allegations, I now turn to the applications before me.
Lis Alibi Pendens
23     Virsagi accepted that there were identical parties in Dhaka CM 8/2012 and Suit 63 and Suit 64 but contended that the issues of fact and law to be determined were different. Although the issues to be decided between Virsagi and Welltech (which lay in tort) and that between Virsagi and Gazipur (which lay in contract) were different, the relief claimed against Welltech and Gazipur was substantially the same – Virsagi wanted to ensure Welltech could only carry on OTC business in Bangladesh with Badal with the involvement of Virsagi and could not exclude Virsagi.
24     Virsagi’s primary claim against Welltech in Suit 63 was framed as follows:
An injunction to restrain [Welltech] from interference with the operation of the Gazipur Agreement in general and 
in particular to allow
 [Virsagi] 
to resume registration for the tests, processing the test results and to mobilize the workers who have passed the test
, being [Virsagi’s] scope of works under the Gazipur Agreement.
[emphasis added]
Virsagi’s other claims against Welltech were for damages and an account of profits from the registration and mobilisation of workers.
25     Virsagi’s primary claim against Gazipur in Suit 64 was framed as follows:
An injunction to restrain [Gazipur] from terminating the Gazipur Agreement in general and 
in particular to allow
 [Virsagi] 
to resume registration for the tests, processing the test results and to mobilize the workers who have passed the test
, being [Virsagi’s] scope of works under the Gazipur Agreement.
[emphasis added]
Virsagi’s other claims against Gazipur were also for damages and an account of profits from the operation of WTPL’s OTC and any other OTC formed with Welltech.
26     Virsagi’s reliefs claimed against WTPL, Mr Woon Wee Phong and Badal in Dhaka CM 8/2012 have been set out above (at [17]) and it would be seen that they were substantially the same as the reliefs claimed in Suit 63 and Suit 64. The essential three-party arrangement between the parties cannot be overlooked although it had been broken down into the Virsagi-Welltech component (with Welltech holding the BCA licence and Virsagi with the Bangladesh connections and the ability to run the business in Dhaka) and the Virsagi-Bangladesh Party component (with Virsagi having the BCA “contact” in Singapore and offering the Bangladesh partner a share in exchange for getting the land, putting up the building and obtaining the Bangladesh approvals) and hence the very bare tri-partite agreement over the joint-venture vehicle, the Rupsha Agreement. Virsagi chose to split this arrangement into two contracts in all probability for its own commercial relevance and protection. Welltech had the BCA licence to offer and Badal had the land, the building, funding in Bangladesh and ability to obtain regulatory approval for the project. Virsagi could do neither of these. This scheme could not work without Badal or Welltech, but it could, without Virsagi. Unfortunately for Virsagi, it did not secure itself as far as Welltech was concerned, for longer than the three years set out in the Principal Agreement.
27     The law on 
lis alibi pendens
 is settled and has been authoritatively set out by the Court of Appeal in 
Yusen Air & Sea Services (S) Pte Ltd v KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
 
[1999] 2 SLR(R) 955
 (“
Yusen v KLM”)
. Virsagi conceded that the first element, 
ie
 that the parties before the courts of Singapore and Bangladesh are the same, was satisfied. As noted above (at [23]), Virsagi’s main contention was that the facts and issues in the two sets of proceedings were different. I was of the view that this was not so. In Singapore, Virsagi sued in Suit 63 Welltech in tort for inducing a breach of contract or unlawful interference with a contract (
ie
 the Gazipur Agreement), and Virsagi sued Badal in Suit 64 for breaching that same contract and for an injunction ordering Badal to perform that contract. Before the Dhaka High Court, Virsagi claimed the same relief against the same “defendants”. The common issues before the Singapore court and the Dhaka High Court are – (i) is Virsagi entitled to insist that Badal/Gazipur continue with the Gazipur Agreement when the Principal Agreement has been validly terminated and (ii) in these circumstances, whether Welltech and Badal/Gazipur could carry on OTC business in Dhaka without involving Virsagi. The remedy sought was the same. Moreover, the issues arose from the same factual matrix. Had the issue of 
lis alibi pendens
 been the only issue before me, I would have been prepared to grant a stay of Suit 63 and Suit 64 on the facts as they appeared at this stage.
Forum Non Conveniens
28     Even if the 
lis alibi pendens
 ground had not been made out, Welltech and Gazipur made compelling arguments for a stay of proceedings on the basis of 
forum non conveniens
. Again the law in this regard is settled: see 
Koh Kay Yew v Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd
 
[1997] 2 SLR(R) 148
, 
Yusen v KLM
 and 
Rickshaw Investments Ltd & Anor v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377
 and the application of the well-accepted 
Spiliada
 principles in 
Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd
 
[1987] AC 460
. These authoritative precedents direct that I should consider, at the first stage (in determining whether Singapore is the appropriate forum), factors such as whether there is another more appropriate forum, the general connecting factors, the jurisdiction where the tort occurred or where the contract was made or operates, the choice of law clause, the effect of the concurrent proceedings in Bangladesh, and in Singapore, the factual disputes that will arise in these proceedings, the location of witnesses and the location of the evidence.
29     Welltech submitted that it was the party holding the BCA approval or licence to run an OTC in Bangladesh. Its agreement with Virsagi (
ie
 the Principal Agreement) was validly brought to an end. Virsagi had no claim in contract against Welltech. The Principal Agreement did not provide for the dissolution of WTPL. From the evidence before me, and as found by the Dhaka High Court, WTPL was a dormant company as the parties chose to deal with the money payments independent of WTPL. WTPL was a company incorporated in Bangladesh.
30     Virsagi’s claim against Welltech lay in the tort of inducing a breach of the Gazipur Agreement or unlawful interference with the Gazipur Agreement and it is to that agreement that I now turn.
31     The subject matter of the Gazipur Agreement was expressed at Clause 3 to be the establishment of a BCA-approved OTC in Dhaka and facilities for the training and testing of workers and the mobilisation of workers to Singapore. A “BCA-approved OTC in Dhaka” was therefore, in my view, a crucial foundational element. Without a BCA-approved OTC and a BCA licence holder, there would have been no point testing workers as none of those tests would have been recognised in Singapore nor would they have aided or enabled such workers to come to Singapore. Virsagi and Gazipur together could not establish a BCA-approved OTC. They needed Welltech or someone like Welltech to participate and offer a BCA licence. Under the Gazipur Agreement, Virsagi no longer had a “nominee” (see Clause 1(c)) or a “Second Party principal” (see Clause 12). There were other provisions within the Gazipur Agreement that could no longer operate and were rendered meaningless when the Principal Agreement came to an end. For example, Clause 4(i) of the Gazipur Agreement provided that Gazipur had to comply fully with all instructions and directions given by BCA and Welltech. However no instruction or directions would have been forthcoming on termination of the Principal Agreement. Turning to Clause 5(a) of the Gazipur Agreement, which set out Virsagi’s obligation to respond to BCA as necessary including attending their meetings in Singapore and relating information or instructions from the BCA to Gazipur – similarly there would be no such meetings as Virsagi was not recognised by the BCA. Any tests carried out by Virsagi and Gazipur without Welltech’s BCA Licence after 31 December 2011 would not be recognised by BCA unless they could secure another BCA-approved licence holder. Without a BCA-recognised test, no workers would be mobilised to Singapore.
32     Virsagi submitted that under Clause 12, the Gazipur Agreement was “...non terminable so long as the Second Party principal continue[d] to possess a license for the testing or worker.” The “Second Party” referred to in the Gazipur Agreement was Virsagi but the agreement did not state who the “Second Party principal” was. In Clause 1 or the “Introduction” clause to the Gazipur Agreement, as previously noted, Welltech was described as Virsagi’s “nominee”. Welltech was obviously no longer a “nominee” if indeed it could be so described in the first place. More importantly, Clause 12 went on to provide that if the licence obtained by the “Second Parties” (which was again not defined) “... [was] cancelled for any reason whatsoever, then the agreement [was] deemed to be cancelled, and its provision rendered null and void.” Gazipur forcefully argued that the Gazipur agreement came to an end when the Principal Agreement came to an end. Virsagi strenuously maintained that since Welltech still held a licence, the Gazipur Agreement was not at an end.
33     With respect, I could not see how it could be contended that the Gazipur Agreement was still in force, capable of practical implementation and therefore enforceable. However I note that Clause 16 of the Gazipur Agreement provided that all matters that pertained to the training of workers in Dhaka, the operations of WTPL’s OTC, the mobilisation of workers to the centre for training, or “...matters arising on the Dhaka side...” shall be governed by the laws of Bangladesh. No evidence was put before me on what the law of Bangladesh was on the issue of whether the Gazipur Agreement survived termination. The only assistance that I could glean was that the Dhaka High Court had, in dismissing Victor’s claim for relief from minority oppression, specifically ruled that the respondents were at liberty to continue with the business of running an OTC in accordance with private arrangement between the parties. That decision has of course been appealed.
34     The second half of the governing law clause in Clause 16 did not apply as it stated that in “...matters pertaining to the registration of workers for tests, the rules and directions of BCA and the licence, etc, matters arising on the Singapore side shall be governed by the laws of Singapore.”
35     Virsagi was in effect asking for a backdoor continuation or enforcement of the Principal Agreement and for the implication of restraint of trade covenants in its agreements with Gazipur and Welltech, 
viz
, to ensure that Welltech could only carry on OTC business in Bangladesh through WTPL with Gazipur 
and
 Virsagi as long as Welltech had the BCA licence. Even if Welltech was no longer obliged to work with Virsagi, Virsagi was seeking to ensure that Gazipur was bound not to work with anyone else, including Welltech, in the OTC business.
36     In addition to these factors and considerations, I took the view that Bangladesh was the more appropriate forum to determine these disputes:
(a)     The Gazipur Agreement was signed in Bangladesh with a Bangldesh national or resident, Badal or his sole proprietorship, Gazipur. The breach of the Gazipur Agreement, if any, occurred in Bangladesh. The interference with the Gazipur Agreement, if any, would operate in Bangladesh. The Gazipur Agreement was governed by the law of Bangladesh and under its express provision, Gazipur took full responsibility for WTPL’s OTC as Virsagi would only be working on the “Singapore side”.
(b)     The Gazipur Agreement dealt with operations in relation to recruitment of workers, accommodation, training, testing, certification and mobilisation of workers in Bangladesh. All payments collected from the workers and disbursements or payments were also made in and from Bangladesh and bank accounts in Bangladesh. The allegations of continuing breaches related to the training, testing and certification and mobilisation of Bangladesh workers in Dhaka and the alleged use of WTPL’s OTC to the exclusion of Virsagi.
(c)     Any accounts, papers and other documents relating to the dispute are in Bangladesh.
(d)     WTPL was a Bangladeshi corporation and any issues in relation to its operation or otherwise lie in Bangladesh.
(e)     The setting up of WTPL’s OTC, the land on which it sits, the licences obtained or obtainable, the payments for these items, the payments or reimbursement for the purchase of training equipment were all made in Bangladesh and the evidence thereof, including bank accounts and ownership records for the training equipment, WTPL’s OTC, the building and the land on which it sits, lies in Bangladesh.
(f)     The relevant witnesses involved in this dispute are in Bangladesh given that the factual background and matters set out at [15] and [19] above deal with individuals or entities or events that occurred in Bangladesh and the multiple agreements between Gazipur and other Bangladeshi parties like Rupsha, Rupsha’s director Mr Jalal Yunos, GN International, Mr Sarker, Badal and Gazipur.
(g)     The defendant in Suit 64, Badal/Gazipur, is resident in Bangladesh.
(h)     There are also factual disputes over how Rupsha came to be substituted with GN International which was in turn substituted with Gazipur. There was also an alleged supplementary agreement dated 19 August 2009 entered into between Virsagi and Badal to resolve the issue of admitting two new partners, Mr Arifur and Mr Monir, the payment to Virsagi for the purchase of the equipment for WTPL’s OTC and Badal’s alleged ownership of the land, WTPL’s OTC building and the equipment therein. Badal’s alleged ownership of the land, WTPL’s OTC building and the equipment is a disputed issue between Virsagi and Badal/Gazipur, and the evidence and witnesses relevant to this dispute are in Bangladesh.
(i)     There are further factual disputes over the alleged buy-out of Victor, whether there was a concluded agreement to do so and whether Victor could allegedly and unilaterally terminate that agreement as well as the alleged ties between Badal/Gazipur with Mr Taneem Hassan who was also allegedly running another overseas training centre in Dhaka in competition with Virsagi. Evidence in relation to this dispute also lies in Bangladesh.
(j)     There is already an action in Dhaka in relation to WTPL and its shareholders which is now on appeal. That action was initiated by Virsagi before these proceedings in Singapore. In addition, Virsagi’s claims of delays in the judicial process in Bangladesh have not been borne out,
(k)     As noted above, Virsagi originally obtained an injunction in Dhaka to restrain Welltech and Badal/Gazipur from testing workers in Bangladesh or through any company other than WTPL set up pursuant to the Principal Agreement but this injunction was stayed on 15 January 2012. I note that Virsagi then commenced Suit 64 on 26 January 2012 and filed Summons 869 on 23 February 2012 for an injunction to oblige Badal/Gazipur to comply with the Gazipur Agreement whereas the injunction in Dhaka CM 8/2012 was for an order that the testing of workers was to be carried out by WTPL;
(l)     Badal/Gazipur alleged that Virsagi was behind the issue of an order by the Ministry of Labour and Manpower, Bangladesh on 11 April 2012 temporarily suspending the permission given to Badal/Gazipur to operate WTPL’s OTC without prior notice to the latter. Badal/Gazipur have taken out separate judicial review proceedings on 15 April 2012 and the Dhaka High Court has issued a rule nisi calling on the Ministry of Labour and Manpower to show cause for its unilateral suspension and has in the meantime issued a stay of the suspension. That action is on-going.
(m)     Whether the Gazipur Agreement has been unlawfully interfered with by Welltech, and issues on the construction of clauses like the non-termination clause (
ie
 Clause 12) and whether it could be construed in the context of the other agreements, like the Principal Agreement, is likely to depend on a resolution of the above factual disputes and the law of Bangladesh.
37     I also note that Virsagi obtained leave to serve the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim in Suit 64 under O11 r 1(b), (d)(iii) and (e) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in Summons No 488 of 2012 (“Summons 488”). O 11 r 1(b) caters for the situation where an injunction is sought ordering the defendant, 
ie
, Badal/Gazipur, to do or refrain from doing anything 
in Singapore
. I cannot see what Virsagi is seeking to restrain Badal/Gazipur from doing in Singapore as what Badal/Gazipur have to do under the agreements would be carried out in Bangladesh. As for O 11 r 1(d)(iii), I have already noted that the law of Bangladesh governs the disputes and issues that arise in Suit 63 and Suit 64. As for O 11 r 1(e), I also could not see what breach had been committed by Badal/Gazipur in Singapore nor did I see a breach that occurred in Bangladesh that rendered the performance of so much of the Gazipur Agreement that ought to have been performed in Singapore impossible.
38     Virsagi have not put forward any good reasons to invoke the second stage of the 
Spiliada
 principles and have failed to persuade me that a stay should not be ordered.
Injunctive Relief
39     As noted earlier (at [37]), in Summons 488 and the accompanying affidavit filed on 1 February 2012, Virsagi sought to serve the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim in Suit 64 on Gazipur in Bangladesh, relying on, 
inter alia
, O 11 r 1(b) of the ROC. Order 11 r 1(b) provides as follows:
... service of an originating process out of Singapore is permissible with the leave of the Court if in the action –
(b) an injunction is sought ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing anything in Singapore (whether or not damages are also claimed in respect of a failure to do or the doing of that thing);
40     In 
Karaha 
Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal
 
[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112
 (“
Karaha Bodas”
), the Court of Appeal adopted the reasoning in 
Siskina v Distos Compania Naviera SA
 
[1979] AC 210
 (“
The Siskina”
) and 
Mercedes Benz AG v Leiduck
 
[1996] AC 284
 that a plaintiff could not obtain a Mareva injunction which was essentially ancillary to proceedings that were pending in a foreign court where the defendant was not subject to the 
in personam
 jurisdiction of the local court. At [37] of 
Karaha Bodas
, the Court of Appeal cited Lord Diplock’s comments in 
The Siskina
 at 256 with regard to O 11 r 1(1)(i) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court (c 54) (UK) (“English RSC”) (which is 
in pari 
materia
 to our O 11 r 1(b)):
... Lord Diplock [in 
the Siskina
] commenting on O 11 r 1(1)(i) of the English RSC stated ([9] 
supra
 at 256):
The words used in sub-rule (i) are terms of legal art. The sub-rule speaks of ""the action"" in which a particular kind of relief, ""an injunction"" is sought. This pre-supposes the existence of a cause of action on which to found ""the action."" A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its own. It is 
dependent upon there being a pre-existing cause of action
 against the defendant 
arising out of an invasion
, actual or threatened by him, 
of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff
 for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. 
The right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is merely ancillary and incidental to the pre-existing cause of action
. It is granted to preserve the status quo pending the ascertainment by the court of the rights of the parties and the grant to the plaintiff of the relief to which his cause of action entitles him, which may or may not include a final injunction. ... [T]he thing that it is sought to restrain the foreign defendant from doing in England must amount to the invasion of some legal or equitable right 
belonging to the plaintiff in this country and enforceable here
 by a final judgment for an injunction.
[emphasis in original]
41     Therefore, an injunction can only be obtained if there is a dispute being substantially litigated in Singapore in which some legal or equitable right of the plaintiff is infringed and which can be protected and enforced in Singapore by a final judgment in Singapore. Although the principle in 
The Siskina
 applies to Mareva injunctions which are sought against assets of a defendant in Singapore, I find that it applies with even greater force to a mandatory injunction which essentially compels specific performance by the defendant of an agreement in a foreign jurisdiction. Against the backdrop of this analysis, many of the factors cited above from [23] to [38] militate against a finding that Virsagi satisfies the test for a grant of the injunctions prayed for. For the same reasons I have set out above, I do not think there is a serious question to be tried. Applying Singapore Law Virsagi’s claims against Welltech and Gazipur are seriously flawed. The disputes between Virsagi and Gazipur can only be properly determined by Bangladeshi law and no evidence of that was put before me. The resolution of the issues outlined above as to breach, inducement of breach of contract and unlawful interference with that contract, cannot be answered without evidence of Bangladeshi law. The remedies and relief claimed by Virsagi also depend on Bangladeshi law. The balance of convenience weighs against Virsagi and so does the element of the adequacy of damages as far as Welltech is concerned as Virsagi have not put any evidence to the contrary before me. Further, Badal/Gazipur have no assets or business in Singapore – they are even further removed than the defendant in 
Karaha Bodas
, which was a Hong Kong entity with no presence in Singapore but with assets in Singapore which could form the subject of a Mareva injunction.
42     I also note that the injunction claimed against Badal/Gazipur did not include Welltech but in Dhaka CM 8/2012, Victor applied for an injunction to compel Badal/Gazipur and Welltech to carry on testing and registering of workers through WTPL and to ensure all payments made and received are carried out through WTPL. Further, if Badal/Gazipur ’s allegations are right (
ie
, that the land, WTPL’s OTC and building and the equipment were all paid for by them), then Virsagi’s right to injunctive relief is very weak.
43     As a final note, even assuming that the defendant falls within the 
in personam
 jurisdiction of the court, I observe that Virsagi is in Summons 869 essentially praying for a mandatory injunction for specific performance of the Gazipur Agreement. For a mandatory injunction, the court must be satisfied not only as to the conditions in 
American Cynamid Co v Ethicon Ltd
 
[1975] AC 396
, but there is a further threshold that if the injunction is not granted, the plaintiff would suffer “irremediable prejudice” that cannot be put right by damages (
Rikvin Consultancy Pte Ltd v Pardeep Singh Boparai and another
 
[2010] SGHC 191
). It is difficult to see how Virsagi would suffer irremediable prejudice if Badal/Gazipur were not forced to specifically perform the Gazipur Agreement.
Conclusion
44     For the reasons set out above, I dismissed Virsagi’s application for a mandatory injunction against Gazipur and granted a stay on the ground of 
lis alibi pendens
 and 
forum non conveniens
 on the applications of Welltech in Suit 63 and Gazipur in Suit 64 and hold that the proper forum to deal with the issues between the parties is Bangladesh.
45     I awarded costs fixed at $8,000 all in to Badal/Gazipur for Summons 869 and Summons 895 and $4,000 all in to Welltech for Summons 829.",2012-10-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The facts
Cur Adv Vult
This is an action for damages in respect of allegedly defamatory words spoken by the defendant, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam (`defendant`), concerning the plaintiff, Goh Chok Tong. In December 1996, Parliament was dissolved and a General Election was called in Singapore. Polling Day was to be 2 January 1997. The words which form the subject matter of this litigation were spoken by the defendant towards the close of an election rally held at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 1 January 1997, the eve of polling day. The words were: 
And finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people.
 2.The protagonists are no strangers to the public. The defendant is the Secretary-General of the opposition Workers` Party (`WP`) and has held that position since 1971. A lawyer by profession and former Member of Parliament, he contested, together with four other WP members, a block of five seats in the Cheng San Group Representative Constituency (`GRC`) in the said General Elections. His opponents were members of the incumbent People`s Action Party (`PAP`). The PAP won the majority of the seats at the Elections, including Cheng San GRC.
 3.The plaintiff is the Secretary-General of the PAP. The plaintiff did not contest the Cheng San GRC, but naturally took an interest in it. He has been a Member of Parliament since 1976 and is currently the Member for the Marine Parade GRC. He has been the Prime Minister of Singapore since November 1990. At the time of the making of the allegedly defamatory statement, the plaintiff had already been returned to his seat in the Marine Parade GRC by virtue of a walkover in that ward. He was thus a Member of Parliament (`MP`) and Prime Minister-elect.
 4.The defendant`s running mate (along with three others) for the Cheng San GRC was one Tang Liang Hong. He was a lawyer by profession. Mr Tang had never run for election before, but in 1992 applied, unsuccessfully, to enter Parliament as a Nominated MP.
 5.The plaintiff considered Mr Tang to be unsuitable for the office of MP as he was, in his view, anti-Christian and a Chinese chauvinist who held radical views on the Chinese language and Chinese culture. He made his opinion public in press interviews on 25 and 26 December 1996 and at a PAP rally held at Hougang stadium on 26 December 1996. The plaintiff held the view that because of his anti-Christian and Chinese chauvinist views Mr Tang was `a dangerous man` and should not be in Parliament. These interviews received publicity in the English and Chinese newspapers on 26 and 27 December 1996. It was during that period revealed that the plaintiff premised his views on the following facts: (a). Rear Admiral Teo Chee Hean had told the plaintiff that on 7 August 1994, at a dinner hosted by the Zheng Yi Association at Joo Chiat, Mr Tang had spoken in Chinese and said that there were many English-educated Christian Cabinet members and senior civil servants, implying thereby that the non-Christian Chinese educated were governed by them.
 (b). In August 1996, Mr Tang had given a talk at the Substation during a Mandarin Seminar at which he stated that there was no need for the Chinese-educated in Singapore to feel inferior. On behalf of the Chinese-educated he asked: `Why then are we the ones carrying the sedan-chair for others? We should be sitting on the sedan-chair?` This was reported in the Straits Times on 10 August 1996.
 (c). When Mr Tang applied to be a Nominated MP in 1992, the Speaker of Parliament received letters from a number of Cabinet members and PAP MPs stating that, in their opinion, Mr Tang was not suitable for appointment. These letters had come to the plaintiff`s attention and included the following statements:
 (i). Letter from late Minister Dr Tay Eng Soon dated 30 July 1992:
 
I know Tang Liang Hong. He tends to be chauvinistic about Chinese culture. He will probably be a spokesman for the Chinese intellectual lobby.
 (ii). Letter from MP Ker Sin Tze dated 6 August 1992:
 
Mr Tang holds radical views on the promotion of Chinese language and culture if Mr Tang is selected, he will probably reiterate these views in Parliament. While all views are entitled to be held in a democracy, the Committee should nevertheless consider whether appointing Mr Tang may indirectly lend legitimacy to his radical viewpoint on what remains a sensitive issue in our multi-racial society.
 (iii). Letter from MP Ch`ng Jit Koon dated 6 August 1992:
 
Based on my experiences and observations in coming into contact with Mr Tang, I find his views and opinions on ethnic and cultural issues rather extreme and insensitive. He is inclined to speak like a `Chinese chauvinist` to the discomfort of other races.`
 (iv). Letter from MP Ow Chin Hock dated 11 August 1992:
 
There are two reservations about [Tang] (i) he has taken extreme positions on some issues such as Chinese language, culture and civilisation and (ii) he is emotional and temperamental.
 (v). Letter from MP Chin Harn Tong dated 8 August 1992:
 
My impression was that he liked to play to the gallery on a popular issue like the Chinese education issue prevailing then.
 6.Extracts from the letters written by the PAP MPs in 1992 were released by the plaintiff to the press and published in the 
 Straits Times 
 on 29 December 1996. Mr Tang was eventually not appointed as a Nominated MP and was reported in 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
 on 20 September 1992 as having stated in response to his rejection as a candidate that the non-English-speaking did not `even have a chance to be spectators` in Parliament.
 7.At the Hougang rally on 26 December 1996, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew also asserted that Mr Tang was `anti-English-educated and anti-Christian` . This was reported in the 
 Straits Times 
 the following day. At the same rally, Rear Admiral Teo Chee Hean narrated the events concerning the speech made by Mr Tang at the Zheng Yi Association dinner in 1994 and said Mr Tang had used his oratorical skills at the dinner to work people up over language and religion. He said he concluded thereafter that Mr Tang was an extremist.
 8.Mr Tang responded to the plaintiff`s accusations by a letter dated 28 December 1996. He denied the plaintiff`s accusations, stated that he viewed them as defamatory and demanded a full retraction and an apology, failing which he would commence legal action. The plaintiff replied through his solicitors by a letter dated 29 December 1996. He refused to retract his statement and invited Mr Tang to commence legal proceedings. Mr Tang sent a similar letter to the Senior Minister and received a similar response.
 9.At a press conference held on 28 December 1996, PAP MP Ow Chin Hock stated that Mr Tang had become more and more radical, one whose extreme views had to be exposed since he was standing for election as those views could destroy the stability of society and politics in Singapore. He said that at the Feedback Unit Dialogue held in 1995, Mr Tang had made remarks that political power was concentrated in the English-educated elite while the Chinese-educated were left out of the mainstream, and so government policies might not be in the interest of the Chinese-educated majority. This was reported in the 
 Lianhe Zhaobao 
 on 29 December 1996.
 10.At a PAP rally at Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 30 December 1996, Deputy Prime Ministers BG Lee Hsien Loong and Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam stated they would support the Prime Minister and shared his views. This was reported in the Shin Min Daily News on 31 December 1996.
 11.At a PAP rally at UOB Plaza on 30 December 1996, PAP MP elect Seng Han Thong stated that Mr Tang had told him that more Chinese educated people were needed in Parliament and that there were too many Christians in the Cabinet. This was reported in the 
 Straits Times 
 on 31 December 1996.
 12.Mr Tang did not respond to the barrage of attacks against him by commencing legal proceedings. However, in an interview given to a journalist, Ahmad Osman of the 
 Straits Times 
, he stated that he still intended to sue the plaintiff and other PAP leaders and MPs who spoke up against him. He further stated that he would `lodge a police report against them for criminal offence`. He continued: 
They are telling lies. They are defaming, assassinating my character. They concocted lies and go on television and spread the lies
 The text of the interview was published in the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
 on 31 December 1996. The plaintiff considered these words defamatory.
 13.At rallies held on 28 and 31 December 1996, Mr Tang repeated his position that he was innocent of the plaintiff`s accusations which were, he said, fabricated to frustrate his election campaign. The plaintiff also considered these statements, which received publicity, defamatory. On 31 December 1996, the plaintiff`s solicitors wrote to Mr Tang asking for a complete withdrawal of his defamatory allegations, an apology in terms and an undertaking against repetition by 6pm on 1 January 1997 with the apology and withdrawal to be read out at a rally not later than 9pm on the same day. Mr Tang did not respond to the letter. Instead, he filed two police reports on the evening of 1 January 1997 against the plaintiff and other senior politicians who had made negative comments concerning him. The time at which he filed the reports is stated on the report as 1816 hours and also as 1930 hours.
 14.In the course of the election campaign, the defendant did not adopt his running mate`s rhetoric, nor did he overtly assert that the plaintiff was lying or conspiring to keep Mr Tang out of Parliament. He did, however, state publicly his view that Mr Tang was neither anti-Christian nor a Chinese chauvinist. He shared the plaintiff`s view that a person who propagates anti-Christian and Chinese chauvinist views should be kept out of Parliament. This is apparent from what the defendant stated at the same rally a short while before he uttered the alleged defamatory words: 
I have told you before and I repeat it again, Mr Tang is not a Chinese chauvinist Neither is he anti-Christian if Mr Tang goes about expressing anti-Christian views and sentiments, we will expel him from the party. So, he can no longer be a Member of Parliament and if he goes round inciting the Chinese against the other minorities, we will equally expel him.
 15.A video-tape of the alleged defamatory remarks was put in evidence. I will attempt to narrate the contents of that part of the tape showing the words complained of as it will be of assistance in construing the words in their proper context. I start at a point towards the end of his speech, where whilst the defendant was saying: 
Now, that`s it alright, stand firm, not just here, but tomorrow. Don`t let fear, you know, stop you voting for your rights, for your welfare, for your freedom to live as citizens of this country.
 Mr Tang came up and appeared to place some documents before the defendant, on his left hand side. It is not discernible from the tape whether Mr Tang said anything to the defendant. The defendant glanced very quickly at Mr Tang and the documents and then continued: 
Remember, remember that the fight, please remember that the fight is between the PAP and you. Are you going to win this fight or are you going to let the PAP win the fight.
 16.Throughout the speech, the defendant waved what appeared to be an envelope in his right hand, using it to punctuate his speech. The defendant then continued: 
`Not just the Workers` Party, are you going to win? Are you? Well, tomorrow at eleven o`clock we`ll show you I know what you want. You are sure? Because if you don`t do something for yourself, my friends, then I`m afraid that there is nothing more I can do for you.`
 17.At this point, the crowd broke out into loud cheers and applause. Mr Low Thia Khiang, the Workers` Party Candidate for Hougang Constituency, walked up to the defendant on his right hand side and spoke to him. What he said was not discernible from the tape, although the defendant appeared to nod his head in agreement and then immediately said: 
[W]e want you to leave quietly we don`t want any complaints from the police. It`s important from friends, yes, I am glad you are listening quietly, that you leave quietly.
 18.At the same time, Mr Tang came up and stood at the left of the defendant, who appeared to take no notice of him as he was conferring with Mr Low. Mr Tang tried to draw the defendant`s attention to the papers he had put before him earlier. Mr Tang then returned to his seat and the defendant continued: 
Please win this battle for yourself, not for the Workers` Party.
 19.He then glanced down to his left, ostensibly to the papers put before him earlier by Mr Tang, but he did not pick them up. Then, continuing to wave the same envelope in his right hand, he said: 
 And finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people.
 But just remember. Have one thing on your mind, one purpose, one will, that it is not for Mr Tang Liang Hong or for me or for the Workers` Party that you are voting. You are voting for yourself. And the PAP have been trying desperately to win this battle. They`ve been trying to stop you from voting for your rights. Well, show them tomorrow and I will then be very, very proud of you people of Cheng San. [Emphasis supplied.]
 With those words the defendant closed the last rally on the last day of campaigning. He did not read out the contents of the reports or tell the audience anything about their contents. The following day, 2 January 1997, was polling day.
 20.The italicised words were republished verbatim by the 
 Straits Times 
 on 2 January 1997 in an article entitled `Tang refuses to apologise for calling SM, PM, liars` . The following is the narrative published in the Business Times on the same day in an article entitled `WP`s Tang refuses to apologise, so PAP leaders sue`: 
Just before the rally ended, party leader JB Jeyaretnam told the large crowd that Mr Tang had filed two police reports against Prime Minister Goh and the PAP. The WP leader did not give details of the police reports, but held them up to the crowd.
 The statement in the 
 Business Times 
 that the defendant held the reports up to the crowd is not borne out by the video-tape.
 21.Mr Tang himself did not make public the fact that he had made these reports. Further, neither he nor the defendant released the contents of the reports. The plaintiff gave evidence that once he heard that Mr Tang had threatened to make police reports against him, he instructed Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng to provide him with copies of the reports if they were made. He received his copy at about 8.30pm on 1 January 1997. Copies were also provided to the Senior Minister. The reports were released to the public the morning after they were filed (ie on the morning of 2 January 1997) by the Senior Minister with the concurrence of the plaintiff. The text of the reports was published in full in 
 The New Paper 
 on 2 January 1997. The report pertinent to this case reads as follows: 
I, TANG LIANG HONG, one of the candidates for Cheng San GRC, wish to make report as follows: 
1 From 25 December 1996, the following persons, namely:
 
(1) Goh Chok Tong 
(2) Teo Chee Hean 
(3) Lee Yiok Suan 
(4) Ow Chin Hock 
(5) Tony Tan 
(6) Ker Sin Tse 
(7) Chin Harn Tong 
(8) Chng Jit Koon 
(9) Lee Kuan Yew 
(10) Seng Han Tong 
(11) Lee Hsien Loong
 
systematically on various occasions and on various dates alleged and made various statements to make or cause the public to believe the following: 
1 I am an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist; 
2 I am anti-English-educated; 
3 some of my statements will cause social and racial disharmony and disruption in Singapore.
 
The abovementioned statements and allegations are groundless and without factual basis and are intended to harm my reputation and to defame me.
 
As a result of their concerted actions and statements repeated over the mass-media, they: 
1 have incited certain groups of people to believe that I am an anti-Christian and anti-English-educated persons; 
2 are likely to incite religious extremists to hate me and cause harm to me and members of my family; 
3 have also repeatedly challenged and provoked me to make statements in public which they say may cause social disorder in Singapore.
 
I enclose herewith newspaper clippings to support what I stated above.
 
I hereby request the police to investigate on an urgent basis and to offer me adequate protection against any possible harm against me and members of my family.
 
Signed: Tang Liang Hong
 
cc Commissioner of Police
 22.The plaintiff took the view that the announcement by the defendant that Mr Tang had filed police reports against the plaintiff and others and the subsequent republications of this announcement in the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
 were defamatory in that such announcement suggested that the plaintiff was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy. Through his solicitors, he wrote to the defendant on 25 January 1997 requesting a withdrawal of the statements, an unreserved apology on terms, an undertaking not to further publish the statements and compensation. The defendant on 29 January 1997 replied through his lawyers that he was prepared to give an apology on his own terms. This offer was rejected by the plaintiff, who then commenced this action for the recovery of damages for defamation. The plaintiff seeks damages for the original publication of the words made by the defendant to the audience at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 1 January 1997 and further for the republication or repetition of those words in the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
 on 2 January 1997.
 23.Mr Tang was also the subject of defamation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff and the other ten persons named in the police report in respect of the allegations made by Mr Tang that they were concocting lies about him and in respect of certain other allegedly defamatory remarks made by Mr Tang to the media at around that period. Mr Tang fled Singapore. The plaintiff obtained default judgment against Mr Tang on 10 March 1997. On 29 May 1997 Chao Hick Tin J assessed the total damages payable by Mr Tang to the plaintiff at $1.4m. The other ten persons also obtained default judgment against Mr Tang and the damages payable to them was assessed at a total of $6.675m.
 24.The same ten persons have brought related actions against the defendant in the present suit on the basis that the defendant made reference to them in his speech on 1 January 1997 and defamed them accordingly. The plaintiffs in those suits have agreed to be bound by my findings in the present case on whether the said words are defamatory.
 25.
 The law of defamation and freedom of speech
The law of defamation is an important pillar of modern society. A claim to the intangible qualities of good character, integrity and honesty must be upheld in the same way as a claim to the ownership of a thing or a claim to be compensated for financial loss or personal injury suffered owing to the unlawful acts of another. Although it has been decided in the United States that defamatory comments made of politicians do not attract liability unless said in malice (see 
New York Times Co v Sullivan
 
[1964] 
376 US 254
), that is not the law of Singapore. That position has been considered and rejected by our courts in 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
 . In that case, the Court of Appeal held that whether a plaintiff is a private citizen or the Prime Minister, the same principles apply. The Prime Minister is entitled to his reputation no less than the ordinary citizen and it is not required for the Prime Minister to prove malice on the part of the defendant to succeed in this claim. Whilst there is an undeniable public interest in protecting freedom of speech as a means of exposing wrongdoing or abuse of office by public officials, there is an equal public interest in allowing those officials to execute their duties unfettered by false aspersions.
 26.It is noteworthy that in England, the House of Lords has now held that it would be contrary to the public interest for a local authority or other government body to have locus standi in an action for damages for defamation because it was of the highest public importance that a government body should be open to uninhibited public criticism: 
Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd & Ors
 
[1993] 1 All ER 1011
. It is not clear whether that principle would extend to public 
 officers 
. In that case Lord Keith of Kinkel made an interesting remark that that was the position at English common law independent of the European Convention on Human Rights. Although this raises the question whether Singapore law (being premised on English common law) should follow suit, that is a question for the Court of Appeal and I am bound to apply Singapore law as it now stands.
 27.No public officer, however high his standing or distinguished his service, is above the law. Recent cases in Singapore have demonstrated that there is no tolerance for corruption or the abuse of position. It is also our law that if a public officer is falsely investigated for a criminal offence, he is entitled in law to bring an action in malicious prosecution. Similarly, where derogatory comments are made of his conduct or character, the public officer may bring an action in defamation against the complainant. If the comments made on his character or allegations of unlawful behaviour are proved true, a total defence is afforded (the defence of justification). Where the attack is unjustified, the comment is still protected if he proves he is entitled to qualified privilege (that is, he published his complaint to the proper authority and to no wider audience than was necessary in the public interest). Where, however, the attack is unjustified and the publication not privileged, the complainant exposes himself to counter-attack by the public officer, who may sue in his private capacity to restore honour to his name.
 28.Neither the defence of qualified privilege or justification was raised in this case. This was not through the defence counsel`s lack of diligence but rather because the defence he chose to raise would have run against that alternative. Underlying an argument that the defendant spoke under privilege or in justification would be an admission that the words were capable of defamatory meaning. This, however, was not the case put forward by Mr Carman. Mr Carman`s case was, in a sense, very simple. He said that the defendant had not defamed the plaintiff because the words were not defamatory. The elegance of that argument, however, belies its complexity, for we are not concerned simply with the plain and ordinary meaning of the words but whether the words, taken in their context, given the defendant`s tone, choice of words, facial expression and physical gestures, with the full force of all reasonable implications and inferences that those words carry, impugn the character of the plaintiff.
 29.
 The misuse of the legal process
Allegations were made in this case that the plaintiff and his political allies have made use of the machinery of the courts to overwhelm their political opponents with litigation and sought by such means to render their opponents financially bankrupt and thereby remove them from the political scene. I make no comment on these allegations save to point out that the defendant did not go so far as to suggest any complicity on the part of the judges in this alleged misuse. To the contrary, the defendant specifically informed the court that he has every confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the court.
 30.Underlying questions relating to the independence of the judiciary and the likelihood of a fair hearing inevitably surface when political leaders resort to the courts to pursue their claims. It would therefore be appropriate to briefly address this issue.
 31.There are no private directives to a judge from the executive or from anyone else on how a case is to be conducted, how the judgment is to be phrased, how the law is to be applied or what matters of policy are to be considered. The judge is expected to decide each case impartially in accordance with the evidence and in accordance with the law. Indeed, the Singapore Constitution requires every judge, on appointment, to take an oath that he will discharge his judicial duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will to the best of his ability and in accordance with law.
 32.I would emphasise that what we have in Singapore is an open system of justice. All evidence and all arguments in all writ actions are presented in public. And the records of the courts are public documents available for public perusal. Hearings being in public, and only in public, any ruling and any judgment made by the court, must stand the test of public scrutiny. Any appeal to the Court of Appeal is also heard in public and must again stand the test of public scrutiny. This is one of the great strengths of our system of law. Any judgment that does not stand the test of public scrutiny will tend to destroy the integrity of the judiciary - and will be a disservice to the people of Singapore.
 33.The issue before me is whether the words uttered by the defendant have defamed the plaintiff and if so what the proper amount of damages payable should be. I will decide those issues frankly and in accordance with established legal principles. I now present my findings.
 34.
 Legal principles in the law of defamation - the meaning of publication
The law of defamation permits each person to hold private opinions of other persons, even if those opinions are completely untrue and unfounded. It is when the unjustified opinion is communicated to another that it assumes an injurious character. When an opinion is communicated to another, it is said to be `published` . `Publication` is a legal term of art that encompasses `libel` , where a defamatory statement is given physical form in printing, writing, pictures, or effigies, and `slander` , which refers to a defamatory statement made in transitory form, either through spoken words, gestures or sounds. The present case concerns slander in the words spoken by the defendant and libel in the words republished by the 
 Straits Times 
 and the
 Business Times 
 the following day.
 35.
 The preliminary issue of special damage
Whether libel or slander, the principles defining what is defamatory and what is not are the same. A key distinction, however, is that slander is only actionable on proof of special damage. This is an archaic common law rule that has been criticised as `arbitrary and illogical` by the Committee on the Law of Defamation, chaired by Lord Porter, in its report of 1948. The present case, which involves slander, would have been pre-empted by the rule for want of proof of special damage but for the established exception that where a person by the slander is allegedly disparaged in his office, profession, calling, trade or business, and the slander was spoken in relation to his office. This is provided for in s 5 of the Defamation Act. I am of the view that this particular alleged slander, spoken against a political rival at an election rally must attempt to disparage him in his political office, whether as the Secretary-General of the opposing party, a Member of Parliament-elect or the de facto Prime Minister.
 36.Mr Shields, for the plaintiff, also suggested that this case fell within another exception, namely, where the slander imputes a crime punishable by imprisonment. Agreeing with this, however, would require me to decide the ultimate issue on a preliminary point. I therefore make no ruling on that submission and instead rely on the exception in respect of the disparagement of office. The question that now has to be answered is whether or not the defendant`s words could, in law, be considered defamatory.
 37.
 What effect must the words have to be defamatory?
Where A accuses B of defamation, he must prove on a balance of probabilities that B has published `defamatory` words concerning him. `Defamatory` words are words which would in the opinion of the judge, `tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally` (per Lord Atkin in 
Sim v Stretch
 
[1936] 2 All ER 1237
 at p 1240). This was the definition suggested to me by Mr Shields.
 38.Whilst widely accepted, I am wary that the use of the term `right-thinking` may appear to inject an analytical element into the test. On such a view, if persons, upon first hearing the published words, form a negative impression of the person allegedly defamed but, on further reflection, decide that their opinion of him was not reduced by the words even if they were true, this would not be defamation - for the person, having gone through the `right thoughts` , does not consider the subject lowered in his estimation.
 39.Such a view would be unsatisfactory because it is clear that whether words are defamatory includes an impressionistic element. Words are defamatory if they convey a negative impression - the words spoken are not to be subjected to analysis in order to determine whether such an impression is rightly held. For, as Lord Devlin, giving his opinion in 
Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 (hereinafter referred to as `the Lewis case`) at p 285, stated: 
One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule about that A statement that a woman has been raped can affect her reputation, although logically it means that she is innocent of any impurity: 
Yousoupoff v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd
 
[1934] 50 TLR 581
 Logic is not the test.
 40.Thus, that the ordinary person would have a negative first impression is sufficient basis for an action in defamation, even though he might subsequently correct himself on that impression.
 41.
 What is meant by `the ordinary person`?
In considering whether words are defamatory, the law does not consider whether they would give a negative impression of the person allegedly defamed to just any person. For if one`s words would be defamatory in law even if they conveyed a negative impression only to the most extreme of individuals, this would demand such a high degree of circumspection in one`s speech as to place an unjustifiable fetter on the right of individual expression.
 42.The court must be satisfied that such a negative impression would be the impression reasonably left on an `ordinary man`. To adopt the words of Lord Reid in the 
 Lewis 
 case, at pp 259-260: 
Ordinary men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. Some are unusually suspicious and some are unusually naive. One must try to envisage people between these two extremes and see what is the most damaging meaning they would put on the words in question What the ordinary man, not avid for scandal, would read into the words complained of must be a matter of impression.
 43.The ordinary man must also apply ordinary meanings. In the same case, Lord Reid took the view (at p 258) that: 
There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs.
 44.These tests, which express the position in English law, are similar to those in our laws. In 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
 , a case involving defamatory statements made by the same defendant in this case during an election rally in 1991, LP Thean J [as he then was], delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal considered that the meaning to be put onto the defendant`s words are: 
the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by reasonable members of the audience at the Bedok car park on that evening using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words, but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons.
 45.Mr Carman has suggested in his submissions that the ordinary person attending the Workers` Party Rally at Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 1 January 1997 is one who is politically neutral, and that the reaction of the crowd to the defendant`s statement is an inapt gauge of an ordinary person`s interpretation of the defendant`s words. This argument has persuasive force and I do not consider it to be at odds with the dicta of LP Thean J I have cited in the preceding paragraph, for LP Thean J in that case referred to `
 reasonable 
 members of the audience` , which I take to mean members who are prepared to assess the words on their face value without predisposition or prejudice. I am therefore required to put myself into the shoes of such a person even if no such person were actually present in the audience that night.
 46.Mr Shields, in his opening statement, submitted that the fact that (and I quote from the written opening statement): 
the words were spoken at an election rally in an atmosphere which was highly charged and plainly hostile to the plaintiff: in other words to an audience which was ready, willing and likely to put the most damaging meaning on the words.
 and that: 
the words were spoken by a person in a senior position and an experienced lawyer in a manner and with a conviction which would have incited the audience to read between the lines and to put the most derogatory meaning upon them.
 should be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of the words. In his closing submissions, Mr Shields clarified his argument by suggesting that I am entitled to look at the context in which the words were published, in particular, the class of persons to whom the statement is published. If he was saying that the defamatory character of the words can be inferred from the crowd`s reaction to them, I cannot agree with this. The predilection of the audience at the Yio Chu Kang stadium to impugn the character of the plaintiff at the slightest whim does not answer the question whether the words are capable of defamatory meaning. Bias is not part of context. The relevance of context is that the judge must put himself in the shoes of a person at the actual rally - he must be in a position to see and assess the tone and facial expression of the defendant rather than to decide on the meaning of the words in the abstract. In making his assessment, however, he must consider himself as if he were an ordinary man. The test is objective. The power of the allegation that words have defamatory meaning is given no force simply because a person or persons are proved to have chosen to put a defamatory meaning on them. I therefore disqualify from my consideration any inclination of the audience to put (or for that matter, not to put) a defamatory quality on the words on their plain and ordinary meaning.
 47.
 Whether the defendant`s intention is relevant
The defendant`s intention in speaking the words, his state of mind and cognizance of the situation and his knowledge of the possible reaction of the crowd to them are not relevant in determining whether the words have defamatory meaning. Nonetheless, I think it necessary to say some words in clarification because Mr Shields spent a substantial portion of his cross-examination of the defendant trying to elicit from the defendant (a) how closely he had been following the debate between Mr Tang and the plaintiff; (b) whether he honestly believed or knew that Mr Tang was not what the plaintiff said he was; (c) whether he knew the contents of Mr Tang`s police reports; and (d) whether he intended by revealing that Mr Tang had made the reports to gain an electoral advantage. Also, the plaintiff in cross-examination described the defendant`s actions in the following words: 
It is, to me, as if Tang Liang Hong had prepared a Molotov cocktail and gave it to Mr Jeyaretnam, who at the precise moment, hurled the Molotov cocktail in my direction and the crowd cheered.
 48.The answers to Mr Shield`s questions and whether in fact the defendant and Mr Tang had conspired to maximise the damage to the plaintiff were all relevant to the defendant`s state of mind at the time he made the statement. These matters, however, bear no relevance to the question whether the words bear defamatory meaning. It is an established principle that the intention of the defendant in saying the allegedly defamatory words is irrelevant in determining their meaning, although it is relevant in determining whether there is malice for the purposes of the qualified privilege defence (which is not in issue) or for the purpose of measuring the quantum of damages payable by him (which is in issue if the defendant is found liable). If he intended a defamatory meaning but what he said was objectively innocent, he is as free from liability as he would be subject to liability if he intended an innocent meaning but what he said was objectively scurrilous and injurious. For this proposition I turn to the decision of the House of Lords in 
E Hulton & Co v Jones
 
[1910] AC 20
.
 49.
 E Hulton & Co v Jones 
 concerned a case in which the owners and publishers of a newspaper published in an article defamatory statements of a person named Artemus Jones, who was believed by the author of the article and editor of the paper to be fictitious. In fact, it turned out that Mr Artemus Jones was a practicing barrister who took initiative in suing the defendants for libel. The parties agreed that there was no intention to defame the plaintiff. The House of Lords held that in an action for defamation, it did not matter that the defendant was not guilty of defamatory intent. Said Lord Loreburn LC (at pp 23-24): 
A person charged with libel cannot defend himself by shewing that he intended in his own breast not to defame, or that he intended not to defame the plaintiff, if in fact he did both. He has none the less imputed something disgraceful and has none the less injured the plaintiff. A man in good faith may publish a libel believing it to be true, and it may be found by the jury that he acted in good faith believing it to be true, and reasonably believing it to be true, but that in fact the statement was false. Under those circumstances, he has no defence to the action, however excellent his intention.
 Because this rule may occasionally operate harshly, Parliament has provided in s 7 of the Defamation Act that where a person has unintentionally defamed another, he may escape liability by making an offer of amends in the statutory terms.
 50.
 Whether the words need to be believed by the audience
Just as it does not reinforce the plaintiff`s case to prove that the whole audience was in agreement with the defendant, it is of no assistance to the defendant to say that his words were not proved to have been believed by any person at all. The test is objective. The incredulity of the claim is not a relevant consideration. If it were, this would lead to the irony of the situation where a person was of such high repute that an extremely outrageous statement about his character would be automatically disbelieved, he could never sue for defamation because the extent of his integrity would preclude its damage. It may well be he is entitled to nominal damages only because there is no proof his reputation was wounded; but the utterance is no less defamatory for that fact.
 51.
 The relevance of the plaintiff`s perception of the words
It is also of little relevance to the question of liability how the plaintiff perceived the words published. Oftentimes, the victim of defamation will be greatly aggrieved and rightfully so, for an attack on his personality, particularly a wilful one, may carry great sting. Its effects may be far-reaching, affecting him not only in his professional capacity but also in social circles and causing discord and suspicion even within the confines of his family life. It is natural for one to seek damages for the highest meaning that the words in question import to him, and this is frequently the case.
 52.However, just as the manner in which the words are meant to be interpreted by the publisher, and the manner in which they may be interpreted by the extremely naive or extremely suspicious are not relevant, so too is the manner in which the words were taken by a plaintiff outside the scope of the court`s duty. The court must assess the meaning of the words from a purely objective standpoint. The hurt and grief caused to the plaintiff by the defendant`s words assumes its true significance only when the court undertakes to determine what measure of damages would compensate the plaintiff for the defendant`s wrong.
 53.
 Whether words defamatory
With these prefatory remarks, I turn to the central issue in the present case, whether the words uttered by the defendant are capable of defamatory meaning. Words may be defamatory in one of three senses: (a) on their plain and ordinary meaning; (b) on some other meaning capable of being inferred from the words standing on their own (the `false` innuendo); or (c) on some other meaning which is reasonably inferred when the words are taken in their context together with knowledge that might be possessed by the ordinary person (the `true` or `legal` innuendo).
 54.Words are defamatory on their plain and ordinary meaning if the words per se impute a defect of character to the plaintiff, such as the statement `Mr X is a cheat` or `Mr X committed adultery with Mrs Y.`
 55.However, the human spirit is limitless in its determination to exploit the nuances of language to make insinuations where the tactlessness of outright candour is unacceptable. Words which on their face convey no imputations against the plaintiff may do so by implication. Hence the phrases `Mr X`s wealth is attributable to his own brand of cleverness` or `Mr X is far better acquainted with Mrs Y than is Mr Y` might, by implication, impugn the character of Mr X in the same way as the blunt accusations. This is sometimes called `false innuendo` . The word `false` is not adjectival of the veracity of the implication, but rather to distinguish this form of innuendo from the form I next describe. A `false innuendo` meaning is the meaning that may be reasonably implied from the words spoken without any special or additional knowledge. It is part of the natural and ordinary meaning and no benefit is derived from a distinction between the two. This is also the approach of the English courts. In 
 Lewis 
` case, Lord Reid considered (at p 258) that: 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 56.A situation of `true` or `legal innuendo` is one in which special knowledge is required to put words into a context in which they assume a defamatory colour. Words which are innocent on their plain and ordinary meaning (and by this I mean the natural meaning and all implications reasonably derived from the words) in one circumstance may take on a whole new texture when they are transplanted into another circumstance. The common illustration is that of the words `Come with me` which if spoken by a head waiter has a different connotation than when spoken by a police inspector accompanied by six armed policemen. Put in the words of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the 
 Lewis 
 case (at p 264): 
[A plaintiff] may establish that because there were extrinsic facts which were known to readers of the words, such readers would be reasonably induced to understand the words in a defamatory sense which went beyond or which altered their natural and ordinary meaning, and which could be regarded as a secondary or as an extended meaning A defamatory meaning which derives no support from extrinsic facts but which is said to be implied from the words which are used is not a true innuendo.
 The distinction has also been recognised in Singapore by the Court of Appeal in 
Aaron & Ors v Cheong Yip Seng & Ors
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 .
 57.The rule is that where words are defamatory on their plain and ordinary meaning and also on their meaning when taken together with special knowledge, this gives rise to two causes of action for which separate awards of damages may be made, or for which a single award of damages may be made: 
Pedley v Cambridge Newspapers Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR 988
. Where a plaintiff seeks to rely on innuendo, as does the plaintiff in this case, it is necessary to plead precisely the innuendo meaning relied on. This is implicit in the principle that where the ordinary meaning is defamatory, a defamatory innuendo gives rise to a separate cause of action, for if the innuendo meaning is not pleaded, neither is the cause of action. This is also apparent from O 78 r 3(1), which states that: 
Where in an action for libel or slander the plaintiff alleges that the words or matters complained of were used in a defamatory sense other than their ordinary meaning, he must give particulars of the facts and matters on which he relies in respect of such sense.
 58.Solicitors for the plaintiff did not, however, draft the statement of claim to specify what meaning on the one hand was to be derived from the words at face value or by implication and what meaning on the other hand was to be derived only by virtue of special knowledge. In fact, the relevant pleading, which I set out below, only alleged a single meaning: 
The offending words, and the words complained of in para 29, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo, meant and/or were understood to mean that the plaintiff had, inter alia, committed and was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation (which is punishable under s 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine or with both); and the offence of criminal conspiracy (which is punishable under s 120B(1) of the Penal Code with imprisonment).
 59.In this case I interpreted the pleading set out to mean that the defendant`s words had only one alleged meaning, which was based on the words either on their plain and ordinary meaning, reasonable implication arising out of those words or innuendo.
 60.The plaintiff is at liberty to plead his case at the highest and to allow the court to decide if a lesser defamatory meaning can be placed on the words if the plaintiff`s case is not made out at the highest meaning. I was invited by Mr Shields, in the event that I did not agree with the meaning pleaded, to consider in the alternative what lesser shades of meaning were available and whether these were defamatory. It is open to me to consider that the words are capable of one shade of meaning on a plain and ordinary reading and of a different shade of meaning when taken together with extrinsic facts. This is the law as stated in 
Lucas-Box v News Group Newspapers Ltd
 
[1986] 1 WLR 147
.
 61.
 Ordinary and natural meaning
How then would the ordinary and reasonable listener in the audience, on the night of 1 January 1997 at the Workers` Party Rally at the Yio Chu Kang stadium, bereft of political inclination and bias, have perceived the words spoken by the defendant?
 62.At the most basic level it cannot be denied that the statement is a statement of fact - that the defendant had in his possession copies of police reports made by Mr Tang against `Mr Goh and his people` . This is in itself unremarkable and being a statement of facts admitted to by the plaintiff in his statement of claim, can prima facie bear no defamatory meaning.
 63.I heard arguments from both counsel concerning the hypothetical question whether it would be defamatory of a person to say that a writ had been issued against some person. It was urged before me that if the issue of a writ carried the defamatory insinuation that a person was liable on a civil suit, then the making of a police report might carry the similar insinuation that a person was guilty of a criminal offence. Mr Shields submitted that a statement that a writ was issued was defamatory and likewise a statement that a police report had been filed. Mr Carman took the opposing position and relied on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in 
Stern v Piper
 
[1996] 3 QB 123
 in which Hirst LJ stated (at p 134): 
I think it is acceptable that a statement that a writ or equivalent civil proceeding has been issued (or for that matter that an indictment or similar criminal proceeding has been laid) may be capable of conveying no more than the fact that the relevant proceedings have in fact been launched.
 64.In doing so, Hirst LJ applied the decision in 
Cadam & Ors v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd
 
[1959] 1 All ER 453
 in which the English Court of Appeal held that a plea of justification was permissible in defence where the Statement of Claim alleged that the defendants had defamed them by stating that a writ had been issued against the plaintiffs.
 65.Mr Carman then argued that the filing of a police report is exactly the same as the issue of a writ and that the defendant`s words were therefore not defamatory. Mr Shields, in reply, argued that 
 Cadam 
 and 
 Stern 
 only stand for the proposition that where it is sought to set up the defence of justification to an action premised on the ground that a statement such as `a writ has been issued against A` is defamatory of A, one cannot strike out the defence as such. However, argued Mr Shields, this did not mean that the statement could not bear defamatory meaning.
 66.Two points need to be made about this. The first, as Mr Shields has pointed out, is that there was no defence of justification raised in this case. Secondly, and more importantly, I am of the view that 
 Cadam 
 and Stern stand for the proposition that in cases where the allegedly defamatory statement is `a writ has been issued against A` or `a police report has been filed against A` , the defendant will always be able to raise the defence of justification so long as the meaning pleaded and sought to be justified is that `a writ has been issued against A` or `a police report has been filed against A` . There can be no other result. Once that is done, all that remains is for the defendant to prove the writ or police report has been issued or filed. Further, on the plainest meaning of the words, 
 without drawing reasonable implications 
 from them, I am of the view that such words can carry no defamatory meaning. The defamatory meaning that requires justification is the meaning that those words carry by implication.
 67.The more pertinent question is therefore whether those words 
 implied 
 the meaning put on them by the plaintiff or any lesser defamatory meaning. I was referred to two cases by Mr Carman for the defendant. The first is Lewis` case, to which I have already referred for introductory remarks. The second is that of 
 Gerald Mapp v News Group Newspapers Ltd 
, an unreported decision of the English Court of Appeal (comprising Hirst, Millett and Hutchison LJJ) given on 27 February 1997.
 68.The facts of 
 Lewis 
 are that two national newspapers in England published brief news notes entitled `Inquiry on Firm by City Police` and `Fraud Squad Probe Firm` which stated in essence that the affairs of a company of which John Lewis was the chairman were being inquired into. The company and John Lewis took offence to the words and commenced actions, each plaintiff taking suit against each paper, making a total of four actions.
 69.On behalf of the company, the statements of claim alleged that: 
By the said words the defendants meant and were understood to mean that the affairs of the plaintiffs and/or its subsidiaries were conducted fraudulently or dishonestly or in such a way that the police suspected that their affairs were so conducted.
 It was also alleged in the statement of claim by a reference to the then English equivalent to our present O 78 r 3(1), that the meaning relied on was an innuendo meaning and not just the plain and ordinary meaning.
 70.The defendants disagreed, and made an application to withdraw the case on innuendo (which, it must be remembered, constitutes an independent cause of action) from the jury. The application was granted by the trial judge. The plaintiffs appealed to the House of Lords who concurred with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge had been right. Their Lordships considered that the meaning pleaded was in fact simply part of the plain and ordinary meaning and could be implied from the words complained of without any additional knowledge. In other words, what the plaintiffs claimed was a true innuendo was in fact a false one. There was in truth only one cause of action and thus, only the one cause of action should be allowed to be put to the jury.
 71.What is of particular relevance to the present case is their Lordships` treatment of the statement that Lewis and his company were having their affairs inquired into. Their Lordships undertook to examine what were the permissible inferences which could be put to the jury. The majority of the House of Lords considered that such a statement could not be capable of implying that Lewis or his company was guilty of fraud. The opinions of the Law Lords are set out for convenience. It is helpful to remember that their Lordships were not adjudicating on what the ordinary reader would necessarily imply from the words published, which in England is a question for the jury, but were delineating the range of permissible inferences that could be left to the jury by the trial judge.
 72.Lord Reid, with whom Lord Jenkins concurred (at pp 259-260) said: 
So let me suppose a number of ordinary people discussing one of these paragraphs which they had read in the newspaper. No doubt one of them might say - `Oh, if the fraud squad are after these people you can take it they are guilty`. But I would expect the others to turn on him, if he did say that, with such remarks as - `Be fair. This is not a police state. No doubt their affairs are in a mess or the police would not be interested. But that could be because Lewis or the cashier has been very stupid or careless. We really must not jump to conclusions Wait till we see if they charge him` I can only say that I do not think that [the ordinary man] would infer guilt of fraud merely because an inquiry is on foot.
 73.Lord Devlin expressed the following opinion (at p 285): 
It is not correct to say as a matter of law that a statement of suspicion imputes guilt. It can be said as a matter of practice that it very often does so, because although suspicion of guilt is something different from proof of guilt, it is the broad impression conveyed by the libel that has to be considered and not the meaning of each word under analysis One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule about that. They can convey a meaning of suspicion short of guilt; but loose talk about suspicion can very easily convey the impression that it is a suspicion that is well founded.
 and at pp 285-286: 
a bare statement of the fact of an inquiry may convey the impression that there are grounds for suspicion But can that convey an impression of guilt? Let it be supposed, first, that a statement that there is an inquiry conveys an impression of suspicion; and secondly that a statement of suspicion conveys an impression of guilt. It does not follow from these two suppositions that a statement that there is an inquiry conveys an impression of guilt. For that, two fences have to be taken instead of one. While, as I have said, I am prepared to accept that the jury could take the first, I do not think that in a case like the present, where there is only the bare statement that a police inquiry is being made, it could take the second in the same stride.
 74.Said Lord Hodson (at p 274): 
I am myself satisfied that the words cannot reasonably be understood to impute guilt. Suspicion, no doubt, can be inferred from the fact of the inquiry being held if such was the case, but to take the further step and infer guilt is, in my view, wholly unreasonable. This is to draw an inference from an inference and to take two substantial steps at the same time.
 In support of his view, Lord Hodson cited 
Simmons v Mitchell
 
[1880] 6 App Cas 156
 (PC), in which the defendant, a government clerk, was alleged in an action for slander to have spoken the following words: 
Haven`t you heard that [the plaintiff] is suspected of having murdered his brother-in-law? A proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension of the murderer is now in my office and there is only one link wanting to complete the case.`
 The plaintiff pleaded that the innuendo was that there was some evidence in the office of the clerk of the Crown and that that there was only one link in the chain of evidence to put the plaintiff on trial for murder. Delivering the opinion of the Privy Council, Sir Robert P Collier stated that: 
It has been argued with some force that these words are capable of bearing the meaning that the plaintiff is guilty of murder, but that the technical proof against him is not wholly complete. Undoubtedly, if the words had admitted fairly of two meanings, the one being an imputation of suspicion only, the other of guilt, it would have been proper to leave to the jury the sense in which they were uttered; but their Lordships have come to the conclusion that, taken in their natural sense, and without a forced or strained construction, they do not contain these two meanings, but only one, viz that there was a case of strong suspicion, but of suspicion only, against the plaintiff a finding of the jury that the words imputed actual guilt would not have been satisfactory `
 75.It is also useful to note the following dicta in the dissenting judgment of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest who stated (at p 269) that: 
a reasonable reader might well consider that no responsible newspaper would dare to publish, or would be so cruel as to publish, the words in question unless the confidential information, which in some manner they had obtained, was not information merely to the effect that there was some kind of inquiry in progress but was information to the effect that there was fraud of dishonesty.
 76.Whilst not a binding decision, I am reluctant to stray too far from a decision of the House of Lords (and in particular, one of such distinguished constitution) which has been applied and accepted as widely as has been 
 Lewis 
` case. I am reinforced in this view by the recent application of the 
 Lewis 
 decision by the English Court of Appeal in 
 Gerald Mapp 
.
 77.
 Gerald Mapp 
 concerned articles published in the 
 News of the World 
. In January 1992, the three plaintiff police officers were transferred out of the Stoke Newington Police Station in the course of an investigation into police corruption. In an article in February of the same year, the 
 News of the World 
 published an article entitled `Drug Quiz Cop Kills Himself` which reported the suicide of Police Sergeant Gerry Carroll whilst in police custody. The article stated that Carroll was custody officer with the drugs squad in Stoke Newington when eight fellow officers (including the three plaintiffs) were alleged to have been involved in drug dealing and bribery. It stated that the accused officers had been transferred to other police stations while an investigation was carried out.
 78.The plaintiffs pleaded that the words in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiffs were guilty of involvement in drug dealing and bribery and that Carroll had killed himself because he would otherwise have to confirm the plaintiffs` involvement. Mr Shields, who incidentally represented the plaintiffs in that case, cited Lord Devlin`s dicta in the 
 Lewis 
 decision and argued that it was not unreasonable to interpret the loose words of the article as conveying the broad impression that the suspicion of guilt affecting the plaintiffs was well founded.
 79.Said Hirst LJ: 
In my judgment, in light of the 
 Lewis
 case, it would be virtually unarguable to suggest that the words complained of here imputed actual guilt as contrasted with a reasonable suspicion of guilt unless, as Mr Shields suggests, their meaning is transformed by the prominent reference to Sergeant Carroll`s suicide.
 In other words, a statement that A is under investigation may be interpreted by the ordinary man to mean A is under reasonable suspicion but may not be interpreted by him to mean that A is guilty of the offence investigated. In this, his Lordship was impressed by the passage from the judgment of Lord Reid in the 
 Lewis 
 case that I have quoted above. The plaintiffs were left to amend their claim to allege that the words were capable of imputing reasonable suspicion.
 80.I express my agreement with the decisions in 
 Lewis 
 and 
 Gerald Mapp 
. It seems to me that it would be nonsensical to say that the four statements `A has reported B for murder` , `B is under investigation for murder` , `B has been arrested on suspicion of murder` and `B has been charged with murder` all bear the same meaning, that is that B is guilty of murder. Such a conclusion ignores the necessary gradations in implication that must follow from the careful selection of words. I am of the view that the ordinary man, given to common sense, would not be insensitive to the differences conveyed by each phrase.
 81.The present case concerns the defendant`s statement that police reports had been filed against the plaintiff. To agree with Mr Shield`s contention that this statement implied that the plaintiff was guilty of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy or at least a serious criminal offence would run directly against the logic of the 
 Lewis 
 case. For the reasons I have set out in the preceding paragraph, I consider that conclusion untenable. Mr Shields, however, canvassed two arguments in support of his proposition.
 82.Firstly, he sought to distinguish 
 Lewis 
 from the present case on the ground that the present case concerned an announcement made by a well-known politician, an established figure. The effect of this, said Mr Shields, and I hope I do no injustice to his argument by re-phrasing it, is that the ordinary person would perceive an allegation made by such a man more gravely than if it were made by someone else. Mr Shields mooted the point that the position and standing of the defendant when taken together with the conviction with which he makes an allegation, can add to its sting. He suggested that this also formed part of the context in which the defendant`s words should be analysed.
 83.Mr Shields referred me to the judgment of Lord Morris, who alone constituted the minority in the 
 Lewis 
 decision, in particular, to the rhetorical question of what possible justification could a fair and reasonable newspaper have in making those reports unless it imputed that Lewis might well be guilty of fraud. By analogy, he argued that the rhetorical question in the present case is what possible justification a man of the defendant`s standing could have by telling a crowd that the report had been made other than his certainty of the plaintiff`s guilt?
 84.Speaking first from general principles, I was not in favour of this argument. For whilst a person`s standing might make his allegation more or less likely to be 
 believed 
, it does not make it more or less 
 defamatory 
. We are concerned here with the statement`s 
 meaning 
, not its 
 weight 
.
 85.This aside, I took the point that the nuances which may be elicited from words uttered by the village idiot are very different from nuances which may be elicited from the same words uttered by an experienced politician or diplomat. If this case and 
 Lewis 
` case were at such extremes, I might have been minded to agree with Mr Shields. However, I can see no reason why reports published in two distinguished national newspapers should be treated by the ordinary reader with any greater levity or cynicism than allegations made by a senior politician.
 86.I do not therefore think that Mr Shields has made a point of sufficient distinction for me to adopt a contrary view to the majority of the House of Lords.
 87.That the words on their plain and ordinary meaning could not impute guilt is a position which, I think, Mr Shields was prepared at the end to concede. Mr Shields thus made this second point. In his closing submissions, he suggested, on the authority of 
 Lewis 
, that there need not be an express imputation of suspicion in the defamatory phrase in order for it to convey suspicion. Thus, although the article published in the Daily Telegraph stated that an inquiry was being conducted into the affairs of the plaintiff company and did not state that the plaintiff company was suspected of fraud, this could nonetheless carry the impression that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion, and the majority of the House of Lords agreed that this was a feasible meaning to be put to the jury. Averting to Lord Devlin`s `two fences`, Mr Shields rightly pointed out that of the two leaps, the first, to suspicion, was permissible, whereas the second leap, to guilt, was not. He argued that if the leap to guilt could not be taken on the plain and ordinary meaning, it must be taken on the innuendo meaning.
 88.I did not think, however, that this argument was of much assistance. I was mindful of the fact that the defendant`s statement is one step removed from that in 
 Lewis 
 case. The defendant stated that the plaintiff was the subject of the report. This is yet one step away from saying the plaintiff is under investigation. For if a statement that A is being investigated cannot mean that A is guilty, so much less can a statement that B has reported A. I do not think that the ordinary man would upon hearing the defendant`s statement make the triple leap from report to inquiry to suspicion to guilt, nor even necessarily the double leap from report to inquiry to suspicion.
 89.Might the ordinary man, however, be inclined to take the first step, that is to say, to draw the inference that where a bona fide police report has been made there is a likelihood that the police would be diligent enough to look into the report to determine whether it warrants further investigation? Mr Carman, in his opening, suggested otherwise, and I quote from his written opening statement: 
The complaint comes from a political opponent of the plaintiff who has many times clashed with them. A reasonable listener would know this and would not assume either that the police would necessarily investigate or that there was any reasonable basis for the complaint. On the contrary, a reasonable listener might be highly suspicious of the validity of the police complaint made by one political opponent about another in the heat and battle of a general election.`
 90.I do not agree. Whilst the ordinary man might not think much of vague allegations made by politicians against each other and might consider them no more than mere political bluster, he might think otherwise where a prominent politician who has stepped into the limelight as Mr Tang had, having avowed to protect his reputation and integrity, takes the serious step of reporting a matter to the police concerning his opponent`s denunciation of him. By extension, where a person announces to the public that such a report has been made, I have no difficulty in concluding that such an event would give the ordinary person in Singapore reason to pause and think. The ordinary person would consider that a police investigation into the affairs of the plaintiff might take place. However, I hasten to add that excluding all special knowledge from the mind of the ordinary person, the words complained of would not have imported any suggestion as to the 
 subject matter 
 of the investigation.
 91.Does that fact alone cause the plaintiff to be lowered in the estimation of the ordinary man? I am of the view that the ordinary man in Singapore is not so steeply cynical as to shrug off a matter such as a police investigation of a public official without a second thought. And, as I have stated, even if on reflection he were to dismiss the matter because he considers it very unlikely that anything would come out of the report, the broad, negative impression left on the audience is still actionable.
 92.I therefore find that the words spoken by the defendant are capable of defamatory meaning, not of the highest degree pleaded by the plaintiff, but of the lesser degree I have already expressed, that is, the ordinary man will come away with the impression that the plaintiff may have conducted himself in such a manner that it is possible he will be investigated for some offence or other. Naturally, how distant the shade of meaning is from the meaning pleaded is a very pertinent consideration in the matter of quantification of damages. Also relevant to quantum would be my finding that the words do not by themselves insinuate that investigation will be made specifically concerning criminal defamation or criminal conspiracy but only to some offence generally.
 93.
 Legal innuendo
It therefore remains for me to consider the question on the second cause of action, that is, whether there were any extrinsic facts which were known to the ordinary man in the audience on the night in question such that he would thereby be likely to put a meaning on the defendant`s words that go beyond the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and if so, what such a meaning might be and whether that meaning is defamatory. I think it useful to repeat here Mr Shield`s submission that the extrinsic facts transform the ordinary meaning into an imputation of guilt.
 94.Mr Shields contended that the following extrinsic facts were known to the audience at the Yio Chu Kang stadium on the night of 1 January 1997: (a). that Mr Tang intended to report the plaintiff and his colleagues to the police for having committed criminal offences, namely defamation of his character and of having concocted and spread lies about him; and
 (b). that Mr Tang in speeches at recent rallies had accused the plaintiff and his colleagues of concocting and spreading lies about him.
 This information, it was said, would be derived either personally through attending the rallies or through media coverage of the elections. Therefore, said Mr Shields, by uttering the fatal words, the defendant was importing the whole force of Mr Tang`s allegations.
 95.The preliminary matters I had to decide were whether (1) those extrinsic facts were proved; and (2) those extrinsic facts were within the special knowledge of the ordinary man attending the rally in question.
 96.I had no difficulty with proof of the extrinsic facts, for the defendant in his filed defence admitted the contents of newspaper articles narrating the debate between the plaintiff and Mr Tang, and although he put the plaintiff to strict proof on the content of the speeches made at the respective rallies, he elected not to cross-examine the witness put forward by the plaintiff to formally prove the contents of the video-tape of the campaign speeches.
 97.As for the question whether the ordinary Singaporean would have been cognizant of those facts, I am of the view that he would have been. As Mr Shields helpfully pointed out, this point was virtually conceded by counsel for the defendant when he put it to the plaintiff in cross-examination that: 
having regard to the circulation of the Straits Times, that by 31 December hundreds of thousands of people in Singapore would`ve also read that [Mr Tang was publicly stating that he was going to lodge a police report against the plaintiff].
 98.I think the evidence makes it clear that even in the defendant`s own mind, the controversy surrounding the allegations made against Mr Tang was, if not common knowledge, special knowledge in the minds of the publishees. This is apparent from the defendant`s speech at the Yio Chu Kang rally on 1 January 1997 in which he stated that: 
if a foreigner comes to Singapore and he reads the papers, he will think that the fight in this election is all between the PAP and just one man, Tang Liang Hong.
 99.I am therefore of the considered view that the ordinary reader, possessing the special knowledge concerning the dispute between Mr Tang and the plaintiff, would know full well the background against which the defendant`s comments were made. This background, however, was not limited to the facts relied on by the plaintiff. In considering the issue whether, marrying the extrinsic facts to the words spoken by the defendant, it could be said that the words bear an innuendo meaning independent of the ordinary meaning, I am of the view that I must consider all the extrinsic facts reasonably known to the ordinary member of the audience.
 100.Knowledge of these additional facts would have come to the ordinary member of the audience primarily through listening to the radio, reading the newspapers or watching election reports on television. With the exception of the speech made by the defendant on the night in question, I do not think it reasonable to impute to the ordinary member of the audience the whole text of all the rally speeches made by the parties to this action and Mr Tang over the several days of the election hustings, because on any given night the PAP and WP would have each organised several rallies, and the speakers would have rotated around the various venues. It would therefore be unrealistic to proceed on the basis that an ordinary member of the public had attended each rally and heard out the speeches in full. Naturally the contents of the speech made by the defendant on 1 January 1997 would be known to the audience at the Stadium but not the readers of the 
 Straits Times 
 or 
 Business Times 
.
 101.
 Straits Times 
 Sunday Times 
 Straits Times 
In that regard, I think that the following observations must be made: (a). An ordinary member of the audience must have known that the plaintiff initiated the controversy by publicly denouncing Mr Tang as an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist, a view that was published in the local newspapers around 26 and 27 December 1996.
 (b). He would also have been aware that the plaintiff`s basis for asserting those views was primarily the letters written by the various MPs in 1992 objecting to Mr Tang`s application to be a Nominated MP. This was made clear in an article in the of 27 December 1996. He would have been aware of the extracts of those letters printed in the of 29 December 1996.
 (c). He would also have been aware of the contents of the letter of demand written by Mr Tang`s lawyers to the plaintiff and the reply given by the plaintiff through his solicitors, both of which were printed in full in the on 30 December 1996. In particular, he would have been aware of the plaintiff`s invitation to Mr Tang to sue him.
 (d). The ordinary man would also have known that the defendant, whilst having come out in support of Mr Tang and stating his own view that Mr Tang was not an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist, had conspicuously refrained from commenting on Mr Tang`s threat to sue the Prime Minister and to report them to the police. He would have derived this from the defendant`s conduct during the campaign and also the remarks made by the defendant that if Mr Tang was in fact a Chinese chauvinist or an anti-Christian, he himself would eject Mr Tang from the party.
 102.There seems to have been some suggestion that the release of the contents of the police reports should be taken into account either as an extrinsic fact or a factor going to aggravate the damages payable. I am of the opinion that the contents of the report cannot be an extrinsic fact taken into account in determining the innuendo meaning of the defendant`s words. The words must be evaluated in light of the facts known at the point in time the words are published: see 
Grappelli & Anor v Derek Block (Holdings) Ltd & Anor
 
[1981] 2 All ER 272
.
 103.How then would the ordinary man equipped with this knowledge have viewed the defendant`s remarks? He would have understood that Mr Tang had made good on his threat to file a police report. He would also know that the report related to serious charges. He would have inferred that the report related to the debate between the plaintiff and Mr Tang, in particular Mr Tang`s allegation that the plaintiff was telling lies and concocting falsities about him to frustrate his election campaign. He would have inferred from the fact that the report to the police was made against a person as prominent as the plaintiff that it would not be taken lightly by the police. Whether the ordinary man would know enough to call these offences by their legal labels of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy is not relevant so long as there is common ground between what he understands Mr Tang`s allegations against the plaintiff to be and the elements of those offences.
 104.On the analysis thus far, the words are not capable of the meaning pleaded by the plaintiff. I am of the view that to the ordinary man the words must have imported that in Mr Tang`s view, the plaintiff had committed an act of serious enough proportions to merit a police report and that he was inviting an investigation into the truth of the allegations and counter-allegations which had formed the heart of the controversy involving Mr Tang and the plaintiff over the preceding days. I do not think that it could be said that the defendant had come out to say that the plaintiff was guilty of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy unless the defendant can be deemed to have adopted Mr Tang`s words as his own. This is a matter to which I now give further consideration.
 105.
 Whether the defendant adopted Mr Tang`s words
The statement of claim filed by the plaintiff detailed the allegations of defamation against Mr Tang as well as against the defendant. The claim set out at length the words spoken by Mr Tang which were considered by the plaintiff to be defamatory and contained pleadings as to the ordinary and innuendo meanings of those words. The statement of claim alleges that: 
By referring to the police report, the defendant was also repeating [Tang`s] defamatory statements and endorsing Mr Tang`s actions in filing the police report against the plaintiff.
 106.The plaintiff relied on this principally as an aggravating factor in the matter of damages. It is clear, however, that if those words were adopted by the defendant, then the defendant would equally be liable for the words spoken by Mr Tang if they were in fact defamatory. Could it be said that the defendant by his statement: 
And finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people.
 meant, in the proper context, that the plaintiff was guilty of having collaborated with the Senior Minister and others to produce a conspiracy of lies with a view to keeping Mr Tang out of Parliament at any cost and without regard for the law? Was the defendant adopting Mr Tang`s allegations?
 107.
Astaire v Campling & Anor
 
[1965] 3 All ER 666
 concerned a newspaper report on investigations conducted into the operations of `the man known in the fight game as ""Mr X""` . The article went on to name the plaintiff, a well-known boxing promoter, as `Mr X` . The plaintiff brought an action against the publisher alleging that the newspaper article carried innuendoes that defamed him. In pleading the facts relied on to support the innuendoes, the plaintiff did not rely on the article, but produced extracts from other newspapers published by persons other than the defendants. An application was made to strike out the pleading. The application was granted.
 108.The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the master granting the interlocutory application. Sellers LJ found (at p 667) that the innuendoes pleaded: 
are not and cannot be derived from the article complained of but arise, if at all, in the material set out in [the pleading] for which the defendants are not responsible. A reasonable reader would not and could not attribute them or their implications to the defendants.
 He went on to say: 
if [the public mind] has been affected by defamatory statements made by someone other than the defendant and not by the defendant, the article does not seem to me to make the defendant liable for anything more than it contains.
 Thus, although A has delivered defamatory remarks concerning B, and C has said something concerning B as well, C`s statement must, as a general rule, be considered on its own. It is either in itself defamatory or not - if it is not defamatory, it cannot, short of some clear reference adopting, importing or citing with approval the defamatory views of A, be actionable.
 109.Mr Carman relied on this case and referred me to the fact that it has been applied in the decision of Goh Joon Seng J in 
Ramaiah Naragatha Vally & Ors v Singapore Press Holdings Ltd & Anor
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 497
 . This case concerned an action brought by six plaintiffs who had been charged with murder or abetment of murder of the victim in what has been described as the famous `Curry Murder Case` . The plaintiffs were eventually all released because of lack of proof.
 110.An article published in the 
 Straits Times 
 reported that the case would be dramatized in a Mandarin serial by the Television Corporation of Singapore, and one Tsang Ho Man, the executive producer of the serial, furnished some comments to the effect that the true facts would be `garnished for dramatic effect`. A separate article on the same page narrated the facts of the murder, including the name of the victim, the manner in which the murder was carried out and the details of the arrest and release of the first to fourth plaintiffs (who had been charged with murder). This separate article did not mention Tsang; Tsang made no reference to the article.
 111.The plaintiffs brought a defamation action against the publisher of the 
 Straits Times 
 as the first defendant and against the named television executive as the second defendant. The second defendant applied successfully for the statement of claim against him to be struck out. Goh Joon Seng J, hearing the plaintiffs` appeal against that order, found firstly that the words published by the second defendant did not on their plain and ordinary meaning suggest that the plaintiffs were guilty of murder. On the alternative argument that the words published by the second defendant contained by way of innuendo the words contained in the secondary article narrating the facts of the murder, he found, applying 
 Astaire v Campling 
, that the second defendant was not responsible for the secondary article narrating the facts of the murder, nor had he adopted or repeated those facts in the published statement.
 112.Mr Carman urged these authorities on me, arguing that the defendant could not be said, by the statement complained of, to have adopted the prior statements of Mr Tang. Mr Shields appeared to suggest that Mr Tang`s words were adopted by the defendant and that they bore defamatory meaning.
 113.Mr Shields in his opening statement referred to the fact that Mr Tang and the defendant shared the same platform at rallies. He also pointed out in argument that they had taken a united stand (stood `shoulder to shoulder` ) in denying the plaintiff`s allegations. Answering this first and foremost on a technical point, it was not pleaded that the defendant, by his conduct, adopted Mr Tang`s words. It was pleaded that by referring to the police reports, the defendant was also repeating and endorsing Mr Tang`s actions in filing the police report. Strictly speaking, I therefore had to consider whether the defendant by his 
 words 
 adopted Mr Tang`s allegations independently of extrinsic facts.
 114.On an objective reading of just the words in isolation, I do not think that the defendant was necessarily adopting Mr Tang`s views, nor did he give the audience the impression that he shared those views. Although this might well have been the case had the defendant read out the contents of the police report, he did not go so far as to do that.
 115.However, even taking into account the extrinsic facts, I was not persuaded by Mr Shield`s submission that the defendant and Mr Tang stood so closely together that the defendant adopted Mr Tang`s words. The words must be put in their proper context. On the one hand it is true that the reference to Mr Tang and the Prime Minister would have raised in the audience`s mind the on-going controversy between them. However, I was also mindful of the defendant`s evidence that in his view that this was a battle to be fought by Mr Tang and that he (the defendant) was far too busy at the time to be overly concerned with how Mr Tang chose to take on the plaintiff`s allegations. I believed the defendant on this evidence, subject to a few qualifications which I will set out later in my comments on quantum. More importantly, applying the `ordinary man` test, I find that this was the impression left on the crowd. Ultimately, the defendant did not call the audience`s attention to the controversy surrounding Mr Tang and the Prime Minister. His message was quite different - that they should vote for themselves. The ordinary man would not have associated the defendant`s words so closely with Mr Tang`s as to say they were adopting each other`s rhetoric or repeating each other`s allegations.
 116.I am also persuaded, having viewed the video-tape of the defamatory remarks several times, that the defendant, as he asserted in evidence, was very much concerned to deliver the speech he had in mind, and that he announced the filing of the reports as a concession to Mr Tang`s persistent reminders rather than as a tactic calculated to leave the voters with a negative impression of the plaintiff. I will, however, for the time being reserve detailed comment on my findings on the defendant`s intention for my discussion on the matter of quantum.
 117.In conclusion on the question of innuendo, I am of the opinion that whilst the defendant never went so far as to adopt Mr Tang`s words and to make them his own, he had yet to take the step of disassociating himself from Mr Tang`s characterisation of the plaintiff as a liar. Although the defendant admitted in evidence that he did not have personal knowledge of the facts relied on by the plaintiff in impugning Mr Tang`s character, having known Mr Tang for some years, he was nevertheless prepared to assert his opinion that the accusations against Mr Tang were not true. He was prepared to come out on behalf of Mr Tang and to lend his reputation as Secretary-General of the Workers` Party to remedy the damage that might have been done to Mr Tang`s reputation by proclaiming that from what he knew about Mr Tang, Mr Tang was not an anti-Christian or a Chinese chauvinist. I am therefore of the view that the defendant, in making the alleged defamatory statement, was in effect saying this: `I think Tang is a good man. Mr Goh does not. I disagree with Mr Goh. Now a police report has been filed by Mr Tang, as he said he would do, to clear his name. So let`s have the police deal with it.` This imputation, that the issue was of sufficient gravity that the police would not dismiss it as a mere nuisance, does, in my opinion, bear defamatory meaning.
 118.I am not saying that in 
 every 
circumstance where A states to B `Look, C has filed a report against D` , A is guilty of defamation. The question whether that statement is defamatory is dependent in every case on its own facts. This was also the view of Lord Devlin in the 
 Lewis 
 case (at p 284): 
If it is said of a man - `I do not believe that he is guilty of fraud but I cannot deny that he has given grounds for suspicion,` it seems to me to be wrong to say that in no circumstances can they be justified except by the speaker proving the truth of that which he has expressly said he did not believe. 
 It must depend on whether the impression conveyed by the speaker is one of frankness or one of insinuation.
` [Emphasis supplied.]
 In the present case, I consider the defendant`s words in their context to be defamatory for they carry the suggestion that the plaintiff may, in making those allegations against Mr Tang have done something wrong. This was not a case in which the defendant, upon hearing from Mr Tang that he had made police reports, was so shocked and surprised that he ran to his neighbour and said in frankness and candour `Did you know what Tang did? He reported Goh!` with no other intention than to express his surprise or to inform the neighbour of this development. The words, taking into account the extrinsic facts, suggest not only that the plaintiff may be investigated for an offence, but go beyond that by suggesting the general nature and substance of the offence. The force of the defendant`s suggestion, although falling short of implying there are reasonable grounds of suspicion for the offence, nonetheless imply that something is amiss, and this renders the defendant`s utterance of those words actionable.
 119.Although the plaintiff has not established the defamatory meaning pleaded in his statement of claim, he has nevertheless established the lesser defamatory meaning referred to above. His claim against the defendant therefore succeeds to that extent.
 120.
 Liability for republication
Before turning to the assessment of damages, I will consider the liability of the defendant for the republication of his statement in the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
 on 2 January 1997.
 121.Generally, where A has published defamatory remarks to B and B, voluntarily and without A`s authorization, then repeats them to another, A is not liable for the damage caused by the republication: 
Ward v Weeks
 
[1830] 7 Bing 211
. After the decision in 
Speight v Gosnay
 
[1891] 60 LJQB 231
 it was widely believed that this guiding principle is subject to three main exceptions, namely: (a). where A authorised or intended B to repeat or republish them;
 (b). where the repetition or republication by B was a natural and probable result of the original publication; and
 (c). where B was under a moral duty to repeat or publish the words to a third party.
 This simple statement of the law, which has stood for over a hundred years would benefit from more analysis.
 122.It was recently argued before the English Court of Appeal in 
Slipper v British Broadcasting Corporation
 
[1991] 1 QB 283
 that 
 Speight 
 was not in fact good law. The appellants contended that the House of Lords in 
Weld-Blundell v Stephens
 
[1920] AC 956
 had affirmed the rule in 
 Ward v Weeks 
 without exception, and that 
 Speight 
 was, by implication, not approved. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It took the view that the House in 
 Weld-Blundell 
 was not concerned to establish 
 Ward v Weeks 
 as a principle in the law of defamation. The Court considered that the law on republication was not governed by special rules but by the ordinary rules relating to remoteness of damage. The question in all cases was whether the republication was a natural, ordinary and probable consequence of the original publication. If there was a chain of causation leading from the utterance of the words to the damage caused through republication, then the defendant would be liable for that damage. If, on the other hand, the chain of causation was interrupted by a 
 novus actus interveniens 
, liability would be limited to the damage caused before the onset of the 
 novus actus 
. This is a useful starting point for the remarks which follow.
 123.It is sometimes said that where A authorises or intends for B to publish his statement, there is a separate cause of action for republication, such that A is liable for the original and second publication. One analysis is that if A has authorised the republication, A is then liable for the original publication and then for 
 authorising 
 republication. The person actually liable for the republication is the republisher, B: see, for example, 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
(8th Ed) in which the learned author writes (at p 123): 
There may be two causes of action against a person who has authorised the republication of defamatory words published by him, one in respect of the original publication and another in respect of the republication, and he is liable on both grounds for the damage which flows from the republication.
 124.In addition, Mr Shields highlighted a passage in 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
(17th Ed, 1995) (at p 1136) which I now set out: 
An intention that the publication should be repeated may be deduced from the circumstances in which it is made and in this connection 
 the probability of repetition may be material
. Thus where defamatory statements are made in the hearing of several persons with a reckless indifference to the consequences, the court may well find the existence of an intention that they should be repeated [Emphasis supplied.]
 125.In principle, I can see no reason why the fact that a person has not directed his mind to the likely consequences of his actions - does not, as the saying goes, think before he speaks - should escape the consequences. However, this whole approach suggests that wherever A has authorised, intended or been reckless as to the possibility of republication, there are three causes of action - two against A (for the original publication and for authorising republication) and one against B (for the republication).
 126.I do not agree with this approach. If a defendant is liable for republication because he can be said to have `intended` it where `the probability of repetition` is significant, this, in essence, appears to me indistinguishable from the test applied in cases on remoteness of damage - that is, whether the damage is a natural and probable consequence of the defendant`s acts. The question in both cases is whether republication was probable, or put another way, if the possibility of it was too remote. If the test is identical, I can think of no reason why a distinction between both types of cases should be sustained.
 127.In light of the decision in 
 Slipper 
, I think the better view is that a defendant who is found liable for the original publication is liable for all subsequent republications which are the natural and probable result of his act. His liability for republication does not arise out of the fact that he 
 authorised 
 or 
 intended 
 the republication or that he was publishing the defamatory remark to one who was under a social, moral or legal duty to repeat it. There are only two causes of action - the one cause against the original publisher and the second cause against the republisher. The damages to be assessed for the original publication must extend to include foreseeable loss, including loss arising out of foreseeable republication.
 128.The principles on remoteness of damage are and have always been independent of the tortfeasor`s intention, recklessness or otherwise, and I think nothing is to be gained by developing the law other than on those lines. It is a simple question of determining whether republication was a natural and probable consequence of the defendant`s original publication. As I have said, the defendant`s state of mind affects quantum, not liability.
 129.The general rule in 
 Ward v Weeks 
 is simply that the original publisher is liable for his publication and the republisher for his republication. Separate acts constitute separate torts. However, applying the rules relating to remoteness of damage to the original tort, it is conceivable that the original publisher is liable for the republication where that republication was more likely than not the consequence of the original publication.
 130.If the defendant authorised or intended the republication, it would almost certainly be the case that republication was a foreseeable consequence. Similarly, if the defendant published it to a person under some sort of duty to repeat it, the probability of repetition would be high. Where the defendant acted innocently but recklessly, how probable repetition would have been is still a question of degree to be answered on the facts of every case.
 131.Applying this analysis to the present case, the question before me is whether the damage caused by the republication was so remote that the defendant could not be said to be liable for it?
 132.Notwithstanding Mr Shield`s excellent submissions, I do not think it can be said that the defendant authorised the republication of his remarks by the 
 Straits Times 
, whether expressly or impliedly. I accepted the defendant`s evidence that he would have much preferred that the newspapers focused on his challenge to the voters to `vote for themselves`. In fact, he expressed consternation in cross-examination that the newspapers had instead dwelt on what he considered to be a sideline to his main message. By the same token I do not find as a fact that he purposefully intended (in the sense of having actively desired) for that portion of his statement to be republished. What then was the probability of republication?
 133.In 
 Slipper 
, the plaintiff brought an action against the makers of a film which portrayed him in a negative light. He considered also that the filmmakers were liable for reviews of the film published by third parties which repeated the defamatory sting of the film. The defendants applied to strike out the pleading that the republication should be taken into account in assessing damages. The application was rejected and the appeal to the Court of Appeal failed. The Court of Appeal considered that it was not plain and obvious that the jury would not find that the defendants had caused the reviews of the film.
 134.In a case more directly on point, 
 McWhirter v Manning & Ors 
 (
 The Times 
, 29 October 1954), the jury considered that a slander spoken by the defendant concerning the plaintiff in the course of a speech at the 45th annual delegate meeting of the National Union of Journalists was defamatory. The jury having answered that question in the affirmative, it fell upon Hallett J to consider whether the defendant was liable for the republication of that slander in the form of a libel by a newspaper publisher. He rejected the argument that because the defendant knew that there were reporters at the meeting and that a report of what he said might and probably would appear in a printed report, he must be taken as having caused the republication. He considered that once the words had flown out of the defendant`s mouth, he did nothing whatsoever to procure publication of the words in a printed form. It was other people who had got it into print and so the defendant, liable for the slander, was not guilty of the libel. Although a 
 causa sine qua non 
 of the libel, he could not be said to be the 
 causa causans 
.
 135.Unfortunately, the usefulness of that case is limited by the brevity of the report and the omission of Hallett J`s detailed reasoning, and I do not propose to follow it for I consider it to be capable of distinction in one significant respect, to which I now turn.
 136.There is an undeniable relationship between causation and the likelihood of repetition. If one repeats things in circumstances in which the likelihood of repetition is almost certain, then one must be said to have caused the repetition and one is liable for it. This appears to be the underlying rationale for the third exception, that where one publishes words to a person whose moral, social or legal duty it is to repeat them, one is liable for the repetition. In the present case, I consider that regardless of the defendant`s intention, the probability of repetition was very high. Although a minor part of his speech, it revealed a fact that the general public would have had great interest in knowing. It, in a sense, was the next instalment in the ongoing saga between Mr Tang and the Prime Minister. People would want to know - has Mr Tang carried out his threats? It was therefore a statement that was almost bound to be repeated.
 137.It is therefore my view that republication was a more probable consequence in the present case than in the case before Hallett J, and I venture to speculate that were he in my position, with the benefit of the 
 Slipper 
 decision before him, he would be in agreement. If republication is not too remotely foreseeable a consequence, then the damage resulting from republication is damage not too remote, and the defendant is liable for the whole damage arising out of his original publication to the audience at the rally and the subsequent republication by the press: see 
Cutler & Anor v McPhail
 
[1962] 2 All ER 474
. Even if there is some possibility that the newspapers may be held to be jointly liable in some way, I am not entitled to take that into consideration in assessing damages payable by the defendant: see, for example, 
Maxfield v Llewellyn & Ors
 
[1961] 3 All ER 95
. This may seem particularly onerous for the defendant, particularly when it appears there is some complicity on the part of the newspapers for the extent to which the libel is circulated. I will deal with the liability of the newspapers for contribution in the next section.
 138.
 Liability of Straits Times and Business Times to contribute
In the typical case involving a slander republished in the newspapers, both the original publisher and the republisher will be sued in court. Oftentimes, the newspaper will be sued because it will have the deeper pockets. There will then be an apportionment of liability between the original and subsequent publisher, having not insignificant regard to the circulation of the newspaper and the original publisher`s intention in making those comments to or in the presence of journalists. In this case, the plaintiff elected not to sue the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
, because, as he put it ` I would go after the person who originated the defamation against me I have a choice to do so or not to do so. So I chose to sue the one who originated it.`
 139.There is nothing at law compelling the plaintiff to sue both the 
 Straits Times 
and the 
 Business Times 
 together with the defendant. In fact, if the plaintiff is confident that the defendant is good for the sum, there is sense in not running the risk of paying three parties` costs in the eventuality that his claim fails. And subject to the rules on remoteness, a plaintiff can be confident of an award covering the original and subsequent publication. However, the law does afford to the defendant the option of either joining the newspapers as third parties (which he has not done), or the option of suing them for contribution in the event he is found liable. This is provided for in s 11(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) which provides that: 
11(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) -
 
 
(c) any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought.
 140.In the context of the question whether the publisher of a newspaper who republishes a defamatory statement is liable under this provision to contribute to damages paid by the original publisher, I am of the view that the answer must be affirmative. Mr Shields, in his submissions, argued that each repetition constitutes a separate cause of action. This was also the view of LP Thean J in the High Court`s decision in 
Lee Kuan Yew v Devan Nair (Straits Times Press (1975) Ltd & Anor, Third Parties)
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 723
 . In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendant for remarks published by him in an interview that was reprinted in the 
 Straits Times 
. The defendant issued a third party notice against the Straits Times Press (`STP`) seeking to join them on the basis that he was entitled to an indemnity or contribution from them. STP applied to strike out the notice. The application failed before the registrar and failed again on appeal. Said the learned judge: 
The publication by STP was a republication of the defendant`s press statement. If the press statement is held to be a libel, then the publication by STP is equally a libel. `Every republication of a libel is a new libel, and each publisher is answerable for his act to the same extent as if the calumny originated with him`: see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (8th Ed) p 117. In those circumstances, both the defendant and STP are tortfeasors, and STP clearly `is, or would, if sued, have been, liable in respect of the same damage` as provided in s 11(1)(c); the question of the defendant`s claim for contribution will then arise and the court will under s 11(2) have to determine such amount of contribution as may be found to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of STP`s responsibility.
 Therefore STP was joined as a third party and they were liable to contribute in the event the plaintiff`s case was made out.
 141.That, however, is not the position in the present case. Without making any findings as to whether the 
 Straits Times 
or 
 Business Times 
 are in this present case liable for republishing the defendant`s statements, I wish only to highlight that it has been recently held by the Malaysian High Court that unless the other tortfeasor (ie either of the newspapers) is joined as a third party or co-defendant, there can be no question of an order apportioning liability. A sole defendant is liable for the whole sum: 
Razman bin Hashim v South East Asia Insurance Co
 
 
[1995] 2 MLJ 469
 . This is also the position in Singapore.
 142.However, if a defendant is made liable for the whole sum, having failed to join the other tortfeasors in the main action, there is nothing preventing him from commencing an action for contribution. In fact, the 
 right 
 of contribution only runs from the date the award is granted, so in one sense to seek contribution before liability has been determined is premature. The relationship between cases in which tortfeasors are sued together and cases in which one torfteasor seeks contributions against the other after his liability is determined is expressed by the authors of 
 Clerk & Lindsell 
 (at p 154) as follows: 
The right to contribution accrues when the claimant is held liable in respect of the damage, or when he agrees to make a payment in compensation for that damage questions of contribution between parties joined as co-defendants can be disposed of at the end of the proceedings in which judgment is given against them, even if separate proceedings for contribution have not been instituted. Contribution proceedings between defendants can also continue after the plaintiff`s claim has been settled as if they had been brought by a separate action and there is no need for fresh proceedings to be started.
 Quite clearly, it is more convenient for a defendant to join his fellow tortfeasors as third parties, as his liability will be cut down at the date of the judgment. If, however, he elects to challenge liability on his own and to initiate proceedings for contribution subsequently, that is as much his prerogative as it is the plaintiff`s in electing who to sue in the first place.
 143.In this case, if the newspapers were sued, they may be able to raise a defence available uniquely to themselves that is not available to the defendant in the present case. This is the defence of qualified privilege contained in s 12 of the Defamation Act. Section 12(1) states that: 
Subject to this section, the publication in a newspaper of any such report or other matter as is mentioned in the Schedule shall be privileged unless the publication is proved to be made with malice.
 This includes paragraph 2 of Part II of the Schedule which deems privileged: 
A fair and accurate report of the proceedings at any public meeting held in Singapore, being a meeting bona fide and lawfully held for a lawful purpose and for the furtherance or discussion of any matter of public concern, whether the admission to the meeting is general or restricted.
 144.This defence was successfully raised in an action related to one by the Workers` Party against a PAP MP who alleged at an election rally that the WP was financed by a foreign country: 
Workers` Party v Tay Boon Too; Workers` Party v Attorney-General
 
 [1975] 1 MLJ 47 
 [1972-1974] SLR 621 . The words were republished on air by Radio Singapore under the auspices of the Department of Broadcasting. The PAP MP was sued and the Department of Broadcasting sued in a related action and nominally represented by the Attorney-General. Under s 13, a broadcast publication is entitled to the same protection as is afforded a newspaper, including the qualified privilege defence under s 12.
 145.FA Chua J held in that case that the election rally, for which there is a lawful permit, fell squarely within the definition of a `public meeting being a meeting bona fide and lawfully held for a lawful purpose`. He then went on to hold that the accusation made against the Workers` Party was a matter of public concern. Finally, holding that the report of the allegation was a fair and accurate report, he dismissed the Workers` Party`s claim against the Department of Broadcasting.
 146.Needless to say, the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
, though they may be tortfeasors at common law, are entitled to the statutory defence in an action by the defendant for contribution if they can bring themselves within the statutory requirements. It may well be, however, that the inaccuracy in the 
 Business Times 
report (to which I have referred to earlier) may deprive the 
 Business Times 
 of the defence.
 147.
 Quantum
I now turn to the issue of quantum. The starting point is, as always, that damages should be compensatory and not punitive. The authors of 28 
 Halsbury`s Law of England 
 (4th Ed), para 235 state that: 
In actions for libel and slander, damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for (1) the injury to his reputation; and (2) the hurt to his feelings. Such damages are compensatory and are at large. They operate to vindicate the plaintiff to the public and to console him for the wrong done; they are better viewed as a solatium than as monetary recompense for harm measurable in money terms The general compensatory damages may be increased to take into account the defendant`s motives in uttering the words complained of, or his conduct before or during the action; such `aggravated damages` (which must be distinguished from exemplary damages) are meant to compensate the plaintiff for the additional injury, going beyond that which would have flowed from the words alone, caused by the presence of the aggravating factors. Exemplary damages, that is, damages going beyond mere compensation, can only be awarded in special circumstances.
 By saying that the damages are `at large` , no more is meant than that the damages are not readily quantifiable by mathematical calculation. This approach is attributable to the decision of the House of Lords in 
Broome & Anor v Cassell & Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 1027
, in which Lord Hailsham of Marylebone said: 
In actions of defamation the principle of restitution in integrum has necessarily an even more highly subjective element. Such actions involve a money award which may put the plaintiff in a purely financial sense in a much stronger position than he was before the wrong. Not merely can he recover the estimated sum of his past and future losses, but, in case the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, he must be able to point to a sum awarded by a jury sufficient to convince a by-stander of the baselessness of the charge This is why it is not necessarily fair to compare awards of damages in this field with damages for personal injuries.
 Consequently, a person might receive a much larger sum in compensation for a libel than for a grievous personal injury.
 148.Mr Carman drew my attention to a recent case in England in which there appears to have been a move away from the doctrine expressed by the House of Lords in 
 Broome v Cassell 
. This was the decision of the English Court of Appeal, 
John v MGN Ltd
 
[1996] 2 All ER 35
 in which Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was, now Lord Bingham) delivered a judgment reducing the damages awarded to pop singer Elton John in respect of a defamatory article printed concerning him in the 
 Sunday Mirror 
 from 75,000 compensatory and 275,000 exemplary damages to 25,000 and 50,000 respectively. In doing so, his Lordship considered the decision in 
 Broome v Cassell 
 and then stated: 
It is in our view offensive to public opinion, and rightly so, that a defamation plaintiff should recover damages for injury to reputation greater, perhaps by a significant factor, than if that same plaintiff had been rendered a helpless cripple or an insensate vegetable. The time has in our view come when judges, and counsel, should be free to draw the attention of juries to these comparisons.
 149.Mr Carman suggested that along those same lines, I might adopt the approach of the English Court of Appeal and to achieve some degree of parity between awards in personal injury cases and defamation cases. Attractive as his argument is, I am bound to follow the established precedent in our courts to apply the law as it has been stated in 
 Broome v Cassell 
. In particular, my attention was drawn to the decision of the Court of Appeal in J 
eyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
  which cites with approval the dicta of the then Lord Chancellor, and that decision is a good statement of the law in Singapore except to the extent that it has been qualified by s 19 of the Defamation Act in situations where there has been a settlement between the plaintiff and one of several defendants: see 
Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur & Ors
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 542
 .
 150.I therefore propose to assess the damages payable by the defendant in accordance with established convention. Mr Shields thoughtfully put before me a schedule of awards in defamation cases heard before the Singapore courts. I note however that awards in other cases are not particularly helpful as a guide because each libel is to be treated on its own and the mix of factors that may affect the quantum are rarely duplicated.
 151.A useful starting point is the following passage from 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
(8th Ed) at pp 592-593 which describes factors which may be taken into consideration in assessing damages: 
the conduct of the plaintiff, his position and standing, the nature of the libel, the mode and extent of publication, the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology and the whole conduct of the defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the very moment of their verdict.
 The list is not, however, exhaustive, and I propose to consider the relevant factors in turn.
 152.
 The nature of the defamation
It seems almost too obvious to say that there is a high degree of correlation between the defamatory meaning of the words uttered or printed and the award of damages. I must assess damages on the meaning of the words as I have found them to be. Although I am entitled to make separate awards in respect of the words in their natural and innuendo meanings, I think that in this case, the innuendo meaning is not so obviously different from the natural meaning that such an approach is justifiable. I am more inclined to make a single award of damages having greater regard to the innuendo meaning, being the more insidious of the two.
 153.In so doing, I am aware that if this were a case in which the innuendo was only understood by a small fraction of the audience and the natural meaning was understood by the vast majority, then however injurious the innuendo meaning, the damages would by and large be a reflection of the gravity of the natural meaning. However, the facts dictate that this is not such a case and I am prepared to rule on the basis that the innuendo meaning was perceived by a substantial majority of the audience at the rally and a substantial majority of the readership of the 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
.
 154.
 The reputation and standing of the plaintiff
The second important factor to consider is the reputation and standing of the plaintiff. Equally obvious as the first point is the proposition that where defamatory allegations are cast against a man who is of high standing and a man who is of low standing, the damage suffered by the former will outstrip that of the latter. This is particularly so where the person is disparaged in his office or trade, for this has the effect of impairing his reputation not only socially but also in the execution of his duties or the conduct of his business. It is true that if the plaintiff could prove actual loss of custom, that would be taken into account. That is not so in this case.
 155.In the statement of claim, it was pleaded that: 
By reason of the matters set out above, the plaintiff has: 
(1) been gravely injured in his character, credit and reputation; 
(2) been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt; 
(3) endured considerable distress and embarrassment; and 
(4) suffered damage accordingly.
 In his affidavit, the plaintiff stated that: 
My reputation, moral authority and leadership standing have been gravely injured both locally and internationally.
 In cross-examination, however, the plaintiff was less unequivocal: 
Mr Carman: Has 1997 been a bad year for you as Prime Minister? 
Plaintiff: On the contrary, I think it has been a good year. 
Mr Carman: A good year? 
Plaintiff: Yes. 
Mr Carman: Your standing as a leader has not been injured in the world? 
Plaintiff: No.
 When the statement in his affidavit was highlighted to him, Mr Carman put the question to the plaintiff again. 
Mr Carman: Is it true that your leadership standing in the world has been gravely injured? 
Plaintiff: Yes. 
 
Mr Carman: Would you give the court the examples of how you know and in what way your leadership standing in the world has been gravely injured in 1997? It`s been a good year for you. 
Plaintiff: Well, I think when - had I not taken this action, then the injury would be permanent, so at that point of time when I decided to take action, it was because I felt aggrieved that I have been called a liar, conspiring to lie, and so on and 
 
Mr Carman: Well, you called it a Molotov cocktail but you are unable to point to any international damage, are you? 
Plaintiff: No, I cannot in sincerity point to a particular damage.
 156.Two comments must be made about this exchange. The first is that the plaintiff quite rightly points out that he is entitled to damages for the personal injury to his feelings and his consternation at having been defamed. Secondly, Mr Carman submitted on the basis of this passage that since the plaintiff had not been able to point to any specific damage, `derisory` damages of (say) $1 should be awarded. I think, however, that the effect of Mr Carman`s submission, if it were accepted without qualification, would be to transform the established principle that defamation damages are unquantifiable or `at large` into a principle by which the plaintiff would have to prove specific instances in which his reputation was not what it used to be before the libel was spoken.
 157.With all respect for the cleverness of Mr Carman`s argument, I cannot accept it. The whole essence of the law of defamation is that that one`s reputation has been denigrated, and that fact (unlike loss of custom) is not always capable of concrete proof. This is why the test whether words are defamatory is objective and not a trial by poll. It would be absurd to say that so many percent of the population think a little less of you, so many percent think much less of you and so many percent think nothing of it and so you are entitled to such and such a sum. The damages are `at large` because one often cannot point to instances of public ridicule or humiliation. On the contrary, it is undoubtedly the case that a great measure of the damage suffered takes the form of shadowy rumours and wild speculations, which, if allowed to fester, will irreparably damage the public perception of the plaintiff`s integrity, morality and trustworthiness. Thus, even if not a single instance of damage can be proved, the court is entitled to step back and to address these speculations and rumours in assessing the damages. And the court will award such sum as damages as will publicly vindicate a plaintiff in his aggrieved feelings. The judicial pronouncement of damages sends a clear message to the rest of the world that the imputations made against the plaintiff are unsustainable. This is what I think Lord Hailsham had in mind in 
 Broome v Cassell 
 and, subject to the reversal of that case by our Court of Appeal, I am not prepared to make an award contrary to that principle. I do, however, think that some weight must be granted to the plaintiff`s concession that 1997 has, on balance, been a `good year` for him.
 158.
 Intention of the plaintiff
It is also an established principle that where the defendant said the words innocently, the award of damages should be less than if he had spoken the words maliciously.
 159.A defendant has acted in malice where the words spoken were calculated to cause injury to the plaintiff. A distinction is to be made between presumed malice and express malice. In every case in which words are defamatory, the law presumes that they are false and the defendant must prove they are true. In the sense that the defendant who fails to prove justification has no just cause or excuse for the defamatory publication, all defamatory statements are published with `malice` (known as `presumed malice` ).
 160.However, the form of malice which may, if pleaded, be relied on to aggravate damages, is what is known as express or actual malice. This is the same type of malice that rebuts a defence of qualified privilege or fair comment. The plaintiff in this case has alleged that the defendant was actuated by express malice. The actual pleading reads as follows: 
the defendant knew and/or ought to have known that the allegation that the plaintiff had, inter alia, committed and was guilty of the offences of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy were untrue. The plaintiff will say that the defendant caused the offending words to be published, falsely and maliciously, knowing that the allegation was false and/or slanderous and/or libelous and/or with a reckless disregard as to whether or not they were false and/or slanderous and/or libelous.`
 Counsel for the plaintiff did not make any suggestions as to how the issue of malice should be treated in the event that I should arrive at a meaning other than the meaning pleaded. This is particularly critical in light of the fact that the meaning as I have found it is not consistent with the high degree of actual malice pleaded. There were two competing considerations.
 161.On the one hand, it was clear that the defendant was not simply announcing that the police reports had been made without any knowledge pertaining to them whatsoever. This is apparent from the following passage in his cross-examination: 
Mr Shields: And you knew what Tang was saying he was going to do? 
Defendant: Yes, he was going to sue them and also make a report, yes. 
Mr Shields: So you knew that and you knew the basis as we say of that report? 
Defendant: I knew this, you know, that they are telling lies about him, yes. 
Mr Shields: That they were effectively conspiring to defame him, concocting lies? 
Defendant: Yes, concocting lies, yes. 
Mr Shields: So you knew that? 
Defendant: Yes. 
Mr Shields: So you knew what was the basis of the report? 
Defendant: He was saying that they are lying, yes.
 On the other hand, the defendant attempted to put in context the words he had spoken as follows: 
Defendant (in cross-examination): I considered it absolutely important to get my message to the voters. I had been telling them that they had to stand up, they had to do something for themselves and here was their opportunity. So, that was really my whole concentration. I didn`t know or even expected Tang to come and suddenly, you know, distract me, but he suddenly came up Tang just put [the reports] by the side and whispered to me, `I`ve now got the reports, I`ve now got the reports, tell them`. I didn`t even take much notice and I think I probably said to him to leave it and go, and I continued because I thought my message was more important. Then the man comes up again and I think, you know, again taps the papers, saying, you know, almost sort of pleading that I should tell them now. Then I thought perhaps I should, you know, as he`s been denying it and that the crowd should know that he`s prepared to back up his denial by handing it over to the police now.
 Having viewed the video-tape, and I must add that viewing the video-tape is critical in putting this case into its proper perspective, and having listened to the testimony of the defendant, I am prepared to make the following findings of fact: (a). The defendant interrupted the theme of his speech to inform the audience that Mr Tang had filed police reports. The defendant did not, as the plaintiff alleged, utter the impugned words to incite the crowd. Although his words attracted some applause, the defendant did not exploit that response. Instead, he continued on his previous theme and told the crowd that he wanted them to leave quietly, and that he did not want trouble with the police.
 (b). The tenor and content of the speech did not suggest that the PAP was dishonest or that its members were guilty of criminal offences. The whole context of the defendant`s closing remarks was to urge the audience not to vote along party lines but to vote in their best interests, although the defendant clearly adopted the stance that a vote for the PAP was not in the audience`s best interests.
 (c). The defendant did not buttress or adopt the allegations made by Mr Tang against the plaintiff. The defendant in the earlier part of his speech, had in effect said that although he was of the view that Mr Tang was not an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist, if it were proven that he were, he would eject Mr Tang from the Workers` Party. In so stating, the defendant did not assert that the plaintiff was a liar or conspiring to defame Mr Tang.
 (d). The defendant did not, as a whole, appear to be acting in concert with Mr Tang to defame the plaintiff. The defendant did not adopt a conspiratorial air with Mr Tang. He did not address Mr Tang when Mr Tang went up to place what were ostensibly the police reports before the defendant. He did not address Mr Tang when Mr Tang went up the second time - instead he spoke to Mr Low. To judge the defendant`s reaction as seen on the tape, he appeared to be more annoyed by Mr Tang than in league with him.
 (e). The defamatory words spoken appear to have been more a concession to his running-mate, to, so to speak, give him face. This is apparent because the words complained of have very little contextual relevance to the words spoken before and after. They are an anomalous blip which go against the grain of the defendant`s speech. I accept the defendant`s evidence that at that time he had not read the police reports and save that he knew, from the press reports of what Mr Tang had said, that the report must relate to the allegations that Mr Tang was anti-Christian and a Chinese chauvinist, he did not know exactly what was contained in the reports.
 162.Although I do not think the sum of my findings can support the contention that the defendant was actuated by express malice, I am, however, prepared to find that the defendant did intend the innuendo meaning as I have found it to be. The defendant intended, in making the announcement he did, to convey to the crowd that the candidates for the Workers` Party, himself and Mr Tang included, had the force of conviction to act on their words. He was not prepared to reject Mr Tang outright. He was not prepared to adopt without qualification the plaintiff`s allegations. He intended thereby to maintain his stand that the plaintiff`s allegations against Mr Tang were untrue and that a public inquiry should be held to determine if they were in fact so. He also knew that in so doing he was not acting altruistically in the interest of Mr Tang, but that there would be political benefits to be derived for the Workers` Party from that announcement. This is apparent from the following exchange between the defendant and Mr Shields: 
Mr Shields: Therefore you perceived an electoral advantage in telling the crowd that the police reports had been made? 
Defendant: Well, yes, that we are serious when we deny that we are Chinese chauvinists or anti-Christians, that we are serious men and we don`t go around just making empty speeches.
 163.Even if the defendant did not intend the innuendo meaning, I am prepared in the alternative to find that he was reckless or indifferent as to whether his words had that effect. The defendant may not have planned with Mr Tang to act in concert against the plaintiff, but he certainly knew the extent of coverage given to the defendant`s debate with the plaintiff, otherwise he would not have stated at the rally that: 
if you have been following the papers, I am sure Singaporeans are sick and tired of what has been published in the papers. But if a foreigner comes to Singapore and he reads the papers, he will think that the fight in this election is all between the PAP and just one man, Tang Liang Hong.
 This shows without a doubt that the defendant was well and fully aware of the controversy surrounding Mr Tang. If he did not, as I have found, intend the impact of his words, he was reckless as to their impact. I premise this finding on the following admission made by the defendant in cross-examination: 
Defendant: I told the audience that he had just placed in front of me copies of reports [Tang] had made to the police, that`s all I told the audience. 
Mr Shields: You knew full well what the impact of that was, didn`t you? 
Defendant: No, Sir. 
Mr Shields: You know full well that the inference was that [Tang] was reporting them because they were lying, that they were spreading false lies about him? 
Defendant: Again, Sir, if I have to repeat myself, I didn`t really think. I just told them he`s made reports, that`s all.
 I did not look at what the impact would be, what he`s reported them for. Wasn`t in the forefront of my mind 
. 
[Emphasis supplied.] 
 164.The defendant was also reckless in making the assertions he did in that he did not attempt to verify whether or not what was said of Mr Tang were true - he acted on his own belief and opinion in a matter of considerable public interest. He stated in cross examination: 
Mr Shields: did you make any attempts yourself to find out whether they were telling the truth - to look at the material which would support their assertion and their attacks upon Mr Tang? 
Defendant: No. 
Mr Shields: So it`s only on your own knowledge of Mr Tang that you took the view that the plaintiffs were lying about him in attacking him? 
Defendant: Yes I sort of gathered they were sort of basing it on what had happened in the past.
 The defendant subsequently stated his position without ambivalence: 
Defendant: I didn`t believe them [meaning, the plaintiffs]. I`m sorry, your Honour. I didn`t believe that he was a Chinese chauvinist but I keep - I have to repeat again your Honour. I wasn`t in any position to make any judgment as to whether they were lying or not.
 165.I am also prepared to find as a fact that the defendant had a reckless disregard as to whether his comments would be published in the newspapers. The defendant attempted at trial to explain his view that reporters leave at the end of the rally and so he did not think his comment would find it`s way into the press. That appears to be no more than speculation by the defendant. He really did not know, when he made the announcement, that reporters had left. Even if they had, the announcement being `news-worthy` there was no reason for him to think that amongst the many thousands who were still at the rally, some would not have passed the information on to the press. I therefore find that the defendant was reckless as to whether the message would indeed be picked up by the press.
 166.In assessing damages, the court may take into consideration not only malice, but whether the defendant acted recklessly in making the defamatory statement. Thus, in 
 E Hulton & Co v Jones 
, Lord Loreburn LC stated (at p 24) that: 
The damages are certainly heavy, but I think your Lordships ought to remember the jury were entitled to think, in the absence of proof satisfactory to them that some ingredient of recklessness, or more than recklessness, entered into the writing and the publication of this article `
 167.In this respect, I am prepared to take into consideration that the defendant was reckless not only as to whether the press would republish the statement, but also as to the effect the statement would have on the ordinary member of the audience taking into account such a person`s knowledge of the on-going debate involving Mr Tang.
 168.
 Offer of apology
The plaintiff, by a letter of demand dated 25 January 1997 demanded an apology from the defendant in the following terms: 
1 On 1 January 1997, I spoke at a Workers` Party Rally at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium. 
2 I had made certain statements during the said Rally, suggesting that the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong had, inter alia, committed and was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation (which is punishable under s 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine or with both); and the offence of criminal conspiracy (which is punishable under s 120B(1) of the Penal Code with imprisonment), by reason of his conspiracy with the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Chin Harn Tong and Seng Han Thong to spread lies about Mr Tang Liang Hong and to assassinate his character. 
3 I accept that these statements are defamatory of the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong. I admit that the allegations made by me are completely false and without basis. 
4 I do accept that the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong:
 
(1) had not either singly, or in conspiracy with the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean, and Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Chin Harn Tong and Seng Han Thong, spread lies about Mr Tang Liang Hong and to assassinate his character; 
(2) had not concocted lies about Mr Tang Liang Hong and spread them, and that Mr Goh Chok Tong`s statements about Mr Tang Liang Hong to the effect that Mr Tang Liang Hong is `
 a Chinese chauvinist who held radical views on the promotion of the Chinese language and culture and that these views would undermine Singapore 
` are true and founded on unchallengeable evidence; 
(3) had not committed any criminal offence, in respect of which Mr Tang Liang Hong had any grounds for filing a police report.
 
5 I do hereby apologise unreservedly to the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, for the distress caused to him by the said false and baseless statements, and hereby withdraw the same. 
6 I have undertaken to the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, not to make allegations and/or any further statements to the same or similar effect. I also wish to state that I have agreed to compensate the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, for the damages and to indemnify him for the costs incurred todate.
 169.The defendant, by a letter dated 29 January 1997 and by way of response to the plaintiff`s letter, offered to apologise to the plaintiff as follows: 
1 On 1 January 1997 I spoke at a Workers` Party rally at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium. 
2 Towards the conclusion of my speech I said inter alia that `Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his team` . 
3 Mr Goh Chok Tong, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, BG Lee Hsien Loong, Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee Hean, Mr Ch`ng Jit Koon, Dr Ow Chin Hock, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lee Yock Suan, Mr Chin Harn Tong and Mr Ker Sin Tze have said through their lawyers that they understand these words to mean that I was alleging that each of them was guilty of the offences of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy against Mr Tang Liang Hong. 
4 I intended no such imputation. At the request of Mr Tang Liang Hong I informed the crowd that Mr Tang Liang Hong had made two police reports. I did not repeat or endorse the contents of the police reports of which I was wholly ignorant at the time. 
5 I apologise to Mr Goh Chok Tong, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, BG Lee Hsien Loong, Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee Hean, Mr Ch`ng Jit Koon, Dr Ow Chin Hock, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lee Yock Suan, Mr Chin Harn Tong and Mr Ker Sin Tze for any distress or embarrassment caused to them by my announcement.
 170.The plaintiff rejected the defendant`s counter-offer of apology. The defendant`s proposal fell short of the terms demanded by the plaintiff in several respects. In particular it did not contain: (a) an admission that the words suggested that the plaintiff was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy; (b) an undertaking not to repeat the allegations; and (c) an agreement to pay damages. I am required to examine whether the apology offered by the defendant should be taken into consideration in the assessment of damages.
 171.I start with the question whether failure to apologise is, per se, a ground for aggravating damages. In 
Fielding & Anor v Variety Inc
 
[1967] 2 All ER 497
, the defendants published a magazine containing the false statement that the plaintiff`s stage production had been a `flop` when it had in fact been a roaring success. The English Court of Appeal considered that the absence of a correction or apology should be taken into account in assessing damages.
 172.By contrast, in 
Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd & Anor
 
[1971] 2 All ER 1156
, a majority of the House of Lords considered that the lack of an apology would not, in normal circumstances, enhance the damages payable. Said Lord Reid (at p 1164): 
I think that there was misdirection as to the elements which the jury could consider in assessing damages. The sum awarded was, I think, surprisingly high and misdirection may well have brought that about. The learned judge directed the jury that they could take into account the fact that there had never been a word of apology from the defendants. In an ordinary case where the statement alleged to be defamatory clearly was made of or concerning the plaintiff an apology may well go to mitigating damages. Whether mere failure to make an apology can ever justify aggravation of damages may be doubted - I need not decide that here. 
 In the present case I do not see what room there was for an apology. The defendants` case throughout was that they never said anything at all about the plaintiff. The question for the jury was whether what they said should be regarded as applying to him or not. To have apologised - I do not know how - might have seemed to be going some way towards admitting that they had defamed the plaintiff
. I think that here there was a misdirection. [Emphasis supplied.]
 Lord Guest (at p 1178) expressed the opinion that: 
In my view, this direction of the judge does not represent the law. 
Failure to apologise is not evidence of malice (Broadway Approvals Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd
 
[1965] 2 All ER 523
). By parity of reasoning it cannot increase the damages. [Emphasis supplied.]
 Lord Donovan expressed concurrence with Lords Reid and Guest.
 173.Unfortunately, the decision in 
 Fielding 
 was not cited in 
 Morgan 
. I am, however, of the view that that the 
 Fielding 
 decision may be distinguished from the general principle laid down in 
 Morgan 
 on the ground that in 
 Fielding 
, the absence of an apology was not relied on by the Court of Appeal per se to increase the damages, but that it was part of the whole conduct of the defendants in that case. They knew that they had printed an erroneous statement but took no action to correct the false impression they had given their readership. Harman LJ thought (at p 501) that that was a case in which the defendants: 
knew what they were publishing was untrue, yet they did it maliciously, that is to say intending to hurt, and then when challenged with it, they produced no apology or even a disclaimer of any sort.
 174.I am prepared to apply the decision in 
 Morgan 
 not only because it is of more recent and higher authority but also because the circumstances in the present case are much less like those in 
 Fielding 
 than they are like those in
 Morgan 
. This was a case in which the defendant maintained from the very first day that he was of the view that the words were not defamatory. An apology along the lines demanded by the solicitors for the plaintiff would, as Lord Reid highlighted in 
 Morgan 
, have amounted to an admission of liability.
 175.What was demanded by the solicitors to the plaintiff was an acknowledgment by the defendant that the words uttered by the defendant suggested that the plaintiff and the others were guilty of criminal defamation and/or criminal conspiracy and an apology for having suggesting that. The solicitors also demanded that the defendant acknowledge that the plaintiff`s statements to the effect that Mr Tang `
 is a Chinese chauvinist who held radical views on the promotion of the Chinese language and culture and that these views would undermine Singapore 
` were true and founded on unchallengeable evidence. Such an apology and acknowledgment would, if made, result in the defendant admitting that by the words he uttered he was suggesting to the audience that the plaintiff and the others were guilty of committing criminal offences. It would also mean that the defendant was resiling from the view he had held (and it would appear still holds) that Mr Tang was neither an anti-Christian nor a Chinese chauvinist; and, more than that, was now endorsing and accepting as true the plaintiff`s denunciation of Mr Tang. It is not difficult to understand the defendant`s refusal to give such an acknowledgment. Clearly, the solicitors to the plaintiff had pitched their demand too high.
 176.Mr Shields submits that the defendant, by not giving the apology demanded, has conducted himself badly and so the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated damages. I am not prepared to consider the absence of an apology, in the terms demanded by the solicitors for the plaintiff, as part of that bad conduct. This was not a case, as I have already found, in which the defendant acted in malice. I have also found that the words uttered by the defendant did not have the extreme meaning canvassed by the plaintiff. Failure to apologise for such a meaning cannot be held against the defendant. If at all, the defendant`s conduct may only be impugned in his conduct of the trial, which is a matter to which I will come later. I therefore find that the absence of apology does not aggravate the damages payable by the defendant.
 177.I now turn to the question whether the offer of apology made by the defendant may reduce the damages payable by the defendant. Counsel for the plaintiff contended that the apology offered was not in acceptable terms, principally because it made no admission of liability. Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 that: 
A successful plaintiff may properly look to an award of damages to vindicate his reputation: but the significance of this is much greater in a case where the defendant asserts the truth of the libel and refuses any retraction or apology than in a case where the defendant acknowledges the falsity of what was published and publicly expresses regret that the libelous publication took place. It is well established that compensatory damages may and should compensate for additional injury caused to the plaintiff`s feelings by the defendant`s conduct of the action, as when he persists in an unfounded assertion that the publication was true, or refuses to apologise, or cross-examines the plaintiff in a wounding or insulting way.
 178.On this point the English Court of Appeal followed 
 Broome v Cassell 
 in which Lord Hailsham LC stated that damages: 
can be reduced if the defendant has behaved well - as for instance by a handsome apology - or the plaintiff badly, as for instance by provoking the defendant, or defaming him in return.
 179.It is clear that the established principle is that if one refuses to apologise and pleads the defence of justification vigorously, one runs the risk that in the event that defence fails, the damages awarded will be higher. The rationale is that one continues to damage the plaintiff`s reputation by the continued and persistent assertion that there is truth in the libel. This principle, however, does not apply in the present case as the defendant has not pleaded justification. He has merely denied that the words are defamatory.
 180.It is not difficult to see, however, that the defendant was to some degree justified in insisting on a variation of the terms of the apology demanded because the innuendo meaning of the slander, as I have found it to be, fell considerably short of what solicitors for the plaintiff considered it to be. Had the defendant agreed to sign the apology, he would have to pay damages on the meaning put on the words by the plaintiff. By coming to trial, the defendant has had his damages assessed based on the lesser meaning.
 181.The defendant`s proffered apology did contain an apology for any harm caused to the plaintiff. Although the words were not retracted, the defendant stated that he did not intend to impute the defamatory meaning alleged (which assertion I have found true on the facts). The proffered apology also draws attention to the fact that the defendant did not endorse the contents of Mr Tang`s police reports. I therefore think that the proffered apology, whilst not to the satisfaction of the plaintiff, was a sufficiently placatory gesture for it to be taken into account in assessing the damages payable to the plaintiff.
 182.
 Volenti non fit injuria and the rule against double recovery
Mr Carman raised an innovative argument in his closing submissions, namely, that because the text of the police reports was released to the press by the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, with the concurrence of the plaintiff, the Senior Minister and the plaintiff are principally responsible for the damage suffered. The damage was caused, said Mr Carman, by the plaintiff`s own act and thus he is not allowed to recover damages for it.
 183.I will consider this together with the second argument raised by Mr Carman, namely, that the plaintiff has already had his reputation vindicated in full by the damages awarded to him in his suit against Mr Tang and therefore there is no damage attributable to the defendant`s words which he has not already been compensated for.
 184.The short answer to these arguments is that damages to be assessed in this case arise out of the publication and republication of the words spoken by the defendant. The publication which the defendant is liable for are the words spoken to the audience at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 1 January 1997, ie `And finally, Mr Tang has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people.` The re-publication for which the defendant is liable is the repetition of those words by the 
 Straits Times 
 and the 
 Business Times 
 the next morning.
 185.This suit does not concern the publication of the contents of the police reports. The defendant is not liable for the text of the police reports made by Mr Tang as they were not adopted by him. He did not read out the report or release it to the press. The defendant is not liable for the republication of the text of the reports by the newspapers. As such, the point raised by Mr Carman concerning the Latin maxim 
 volenti non fit injuria 
 has no application in the present case although the position could well be different had that issue been raised in Mr Tang`s case.
 186.Insofar as the argument relating to double recovery is concerned, the same principle applies. The damages awarded in the suit against Mr Tang concern the words spoken by Mr Tang. The present case concerns the words spoken by the defendant. The fact that the plaintiff has recovered damages for words spoken by Mr Tang is not relevant in the present case as those words are not the subject-matter of the present suit.
 187.
 Republication
Before turning to the question of aggravated damages I return briefly to consider the extent of the defendant`s liability for the republication of the slander in the newspapers the following day. The 
 Straits Times 
 and 
 Business Times 
 are as much if not more culpable than the defendant. The original publication was limited to the audience at the Yio Chu Kang stadium. By and large the greater damage done was through the circulation of newspapers containing the defamatory remarks as these not only reached a vastly greater number of persons (on plaintiff`s counsel`s submissions, several hundred thousand) but also put the slander into permanent form. However, as I have stated, it is not open for me to apportion liability between the defendant and his joint tortfeasors as they are not party to this action and the proper course is for the defendant to seek contribution.
 
 Aggravated damages
(i) Conduct before trial
 188.The plaintiff seeks $150,000 general and $50,000 aggravated damages. I now turn to deal specifically with the claim for aggravated damages. The statement of claim contains numerous bases on which the claim for aggravated damages is premised. Some of these are in fact repetitions. Broadly, I think the factors urged upon the court (excluding the way the case was conducted, which I will deal with separately) were as follows: (a). the nature and gravity of the defamatory remarks;
 (b). the plaintiff`s position and standing;
 (c). the fact and extent of the republication in the Straits Times and elsewhere;
 (d). the defendant`s intention in speaking the words;
 (e). that the defendant adopted Mr Tang`s earlier remarks;
 (f). that the defendant knew the allegations made against Mr Tang were not without basis;
 (g). the publication of the contents of the police reports by the newspapers; and
 (h). the absence of an apology.
 189.I think that the claim under the head of aggravated damages cannot merit an award of $50,000 for the following reasons:
 With regards to (a), (b) and (c), namely, the gravity of the libel, the standing of the plaintiff and the extent of republication, I think these considerations are more properly classified as factors affecting compensatory damages; (d). Although the defendant admitted there was electoral advantage in his making the statement, his intent was not to defame the Prime Minister but to make the point that WP candidates would do what they promised;
 (e). I have found that the defendant did not adopt Mr Tang`s words;
 (f). Concerning the contention that the defendant knew the allegations against Mr Tang were not without basis, I do not think this is an aggravating factor. The Prime Minister considered Mr Tang to be an anti-Christian and a Chinese chauvinist. The defendant did not agree. He had a different view about Mr Tang. He therefore, inter alia, spoke the defamatory words stating that the matter had been put before the police;
 (g). I do not think that the defendant can be made to pay increased damages for the release of the reports to the newspapers because, as I have said, those were Mr Tang`s words which the defendant did not adopt. Further, the release to the press was procured not by the defendant (or even Mr Tang) but by the Senior Minister after discussion with the plaintiff. The defendant cannot be made liable for what the Senior Minister did; and
 (h). I have already found that the absence of an apology does not enhance damages.
 Insofar as the defendant was reckless as to whether the words would be republished, I am prepared to take this into consideration.
 (ii) Conduct at trial
 190.Mr Shields also contended that the defendant`s conduct of the case, in particular, the conduct of his counsel, should be taken into consideration in assessing aggravated damages. He drew my attention to the following passage in 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (at p 593) which states that the court may consider in assessing damages: 
the whole conduct of the defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the very moment of [the jury`s] verdict. They may take into consideration the conduct of the defendant before action, after action and in court at the trial of the action, and also, it is submitted, the conduct of his counsel, who cannot shelter his client by taking responsibility for the conduct of the case.
 191.Mr Shields submitted that the defendant, together with Mr Carman, had `embarked upon a wide ranging attack on the credit and credibility of the Prime Minister` and `repeated the refrain, in effect of the courts being used as some form of instrument of oppression`. Mr Shields highlighted what he submitted was the extensive cross-examination of the plaintiff on issues that bore little or no relevance to the present case, including allegations that the plaintiff, inter alia: (a). was using `the heavy artillery of multiple actions at the same time to obtain massive damages` to bankrupt the defendant and to oust him from Parliament;
 (b). together with the Senior Minister paid mere `lip-service to having the full rights of democracy` but that `there comes a point when you adapt them for your own purposes in Singapore to stay in power and to stifle opposition` ;
 (c). was abusing his powers in that that this court has `been turned to on occasion not for normal, legitimate healthy claims but in order to use the court as a possible political weapon against opponents such as Mr Jeyaretnam` ; and
 (d). was not being truthful on the stand.
 Mr Shields also pointed out that this case received extensive international media coverage and that Mr Carman`s allegations were republished in the 
 London Times 
and the 
 Herald Tribune 
.
 192.In 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  
[1989] SLR 1063
 , a similar issue arose in respect of a defamation action brought by the then Prime Minister concerning a defamatory article published by the 
 Far Eastern Economic Review 
. Said LP Thean J: 
The other aggravating factor is the conduct of the defendants through their counsel in repeatedly attempting in the cross-examination to put to the plaintiff matters which have no relevance to the issues; their counsel have persisted in that line of cross-examination on several occasions. The line of cross-examination, Mr Previte submitted, exacerbated the hurt to the plaintiff`s feelings and the damage to his reputation, particularly in this case which has received extensive publicity. Mr Previte listed out no less than 24 instances of the cross-examination in which questions were disallowed on the ground of irrelevancy. In addition, there were numerous instances where questions put to the plaintiff were calculated to be offensive and to increase the hurt to his feelings. In my judgment, such conduct is a relevant aggravating factor.
 193.Unlike that case, however, Mr Shields in the present raised few objections to the questions posed in cross-examination. Even when the court asked Mr Carman what the relevance of questions relating to the opposition being stifled by the Government`s policies was to the issues before the court, Mr Shields did not raise any objection on grounds of relevancy. Mr Shields in fact told the court: 
if my learned friend wants to put to the plaintiff that this is a politically motivated libel action, then I can`t stop him doing it.
 Mr Shields` only concern was that Mr Carman should refrain from asking questions which contained comments. Mr Carman`s response to the query by the court was that: 
the plaintiff claims aggravated damages, claims malice, claims substantial damages. If the true motive of bringing it has nothing to do with distress, hurt or injury to feelings, he`s suffered no loss And so one has to investigate his motive for the litigation, his motive for making these assertions.
 and touching on the concern relating to comments expressed by Mr Shields, he told the court that he would assist by asking his questions direct without comment. Mr Carman then proceeded with that line of questioning.
 194.I am of the view that Mr Carman was entitled to cross-examine the witness along those lines. The plaintiff`s motive was relevant to the issue of damages. Mr Carman was, no doubt, at times attempting to politicise this case. However, it must be remembered that this is a case born, bred and raised from the embers of the General Elections. To expect politics not to enter into the case would be naive. Just as Mr Shields contended the defendant was politically motivated to speak the words, Mr Carman was entitled to contend that the plaintiff was politically motivated to bring the action.
 195.I am conscious of the fact that, although objection was not taken, a fair number of Mr Carman`s questions, in particular those relating to the plaintiff`s views on democracy and government policy, were not directly relevant to the case. However, mere irrelevance of cross-examination is not a ground for aggravating damages. In every case, whether civil or criminal, cross-examination will occasionally exceed the strict boundaries of relevance, which sometimes cannot be distinctly drawn except in retrospect, when all the evidence has been adduced. As for the dicta of LP Thean J in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Davies 
, I think the true effect of that case is that questions which are irrelevant in the sense that they are intended to annoy or antagonise the witness and re-inforce the defamation may aggravate damages.
 196.In this respect, it is unfortunate that Mr Shields reserved the majority of his objections to the line of questioning for closing submissions. Had he protested more vigorously during cross-examination instead of taking the position that his client does not need protection, I would have been prepared to intervene. Unlike the 
 Davies 
 decision, Mr Shields limited his objections to but a few. Had there been a valid objection early in the proceedings and a direction given to Mr Carman to phrase his questions more carefully, and had Mr Carman defied that direction, a better case for aggravated damages would have been made out. But that did not happen.
 197.Nor do I think that Mr Carman`s charge that the plaintiff was, on occasions, not truthful a matter that can merit aggravated damages. Whether that charge is accepted or rejected by the court, what Mr Carman was doing was no more than what happens all the time in court proceedings. Matters on which counsel considers that the witness is exaggerating or is being `economical with the truth` are invariably highlighted by counsel. That is the whole object of cross-examination and any witness who comes to testify is on risk that his evidence will be so challenged. In this case, to take one example, the statement of claim and the plaintiff`s affidavit evidence-in-chief had both alleged that the words uttered by the defendant had resulted in the plaintiff`s reputation, moral authority and leadership having been gravely injured both locally and internationally. Given such a claim, it was entirely permissible for Mr Carman to ask the plaintiff to give instances of how and when this had happened and upon the plaintiff being unable to do so to suggest that the plaintiff had exaggerated the damage done to him.
 198.What in the end was really objected to was the force and style of Mr Carman`s cross-examination. I do not think that that is a valid ground for criticism. The cross-examination attracted attention because Mr Carman`s devices were applied to a prominent and important public figure. However, justice is blind and just as I do not think that this would have been serious aggravation in a case involving relatively unknown parties, the same principle must apply here.
 199.At the same time, I am prepared to take into consideration that in the end Mr Carman`s allegations were not made out. There was no proof. The allegations were spectacular but unsubstantiated. To some extent, Mr Carman was, on the defendant`s behalf, attempting to put government policy on the stand, with little or nothing to back up his accusations. I am not saying Mr Carman was not entitled to raise the issue. I am saying Mr Carman was not entitled to raise the issue if he had no sustainable grounds for doing so. This represented not only a waste of the court`s time but unnecessary examination of the witness on irrelevancies. There is nothing wrong with putting a good or arguable case strongly to a witness but to put a case with the driving force of a strong one and then fail to call any evidence to support that case is to indulge in pure rhetoric. Ordinarily such rhetoric may not do much harm but in this case the rhetoric was an attack on the integrity of the plaintiff as Prime Minister. It is clear, by the failure to call evidence to support the allegations, that the questions were directed not towards assisting the court in determining the issues before it but directed at the gallery and the press in order to denigrate the Prime Minister and the way he governs Singapore. For such conduct aggravated damages is payable. The enhanced damages arise out of the nexus between the harm done by the defamatory words originally spoken and the further harm done by the hurt caused to the plaintiff`s feelings as a result of the cross-examination on irrelevant matters.
 200.
 Conclusion
Taking into account the meaning as I have actually found it to be, in particular that the allegation fell considerably short of one suggesting there was reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff committed the alleged criminal offences, and taking into account the other matters discussed above, in particular the high standing and reputation of the plaintiff, I award the sum of $10,000 by way of general compensatory damages. On the question of aggravated damages, taking into account the fact that the defendant acted with reckless disregard to the consequences of his actions and taking into account the conduct of his defence at trial, I award the sum of $10,000 making a total of $20,000 payable to the plaintiff by the defendant by way of damages.
 201.I note that the other ten plaintiffs in related actions against the defendant have agreed to be bound by my findings on the meaning of the words. It remains for them to prove that the defendant`s words contained an obvious or readily inferable reference to them as plaintiffs in their respective suits. Damages for those plaintiffs who succeed in establishing reference to them may be assessed separately. As for the matter of aggravated damages in the other suits, it remains to be seen whether the defendant persists in conducting his defence in the same fashion as he did in this case.
 202.
 Costs
I think it is necessary to preface my award on costs with some words concerning the responsibility of a solicitor acting for a plaintiff. It is incumbent on the solicitor to make a careful and dispassionate review of all the evidence available and if, after advice, the client decides to commence proceedings, the solicitor should ensure that the facts available can measure up to the claim he drafts and to the submissions he proposes to make to the court. I will highlight some instances from this case which will illustrate why I make these remarks.
 203.The statement of claim stated that the plaintiff had been `gravely injured in his character, credit and reputation; been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt; endured considerable distress and embarrassment; and suffered damage accordingly` . However, the plaintiff was unable to point to any single incident at trial to substantiate this pleading. I think it surprising that solicitors were prepared to draft the pleadings without first ascertaining from the plaintiff what incidents of scandal or contempt were suffered by him. The unequivocal force of the pleading put the plaintiff in a tight spot when he took the stand, a situation which could have altogether been avoided by more careful drafting. Had the statement of claim simply alleged that the defendant`s words tended to lower the reputation of the plaintiff, that would have been accurate and more than sufficient. As Mr Shields has pointed out, there was no need to plead or prove special damage because of s 5 of the Defamation Act.
 204.In the statement of claim, it was alleged that the words were `calculated to work up the emotions of the highly-charged audience` at the rally. The plaintiff`s case was that the defendant orchestrated the attack on the plaintiff; that he knew the contents of the police report and that he stage-managed the timing of the announcement to achieve maximum damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. Having viewed the video-tape, I do not think this a reasonable assertion by any standard. Watching the tape, it is patently obvious that Mr Tang had to draw the attention of the defendant to the reports on two occasions before the defendant could be drawn away from the mainstay of his speech to announce that he had just been handed the reports. The announcement of the reports amounted to no more than a brief aside. The audience, no doubt, was biased against the plaintiff. Had the defendant wanted to play up the police reports, he would have read them out, or summarised their contents. His closing point would have been `Do you want to vote such a man into Parliament?` instead of `Vote for yourselves`. The defendant had the political experience and oratorical skill to achieve that effect if he wanted to. In the end, his actions fell far short of the degree of malice alleged by the plaintiff`s solicitors.
 205.The statement of claim erroneously pleads in two places that the defendant held up the police reports when he spoke to the audience. It was quite clearly wrong to say that the defendant held the reports up to the audience when he spoke. The defendant waved the same envelope throughout the speech but never showed the reports (or what were ostensibly the reports) to the audience. This is obvious from the tape and the error could not have occurred if the tape had been viewed before the statement of claim was drafted. The error is as significant as it is glaring because it goes to the demeanour of the defendant in making the statement and could affect both liability and quantum.
 206.The statement of claim alleges that: 
the defendant knew and/or ought to have known that once the fact of the police report was made public, the press would procure copies of the same and that the contents of the said report would thereafter, be widely publicised in the press and other media `
 
 
the contents of the said police report were published in, inter alia, the 2 January 1997 edition of the New Paper; an article in the 3 January 1997 edition of the 
 Straits Times
 entitled `What Tang Said in Police Reports`.
 Neither of these pleadings disclosed the fact that the reports were in fact released by the Senior Minister with the consent of the plaintiff although this fact must have been known when the statement of claim was filed. The fact that the reports were made available to the press, not by the defendant (or by Mr Tang) but by the Senior Minister, was a highly material fact and ought to have been disclosed in the statement of claim. No effort was subsequently made to correct the statement of claim. The revelation of the facts prompted the defendant to file a last-minute application to amend the defence. Mr Carman submitted that this failure to disclose had unfortunately led the judge assessing damages in the suits brought by the plaintiff and the others against Mr Tang to award damages on the basis that it was the defendant, as the Secretary-General of the Workers` Party, who had released the reports to the press. I make no comment on that submission. I refer to it only to emphasize the point that difficulties can arise if solicitors drafting pleadings leave matters that are important to the issues before the court, unstated.
 207.I can fully understand the temptation of counsel to prosecute a claim vigorously and with enthusiasm. I can also understand the sensitivities in dealing with such important clients as the plaintiff. But it is important, the more so in a high profile case involving political leaders, that the legal advisors make a cool and rational appraisal of the events in hand. The plaintiff has told the court that his legal advisors told him that he had a very strong case and it was because of that advice that he instituted these proceedings. The plaintiff had a strong case, yes, but it was for a degree of defamation much lower than what he claimed it to be. The plaintiff`s case had, in short, been over-stated.
 208.The normal rule on costs is that costs will be awarded to the successful party. In this case, although the plaintiff has been successful in the sense that an award for damages in his favour has been made, the plaintiff did not succeed in his claim as pleaded in his statement of claim. Bearing in mind the significant disparity between the meaning of the words as claimed by the plaintiff and the meaning of the words as I have found them to be, the question arises whether the plaintiff should be awarded the full costs.
 209.I am conscious that it is not appropriate to deprive the plaintiff of costs simply because he did not succeed on all the issues. In 
Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2)
 
[1993] 1 All ER 232
, the trial judge ordered the respondents to pay only one quarter of the costs of a successful petitioner under the English equivalent of our s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50). The English Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in doing so and varied the costs order such that the petitioners could recover half their costs from the respondents. The following passage from the headnote provides a convenient summary of the principles applied by the Court of Appeal: 
a successful party who neither improperly nor unreasonably raised issues or made allegations which failed ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the unsuccessful party`s costs, and because the judge had disregarded that principle his order could not stand. In the circumstances the costs ought to follow the event to the extent that the award of costs to the petitioners should be diminished by the amount of time and expense taken up by the allegations that failed.
 I agree. Because the plaintiff has succeeded in this suit he is entitled to costs. However, I am mindful that a great deal of time was spent trying to prove pleadings that were at the end of the day not established: the high pleaded meaning of the words, the allegation of malice on the part of the defendant and the allegations concerning his intention and purpose in making the statement, the allegation of conspiracy between the defendant and Mr Tang, the allegation that the defendant had adopted Mr Tang`s words and the inaccuracies between the pleadings and the video-tape are examples. These should affect the extent of his entitlement to costs. Naturally, the counterbalancing factor is the extent to which Mr Carman`s cross-examination of the defendant dwelt on irrelevant matters.
 210.I also refer to the fact that my power to award costs under s 18(2) read with para 13 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) must be exercised in accordance with the Rules of Court. This includes O 59 r 7 which provides that in making my order on costs I may have regard to the unreasonable omission of a party to do any thing, the doing of which would have been calculated to save costs or the unreasonable doing of any thing calculated to occasion, or in a manner or at a time calculated to occasion unnecessary costs.
 211.This action as well as the twn other actions brought against the defendant all arose from the same words uttered by the defendant at the election rally. Except for the fact that different firms of solicitors acted for the different plaintiffs, there could be no clearer case than these 11 actions for which consolidation was appropriate. Although different firms of solicitors acted this was not a case where there was any conflict inter se between the plaintiffs. This is evident from the evidence of the plaintiff when he said that there was consultation and co-operation with the various solicitors before the proceedings were started.
 212.The fact that the plaintiffs in the other suits ultimately agreed to be bound by my findings on the meaning of the words also reinforces the view that this was a good case for consolidation. Consolidation would have resulted in a saving of costs. The only reason why consolidation did not take place was the vehemence of the objections raised by the solicitors to the plaintiff and by the solicitors to the other ten plaintiffs when the defendant applied for all the 11 suits to be consolidated. That objection prompted Mr Carman to submit in this court that the plaintiff was motivated by a desire to drive up the legal costs which he hoped to recoup from the defendant.
 213.The increase in costs occasioned by the fact that a consolidation order was not obtained was mitigated to a considerable degree by the plaintiffs in the other suits now agreeing to be bound by this court`s decision on liability in this suit. By so agreeing there has, in effect, been consolidation insofar as liability is concerned. This has resulted in savings in costs. The savings, however, would have been more if the parties had, at an early stage, agreed to consolidation.
 214.Bearing in mind that the factors in the 
 Elgindata 
 decision apply to a lesser extent in the present case, I do not think a 50/50 award would be fair. I therefore order that the defendant pay 60% of the plaintiff`s costs.",1997-09-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
Cur Adv Vult
(delivering the judgment of the court): The respondent was convicted in the High Court by Kan Ting Chiu J on the following charge and sentenced to eight years` imprisonment: 
That you, Andrew Gerardine
 
On 13 March 1997 between 8.30am and 9am at Block 804 King George`s Avenue #14-154, Singapore, together with one Mansoor s/o Abdullah, one Nazar bin Mohamed Kassim and one Kamala Rani d/o Balakrishnan and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Sivapackiam d/o Veerappan Rengasamy, female aged 53 years, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 304(a) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 The prosecution appealed against the trial judge`s decision. We heard their appeal on 3 August 1998 and reserved judgment.
 2.
 The facts
The undisputed facts were as follows. The deceased was one Sivapackiam d/o Veerappan Rengasamy, female, 53 years old. At the time of her death on 13 March 1997, she was living in Block 804 King George Avenue #14-154 (the flat). Andrew Gerardine @ Maria (Gerardine) had been renting a room in the deceased`s flat since February 1997. Shortly before the deceased`s death, she was on bad terms with Gerardine. She had for example scolded Gerardine, called her a prostitute and used vulgarities on her.
 3.The deceased was found dead in the flat. In his affidavit, Dr Gilbert Lau, a pathologist attached to the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine stated: 
5 I performed a post-mortem on the deceased`s body. I certified the cause of death to be due to severe haemorrhage, mainly arising from the severance of the right superior thyroid artery caused by a stab wound situated on the right anterolateral aspect of the deceased`s neck. I am of the opinion that the said severance of the right superior thyroid artery is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
 4.At about 2am to 3am on 13 March 1997, Gerardine, Mansoor s/o Abdullah (Mansoor), Nazar bin Mohamed Kassim (Nazar), and Kamala Rani d/o Balakrishnan (Rani) were at Albert Court. There Gerardine told the other three about her problems with the deceased. She asked them to help her teach the deceased a lesson and to beat her up. She also told them that the deceased kept a lot of jewellery and money in the flat. After they agreed to help her, Gerardine went back to the flat to collect her bag. She arrived at the flat at about 7am. After collecting her bag she went back to Tekar market, where the other three were waiting.
 5.While waiting for Gerardine to return, Nazar went to Farrer Park Stadium. He and Mansoor had been sleeping at Farrer Park Stadium for six months. He changed his clothes, took a ten centimetre long knife and returned to Tekar market to wait for Gerardine. After Gerardine met up with the other three at Tekar market at about 7.30am, the four of them proceeded to wait for a taxi. While waiting for the taxi, Nazar told Mansoor that he had a knife and made Mansoor touch the handle of the knife.
 6.The taxi took them to the vicinity of the flat, where they had breakfast. This was about 8am. After breakfast, they sat at a bench near a coffee shop to wait for the deceased`s son to leave for work. Gerardine spotted the deceased walking back to the flat carrying a newspaper with her. She pointed out the deceased to Nazar, Mansoor and Rani. Nazar and Mansoor then told Gerardine that they wanted to take a walk. At about 8.20am, Gerardine spotted the deceased`s son leaving for work. She was aware that he usually left for work at around that time. At about 8.30am, Nazar and Mansoor returned. After they returned, Gerardine told them to follow her to the flat. Nazar asked Gerardine what they were to say when they arrived at the flat. She told them to tell the deceased that they wanted to rent a room.
 7.The four of them proceeded to the lift-landing of the flat. Before entering the lift, Gerardine went to the nearby Prime Supermarket, bought a pair of gloves and gave one each to Mansoor and Nazar. While in the lift Gerardine asked Mansoor and Nazar what they would be using to beat the deceased. It was revealed that Mansoor would be using a chain that he was wearing. They took the lift to the 13th floor, and Mansoor and Nazar walked up the stairs to the 14th floor where the flat was, while Gerardine and Rani waited at the staircase of the 13th and 14th floor near the flat.
 8.When they arrived at the flat, Mansoor called the deceased and told her that they wanted to rent a room. She then invited them to enter her house to view the room. They entered the house, and walked around to see the bedroom. While the deceased was showing them around, Mansoor took out a silver-coloured chain which he wore around his left wrist. He hooked the chain around her neck and started to strangle her with the chain. They pulled her into the bedroom located near the kitchen. The deceased struggled and screamed. In the ensuing struggle, Nazar joined in and stabbed the deceased at the right side of her neck several times. After the deceased was stabbed, Mansoor walked out and asked Gerardine and Rani to go into the flat. Gerardine and Rani followed Mansoor into the flat. She and Mansoor then made a futile search for the deceased`s jewellery and money. All four of them eventually left the flat without having taken any of the deceased`s valuables. The four were subsequently arrested. After their arrest, statements were recorded. The statements were admitted in evidence without challenge.
 9.Rani pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was sentenced to seven years` imprisonment. Mansoor, Nazar, and Gerardine were tried in the High Court for murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Mansoor and Nazar were convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
 10.
 Decision of the trial judge
The trial judge found that, although Gerardine had instigated the other three to assault and rob the deceased, she had not asked her friends to kill or to cause her serious injuries, and was not aware that Nazar had armed himself with a knife, neither did she assist or participate in or witness the stabbing. The trial judge therefore convicted her on the reduced charge of culpable homicide under s 304(a) read with s 34 of the Penal Code and sentenced her to eight years` imprisonment.
 11.
 The appeal
The prosecution appealed against the decision of the trial judge and asked that Gerardine`s conviction under s 304(a) read with s 34 of the Penal Code be set aside and that she be convicted of the original charge of murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.
 12.
 Evidence on knowledge of the knife
The prosecution submitted that the evidence showed that Gerardine knew that Nazar brought a knife along with him to the flat. At the court below, the trial judge had found that Gerardine was not aware that Nazar had armed himself with a knife.
 13.The evidence which supported the trial judge`s finding that Gerardine did not know of the knife was as follows. First, in her statement to DSSgt Lim Song Chai (DSSgt Lim) on 18 March 1997, Gerardine denied knowledge of Nazar`s knife. She said: 
I did not arm with any weapon. I also do not know whether `Mansoor`, `Nazar` and `Rani` was having any weapon. When we were taking the lift up to the flat. I asked `Mansoor` and `Nazar` what they intend to use to beat up `Auntie`. `Mansoor` took out a iron string around his neck and he told me that he will use the string to beat up Auntie. `Nazar` did not say anything. He only asked me what to say when they reach the house. I told him to pretend to rent a room from `Auntie.`
 At the trial, Gerardine maintained her stand that she did not know of Nazar`s knife. Secondly, there was Nazar`s testimony in court that, while the four of them were at Albert Court, there was no discussion of what weapons were to be used to beat up the deceased and that he did not tell Gerardine about the knife. However, in his statement to DSSgt Lim on 19 May 1997 Nazar had given evidence contradictory to what he said in court. He said: 
19 About five minutes later, I returned to the coffee shop. I went to Maria and asked her how. She told me that her house owner`s son had not leave the house. I then suggested to Maria to sit together at the shelter nearby but she refused. Maria asked me what I was using to hit her house owner. I told her that I was having a knife. Kamala Rani also heard that I was having a knife. I left her table and told Mansoor s/o Abdullah to sit at the shelter.
 Further on in the same statement, Nazar said that he showed Maria the knife while they were inside the lift: 
23 She asked Mansoor s/o Abdullah what he was using to hit her house owner. Mansoor s/o Abdullah showed us a silver-coloured chain around his left arm and said that he was using the chain to hit the house owner. Maria asked me the same question and I told them that I was using the knife and I took out the knife from my left booth and showed it to them. I placed the knife in my pant right front pocket and placed the glove in my left pocket.
 Nazar subsequently retracted these statements in court. When cross-examined by the prosecution as to why he gave the wrong statement to DSSgt Lim he said that there was no reason for giving the wrong statement. When cross-examined by the prosecution as to why he should have refrained from telling the others about the knife, he said that he did not know why he did not show them. In the light of his failure to give any reason for his retractions, we do not think that much weight can be attached to Nazar`s testimony in court regarding Gerardine`s knowledge of the knife.
 14.With regards to the evidence which showed that Gerardine was aware of the knife, there was, first, Nazar`s statement to DSSgt Lim as mentioned above. Secondly, it was the evidence of Nazar, Mansoor and Gerardine that while they were inside the lift, Gerardine asked about the weapons to be used. Although it was revealed in the lift that Mansoor was going to use his chain, according to the evidence of the accused persons, there was no mention of what Nazar was going to use. In other words, according to them, after Gerardine had asked in the confined space of a lift what weapons were to be used, she was aware of what Mansoor was going to use, but not Nazar. We are of the view that it is inherently incredible that, in the discussion about the weapons to be used, Gerardine was only concerned about and aware of Mansoor`s chain but not Nazar`s knife.
 15.Thirdly, in her first statement to the police, which was to Woman Inspector Yeo Wee Poh (Inspector Yeo) on 13 March 1997, Gerardine told Inspector Yeo that she saw a tall Indian man take out `a knife, about ten centimetre long, from the right side pocket of his pants`. This was an amazingly accurate description. In his statement to DSSgt Lim on 19 May 1997 Nazar had said that the `blade of the knife is about ten centimetre long`. In para 23 of that statement, which is reproduced above, Nazar also said that, after showing them the knife in the lift, he placed the knife in his `pant right front pocket`. It was pointed out by counsel for the respondent that Gerardine could have been apprised of the existence of the knife and its usage when all four of them met up at Farrer Park Stadium after they left the flat. In our view, while it might have been possible that the four of them talked about the use of the knife to stab the deceased, and hence for Gerardine to know of the existence of a knife and of its use, it was highly unlikely that any such conversation would have given her such particular and accurate knowledge of the length of the knife and where it was kept prior to being used.
 16.This particular statement given by Gerardine to Inspector Yeo was disregarded by the trial judge. He was mindful that Gerardine had given a statement to Inspector Yeo which was different from the one that she gave to DSSgt Lim, but he accepted her explanation that she was frightened when Inspector Yeo interviewed her. In our view, with the greatest respect to the trial judge, Gerardine`s explanation for her different statement to Inspector Yeo should not have been accepted. Even if Gerardine was frightened, it does not explain how she knew the exact length of the knife as described by Nazar and the exact place where Nazar kept his knife prior to using it.
 17.Taking all the evidence into consideration, the only evidence we found which could have supported a finding that Gerardine did not know about the knife was her own testimony. Weighed against that was Nazar`s statement to DSSgt Lim that he showed Gerardine the knife, the fact that in the lift Gerardine did ask about the weapons to be used and did know that Mansoor was going to use the chain, and her particular knowledge of the length of the knife as described by Nazar and the exact place where he kept it prior to using it. We are therefore of the opinion that the finding that Gerardine did not know about the knife was clearly against the weight of evidence. Indeed the compelling inference from the evidence was that Gerardine knew that Nazar brought a knife with him to the flat.
 18.
 Evidence on the common intention of the parties
The prosecution also submitted that the trial judge had erred in that, on the evidence adduced, the common intention shared by Gerardine, Mansoor, Nazar and Rani was more than a mere intention to assault and rob the deceased and was an intention to cause grievous hurt or serious injury to the deceased. Following from our finding that Gerardine did know of the knife and did nothing to stop Nazar from bringing it with him to meet the deceased, it is our judgment that their common intention was more than just to assault and rob the deceased. We find that their common intention was to cause grievous hurt or serious injury to the deceased.
 19.
 Requirement of participation in the criminal act under s 34
It was also submitted by the prosecution that there is no legal requirement that accused persons participate in the criminal act in order for them to be liable under s 34 of the Penal Code. This issue of law was relevant because the trial judge had found that Gerardine did not assist or participate in or witness the stabbing of the deceased. At the time when the stabbing occurred, Gerardine was not in the flat but at the staircase of the 13th and 14th floor near the flat. One of the authorities relied on by the prosecution was the recent judgment of this court in 
Asogan Ramesh s/o Ramachandran v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 286
 . In 
 Asogan 
 the court quoted from Wee Chong Jin CJ in 
Wong Mimi v PP
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
 , who in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 79: 
There is no doubt that for this section to apply there must be in existence a common intention between all the persons who committed the criminal act, and that a criminal act be done in furtherance of that common intention. When these two requirements are proved, each of such persons would be liable for the entire criminal act in the same manner as if he had done it alone.
 In this judgment, Wee Chong Jin CJ mentioned two requirements for liability under s 34 of the Penal Code, the existence of a common intention between all the persons who committed the criminal act, and the furtherance of the common intention by the criminal act.
 20.We do not think that this dictum of Wee Chong Jin CJ serves as a proposition that there is no requirement of participation in the criminal act under s 34 of the Penal Code. This dictum must be seen in the context of the case. As was observed by LP Thean J (as he then was) in 
PP v Tan Joo Cheng
 
[1990] SLR 743
 , in 
 Wong Mimi v PP 
 there was no doubt that the accused persons participated in the act constituting the offence. In that case Mimi Wong and her husband Sim Who Kum were charged with murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. The court found that Sim was a party to the stabbing. He brought detergent to the house of the deceased, asked Mimi Wong to lure the deceased into the bathroom, mixed the detergent with water and threw the mixture into the deceased`s eyes as Mimi Wong got ready to stab the deceased. Sim Who Kum`s participation in that case was never in question.
 21.Furthermore, in the earlier decision in 
Lim Heng Soon v PP
 
 
[1970] 1 MLJ 166
  [1969-1971] SLR 89 , Wee Chong Jin CJ himself, in delivering the judgment of the court, had approved the trial judge`s direction to the jury which stated that there were three requirements in section 34, one of which was the requirement of participation in the criminal act by those sharing the common intention. The trial judge`s direction was as follows: 
Now, along with this charge of murder the charge says it should be read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Now then, Gentlemen, that section says: `When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone.` Now there are three requirements under this section. First, there must be a common intention among a group of people, that is the first requirement; second, there must be participation in the criminal act by those sharing the common intention; thirdly, the criminal act must be in furtherance of the common intention. Now if these three requirements are there, then every person who participates in the commission of that criminal act would be liable as if he committed the act all by himself, irrespective of the fact that he might have played only a very small part in the commission of the act.
 Wee Chong Jin CJ observed that the trial judge`s direction was in accordance with the law laid down by 
 Mahboob Shah v R 
 AIR 1945 PC 118.
 21.Another case which made it clear that participation in the criminal act is one of the requirements for liability under s 34 of the Penal Code is that of 
Chew Cheng Lye v R
 
[1956] MLJ 240
 . The accused in that case was charged with theft of a bicycle under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Whitton J said at p 241: 
I would say it must be established that more than one person participated in the commission of the criminal act which forms the subject of the charge, although in certain circumstances mere presence may constitute participation.
 Whitton J noted that there would have been no difficulty establishing liability under s 34 had it been shown that the accused had kept watch or otherwise assisted in the removal of the bicycle.
 22.There is also the High Court case of 
PP v Tan Joo Cheng
 
[1990] SLR 743
 , where Tan Joo Cheng and Kang Hai were charged with murder. The two together with two other persons had agreed to commit robbery on Lee. LP Thean J (as he then was), in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 754: 
It is in evidence that he [Kang Hai] knew that Joo Cheng was at the material time armed with a knife. He himself brought along a rope. On the evidence, it is our inference that Joo Cheng and he would confront and hold up Lee: Joo Cheng with the knife and he with the rope. It is also our inference that the knife is intended to be used by Joo Cheng to intimidate Lee, and if Lee resists, to counter and overcome the resistance. But the fact remains that at the time when Lee was held up and confronted, Kang Hai was not present; nor was he there at the time when the struggle took place when Lee was injured by Joo Cheng. There was no participation by him in any form - active or passive - in the holding up of Lee, the struggle with Lee and the stabbing of Lee. A person sought to be made liable by s 34 must in some manner participate - whether actively or passively - in the act constituting the offence.
 The court accordingly held that Kang Hai was not guilty of murder under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and convicted him on the lesser charge of attempted armed robbery.
 23.In addition to this line of authorities, there is also I 
brahim bin Masod v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 873
 , which was relied on by the prosecution. Although the court in 
 Ibrahim bin Masod 
 distinguished 
 Tan Joo Cheng 
, it did not disagree with the view held in 
 Tan Joo Cheng 
 that there must be participation in the commission of the offence. In delivering the judgment of the court, Karthigesu JA said at p 882: 
reliance was placed on the High Court case of
 PP v Tan Joo Cheng
where it was said that `A person sought to be made liable by s 34 must in some manner participate - whether actively or passively in the act constituting the offence.` Each case must depend on its own particular facts. In 
 Tan Joo Cheng
`s case the learned judges of the High Court found on the evidence that the accused did not actively or passively participate in the commission of the offence. That is not the case here. There is ample evidence as found by the learned judge, with which we agree, that Ibrahim had passively if not actively participated in the killing of Phang, notwithstanding his absence when the actual act of strangling Phang was committed by Liow.
 The court in 
 Ibrahim bin Masod 
 did not hold that participation was not a requirement for liability under s 34 of the Penal Code. It instead distinguished 
 Tan Joo Cheng 
 by holding that there was participation in the commission of the offence despite the fact that the accused was absent at the time when the victim was strangled. In 
 Tan Joo Cheng 
, the court had held that there was no participation as the accused was not present at the material time, and he did not participate in either the holding up, the struggle with the victim or the stabbing of the victim. It is apparent that both cases are in agreement that there must be participation in the act constituting the offence in order for there to be liability under section 34. What they did diverge on, was whether there could be participation in the commission of the offence when an accused was absent at the time when the act constituting the offence was committed.
 24.
 Physical presence when the criminal act is committed
The issue of law before us therefore was not whether participation in the criminal act is a necessary element of s 34 liability. The long line of authorities on this makes it clear that in order for an accused to be liable under s 34, he must have participated either actively or passively in the criminal act. Instead the issue was this. What constitutes participation in the criminal act for the purposes of s 34? Can there be participation in the criminal act notwithstanding the fact that an accused was not physically present when the act constituting the offence was committed? Or to put it in the context of our present facts, can a person be liable for murder under s 302 read with s 34 notwithstanding the fact that the person was not in the room when the stabbing took place?
 25.In 
 Tan Joo Cheng 
 the court`s view was that participation under s 34 required an accused to be physically present when the act constituting the offence was committed. There the accused was not present when the victim was held up and stabbed. The court held that he did not participate in the act constituting the offence and was therefore not guilty of murder.
 26.The contrary position was adopted in 
 Ibrahim bin Masod 
. In that case, Ibrahim had together with Liow kidnapped Phang. They took Phang to Liow`s flat. Phang was strangled to death during the period when he was held by the two in Liow`s flat. Ibrahim was charged with murder under s 302 read with s 34. Ibrahim`s defence was that at the time when Phang was strangled, he was in Geylang selling off Phang`s watch. The court held that there was ample evidence that Ibrahim had passively if not actively participated in the killing of Phang and that Ibrahim was guilty of murder, notwithstanding his absence when the actual act of strangling Phang was committed by Liow. In other words, the court took the position that there could be sufficient participation for the purposes of s 34 notwithstanding the fact that an accused was not physically present when the act constituting the offence took place. In coming to its decision, the court in 
 Ibrahim bin Masod 
 relied on 
Nazir v R
 
[1948] 49 Cr LJ 271
, a case of the Allahabad High Court. There Raghubar Dayal J held that, where the two essentials of the existence of a common intention and a criminal act done in furtherance of that common intention were satisfied, each person would be liable for the entire criminal act irrespective of the fact whether he was present at the time or not. The court therefore held that the mere fact that B was not present throughout the beating of M and A did not absolve B from the liability of the consequences of the beating as the actual type of beating was in furtherance of the common intention of all.
 27.The decisions of the Supreme Court of India on this point of law are divided. In 
 Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v State of Bombay 
 AIR 1955 SC 287 the three appellants were convicted of criminal breach of trust by a public servant under s 409 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code. One of the appellants was a public servant who was in charge of a government depot. His companions had permitted government stores to pass out of the depot and allowed another person to convert those stores to his own use. The evidence was that this particular appellant had abetted the removal by planning it with his companions. However, he was not present when the goods were loaded nor was he present when they were allowed to pass out of the gates, that is to say, he was not present when act constituting the offence was committed. In delivering the judgment of the court, Bose J said at p 293-294: 
23 The essence of the misdirection consists in his direction to the jury that even though a person `may not be present when the offence is actually committed` and even if he remains `behind the screen` he can be convicted under s 34 provided it is proved that the offence was committed in furtherance of the common intention. This is wrong, for it is the essence of the section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time the crime is actually committed. The antithesis is between the preliminary stages, the agreement, the preparation, the planning, which is covered by s 109, and the stage of commission when the plans are put into effect and carried out. Section 34 is concerned with the latter. It is true that there must be some sort of preliminary planning which may or may not be at the scene of the crime and which may have taken place long beforehand, but there must be added to it the element of physical presence at the scene of the occurrence coupled with actual participation which, of course, can be of a passive character such as standing by a door, provided that it is done with the intention of assisting in furtherance of the common intention of them all and there is readiness to play his part in the pre-arranged plan when the time comes for him to act. 
24 The emphasis in s 34 is on the word `done`: `When a criminal act is ""done"" by several persons ` It is essential that they join in the actual `doing` of the act and not merely in planning its perpetration.
 28.In 
 Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Desai v State of Bomba 
y AIR 1960 SC 889, 
 Shreekantiah 
 was distinguished on its facts. In that case, the two appellants were directors of a company who had been convicted under s 409 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code for committing criminal breach of trust regarding cloth supplied to them. It was alleged by one of the appellants that he was not at the factory during the period when the goods must have been removed. Shah J in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 892: 
7 But the essence of liability under s 34 is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the offenders leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the common intention and presence of the offender sought to be rendered liable under s 34 is not, on the words of the statute, one of the conditions of its applicability. As explained by Lord Sumner in 
 Barenda Kumar Ghose v Emperor 
 AIR 1925 PC 1 at p 7, the leading feature of s 34 of the Indian Penal Code is `participation in action`. To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons; the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in the planning. A common intention - a meeting of minds - to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s 34. But this participation need not be in all cases by physical presence. In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts, which may be done at different times and places The observations in 
 Shreekantiah 
`s case AIR 1955 SC 287 in so far as they deal with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code, must, in our judgment be read in the light of the facts established and are not intended to lay down a principle of universal application.
 29.In 
 Shiv Prasad v State of Maharashtra 
 AIR 1965 SC 264, however, the court chose to follow the position taken in 
 Shreekantiah 
 instead of 
 Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Desai 
. In that case, the three accused were convicted under s 467 and s 471 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code for forgery. The first accused had forged a railway receipt to divert a supply of iron angles. The second and third accused were not at the railway stations when the forgery was committed. Raghubar Dayal J in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 268: 
15 Accused No 1, in the present case, alone did the various acts on 18 February 1959 which constituted the offences of which he was convicted. Accused persons Nos 2 and 3 took no part in the actual commission of those acts. Whatever they might have done prior to the doing of those acts, did not form an ingredient of the offences committed by accused No 1. They cannot be said to have participated in the commission of the criminal act which amounted to those various offences. They cannot be therefore held liable, by virtue of s 34 IPC for the acts committed by the accused No 1 alone, even if those acts had been committed in furtherance of all the three accused.
 30.In 
 Tukaram Ganapath v State of Maharashtra 
 AIR 1974 SC 514, a position different from 
 Shiv Prasad 
 was taken. That case concerned a house-breaking of a godown by five persons. The appellant was not present at the godown when the goods were loaded onto a vehicle from the godown. He had however supplied the duplicate key to the godown and waited for the vehicle at the weighbridge. In delivering the judgment of the court, Krishna Iyer J said at p 516: 
10 Mere distance from the scene of the crime cannot exclude culpability under s 34 which lays down the rule of joint responsibility for a criminal act performed by a plurality of several persons. In 
 Barenda Kumar Ghosh v Emperor 
 AIR 1925 PC 1 the judicial committee drew into the criminal net those `who only stand and wait`. This does not mean that some form of presence, near or remote, is not necessary or that mere presence without more at the spot of crime spells culpability. Criminal sharing, overt or covert by active presence or by distant direction, making out a certain measure of jointness in the commission of the act is the essence of s 34. Even assuming that presence at the scene is a pre-requisite to attract s 34 and that such propinquity is absent, s 107 which is different in one sense, still comes into play to rope in the accused. The act here is not the picking the godown lock but housebreaking and criminal house trespass. This crime is participated in by those operating by remote control as by those doing physical removal. Together operating in concert, the criminal project is executed.
 31.In 
 Ramaswami v State of Tamil Nadu 
 AIR 1976 SC 2027, the court departed from the position in 
 Tukaram Ganapath 
 and emphasised the requirement of physical presence at the actual commission of the crime in offences involving physical violence. In delivering the judgment of the court Untwalia J said at p 2031: 
12 Section 34 is to be read along with the preceding s 33 which makes it clear that the `act` spoken of in s 34 includes a series of acts as a single act. It follows that the words `when a criminal act is done by several persons` in s 34, may be construed to mean `when criminal acts are done by several persons`. The acts committed by different confederates in the criminal action may be different but all must in one way or the other participate and engage in the criminal enterprise, for instance, one may only stand guard to prevent any person coming to the relief of the victim or otherwise to facilitate the execution of the common design. Such a person also commits an `act` as much as his co-participants actually committing the planned crime. In an offence involving physical violence however, it is essential for the application of s 34 that the person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime for the purpose of facilitating or promoting the offence, the commission of which is the aim of the joint criminal venture. Such presence of those who in one way or the other facilitate the execution of the common design, is itself tantamount to actual participation in the `criminal act` In the case before us, A-2 obviously, was acting in concert with A-3 and A-4 in causing the murder of the deceased when he prevented PW1 from going to the relief of the deceased. Section 34 was therefore fully attracted and under the circumstances A-2 was equally responsible for the murder of the deceased.
 32.This shifting in position of the Indian courts seems to us an indicator of the difficulty in balancing the proper use of the doctrine of common intention as found in s 34. The section was crafted in a way which would meet situations where it would be difficult to identify the exact acts of individual members of a party who acted in furtherance of their common intention. It allows for the imposition of the liability of a person who actually perpetrated the crime on to the participants of that crime. This extension of liability from the perpetrator to the participant is premised on the responsibility of participants for associating with such a crime, and the consequences that could follow. However, such liability would also mean that a participant could be liable for an offence even though he did not commit the actus reus or have the mens rea for that particular offence. In an offence which carries a mandatory death sentence such as murder, it would mean that a participant could be given the death penalty despite not meeting any of the required ingredients of s 299 and s 300 of the Penal Code. It seems to us that it is the difficulty in balancing these considerations that has resulted in the long line of contradictory authorities. On the one hand are cases such as
 Shreekantia 
 h 
, 
 Shiv Prasad 
 and 
 Ramaswami 
 which have taken the position that the accused person must be physically present at the actual commission of the offence. On the other hand are cases such as
 Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Des 
ai and 
 Tukaram Ganapath 
 which hold the contrary. It is noteworthy however that, even in 
 Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Desai 
, a case regarding criminal breach of trust where the court held that physical presence was not necessary, Shah J noted at p 892 in the passage quoted above that, in offences involving physical violence, presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, unlike cases where the offence consists of diverse acts, which may be done at different times and places.
 33.It would be useful at this point to take a closer look at the language of s 34 of the Penal Code. It provides: 
When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
 Section 33 of the Penal Code states that the word `act` denotes a single act as well as a series of acts. As noted by Untwalia J in 
 Ramaswami 
, it follows that the words in s 34 `when a criminal act is done by several persons` may be construed to mean `when criminal acts are done by several persons`. Therefore, where different acts in a criminal enterprise are committed by different participants, such participants may still be regarded as having `done` a criminal act for the purposes of liability under s 34. The question though is whether this diversity of acts includes acts of preparation and planning by persons who are not present when the act constituting the offence is committed. In 
 Shreekantiah 
 Bose J took the view that it was essential that the participants join in the actual `doing` of the act and not merely in planning its perpetration. He noted that there was a difference between the preliminary stages, the agreement, the preparation, the planning, which is covered by s 109 of the Penal Code, and the stage of commission when the plans are put into effect and carried out, which is covered by s 34. The same point was made in 
 Noor Mohammad Mohd Yusuf Momin v State of Maharashtra 
 AIR 1971 SC 885. In delivering the judgment of the court, Dua J said at p 888-889: 
7 So far as s 34, Indian Penal Code is concerned, it embodies the principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act, the essence of that liability being the existence of a common intention. Participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of the common intention invites its application. Section 109, Indian Penal Code on the other hand may be attracted even if the abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he has instigated the commission of the offence or has engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or has intentionally aided the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission.
 In that case, the court had reasonable doubt regarding the presence of the appellant at the spot in the company of the other accused when the murder was committed. The court therefore set aside the appellant`s conviction under s 302 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
 34.We respectfully agree with the reasoning of the learned judges in 
 Shreekantiah 
 and 
 Noor Mohammad Mohd Yusuf Momin 
. Section 34 operates on the basis of joint liability and its essence lies in the doing of a criminal act which furthers the common intention of the participants. The participants are regarded by virtue of this joint liability as principals in the crime. In abetment on the other hand, the actual offence is committed by someone else other than the abettor. The very nature of s 34 demands a closer association with the actual commission of the offence, as compared to abetment where the person is punished for aiding or abetting the principal. There is therefore no requirement that an abettor must be present at the immediate scene of the crime in order for there to be liability for abetment. In our view, to hold that an accused can be liable under s 34 despite being absent when the commission of the offence occurred would render much of the abetment provisions in the Penal Code otiose. It cannot have been the intention for s 34 to take over the provisions of Ch V of the Penal Code which provides for the substantive offence of abetment. In our view, therefore, in order for an accused person to be liable under s 34, there must be a requirement that he was physically present when the commission of the offence took place.
 35.As an example of the overlap that could occur if there was no such requirement for s 34, let us consider the situation described in illustration (c) to s 111 of the Penal Code. By virtue of s 111 of the Penal Code, an abettor is also liable for different acts which are done. It provides: 
When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had directly abetted it:
 
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
 Illustration (c) to s 111 states : 
A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.
 If there was no requirement that an accused person be physically present at the commission of the offence, s 34 liability could also be imposed on person A in illustration (c) to s 111. There would have been sufficient participation in the criminal act by person A from his instigation of the robbery and from his provision of arms. There was also a common intention to commit robbery and the murder was in furtherance of their common intention. Person A would have been liable for murder under s 34 and s 111. While there might be occasional overlaps of liability within the Penal Code, it cannot have been the intention for such a direct overlap of liability to occur.
 36.The question whether an accused person must be physically present at the actual commission of the offence is therefore answered in the affirmative. The next question which arises for this appeal is whether Gerardine was physically present for the purposes of s 34 when the stabbing took place. The requirement here is physical presence at the actual commission of the offence, not physical presence at the immediate site when the commission of the offence occured. In 
 Barenda Kumar Ghosh v Empero 
r AIR 1925 PC 1, a post-master was shot and killed inside a post office. The accused said that he was outside the post-office at the time of the shooting. Lord Sumner in delivering the judgment of the court observed at p 6, `Even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other things ""they also serve who only stand and wait""`. It was also noted by Bose J in 
 Shreekantiah 
 that an accused need not be present in the actual room. He can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape. What is crucial is that he must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time the crime is actually committed. In 
 Ramaswami 
 A-2 was in the vicinity but not at the immediate site where the beating took place. Untwalia J held that A-2 was acting in concert with A-3 and A-4 in causing the murder of the deceased when he prevented PW1 from going to the relief of the deceased and A-2 was equally responsible for the murder of the deceased under s 34. Looking at the present facts, although Gerardine was not in the flat when the stabbing took place, she was at the staircase landing near the flat. It could not be said that she was in a place remote from the actual occurrence of the offence and the clear inference from the whole of her behaviour was that, if she did see anyone coming, she would warn her companions who were inside the flat. Furthermore, she was the one who brought the others to the flat and identified the deceased. Knowing the movements of the deceased`s family, she was the one who brought them to the flat at a time when the deceased`s son had already left the flat. She was the one who told Mansoor and Nazar what to say in order to get into the flat. In the lift she had given gloves to Mansoor and Nazar to avoid them leaving finger-prints when they beat up the deceased. After Mansoor and Nazar had killed the deceased she went into the flat to look for the deceased`s valuables. In our judgment, her behaviour satisfies the requirements of s 34. We therefore allow the appeal by the prosecution. The respondent`s conviction of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is accordingly substituted by a conviction of murder and she is hereby sentenced to death.",1998-09-09 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Introduction
This appeal arose out of a conviction for six charges: three counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and three counts of fraudulent trading under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1990 Ed). The three cheating charges relate to the following cases and victims: (a). DAC 16750/95 Salim bin Salleh (PW14)
 (b). DAC 16756/95 Norzita bte Musa (PW6)
 (c). DAC 353/96 Norrazzman bin Abdul Raup (PW12)
 whilst the fraudulent trading charges relate to: (d). DAC 16753/95 Hussain bin Mohd (PW9)
 (e). DAC 16757/95 Noorhaini bte Musa (PW10)
 (f). DAC 352/96 Jamaludin bin Hashim (PW7)
 2.The cheating charges were identical in form except for the names of the victims. The charge in DAC 16750/95 is set out below: 
You, Rahj Kamal Bin Abdullah @ Murugesan Rajendran
 
NRIC NO 0106200Z,
 
are charged that you, on or about 7 December 1992, in Singapore, being a director of CDA International Pte Ltd (the Company), did cheat one Salim bin Salleh by deceiving him into believing that if he enters into an associate agreement with the Company to provide an interest free personal collateral loan of a sum of S$30,000 and pays the said sum to the Company, the Company would pay him in return guaranteed `goodfaith gifts` of S$3,000 every month for an unlimited period of time commencing four months after the signing of the said agreement, and a guaranteed refund of the S$25,000 in four instalments pursuant to the said agreement, when in fact you did not have the intention to cause the Company to fully honour the said payments, and by that deception dishonestly induced Salim bin Salleh into delivering a sum of S$30,000 to the Company, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.The fraudulent trading charges were also identical in form except for the names of the victims and the amounts the victims had paid to CDA International Pte Ltd (the Company). The company - CDA International Pte Ltd - was incorporated on 24 January 1992 with two directors, namely the appellant and PW13. Both of them were the only two shareholders, each holding a $1 share. In DAC 16753/95, the charge was as follows: 
You, Rahj Kamal Bin Abdullah @ Murugesan Rajendran
 
NRIC NO 0106200Z,
 
are charged that you, around November 1992, in Singapore were knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of CDA International Pte Ltd (the Company), being a business carried on for the fraudulent purpose of inducing one Hussain bin Mohammed to provide, pursuant to an associate agreement with the Company, an interest free personal collateral loan of a sum of $30,000 to the Company, in return for which the said Hussain bin Mohammed would receive from the Company guaranteed `goodfaith gifts` of $3,000 every month for an unlimited period of time commencing four months after the signing of the said agreement and a guaranteed refund of $25,000 in four instalments pursuant to the said agreement, which the Company had no intent to fully honour, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1990 Ed).
 With respect to DAC 352/96, the variations related to the following: the interest free personal collateral loan to the Company was for a sum of $25,000; the guaranteed refund was in full; and the goodfaith gifts matured sooner - three rather than the usual four months after the signing of the agreement.
 4.At the end of the trial, the district judge convicted the appellant of all six charges and sentenced him to two years` imprisonment on each charge. The sentences in DAC 16750/95 and DAC 16753/95 were to run consecutively while the other sentences were to run concurrently. This made a total of four years` imprisonment to commence upon the expiry of the current sentence which the appellant was serving. The appellant appealed against the convictions and sentences. I dismissed the appeal and at the same time ordered the sentences in four charges to run consecutively, with the other sentences to run concurrently, making a total of eight years` imprisonment. I now give my reasons.
 5.
 The prosecution`s case
Although the six charges were framed under different sections, the prosecution`s case rested on the Directorship Programme (DP) designed by the appellant. The essence of the scheme was that in exchange for either a $30,000 or $25,000 `interest free personal collateral loan` to the Company, a participant would be guaranteed `goodfaith gifts` of $3,000 per month for an indefinite period of time. There was also the assurance that the original loan sum or a large part of it would be returned within two years. All the agreements were evidenced by a printed document with the logo of the company and with the word `directorship` typed on it. They were produced, admitted and marked as follows: (a). PW14`s agreement P38
 (b). PW6`s agreement P21
 (c). PW12`s agreement P30
 (d). PW9`s agreement P34
 (e). PW10`s agreement P22
 (f). PW7`s agreement P25
 The appellant`s signature appeared on (a), (d) and (f) as representing the company while the remaining three documents were signed by one Mohamad Sanip bin Ali (PW8).
 6.
 The scheme
The prosecution witness who had the earliest involvement with the scheme was Noorrashid bin Musa (PW13). He first came to know of the appellant sometime in 1991 when he was introduced by a friend to him. PW13 was offered a job as a tutor by the appellant and was also asked to join a fabulous programme. PW13 paid $50 to obtain some brochures and later went to attend a seminar conducted by the appellant at the Golden Landmark Hotel. The appellant was a charismatic and influential speaker who spoke on his `Time and Management` programmes and his desire to provide jobs for the Malay community. PW13 was very impressed and soon joined a non-fixed deposit programme where he would get a 5% monthly return for his investment of $5,000 and a 5% commission for every person he could recruit to join the programme. The company which ran this programme was one DFM company.
 7.PW13 was initially worried that he might not get his returns. To reassure PW13, the appellant swore on the Koran that he would take care of PW13 and his family. The appellant subsequently formed a sole proprietorship known as Concierge Dynamics Associates (CDA) and transferred all DFM agreements to CDA. PW13 then became actively involved in the recruiting of members and the collection of funds. There was no tangible business run by CDA save for the non-fixed deposit programmes and the conduct of Basic Compulsory Training 1 and 2 (BCT). It was not compulsory to attend these classes and they were not conducted systematically. The point of these classes was to recruit more participants and to get participants to upgrade by putting in more money and earning better returns and commissions.
 8.The appellant subsequently instructed PW13 to register a new firm known as Venture Concierge Associates (VCA) in partnership with one Junita bte Ibrahim in November 1991. Thereafter members of CDA were asked to transfer their investments to VCA. Members were also encouraged to top up their investments in order to obtain a higher return. VCA ran the same business programme as CDA with no tangible business. More businesses were also registered in the names of other recruits: Darham Management Associates in the names of Mohamad Sanip bin Ali (PW8) and one Shamsul Bahrin bin Shaari; and Proton Management Consultants in the name of Mohamed Hishamudin bin Sapinge. After VCA had been active for some time, the appellant instructed all investments to be transferred to Darham. The appellant also brought PW13 and other associates to different countries in the region such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia to conduct seminars and to recruit new members.
 9.Over time, the non-fixed deposit programme was improved. The DP was started. Both PW6 and PW10 who did clerical work for the appellant gave evidence that it was the appellant who came up with the idea, and the programme was implemented and further explained under his instructions. For an interest free personal loan of $30,000 to the company, the benefit was a return of $3,000 every month after the third month forever, and a refund of $25,000 progressively. PW7 and PW12 gave evidence that during the classes, the appellant would induce them to join the DP by promising all directors a car of their own. The appellant also told them that at the end of the course, each associate could choose the business he wished to go into, financed by the money collected.
 10.Initially the appellant would receive the money first before signing the agreements. At a later stage, he authorised PW13 and PW8 to receive the money and gave instructions for PW6 and PW10 to see him, P13 and PW8 in that order for signature of the DP agreements. All funds collected by PW13, PW8 or other associates under such programmes were given to the appellant personally, to his personal assistant or deposited into his bank account. The appellant would also be given a list of all the new recruits. PW13 testified that he allowed the appellant to keep all the money as the latter was the brain-child of all these programmes and had run the programme successfully for the past 10 years. PW6, PW8 and PW13 gave evidence that at the end of every month, a list would be compiled to inform the appellant as to the amount of goodfaith gifts due for each month. The appellant would vet and approve the payment before transferring money to the accounts of VCA or Darham after which PW13 and PW8 would use the money to pay out the goodfaith gifts, the rentals, the overheads and other expenses.
 11.No tangible business which could generate profits was carried out by the Company or any other companies under the umbrella of this set-up. PW8, PW10, PW12 and PW14 all gave evidence that they saw no business other than the recruitment of participants for the various programmes and the collection of money. The appellant did not tell anyone what the money was used for except that it was used to invest in business abroad. No one had any idea how the appellant could generate the funds needed to meet the goodfaith obligations but over the years, they, in particular PW13 and PW8, had developed trust and faith in the appellant. This was because the appellant had been able to honour the goodfaith obligations under the non-fixed deposit programmes and other similar associate agreements involving smaller sums of money. PW13 himself continued to trust the appellant as the appellant had told him that he had bank accounts in Switzerland and Labuan and that he had the means to generate the income needed to fulfil the obligations under the agreements. The appellant, however, could not share the knowledge of how he was able to do it as that was a trade secret.
 12.PW6, PW7, PW9, PW10, PW12 and PW14 all gave evidence that they received the goodfaith gifts of $3,000 only once or twice and did not get their refund back. PW8 and PW13 gave evidence that towards the end of 1992 or early 1993, the appellant started stressing on Conduct, Attendance and Performance (CAP). The associates had to be actively recruiting people into more programmes and must introduce a minimum of two new recruits per month. PW7 gave evidence that he was told by both the appellant and PW13 that, if he wanted to be paid the goodfaith gifts, he had to recruit more members. He also had to write a letter of apology to the appellant for asking for his money so many times. Both PW13 and PW8 gave evidence that these letters of apology would then be used by the appellant to label some associates `defaulters` as an excuse for not giving them their good faith gifts and refunds. PW12 and PW8 were among those who were told that they had defaulted and would not receive any payments.
 13.In May 1993, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) raided the company`s office at Kim Seng Plaza. At the time of the raid, the appellant was in Jakarta. PW13 rang the appellant who told him to remove all the documents from the office and to fly over to Jakarta. He also told PW13 to warn the associates that those who worked with the CAD would be considered defaulters and would not get payment. In Jakarta, the appellant tried to calm the associates and subsequently deployed them to carry on more recruitment work in Indonesia. The directors who were behind in their receipt of payments were told to trust the appellant and receive just allowances. PW12 gave evidence that, after the raid, the appellant rang to give instructions for setting up a new company in order to carry on the business. The following day, PW12 registered Hamnaz Management Consultants as a sole proprietorship at the Registry of Companies and Businesses in order to confuse the authorities. PW8 gave evidence that the appellant had told him not to respond to the CAD letter of appearance. Instead, they were to write to the CAD to inform them that they were outside Singapore. The appellant also scolded them for being careless in allowing the CAD to take away the files including a list of investors` names.
 14.Both PW13 and PW8 gave evidence that the appellant had said that he would use the raid as an excuse not to make payments. PW8 also gave evidence that, even after the raid, money was still transferred to the appellant but the payments made came from the pockets of members like PW12, PW14, Hishamudin and Rahman. PW13 was arrested when he subsequently returned to Singapore. He then realized that the entire scheme was a scam and thereafter, when he heard that the appellant had come back to Singapore, helped to apprehend him.
 15.Relying on the evidence above, the prosecution argued that the appellant was clearly the directing mind and will of the company. All the funds collected were given to the appellant and he alone decided when and whom to pay. The prosecution also relied on the appellant`s own evidence that he was very much in control of all the activities in the company and its business entities from the date of its incorporation in January 1992 to May 1993. The prosecution`s case was that the DP, by the very manner in which it was structured, was from the start bound to fail. First of all, the high returns promised were inherently incredible as the fulfilment of such promises would require a company or person to possess an immense source of financial resources, which on the evidence neither the appellant nor the company had. The appellant himself confirmed that the company did not have any profit-generating business or trade. The only business activity was the collection of funds from members of the public through the various schemes and programmes. Hence the only source of funds which the company could use for the payment of the goodfaith gifts and the refunds were the funds collected from subsequent investors. Such a financial snowball scheme which could only carry on for as long as there was a continuous, uninterrupted and enormously progressive increase in participants in the programmes would eventually collapse. There was simply no realistic prospect of the company or the appellant fulfilling the financial obligations under the DP, a fact which the appellant must have been aware of. Hence, the prosecution invited the trial judge to draw the irresistible inference that the appellant knew, at the time these representations were allowed to be made, that they were false, as he was fully aware that neither he nor the company had the financial ability then or in the future to fully honour these guaranteed payments indefinitely. As such, the appellant had acted dishonestly, or framed within the terms of the Companies Act charge, with a fraudulent purpose.
 16.
 The defence
The thrust of the appellant`s defence was that PW13 and his other associates had carried out the DP under the banner of the company without his consent and knowledge. According to the appellant, once VCA was started, only two agreements were transferred from CDA to VCA: PW8`s and one Ronald Lobo`s. All the rest were refunded and terminated. The company was formed by him together with PW13 but, as he was going out of Singapore to establish his credibility, the company with its branch at Kim Seng Plaza was supposed to be dormant. He claimed that he had no knowledge that the company had been used for any business and was unaware of the DP or what PW13 was doing behind his back. As such, he had never made any representation about the DP to any of the victims. He claimed that his purported signatures appearing on three of the agreements were forged and his co-director PW13 was the one who had cheated these victims. Alternatively, he claimed that the company could not pay because accounts were frozen by the CAD. As such, there was no intention to cheat.
 17.
 The decision below
The trial judge rejected the appellant`s defence. He found on the evidence that the appellant had full control over the funds that were collected by all the associates for the various programmes including the DP. He accepted the evidence of PW13 and PW8 that all the funds collected, whether from the DP or from any other programmes with any other companies, would be channelled to the appellant, either personally or into bank accounts operated by him, in Singapore or even in Indonesia. This evidence was confirmed by the appellant`s personal assistant Melissa Hera Yati Junadi (PW5) and the bank statements of accounts solely operated by the appellant. The trial judge came to the view that the appellant was the one who supplied the funds to make payments of goodfaith gifts, the overheads and other expenses of running the programmes. On the appellant`s own evidence, he was the one who determined who should be paid and how much goodfaith gifts should be paid out.
 18.The trial judge also found as a matter of evidence that the appellant was aware of the DP. Besides oral evidence from the prosecution witnesses, the defence witness Hanifa Kahar (DW2) testified that the appellant was one of the persons who had encouraged her in the setting up of a company, Assistant Concierge Elite (ACE) which had also embarked on a similar scheme of collecting $30,000 as an interest free personal loan based on the same generous terms. The trial judge also found the appellant to be inconsistent in his evidence, blowing hot and cold over the control he had over the activities of the companies involved. On the one hand, he alleged that he was the mentor of PW13 and would scrutinize the latter`s projects closely before approving huge loans to him. On the other hand, he said that PW13 became independent after VCA was set up and he had never scrutinized a single VCA agreement, which would have revealed a similar scheme of indefinite goodfaith gift payments with capital refunds.
 19.The trial judge further found that there was no viable business being carried out. None of the associates were aware of any profit-making business or involvement that could possibly provide the funds and the means to fulfil the obligations of the Company and all the other related companies to meet the goodfaith gift payments. The appellant would respond to their concerns with catch words like GOD: Generating, Operating and Destroy, adding that he could not divulge the secret as others might topple him. When cross-examined, the appellant could not give a cogent answer to the question of how he was going to honour the obligation under the DP. While he claimed that banks and friends had given him millions to sustain the scheme, he refused to reveal their identities. A few tangible businesses were mentioned: a Haj programme and a boutique business. Under cross-examination however, the appellant was forced to admit that there were no profits to talk about. Under the Haj program, each pilgrim could sign up for $2,000 but the cost that had to be borne by them was $6,500 per pilgrim which had to be paid to the travel agent. As for the boutique, the trial judge accepted the evidence of PW8 that it was merely to attract customers to sign up as associates and there was no viable business being carried out.
 20.The trial judge drew an adverse inference against the appellant for refusing to reveal his financial sources. He found that the defence witnesses did not help the appellant as they could not offer any cogent evidence to show that the group of companies was able to fulfil the financial obligations under the DP. On the contrary, he found that DW2 and Halimatus Sulaudiah bte Nasir (DW3) themselves did not receive their refunds and the goodfaith gifts due to them stopped after a few times. His only conclusion was that the funds for the initial payment of the goodfaith gifts came from the interest free loans collected from both prior and subsequent associates. The trial judge also rejected the defence that there was no intention to cheat as it was the CAD raid which caused the inability to pay. The trial judge found it telling that, although the scheme had been started for almost two years before the CAD raid, the focus had been on recruitment and the collection of funds. He was of the view that all the plans and ideas for all kinds of businesses were merely grandiose fronts conjured up by the appellant. The appellant had no intention to translate any of them into concrete profit-generating businesses. The fact that the Company had no capital, no bank account and no source of funds other than the collection of money from new associates was concealed. The trial judge was of the view that such concealment could not but be dishonest. At the end of the trial, he found that the prosecution had proven its case against the appellant on all six charges beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant accordingly.
 21.
 The appeal
Pursuant to the petition of appeal, two questions arose in the appeal: (1). whether the elements of the offences were made out; and
 (2). whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.
 (1) 
 Whether the elements of the offences were made out 
 The cheating charges
 22.The relevant part of s 420 Penal Code reads: 
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to a fine.
 As to the definition of cheating, the relevant part of s 415 states: 
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, is said to cheat.
 23.Earlier in 
Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 969
 , I have already laid down three elements that have to be satisfied for the cheating offence under s 420 to be made out. First, the victim must be deceived. Second, the deception must have induced the victim to deliver any property to any person. Finally, there must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property which constitutes the mens rea for the offence.
 (i) Deception
 24.The natural and ordinary meaning of the word `deceiving` is causing another to believe what is not true. Such misrepresentation can be by way of words, acts and even omissions. As explanation 1 to s 415 makes clear, a dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of the section. In this respect, an issue arose as to whether representations must be made personally and directly by the accused. The appellant contended at the trial that he had not made any direct representation to the victims about the DP. The prosecution, however, argued that he did make indirect representations and submitted that representations need not be direct or made personally, as long as it can be said that the accused caused the deception.
 25.A perusal of the evidence showed that the appellant did make direct representations to PW6 and PW12. The appellant was the one who told PW6 about the goodfaith gifts under the agreement and the fact that the investments would be used for a global, albeit unknown, business. There was also direct representation of the DP by the appellant to PW12 in the classes that the former conducted. The appellant further promised PW12 that he would be put fully in charge of a company, given a car and a house abroad and payment of the goodfaith gifts would continue for as long as he was with the company. For PW14, however, he was not sure whether it was the appellant who mentioned the DP in the classes and, though his agreement bore the appellant`s signature, he did not see the appellant sign it.
 26.I was of the view that the element of deception can be satisfied without a direct and personal representation. A fraudulent or dishonest representation can be made directly or indirectly. Such a representation made through a person acting as agent for the accused amounts to fraudulent or dishonest representation by and on behalf of the accused. Where there is evidence to show that the accused had authorised another to act on his behalf, the false representation can be made the basis for convicting the accused. In this case, it was not disputed that the terms of the agreements had meanings and effects as set out in the charges. The appellant contended at the trial that he had no knowledge of such agreements and his purported signatures appearing on three of the agreements had been forged. According to him, it was PW13 and PW8 who had cheated the victims.
 27.I found the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was well aware of the DP to be strongly supported by the evidence. Besides evidence that the appellant talked about the DP in the classes he conducted, PW6 and PW10 testified that the DP was implemented by the appellant. Even DW2 agreed that the appellant was aware of the nature of the programme, in that there would be goodfaith gifts due to the associates. According to her, all the associates had gathered in Jakarta after the CAD raid, and the accused had talked to them about how to carry on the payments. Once the appellant was shown to be aware of the DP, the strength of his defence that his signatures were forged fell correspondingly. At the trial, the appellant challenged the authenticity of his purported signatures and wanted a report from the Department of Scientific Services which would mean an eight-week delay to the trial. The trial judge refused to adjourn the trial for this exercise for sound reasons: 
the accused would be required to tender specimen signatures which are similar to those in the DP agreements. As it was the accused`s position that the DP signatures are forgeries and completely different, it would be foolish of him to try his best to imitate exactly the DP signatures when he furnishes his specimen signatures. Any specimen signatures furnished by the accused would clearly be suspect and unreliable
 28.I could not agree more with the trial judge, taking into account the fact that the appellant had shown himself to be good with different signatures. PW13 gave evidence under cross-examination that in 1992 the appellant changed his signature when he started signing directorship agreements, the haj and umrah programmes of the Company. This was confirmed by PW6 and PW8. DW3 also confirmed that the appellant kept changing his signature. In any event, PW13 testified that the appellant had signed the agreements with PW14, PW9 and PW7 in his presence and this was confirmed by DW3 who gave evidence that she had seen PW13 handing such agreements to the appellant to sign. As for the agreements carrying the signature of PW8, there was evidence by PW13, PW6 and PW10 that PW8 was authorised by the appellant to sign such agreements. It was therefore obvious that the appellant had caused or allowed the representations in these agreements to be made.
 (ii) Inducement to deliver any property to any person
 29.This element was clearly satisfied given that almost all victims testified that they would not have invested their money if they had known that they would not receive the goodfaith gifts every month or if they had known that they would not get their refunds. Neither would they have invested if they had known that the Company had no tangible business besides the recruitment of participants like them.
 (iii) Dishonest intention
 30.The appellant`s alternative defence was that this case concerned a mere civil breach of contract. Even if he was the one who had propagated the scheme, he had no dishonest intention and it was the CAD raid which had prevented him from paying out. The distinction between a case of mere breach of contract and one of cheating depends upon one vital factor: whether at the time of the agreement there is intention on the part of the accused to carry out the terms of the agreement, as is clear from illustration (g) to s 415. In this regard, there need not be any positive evidence of the dishonest intention. It can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the appellant.
 31.At the trial, the trial judge was persuaded by the case of 
 Nadir Ali Barqa Zaidi v State of UP 
 AIR 1960 All 103 where the appellants ran two schemes, similar to the DP in the present case. There, both schemes involved the deposit of money by members of the public with a firm. Under one scheme, a depositor would receive Rs700 in six monthly instalments in return for the deposit of Rs100. Under the other scheme, it was Rs406.4 in six fortnightly instalments. The court there was of the view that either scheme was bound to fail as `a stage would come when no further depositor would be forthcoming and the bubble would burst`, a fact that the appellants were clearly aware of. The court also arrived at the conclusion that the entire scheme was dishonest at its commencement because of the concealment of material facts. The appellants had not only falsely represented that the firm was a bank and that its schemes were approved by the government, they had also concealed material facts like the firm having no securities, no investments or foreign trade and a very small capital and how a depositor would be paid from the money of subsequent depositors. The court there held that the concealment of such material facts could not but be dishonest.
 32.In the present case, a dishonest intention could be inferred from similar circumstances of concealment. PW6 gave evidence that all the offices were opened on the appellant`s instructions, a fact confirmed by PW13. All these business entities had no tangible business and were largely set up to confuse the authorities. Both PW8 and PW13 gave evidence that CDA, VCA, Darham and the company had no tangible business. In particular, PW13 gave evidence that it was the appellant who told him to register VCA because CDA had to lie low. Similarly, PW12 gave evidence that the appellant had instructed him to set up Hamnaz Management Consultants to confuse the authorities as Darham was facing problems. In addition, PW13 gave evidence that the company had no bank account and there were no official company receipt books. All the funds collected went to the accused in person or into his personal accounts, with him doling out payments as and when required. Receipts issued by the company for the moneys it received from the victims under the DP were taken away to Indonesia by the appellant and substituted with receipts issued by Darham, presumably to confuse the authorities. A similar view should be taken with respect to the appellant`s many different signatures.
 33.Besides evidence that there was no income-generating business being conducted and that the only business was to collect moneys from the associates, the prosecution witnesses testified that they had no idea what the appellant did with the money he collected or how he could generate the required funds because the appellant kept his activities a secret. The appellant did not disclose the material fact that the money collected from the victims would go towards paying prior depositors or that they would be paid from the money of subsequent depositors. As discussed above, almost all the victims testified that, if these had been made known to them, they would not have given any money to the company. In my opinion, the trial judge was entitled to follow the 
 Nadir Ali 
 case and draw the inference that `the concealment of such material facts could not but be dishonest.` In any event, as the appellant was unable to explain adequately how he was going to honour his financial obligations, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that the appellant was fully aware that neither he nor the company had the financial ability to fully honour the guaranteed payments indefinitely as represented. As such, the trial judge rightly came to the conclusion that the appellant knew, at the time the representations were made, that they were false, and that he possessed the requisite mens rea for the cheating offences to be made out.
 34.In view of what I have set out above, I found no merit in the appellant`s contentions. I accepted fully the trial judge`s assessment of the evidence and dismissed the appellant`s appeal in relation to the cheating charges accordingly.
 The fraudulent trading offences
 35.For the fraudulent trading offences, the prosecution needed only prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, two elements: first, that the business of the company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors or with a fraudulent purpose and, second, that the accused was knowingly a party to the carrying on of that business with such intent or purpose. With regard to the first element, the trial judge was persuaded by 
R v Grantham
 
[1984] QB 675
, a case on s 332(3) read with s 332(1) of the 1948 English Companies Act, which was in pari materia to s 340(5) and (1) of our Companies Act. In that case, the trial judge`s direction, which was approved by the Criminal Court of Appeal was set out at p 169a-d: 
A man intends to defraud a creditor either if he intends that the creditor shall never be paid or alternatively if he intends to obtain credit or carry on obtaining credit when the rights and interests of the creditor are being prejudiced in a way which the defendant himself has generally regarded as dishonest a trader can intend to defraud if he obtains credit when there is a substantial risk of the creditor not getting his money or not getting the whole of his money and the defendant knows that that is the position and knows he is stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest.
 36.As discussed above, with no profit-generating business under the Company`s belt, there was, to the knowledge of the appellant, a substantial risk of the victims not getting their money or the whole of their money. The trial judge was therefore entitled to find that there was intent to defraud the creditors and that the appellant was knowingly a party, having made a well supported finding that the appellant was, at the very least, aware of the DP. Hence the elements of the fraudulent trading offences were also made out. Accordingly, I had no hesitation in dismissing the appellant`s appeal on these charges.
 (2) The sentence
 37.This left me with a final issue to consider: the appellant`s appeal against the sentences which the trial judge imposed upon his conviction for the respective offences. As the trial judge pointed out, the appellant had practised deception on a large scale. He projected himself as the economic saviour of the Malay community and succeeded in gaining the trust of PW13 and other associates by using religion to back up his promises. He then made use of them to convince and persuade their friends and families to hand over their hard-earned money, using self-invented concepts and grandiose plans to exploit the ignorance and trust of his victims. He thought nothing about forming business entity after business entity to confuse the authorities and, even after the CAD raid, he attempted to hide documents and had no compunction about continuing his schemes in Jakarta. In my opinion, the appellant had shown a strong propensity to dishonest means of self-enrichment and I felt that the need to deter him from committing further wrongdoing was sufficient basis for me to enhance his sentence.
 38.In doing so, I also took into account the conduct of the appellant during the trial. As the trial judge said in his judgment, 
Before me, the accused showed no sign of remorse. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, he dragged all the prosecution witnesses through a long and tedious trial. What was more objectionable was the manner in which he went about conducting his trial. He asked a lot of irrelevant questions and even when the court ruled those questions as irrelevant, he would persist in asking them if not immediately, then at a later stage; the same questions would be asked again. On several occasions, he would also argue with the court when the court ruled his questions as irrelevant. He even wanted to subject his own defence witness, Ms Halimatus Sulaudiah bte Nasir (DW3) to questions involving her alleged rape by PW13 The accused had also asked PW5 if she was molested and had put to her that she resigned because she was pregnant. These allegations had absolutely no relevance to the case and they were clearly raised to cause distress.
 Such deplorable conduct was totally unacceptable. As such, I enhanced the sentences by ordering four of the sentences to run consecutively while the rest run concurrently. On this basis, the appellant`s imprisonment was extended to 96 months in total. Taking into account s 234(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I further ordered that the sentences would only commence upon the expiry of the current sentence which the appellant was serving.",1997-10-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This is an appeal which raises, amongst other matters, several interesting issues in relation to the ambit and applicability of the presumption of corruption under s 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the Act). In the trial below, the trial judge acquitted the accused without his defence being called. Against this decision, the prosecution appealed. I allowed the appeal and I now give my reasons for doing so.
 2.
 The charge
The accused was charged as follows: 
That You,
 
Low Tiong Choon,
 
M/46 yrs,
 
NRIC S01811324B
 
are charged that you, on a day in April 1995, at 151 Chin Swee Road #02-15/16, Singapore did corruptly receive for yourself a gratification of a sum of $500 as a reward from one Yap Chee Leong for introducing one Gay Khiam Seen to engage the said Yap Chee Leong as counsel for the said Gay Khiam Seen in a traffic case, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 3.
 The case for the prosecution
The prosecution`s case could not have been more straightforward. The accused was a staff sergeant in the Singapore Police Force at the material time of the alleged offence. He was in charge of deployment and security operations at the subordinate courts. He has since retired from the force in September 1995.
 4.On 30 September 1994, one Gay Khiam Seen (Gay) was arrested for drunken driving. On 31 October 1994, he was charged in the subordinate courts for the offence of drunken driving. Subsequently, Gay was introduced to the accused by one Andrew Tang, who was his father`s business associate. This introduction took place at the lock-up area of the subordinate courts, where the accused was working. Gay told the accused that he required a lawyer to represent him in court. The accused suggested Yap Chee Leong (Yap) whom he assured Gay was a very experienced lawyer in the field of traffic offences. The accused then called Yap, and on that very same day, Gay accompanied the accused to Yap`s office.
 5.Yap consequently represented Gay in court on 15 March 1995 for his case to be mentioned. On 7 April 1995, Gay pleaded guilty to his traffic offence. He received a day`s imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, and was disqualified from driving for three years. During the trial below, it transpired that after this incident Gay paid a total of $30,000 in legal fees and disbursements to Yap.
 6.The prosecution claimed during the trial that this introduction by the accused to Yap came with a price. They sought to rely on a statement given by Yap while he was serving his sentence, also for offences related to corruption, at Tanah Merah Prison. This statement was recorded by one Chan Toh Kai (Chan), a former senior special investigator with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). The circumstances to which the statement came to be recorded are unimportant. What is important though were the portions which the trial judge admitted as evidence under ss 378(1)(b)(i) and 379(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). In essence, these portions implicated the accused as they alleged that he introduced clients to Yap in return for an `introduction fee`. The relevant parts of Yap`s statement, as set out in [para ] 11 of the trial judge`s decision, read: 
2 [The accused] had on five or six occasions introduced clients to me 
7 The last occasion was sometime in early 1995, and the name of the client, if I am not wrong, was Gay Khiam Seen. He was charged for driving under disqualification and I represented him in court. He pleaded guilty and was fined and jailed for a day. I am unable to recall now, but it was either [the accused] telephoned me to tell me he was sending a client to see me, or he arranged to bring the client to my office. 
8 I met [the accused] in court on the day Gay pleaded guilty. On another occasion, when we met in court, he asked me how much I charged Gay, and I told him $5,000. In fact that was not the actual sum I charged Gay. I did not want to reveal to [the accused] the fee I charged my client. To me, that was a hint that he was reminding me his introduction fee. I told him to see me in my office in the evening. 
9 Later, [the accused] came, and I handed to him $500 in cash. I usually carry some cash with me. This $500 was not reflected in my company`s account. 
10 After one or two clients that [the accused] introduced to me, he remarked that my fee was very high. This was followed by an introduction fee of 10% per client arranged between us. However, I am unable to recall whether he was the one who suggested this to me, or I made this offer to him. I estimate that I had given him introduction fee on three or four occasions.
 7.The prosecution therefore relied on Yap`s statement to show that the accused was guilty of corruption under s 5(a)(i) of the Act, by receiving money as a reward for introducing clients to Yap. The prosecution also called two further witnesses other than Gay and Chan. One was Mohd Afif Hussain and he testified that Yap had been imprisoned for corruption offences. Yap subsequently passed away in jail due to heart failure. The other was Inspector Loo Sew Nam (Loo), and his evidence was to the effect that it was not appropriate for the accused to receive moneys from counsel in return for introducing clients to them. In particular, he pointed out that this violated rule A10 of the Police General Orders (PGO), a code regulating the conduct of the police, and which is given the force of law by virtue of s 26 of the Police Force Act (Cap 235).
 8.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge accepted the defence`s arguments that there was no case to answer. She held that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case which justified calling for the accused`s defence. In addition, the presumption of corruption under s 8 of the Act was not applicable. Accordingly, she acquitted the accused and discharged him. As she held at [para ] 33 of her grounds of decision: 
In sum, on taking the evidence at its highest, I found that an inference of `corrupt` receipt was not reasonably open. There was no evidence of improper influence intended by Yap in rewarding the accused for introducing a client. The accused did not take advantage of his official position and there is no inference reasonably open that by receiving the $500 he intended to disregard his duty. As stated above, the accused was moonlighting and for this he should have been dealt with appropriately under the Police Force Act and not for corruption. I accordingly acquitted and discharged the accused.
 9.
 The appeal
The appeal by the prosecution rested on two main grounds. The first related to the issue that the trial judge erred when she held that the presumption under s 8 of the Act was not applicable in the present case, and the second related to the contention that the trial judge erred when she found that the accused`s act of receiving $500 from Yap could not be construed as corrupt so as to establish a prima facie case necessary for his defence to be called.
 a Presumption under s 8
 10.Dealing with the first issue first, the trial judge held that the only reason why the presumption of corruption was not applicable in the present instance was because she felt that the presumption was meant only to be invoked when it was impossible for the prosecution to prove their case in certain aspects. In the present case, the prosecution could in fact prove their case without the need for the presumption. In particular, they even listed the nature and essence of the offence, thus avoiding any need for the accused to be deemed `corrupt` under the presumption. Hence, it was not possible nor necessary for the prosecution to rely on the presumption. At [para ] 24 of her grounds of decision, she said: 
I found a fundamental difficulty in logic in the prosecution`s attempt to invoke the presumption in the present case. I shall explain. The prosecution had tendered in evidence Yap`s statement in which the purpose why he gave the $500 is expressly stated to have been for the introduction of Gay as a client. In the charge, the prosecution had also expressly averred that the $500 was received as a reward for the introduction of Gay. The object of the payment and alleged receipt is therefore identical. 
 In my view, the utility of the presumption must disappear entirely where the prosecution alleged a specific purpose for the payment and receipt
. In such a case, it must be for the court to decide objectively applying the principles of law in the area of corruption as to whether the element of `corruptly` is made out on the basis of the express purpose of the receiving stated in the charge. This must be so because the presumption cannot deem the specific alleged purpose of receiving as corrupt, if considered objectively, no corrupt element is found to exist on the evidence available at the close of the prosecution`s case. 
 In my judgment, the underlying policy of the presumption is obviously to assist the prosecution in cases where it is unable to establish what is the nature of the payment and receipt. In such cases, the presumption fills a void to establish a prima facie case. In my opinion, the reliance on the presumption in the present case was therefore misplaced
. [Emphasis added.]
 11.With respect, I could not agree with the trial judge`s reasoning. In my opinion, she made a fundamental error of law in this respect, in that she misconceived the true nature and purpose of the presumption of corruption under s 8 of the Act. The presumption under s 8 applies regardless of whether the prosecution is able to prove the essence of the offence which the accused is alleged to have committed. As long as the requisite criteria as laid out in s 8 is fulfilled, the presumption of corruption is triggered. In my judgment, the underlying policy of the s 8 presumption is not to fill any void which the prosecution may find unable to prove in their case, rather it is to catch persons who are under the employment of the government or a public body when such persons abuse their position and corruptly give or receive a gratification for some ulterior purpose. It is for this reason that the legislature has seen fit to impose a presumption of corruption against such persons. Usually, such persons are in positions of influence. If there are no checks on or safeguards against such persons, they may well exploit or abuse their positions in return for gratification from those whom they favour. In such a case, the presumption kicks in and makes it easier to prove a case of corruption against them. There is no dispute that those who work for the government or a public body tend to be the ones who have the power and authority to make decisions which can potentially affect others. As such, the present s 8 presumption is simply another device, amongst others, which allows the courts to scrutinise and punish, if necessary, such persons. Public interest demands a certain standard of behaviour from them and therefore if they do not conform to that standard, legislation provides the courts with the necessary means to deal effectively with them. In the case of 
PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 131
 , I held, in reference to s 8 (at p 134G): 
To give effect to the objective of the Act to provide for a more effectual prevention of corruption, the legislature has seen fit to displace the presumption of innocence against an accused person in the limited cases falling within s 8. These corruption cases are viewed with particular severity because public officers and government matters are involved. Therefore, a public officer who, by virtue of his office or position, has the power and authority to make a decision affecting another person cannot allow himself to seek favour from that other person. If he does so, he bears the onus of rebutting the presumption of corruption within s 8 of the Act on a balance of probabilities. The rebuttal of the presumption was precisely the task faced by the respondent at trial and in this appeal.
 12.In that sense, this is the 
 real 
 essence of the presumption. Invoking the presumption however does not mean that these persons are guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, it assists only to the extent that such persons, in the employ of the government or public body, are prima facie guilty. In other words, they are 
 deemed 
 to be corrupt, on the basis that they knew they should not be so, but yet placed themselves in the position which contradicts what they ought not to do. It is then up to the accused to rebut the allegations and presumptions of corruption against them. As I made it very clear in my recent case of 
Yuen Chun Yii v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 57
  (at p 71 [para ] 69): 
It should be emphasised that although the presumption of corruption under s 8 PCA was raised, this did not transform a s 6(a) offence into one involving strict liability. It merely presumed, inter alia, that there was a corrupt element in the transaction and that the appellant knew that his conduct would be considered corrupt on an ordinary objective standard. The burden remained on the appellant to rebut these presumptions: see 
PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 131
 .
 13.The reason for of the presumption thus lies not in the assistance it provides to the prosecution in proving their case, but on policy grounds, in the sense that those who are under the employment of the government or a public body are presumed guilty if they find themselves in the position envisaged under s 8 of the Act. This can only be right, since such persons should not be allowed to profit from their position corruptly. If they do, they should then be prepared to face the severe consequences of the law, including the availability to the prosecution of the s 8 presumption. Accordingly, in my judgment, the trial judge should not have refused to invoke the presumption of corruption based on her reasoning as given in her grounds of decision.
 14.Having said that however, the presumption is still not invoked as of right. One still has to ask whether the presumption could be rightfully invoked, especially in the present case. In the case of 
 Yuen Chun Yii v PP 
, I reiterated three factual criteria which have to be satisfied before s 8 can apply. At [para ] 52 of the judgment (at p 68), I held: 
In view of the operation of s 8 PCA, it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove three factual elements, laid down by Wee Chong Jin CJ in 
Chew Chee Sun v PP
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 58
  (at p 59); [1975-1977] SLR 352 (at p 354) as follows: 
(i) a gratification was paid or given to or received by the accused person; 
(ii) at the time of the payment, gift or receipt the accused was in the employment of the Government or a department thereof or a public body; and 
(iii) the payment, gift or receipt was by or from a person who at the time of the payment, gift or receipt had or sought to have dealings with the Government or that department of Government or that public body.
 15.The same criteria was more or less repeated again by Wee Chong Jin CJ in the case of 
Wee Toon Boon v PP
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
  [1975-1977] SLR 498 .
 16.In my opinion, the first two criteria can be proved very easily and in fact, in the present case, this was done. It is pertinent at this stage to remind ourselves that I need only to assess the evidence of the prosecution 
 as if 
 it were true, since it was the defence`s contentions that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case. On that basis, according to established case law, all that I was required to do was to accept the prosecution`s case as correct and consider whether a prima facie case had been made out which warranted the accused`s defence being called.
 17.Taking the prosecution evidence therefore as if it were true, I think the prosecution had shown that the accused had received a gratification from Yap in the form of $500 and that when he received this gratification, he was still in the employment of the Singapore Police Force, a part of the government. Yap`s statement which he made before he passed away was admitted in court without any challenge and it was not disputed that the accused was still working in the subordinate courts as a police officer when the offence was alleged to have been committed. The first two criteria were accordingly satisfied.
 18.The problem came however with the third criteria, that the giver of the gratification must have had or was seeking to have dealings with `the government or that department of the government or that public body` by which the accused was the employed. In my view, it was in this respect that the prosecution failed to satisfy the criteria, so as not to invoke the s 8 presumption. In the instant case, the accused had introduced Gay to Yap, for which he was later alleged to have been paid a fee. The end purpose of this introduction was so that Yap could make a living by representing him in court. Gay would then pay Yap for his services rendered as a lawyer representing him in court. Therefore, in my judgment, if there were any dealings by Yap with anyone at all, it was with his client, Gay, whom he, as a lawyer, represented in court, and not with the government or any other public body. In my view, Yap did not deal with the accused or his employer, the Singapore Police Force, or with the subordinate courts, the judicial arm of the government of Singapore and I think it would indeed be straining the definition of the phrase `dealing or seeking to deal with the Government or its department thereof or a public body` if one were to hold the contrary. He may have had contact with them but I could hardly think that this amounted to `dealing or seeking to deal` with the government or a public body.
 19.In the case of 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP 
, Wee Chong Jin CJ held, in reference to the presumption of corruption under the Act (at p 198A): 
It is to be observed that the Act when it was enacted as Ordinance No 39 of 1960 replaced and repealed the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance which was enacted as Ordinance No 41 of 1937. In the 1937 Ordinance the presumption section (s 5) raised the presumption where the gratification was from a person or agent of a person `holding or seeking to obtain a contract` from the Government or any department thereof. In my judgment the intention of the legislature in substituting `dealing` for `contract` is manifestly to widen the scope of the presumption having regard to the long title of he Act - `An Act to provide for the more effectual prevention of corruption` - and having regard to the difficulty of proving corruption by a public servant in the discharge of his public duties. In my judgment, the expression `any dealing with the Government or any department thereof` means `any matter with the Government or any department thereof`.
 20.In line with the above cited passage, in my opinion, in determining whether or not a person is dealing or seeking to deal with the `Government or a department thereof or a public body`, one has to look at the true essence and purpose of the dealing. In other words, one has to look at the end result which the deal between the person and the government or public body seeks to achieve. In previous cases where it was held that the giver of the gratification was seeking to deal or indeed dealt with the government or a public body (see 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP 
, 
 Chew Chee Sun v PP 
, 
 PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan 
 and 
 Yuen Chun Yii v PP 
), the ultimate aim of the giver was to procure a benefit from the government or public body, although not necessarily at their expense. Usually, this giver sought to establish a relationship, contractual or otherwise, with the relevant government or public body. A typical example would be the case of 
 PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan 
, where an official of the government (in the form of an army officer) gave information to a hawker in order that he could win the tender for a hawker stall within an army camp. In return, a gratification was given by him to the officer. In the present case, the factual scenario was quite the opposite. Not only was Yap, the giver, not seeking to deal with the government, instead, if he was dealing at all, he was only dealing with an individual, Gay, who was his client, and to whom he owed an obligation to represent him in court. Yap`s ultimate aim was not to establish a relationship with the government or a public body. Rather it was to establish a relationship with his client. He could then charge for services rendered by him in respect of this client.
 21.The prosecution, in the course of their appeal, tried to argue that Yap had dealings with the government. In particular, he had dealings with the police, the Attorney General`s Chambers and the courts. Further, he also had several dealings with the accused, who at the time was a police officer in the employment of the Singapore Police Force and working at the lock-up area at the subordinate courts. In view of what I have stated above, I could not accept these contentions. In addition, there was an inherent flaw in these arguments. Section 8 lists three factual criteria which have to be satisfied before the presumption can be invoked. In my view, this necessarily means that three separate and very distinct criteria have to be satisfied. If one takes the prosecution`s view that, when the receiver (in this instance the accused) receives a gratification from the giver (ie Yap), and this act constitutes the fact that the giver is dealing or seeking to deal with the government of a public body, then it is redundant to have to prove the third criteria at all. This cannot be what was intended by the legislature. As for the argument that, by representing Gay in court, therefore Yap was dealing with the government, I could not find it to be acceptable. As I have already explained, the representation of Gay by Yap in court was but an incidental event to the ultimate conclusion that Yap was dealing with Gay. In the course of this dealing, Yap had to deal with both the Attorney General`s Chambers and the courts. To say however that Yap, by virtue of this contact with the courts and the Attorney General`s Chambers, dealt with the government was too wide an interpretation which I was not prepared to adopt. Accordingly, I rejected the prosecution`s contentions on this issue.
 22.It was therefore my judgment that the presumption under s 8 of the Act should not and could not have been invoked in the present case. The trial judge arrived at the same conclusion, although her reasoning in this respect was flawed.
 b Whether, on the prosecution`s evidence, a prima facie case had been made out
 23.I next turned to consider the prosecution`s evidence to see whether their case, if believed, would establish a prima facie case so as to warrant calling for the defence of the accused. This would also answer the question of whether the trial judge erred when she held that the prosecution had not discharged their burden of proof at the close of their case. As a starting point, it was useful to note that the 
 Haw Tau Tua 
 principle only required that I assume the prosecution`s evidence as correct and true at this stage. In doing so, I was as well-placed as the trial judge to draw any necessary inferences from the facts and circumstances of the case: see 
 PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan 
. I also found it unnecessary to repeat the law in this area, for they were now well established: see 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
  and 
 Yuen Chun Yii v PP 
.
 24.The trial judge, in turning her mind to consider whether the prosecution had made out a prima facie case, first reiterated the elements which they had to prove to discharge their burden. At [para ] 17 and 18 of her grounds of decision, she held: 
17 In order to establish a prima facie case, the prosecution had to prove the following elements:
 
(a) that the accused received $500 from Yap in April 1995; 
(b) that the $500 was a reward for introducing Gay to Yap; 
(c) that there was a corrupt element in this transaction; and 
(d) that the accused received the $500 with a corrupt intent
 
18 The law in relation to the standard of proof at the close of the prosecution`s case is trite. I was mindful of the standard and I proceeded on the assumption that the facts stated in Yap`s statement were accurate.
 25.She then held that the first and second elements of the offence of corruption under s 5(a)(i) of the Act had been satisfied. This was uncontroversial. Clearly, both elements had been fulfilled and established on the basis of Yap`s statement which the prosecution tendered as their evidence. Accordingly, I wasted no time in re-examining the trial judge`s decision in this respect.
 26.The problem arose however when one examined the trial judge`s decision in relation to the third and fourth elements of the offence, namely the corrupt element and corrupt intent criteria. She found that these elements had not been satisfied. In summary, she held that it was significant that the accused came to know of Gay in his personal capacity. Thus, he did not abuse his position to secure a benefit for himself. She also pointed out that, although the accused was a police officer, this did not preclude him from receiving some money for an act which had no connection or causal link with his job as a police officer in the subordinate courts. In her opinion, the receipt of the money would only be wrong if, to quote her, `the accused had received the $500 as a reward for or as an inducement to be influenced in the discharge of his duty`. She held that there was no evidence to support such an allegation. As she pointed out (at [para ] 30 of the grounds of decision): 
From Yap`s statement, it is clear that the $500 was a reward for the introduction and nothing more. There is not an iota of evidence from which it can be inferred that Yap intended to produce the result that the accused would be obligated to him in the future, and that he would be inclined to act contrary to his duty, if and when he was ever requested to so act. On the evidence, I also took the view that the accused was in no position to show or refrain from showing favour or disfavour to Yap. There could thus be no compromise or disregard of his duty
 27.Finally, in response to the prosecution`s contentions that the manner in which the accused asked for the money was surreptitious, she replied at [para ] 31 of the grounds of decision: 
Turning now to the circumstances of the payment referred to by the DPP. She submitted that the manner in which the accused asked for the money was surreptitious. By this she elaborated that he had not openly asked for the money from Yap but instead indirectly hinted at it by asking how much he had charged Gay. She also added that the $500 was paid in cash and not reflected in Yap`s account. In my view, there is nothing sinister in the accused having hinted to an `introduction fee` as opposed to having asked for it outright. The fact that it was paid in cash in neither here nor there. $500 is after all a small amount. Lastly, with regard to the non-entry of the payment in Yap`s account, I failed to see how the accused could be affected by that. I therefore did not agree that these factors justified a conclusion of bribery.
 28.With great respect, I thought that the trial judge erred in coming to her conclusion that the prosecution had not proven a prima facie case which warranted calling the accused`s defence. In my view, the prosecution had in fact shown that a prima facie case of corruption had been proved, having regard to the burden they had to satisfy in order to discharge their legal obligation. In particular, it was also my opinion that the accused`s defence and explanations were very much desired to clarify certain things which would otherwise work against him. I shall explain.
 29.First, the trial judge thought that it was significant that Gay was introduced to the accused through Gay`s father`s business associate. I agreed. By itself, this fact did not raise any queries. Not only that, it was also evidence that the accused might have known Gay in his personal capacity, and so not abused his position as a police officer as a result. However, where I thought that the trial judge erred was her failure to consider that the introduction took place at the lock-up area of the subordinate courts. Gay was brought there by his father`s business associate. On this basis, it could equally be reasonably inferred that had the accused not been a police officer in the lock-up area of the subordinate courts, he would not have been introduced to Gay, notwithstanding that he was introduced to Gay by an outsider (meaning Gay`s father`s business associate). In addition, there was also no evidence that the accused knew Gay`s father`s business associate personally, and so it could also be possible that the accused knew him through his capacity as a police officer.
 30.I found the place of introduction particularly unusual. Why, of all places, would the introduction take place in the lock-up area where the accused was working? After all, that was a place where those who were detained in the courts had contact with the police personnel in the subordinate courts. It was therefore arguable, as the prosecution contended, that the accused could only have known Gay in his professional capacity. This would point to the corrupt element when Yap subsequently paid the accused for this introduction, for it could not be discounted that the accused was acquainted with Gay only because he was a police officer. There was every likelihood that Gay`s father`s business associate brought him to meet the accused there because he was a police officer and could probably be able to help him. Without the accused`s defence, I felt inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the prosecution. Of course it was always open to the accused to argue the contrary, in that he would have known Gay personally anyway, regardless of whether he was working in the lock-up area or not. However, until his defence is called, no one would know. Accordingly, in the light of the prosecution`s argument that the accused knew Gay in his professional capacity, and taking into account the circumstances of the introduction, I was of the view that the prosecution had shown that there was an element of surreptitiousness by which the accused came to know Gay.
 31.The trial judge emphasised the fact that there was no evidence which showed that the money the accused received was a reward for the introduction of clients to Yap. I could not agree. In this respect, it was particularly pertinent to note the defence of the accused. His defence was not that he received Yap`s money but did not receive it corruptly, rather it was that he did not receive any money at all. Thus, if the prosecution`s case was believed (ie that the accused did receive money), then the only logical and reasonable conclusion to be drawn was that he received the money corruptly. In other words, he possessed a corrupt intent. Why else would he deny receiving the money, if he had nothing to hide? In fact, this was precisely the prosecution`s case, and they sought to prove it by relying on Yap`s statement. In the light of this statement, on the assumption that the prosecution`s version of the facts was right, the accused could only be guilty of corruptly accepting money as a reward for introducing clients to Yap.
 32.Yap, in his statement, made it clear that the accused had hinted at money in return for the clients he introduced to him. The trial judge felt this was inconsequential. With respect, this could not be correct. In my judgment, the circumstances surrounding the request for money showed that the accused expected to be paid for his introduction. The accused hinted in a subtle manner at money, and received an amount, albeit a small amount, in cash which he did not disclose to anyone, including his own employer, the Singapore Police Force. In fact, he allegedly did so several times. At the trial, he then denied receiving any money at all. If the accused disputed these allegations, it was up to him to rebut them. Having considered the prosecution`s evidence in detail, I was of the view that there was justification for their argument that the accused`s conduct was consistent with the fact that he was attempting to cover up his actions because he knew he had done something which he should not have done. Corruption can come in all forms and ways, and the present case appeared to be a typical scenario of a person who, after soliciting a gratification for his work, was now trying to deny it all. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the prosecution had shown a prima facie corrupt element in the transaction when Yap paid the accused for his introduction. It was up to the accused now to show that his actions were not what they appeared to be.
 33.It was clear, relying on Yap`s statement, that he had given money to the accused on several occasions for the introduction of clients. Unfortunately, the trial judge failed to take this fact into account at all. The relevant parts of Yap`s statement read: 
After one or two clients that [the accused] introduced to me, he remarked that my fee was very high. This was followed by an introduction fee of 10% per client arranged between us. However, I am unable to recall whether he was the one who suggested this to me, or I made this offer to him. I estimate that I had given him introduction fee on 3 or 4 occasions.
 34.In my view, this passage by itself indicated some suspicious and sneaky conduct on the accused`s part. The payment to the accused was not a one-off payment, nor was it for a variety of things. The payments, consistent as they were, appeared to be for the constant and continuing introduction of clients to Yap. I could not agree with the trial judge that the accused was merely `moonlighting`. The suspicion that the payment were bribes was reinforced when one took account of the fact that such payments were then labelled as `introduction fees`. Insofar as the relevant inference was concerned, I was of the view that it could only be that this was a concealment of the substance of the payments. In my opinion, without the benefit of hearing the accused`s defence, Yap`s statement said it all, and that was that the accused received money from Yap corruptly. Having said that, I bore in mind that the accused had not had the opportunity to be heard.
 35.Finally, and probably most significantly, I could not disregard the fact that the accused was, all this while when he allegedly received payments from Yap, a police officer employed by the Singapore Police Force. As the prosecution quite rightly pointed out, the accused, being a police officer, was part of the system of administration of justice in Singapore that strives to be fair at all times. He was well aware of his duty to serve in the interests of justice. Thus, when he placed himself in the unenviable position of appearing to have abused his position as a police officer, as he did in the instant case, by getting to know clients who needed legal representation and then introducing them to Yap in return for a reward, monetary or otherwise, it was not unreasonable to infer that he thereby breached his duty as a police officer and acted corruptly for his self interest. It was up to him to explain his actions. The accused was not presumed guilty, rather, in my judgment the prosecution had made out their case which warranted calling for the defence`s rebuttal to the allegations.
 36.In the circumstances, I found that the prosecution had shown a prima facie case which warranted the accused being called upon for his defence. There were a number of surreptitious facts which required explanations, the failure to explain which would be detrimental to the accused. In the light of the above, I made the order allowing the prosecution`s appeal and remitted the case back to the court below for the accused`s defence to be called.",1997-10-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The applicant in this case, Mr Jonathan Michael Caplan QC, applied to be admitted to practise as an advocate and solicitor on behalf of the appellant in MA 91/97. Having heard the submissions of his counsel and having heard also the submissions of the Deputy Public Prosecutor and counsel appearing on behalf of the Law Society, I dismissed the motion for admission. I now set forth my reasons in writing.
 2.
 The facts of MA 91/97
The appellant in MA 91/97 is one Nomura Taiji, a Japanese national (the appellant). The appellant faced three charges in the district court of abetting one Okada Sadako, also a Japanese national, in fraudulently using as genuine a forged document purporting to be a Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB) bank draft for the sum of ¥1.27 trillion (S$16 billion). These charges were brought under s 467 read with ss 471 and 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Two out of the three charges were proceeded with whilst the remaining third charge was stood down. The appellant was jointly tried on these two charges with four other accused persons in a trial which lasted 54 days. He was convicted of both charges and sentenced to two four-year terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. He declined to have the third charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing and claimed trial to this third charge as well. He is presently on bail pending the appeal.
 3.The facts of the appellant`s case were as follows. In 1992 the appellant met one Okada Sadako (Okada), a woman who made public claims to being the illegitimate daughter of the late Emperor Hirohito of Japan. Okada claimed that the late emperor had left her a bequest of ¥13.97 trillion which was kept at DKB and which bequest had become due to her on the emperor`s death in 1989. Okada had in her possession what purported to be a DKB bank draft for the sum of ¥1.27 trillion (S$16 billion), which sum she said represented part of the accumulated interest on her inheritance of ¥13.97 trillion. This was the exhibit marked P12 in the court below.
 4.Okada claimed to be experiencing difficulty in obtaining access to her inheritance. In December 1995 she asked the appellant for a loan in order to travel to Singapore, London and the United States. She apparently hoped to borrow even larger sums of money from various people and organisations in these countries. The appellant gave Okada money totaling ¥5m on three occasions between December 1995 and January 1996.
 5.Using the money obtained from the appellant, Okada travelled to Singapore and, in the company of other persons, approached three banks in Singapore with the document P12.
 6.In early March 1996 Okada, who was then in Japan, was told that the Singapore branch of the Republic National Bank of New York (RNB) had processed the bank draft and that the funds were ready to be credited into her account in Singapore. Okada set off for Singapore together with the appellant and other persons. Their group of six was arrested in Singapore upon arrival.
 7.The act of abetment alleged in the three charges against the appellant was said to be constituted by the loan of moneys to Okada (totaling ¥5m) on three occasions between December 1995 and January 1996.
 8.In the trial below, the appellant sought to show in his defence that the ¥5m given to Okada constituted, not a loan, but a gift to someone he believed to be a genuine member of the Imperial family. He also sought to show that he did not have the necessary mens rea for the offence because he had actually believed Okada`s claims to being the daughter of Emperor Hirohito; he had also believed that the purported DKB bank draft for ¥1.27 trillion (exh P12) was genuine; he had not known that Okada was seeking to encash P12 but had believed that she was merely having its authenticity confirmed.
 9.The district judge disbelieved the appellant`s defence and convicted him of the two charges proceeded with by the prosecution.
 10.
 The relevant considerations under s 21(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed)
Before I give the reasons for my rejection of Mr Caplan`s application for admission, it will be useful to set out the principles which I bore in mind when considering the application.
 11.Mr Caplan`s application was made pursuant to s 21 of the Legal Profession Act. Under s 21(1), the court 
may for the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who - 
(a) holds her Majesty`s Patent as Queen`s Counsel; 
(b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and 
(c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.
 12.In 
Price Arthur Leolin v A-G & Ors
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 972
 , the Court of Appeal has set out the relevant considerations to be borne in mind by the court when deciding whether the criteria set out in s 21 of the Legal Profession Act has been satisfied in an application for admission of a Queen`s Counsel. That judgment went into some detail; and it would be superfluous for me to quote verbatim from the judgment. I think it will be sufficient to say, by way of summary, that s 21(1) spells out a three-stage test. At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen`s Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for the court`s discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, the applicant has to satisfy the court of his suitability for admission.
 13.If, however, admission is being sought for the purpose of a criminal case, matters do not end with the three-stage test I have just described. The criteria for admission of Queen`s Counsel in criminal cases was made even stricter this year, with the insertion of a new s 21(1A). This section, which became effective on 1 January 1997, reads as follows: 
The court shall not admit a person under this section in any criminal case unless the court is satisfied that there is a special reason to do so.
 14.The reasons for imposing stricter criteria for admission in criminal cases was explained by the Minister for Law during the second reading of the relevant amendment bill in Parliament. The minister pointed out, in particular, that since English criminal law and procedure differed quite substantially from ours, Queen`s Counsel would not usually be familiar with our criminal justice system. Asked to define what he thought might be `special reasons` for admitting Queen`s Counsel in criminal cases, he stated that he thought it better for such definitions to be left to the courts. He did add, however, that if he were pressed `to indicate an example` of such `special reasons`, 
there could be a criminal case where an important constitutional law issue arises as to whether some constitutional rights have been breached, or whether the regulations or the Act under which the person is being charged raises the question of conformity with some provisions of the Constitution. So it then becomes not just a criminal case on the particular set of facts, but broader and more fundamental questions may be raised, and one can argue that this could be a `special reason`.
 15.An example of the sort of case the minister might have been referring to can be found in 
Re How William Glen QC
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 474
 . This application was heard before the introduction of s 21(1A), but its facts are still instructive. The applicant in this case sought admission for the purpose of appearing on behalf of four appellants in their appeal to the High Court against convictions sustained in the magistrate`s court under ss 3 and 4(2) of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338). The appellants had been fined for these convictions. They intended to challenge on appeal the validity of the ministerial order made under the Act: in particular, they intended to argue that the order violated the right to religion enshrined in article 15 of the Constitution. The application for admission was allowed by the judge who felt that far more was at stake in the appeal than `the fines imposed by a magistrate`: 
What is in issue is the validity of governmental action in making Order No 123 - a judicial review of the order in a broad sense of the term on the ground that it is ultra vires the Constitution. Questions relating to fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution inevitably will be brought up in the appeal.
 16.Examples of `special reasons` are of course not confined to cases with constitutional implications. There may well be other cases where the verdict holds significant repercussions not just for the individual accused but also for the way in which an entire section of the population orders their daily lives or the conduct of their business. An example of this sort of case can be found in the case of 
 Re Sir Allan David Green QC 
 (OM 20/96). Again, the application here was actually heard before the introduction of s 21(1A), but as with 
 Re How William Glen QC 
, I think the facts are nevertheless instructive. In this case the applicant sought admission for the purpose of appearing in an appeal by the appellant, a local lawyer, against his conviction in the district court on a charge under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241). The charge alleged that the appellant had acted in conjunction with a condemned prisoner (A) in corruptly soliciting for A`s family a gratification of $100,000 from the son of his former co-accused (B), on account of A making a signed statement to the effect that B had been innocent of the drug trafficking charge of which they had both been convicted. It was contended that the appeal raised difficult questions of construction of the relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It was also contended that this was an unusual case because it did not involve the normal situation of an accused demanding payment in return for a favour: the appellant in this case had received no moneys himself and claimed that he had merely acted in the capacity of A`s lawyer by passing on a message. The appellant asserted that, viewed in such a context, his conduct could not be seen as being `corrupt` within the meaning of s 5 of the Act. The application for admission was allowed by the judge who held that the issues raised as to the construction of the relevant statutory provisions were sufficiently difficult and complex to warrant the appearance of Queen`s Counsel. The judge also felt that determination of the issues raised by the appellant `could have far reaching implications for the legal profession of which the appellant is a member`.
 17.I should say at this juncture that I do not intend to attempt in these written grounds a lengthy exposition on the sort of factors which may qualify as `special reasons` under the section. I have given the above two examples in an effort to illustrate the sort of factors which may be treated by the courts as `special reasons` under s 21(1A). The list of such factors is one which will have to be developed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the particular circumstances of any individual case. I wish only to add that, in any application where admission of Queen`s Counsel is being sought for the purpose of a criminal case, the affidavit in support of the application must state with particularity the factors which, according to the applicant, qualify as `special reasons` for allowing admission.
 18.
 The present application
I have examined the relevant considerations under ss 21(1) and 21(1A) in some detail because they served as the background against which Mr Caplan`s application was determined.
 19.Mr Edmond Pereira, appearing on behalf of Mr Caplan, contended firstly that MA 91/97 raised issues of law of sufficient difficulty and complexity to warrant admission of a Queen`s Counsel. Three such issues were enumerated: (a). the question of the weight which the district judge should have placed on that part of Okada`s evidence which was favourable to the appellant, given that Okada`s credit had been impeached by the prosecution;
 (b). the question of the weight which should have been accorded to the appellant`s statement made under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code, given the appellant`s claims as to having been misinformed about the meaning of the English word `encash`; and
 (c). the question of the weight which should have been given to the expert evidence regarding Okada`s state of mind.
 20.I agreed with the DPP, however, that the above questions were really factual in nature and concerned, in the main, the district judge`s evaluation of the evidence before him. In respect of the question of Okada`s evidence, for example, as the DPP pointed out, there is established case law regarding the manner in which a trial court should treat the evidence of a witness whose credit has been impeached. Briefly, the mere fact that a witness`s credit has been impeached does not necessarily mean that all his evidence will be disregarded: the court still has to scrutinise the whole of his evidence in order to determine which aspects are true and which should be disregarded. In the context of MA 91/97, therefore, what counsel for the appellant would have to do would be to persuade the High Court that those aspects of Okada`s evidence which favoured the appellant`s story were not given the weight they deserved by the district judge. I could not see that there would be any complicated legal reasoning called for in such an exercise. The same argument applied to the other two questions said to constitute difficult issues of law.
 21.Mr Pereira also contended that the facts of the case against the appellant were of such complexity as to require elucidation through the expert court craft of a Queen`s Counsel. With respect, however, based on the information given in the affidavit filed by counsel and the petition of appeal exhibited therein, it seemed to me that the facts of this case were no more complex than many of the cheating cases heard regularly in the district courts. It is true that the trial below lasted 54 days but this in itself did not suffice as an indication of factual complexity. As the DPP pointed out, it was a joint trial of five accused persons (including the appellant), none of whom spoke English. The key prosecution witness, Okada, also did not speak English and was obliged to testify with the aid of a Japanese interpreter. The trial was further prolonged by the fact that four out of the five accused acted in person; and the district judge had constantly to give them guidelines about the parameters of permissible cross-examination of witnesses.
 22.In my judgment, therefore, counsel appearing for the appellant in MA 91/97 really has the task of sifting through the evidence adduced in the trial below and persuading the High Court that sufficient evidence exists in support of the appellant`s defence. Without in any way underestimating the skill and hard work which will no doubt be expended on counsel`s part, I must agree with the DPP that it is not a task of such magnitude as to require the expertise of a Queen`s Counsel. I think there must be numerous local criminal lawyers who are more than equal to the challenge of such a task; and I would include amongst them Mr Pereira himself.
 23.It should also be pointed out that, insofar as the requirements of s 21(1A) were concerned, the affidavit in support of this application did not specify what factors there might be in the appellant`s case which could be said to constitute `special reasons` for allowing Mr Caplan`s admission. On a perusal of the petition of appeal exhibited in the affidavit, I was unable to discern any such special reasons. As I indicated earlier, this seemed to me to be a fairly standard sort of cheating case. The affidavit did make mention of the fact that the appellant was a wealthy and respectable Japanese national. It was not said whether this was intended to be relied on as a special reason for allowing the admission of a Queen`s Counsel. Certainly I did not think that it could be regarded as a special reason under s 21(1A).
 24.In concluding, I wish only to add that Mr Caplan`s experience and qualifications were never in doubt. Indeed, I recall that he appeared before me in 
Cheam Tat Pang & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 541
 , and I found his assistance in that case invaluable. My reasons for rejecting the present application for admission were entirely related to the nature and circumstances of the case, which in my view failed to meet the criteria laid down in ss 21(1) and 21(1A) of the Legal Profession Act.",1997-11-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

(delivering the judgment of the court): 
 Introduction 
 1.There are 14 appeals before us, and all of them were brought by Mr Tang Liang Hong (`Mr Tang`), the appellant. The respondents to these appeals are the various parties named below.
 2.First, there is CA 63/97, in which Mr Tang appeals against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J refusing, among other things, to recuse himself from hearing all the actions brought against Mr Tang by the respondents and all applications connected therewith, and to set aside (i) the order joining Madam Teo Siew Har (`Madam Teo`), who is Mr Tang`s wife, as the second defendant in all those actions and the worldwide Mareva injunctions against Mr Tang and Madam Teo respectively made on 27 January 1997, and (ii) the order appointing a receiver over the assets of Mr Tang and Madam Teo made on 17 February 1997. The respondents in this appeal are Mr Lee Kuan Yew (`Mr Lee`) and BG Lee Hsien Loong (`BG Lee`). This appeal arose from the action instituted by Mr Lee and BG Lee in Suit No 1116 of 1996.
 3.Next, we have a group of 12 appeals comprising CA 64 and 111-121 of 1997, in which Mr Tang appeals against (i) the decision of Goh Joon Seng J striking out his defence in each of the 12 actions before the learned judge (including the action in Suit No 1116 of 1996) and entering interlocutory judgment against him in each of those actions, and (ii) the decision of Chao Hick Tin J assessing damages awarded to the respondents in those actions. In these appeals, the respondents are as follows: (a). Mr Lee and BG Lee in CA 64 and 117 of 1997 arising from Suit Nos 1116 of 1996 and 172 of 1997 respectively;
 (b). Mr Lee alone in CA 111, 118 and 119 of 1997 arising from Suit Nos 2523 of 1996, 181 of 1997 and 182 of 1997 respectively;
 (c). Mr Goh Chok Tong (`Mr Goh`) in CA 112 and 120 of 1997 arising from Suit Nos 2524 of 1996 and 187 of 1997 respectively;
 (d). RADM Teo Chee Hean (`RADM Teo`), Messrs Ch`ng Jit Koon (`Mr Ch`ng`), Ow Chin Hock (`Dr Ow`), Chin Harn Tong (`Mr Chin`), Ker Sin Tze (`Dr Ker`) and Seng Han Thong (`Mr Seng`) in CA 113 and 121 of 1997 arising from Suit Nos 2525 of 1996 and 188 of 1997 respectively; and
 (e). BG Lee, Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (`Dr Tan`) and Mr Lee Yock Suan in CA 114, 115 and 116 of 1997 respectively arising from Suit Nos 70, 76 and 82 of 1997.
 4.Finally, we have CA 135/97 in which Mr Tang appeals against (i) the decision of Lai Kew Chai J striking out the defence of Mr Tang in the action brought against him by Mr Goh on the ground that Mr Tang had no reasonable defence and entering interlocutory judgment against him in favour of Mr Goh, and (ii) the decision of Chao J assessing the quantum of damages awarded to Mr Goh. In this appeal, only Mr Goh is the respondent. This appeal arose from Suit No 244 of 1997 instituted by Mr Goh against Mr Tang.
 5.
 Parties
A helpful description of the parties involved in the proceedings and the offices they hold or their occupations has been given by Chao Hick Tin J in his judgment (reported in 
[1997] 3 SLR 91
) which we respectfully adopt. As the learned judge rightly said, and we agree, the standings of the parties is a pertinent consideration in the assessment of damages in defamation.

 Proceedings below
Each of the actions brought against Mr Tang was in respect of a libel or slander made by Mr Tang. The earliest of the actions, namely, Suit No 1116 of 1996, arose in these circumstances.
 9.In May 1996 or thereabouts there was considerable public controversy on the discounts offered by Hotel Properties Ltd (`HPL`) to certain early purchasers of apartments in two condominiums which were then under construction, namely, 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
. HPL is a public company with its shares quoted on The Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd. Among those purchasers who enjoyed the `early bird discounts` were Mr Lee and BG Lee who each purchased an apartment in each of the condominiums. Their purchases at discounted prices came to the notice of Mr Goh who then directed an investigation to be carried out by the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, and the Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Mr Koh Beng Seng. After completing the investigation Dr Hu presented his findings to Parliament which cleared both Mr Lee and BG Lee of any impropriety concerning the purchases of the apartments. Both Mr Lee and BG Lee each also gave a full account in Parliament of the circumstances as to how they came to purchase the apartments. They also handed over to charities whatever discounts they had received. Thus, the matter was put to rest.
 10.However, in the issue of a Chinese language magazine 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
 published on 2 June 1996 there appeared an article which referred to the receipt of `early bird discounts` by Mr Lee and BG Lee in respect of their purchases of the apartments at 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
. The magazine is published in Hong Kong with a circulation in Singapore. The article concluded with certain remarks attributed to Mr Tang who had been interviewed by a reporter of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
. An English translation of the remarks is as follows: 
This matter should be referred to professional agencies such as the Commercial Affairs Department or the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. The reports put up by them will be more convincing to the people. Koh Beng Seng and Finance Minister Richard Hu are after all not experts in this field.
 11.Mr Lee and BG Lee took exception to those remarks and demanded an apology from the editor, publisher and printer of the magazine and also Mr Tang and commenced an action in Suit No 1116 of 1996 against all of them. There are four defendants to that action, and three of them, namely, the editor, publisher and printer of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
, tendered their apology and the apology was also published in 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
. They also paid to Mr Lee and BG Lee each damages in the sum of $450,000.
 12.Mr Tang defended the action. He did not deny making those remarks. His substantive defences were: first, the offending words were not defamatory; second, they were said on an occasion of qualified privilege; and third, what he said was a fair comment on a matter of public interest. While these proceedings were in progress, other events occurred which gave rise to the 12 other actions being brought against Mr Tang by the respondents. We now turn to these events.
 13.In December 1996 the government announced that a Parliamentary General Election would be held on 2 January 1997 and that the nomination day would be 23 December 1996. Mr Tang was one of the candidates of the Workers Party (`WP`) contesting at the Group Representational Constituency (`GRC`) of Cheng San. The PAP team contesting in that GRC was led by Mr Lee Yock Suan. Mr Goh and Mr Lee were gravely concerned about Mr Tang entering the election and both of them decided to participate in the PAP`s campaign for Cheng San. The PAP leaders spoke out against Mr Tang, calling him a Chinese chauvinist, and said that he was an anti-Christian and anti-English educated Chinese. Mr Tang denied these allegations and said that the PAP were deliberately saying these to scare the electorate.
 14.On 28 December 1996 Mr Tang`s solicitors sent a letter to Mr Goh and Mr Lee demanding a retraction and apology for calling him a Chinese chauvinist. This prompted an instant reply from their solicitors rejecting the demand and inviting Mr Tang to sue their clients.
 15.On 30 December 1996 in an interview given to the 
 The Straits Times 
 reporter, Mr Ahmad Osman, Mr Tang was asked whether he was going to sue the PAP leaders for calling him an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist, and he said the following: 
Of course I am going to sue them. Not only that, I am going to lodge a police report against them for criminal offence. They are telling lies. They are defaming, assassinating my character. They concocted lies and go on television and spread the lies. I am not going to do it now. I have no time. What is the hurry? No need to hurry.
 He further added: 
Their logic is if I don`t come to deny, then I am admitting it. What kind of logic are they talking about? I hope voters will understand this kind of situation. The PAP say that they are people of good character. They are resorting to this `below-the-belt` hitting tactic. What character are they talking about.
 16.On the same day the solicitors acting for Mr Goh and Mr Lee wrote to Mr Tang demanding a full public retraction on what he had said. He refused. In consequence, three actions were brought against him: Suit No 2523 of 1996 by Mr Lee, Suit No 2524 of 1996 by Mr Goh and Suit No 2525 of 1996 by RADM Teo, Mr Ch`ng, Dr Ow, Mr Chin, Dr Ker and Mr Seng.
 17.Thereafter, at three WP rallies held separately on 31 December 1996, Mr Tang raised once again the purchases by Mr Lee and BG Lee of the apartments in 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
 from HPL. At the first rally at UOB Plaza, he said, among other things, the following in English: 
But I believe one of the issues they are afraid that I may raise is, once I enter Parliament, I may raise issue on HPL so whether this issue need to be looked in certain aspect like for instance what is the purpose of offering him the discount?
 At the second rally at Hougang Stadium he said, among other things, the following in Mandarin: 
We will be raising the issue on HPL. This is their death blow. Because of this, they are very excited and nervous. So they have fabricated a lot of rumours saying that I am a chauvinist, that I am against a certain religion.
 Then at the third rally at Hougang Avenue 7, he said the following in Mandarin: 
Why must they still try to stop us from entering Parliament? They are afraid that we will raise all sorts of problems in Parliament, including the sale of properties from HPL
 and the following in English: 
They are worried that the opposition party gets into Parliament to raise a lot of problems, including the HPL problem.
 These speeches formed the subject matter of Suit No 172 of 1997 brought by Mr Lee and BG Lee for damages for slander and also for libel.
 18.Then, on 1 January 1997, the eve of polling day, Mr Tang lodged two police reports. In one of them, he wrote: 
From 25 December 1996, the following persons, namely: 
(1) Goh Chok Tong 
(2) Teo Chee Hean 
(3) Lee Yiok Suan (sic) 
(4) Ow Chin Hock 
(5) Tony Tan 
(6) Ker Sin Tse (sic) 
(7) Chin Harn Tong 
(8) Ch`ng Jit Koon 
(9) Lee Kuan Yew 
(10) Seng Han Tong (sic) 
(11) Lee Hsien Loong
 
systematically on various occasions and on various dates alleged and made various statements to make or cause the public to believe the following: 
1 I am an anti-Chinese chauvinist; 
2 I am anti-English-educated; 
3 some of my statements will cause social and racial disharmony and disruption in Singapore.
 
The abovementioned statements and allegations are groundless and without factual basis and are intended to harm my reputation and to defame me.
 
As a result of their concerted actions and statements repeated over the mass-media, they: 
1 have incited certain groups of people to believe that I am an anti-Christian and anti-English-educated person; 
2 are likely to incite religious extremists to hate me and cause harm to me and members of my family; 
3 have also repeatedly challenged and provoked me to make statements in public which they say may cause social disorder in Singapore. 
 
 
I hereby request the police to investigate on an urgent basis
 19.Arising from this report, three actions were brought against Mr Tang namely: Suit No 70 of 1997 by BG Lee, Suit No 76 of 1997 by Dr Tan and Suit No 82 of 1997 by Mr Lee Yock Suan, each claiming damages for libel.
 20.Soon after the general election, on 4 January 1997 Mr Tang left Singapore. Subsequently, in a telephone interview given on 10 January 1997 to a journalist in Kuala Lumpur, which was published in 
 The Straits Times 
 on 11 January 1997, the following was reported: 
Mr Tang Liang Hong said last night besides fearing for his safety, he fled Singapore because he was concerned that he would be arrested by the authorities.
 
`They were building up this case against me. I could see where it was all heading. I wanted to leave Singapore and be given a chance to tell the world that I am not who they say I am.
 
Once I go back to Singapore, there is a possibility that I may be locked up and not be given a chance to defend myself,` he said.
 
The Workers` Party candidate for Cheng San GRC made these points in a telephone interview.
 
He again declined to reveal his whereabouts, adding that he might return to Singapore in a few days.
 
When told that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had given an assurance that he would not be arrested, he laughed, adding: `Do you think I should believe them?`
 
He said that many years ago Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had given some Nanyang University students a similar assurance. A few days later, some of them were arrested. Mr Tang, 61, said that he did not discount being arrested under the Internal Security Act, especially since he had been accused of playing `international` games.
 In respect of these statements made by Mr Tang, Mr Goh and Mr Lee each instituted proceedings against Mr Tang in Suit Nos 244 and 182 of 1997 respectively claiming damages for slander and libel.
 21.On 23 January 1997, Mr Tang gave a telephone interview to Mr Ahmad Osman again. Mr Tang said he was applying to strike out Suit Nos 2523 to 2525 of 1996 on the grounds that they constituted an abuse of the court process and accused the PAP leaders of using: 
[defamation] as a political weapon to squeeze me out from the political arena and to try and bury me with litigation politically, to bury me politically and financially.
 In an article carried by 
 The Straits Times 
 the following day, the relevant parts read: 
Defeated Workers` Party candidate Tang Liang Hong has applied for a court order to strike out three defamation suits filed against him by the Senior Minister, the Prime Minister
 
He described the suits against him for calling the PAP leaders liars during the recent General Election as an abuse of the court process claiming that the suits were being used as a political weapon to squeeze him out of the political area and to `bury him politically and financially`.
 22.In respect of these statements three actions were brought against Mr Tang: Suit No 181 of 1997 by Mr Lee, Suit No 187 of 1997 by Mr Goh and Suit No 188 of 1997 by RADM Teo, Mr Ch`ng, Dr Ow, Mr Chin, Dr Ker and Mr Seng.
 23.Following the commencement of these actions, the plaintiffs in each of the actions, except in Suit No 244 of 1997, on 27 January 1997 applied for and obtained an order joining Madam Teo as the second defendant in the actions, and a worldwide Mareva injunction restraining Mr Tang and Madam Teo from disposing of their assets up to the value of $11,200,000. They were also ordered to disclose their assets in and outside Singapore within five days, that is, by 4 February 1997. This order was not complied with. On 17 February 1997, the respondents again in each of the 12 actions obtained an order appointing a receiver over the assets of Mr Tang and Madam Teo pending the outcome of the actions.
 24.Under the receivership order, Mr Tang and Madam Teo were ordered to co-operate with and disclose their assets to the receiver by 24 February 1997. On 21 February 1997, they were given a further and final extension until 3 March 1997 to comply with the order of 27 January 1997 and the receivership order. However, on 3 March 1997 Mr Tang filed an application to disqualify Lai Kew Chai J and set aside the Mareva injunction and the receivership order in the 12 actions on the ground of apparent bias.
 25.The application was heard by Lai Kew Chai J in chambers on 5 March 1997 and was adjourned for hearing in open court on 10 March 1997. The application was dismissed with costs on an indemnity basis. It was further ordered by Lai Kew Chai J that Mr Tang`s counsel, Mr JB Jeyaretnam, should show cause why he should not be made personally liable to pay the costs of the unsuccessful application.
 26.On the same day after Mr Tang`s application to disqualify Lai Kew Chai J was dismissed, Mr Tang`s defences in the 12 of the defamation actions (ie all the actions except Suit No 244 of 1997) were struck out by Goh Joon Seng J for want of compliance with the terms as to discovery contained in cl 16 of the receivership order. Interlocutory judgments were entered against him with damages to be assessed by a judge in open court.
 27.There remained the action in Suit No 244 of 1997 which was instituted by Mr Goh. On 22 April 1997, Mr Tang`s defence in that suit was struck out by Lai Kew Chai J on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable defence. Interlocutory judgment was also entered with damages to be assessed.
 28.On 5 May to 8 May 1997, all the 13 actions came before Chao Hick Tin J for assessment of damages. In a reserved judgment (reported in 
[1997] 3 SLR 91
) the learned judge handed down his awards of damages in all the 13 actions.
 29.
 Preliminary objection - notices of appeal
Before we proceed further we should say a brief word on the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents in the 12 appeals, namely, CA 64 and 111-121 of 1997, which we disposed of at the hearing.
 30.In each of these appeals, the notice of appeal filed by Mr Tang was expressed to be an appeal against the order made by Goh Joon Seng J on 10 March 1997 striking out the defence and entering interlocutory judgment against Mr Tang and `the damages and costs ordered to be paid by [Mr Tang] on the 29th day of May 1997 following the assessment by Justice Chao Hick Tin pursuant to the Order by Justice Goh Joon Seng`. It is apparent from such notice that Mr Tang intended to appeal against the two decisions, namely: the decision of Goh J given on 10 March 1997 and the decision of Chao J given on 29 May 1997. Any doubt on the extent of such appeals was removed by the cases filed by Mr Tang in these appeals in which he sought to appeal against the two decisions. In this respect, Mr Tang was clearly in error; he could not, by one notice, appeal against two decisions given in two separate hearings by two different judges.
 31.It is perhaps helpful to advert to the circumstances in which this error arose. On 10 March 1997 there was before Goh Joon Seng J an application to strike out Mr Tang`s defence and consequently to enter interlocutory judgment against him in each of the 12 actions, namely: Suit Nos 1116 of 1996, 2523-2525 of 1996, 70 of 1997, 76 of 1997, 82 of 1997, 172 of 1997, 181-182 of 1997 and 187-188 of 1997 (`the 12 actions`). The applications were made pursuant to a term contained in the combined receivership order (which applied to all the 12 actions) that, in default of Mr Tang complying with the order for discovery contained in that order, the plaintiff or plaintiffs (as the case may be) would be at liberty to apply to strike out the defence of Mr Tang and enter judgment. Before Goh Joon Seng J it was not disputed that Mr Tang had not complied with the discovery order, and there was no valid ground advanced by or on behalf of Mr Tang as to why his defence should not be struck out. Accordingly, the learned judge pursuant to each application made an order that Mr Tang`s defence be struck out and interlocutory judgment be entered against Mr Tang. In fact, Goh Joon Seng J made 12 interlocutory orders in the 12 actions respectively.
 32.Soon thereafter, Mr Tang filed one notice of appeal headed as CA 64 of 1997 and intituled in the matter of the 12 actions wherein he purported to appeal against each order made by Goh Joon Seng J in each of the 12 actions. That obviously was wrong. He should have filed 12 separate notices of appeal against the 12 orders respectively. As a result, on 30 May 1997, the plaintiffs in these actions applied to strike out the notice of appeal. The matter came before Goh Joon Seng J on 30 May 1997. The learned judge refused to strike out the notice of appeal; instead, he ordered an amendment be made to the notice of appeal by deleting all references to the other actions, except Suit No 1116 of 1996, and gave leave to Mr Tang to file 11 fresh notices of appeal against the orders he made on 10 March 1997 in the other 11 actions, and extended the time of appeal against the order in each such action.
 33.Meanwhile, pursuant to the interlocutory judgment entered by Goh Joon Seng J, the matter of assessment of damages in the 12 actions and also in Suit No 244 of 1997 came on for hearing before Chao Hick Tin J on 5 May 1997 at which evidence as to damages was adduced before him. On 29 May 1997 Chao Hick Tin J delivered his judgment making awards of damages in favour of the plaintiffs respectively.
 34.On 12 June 1997, Mr Tang amended the notice of appeal in CA 64 of 1997 as directed by Goh Joon Seng J, and filed similar notices of appeal against the orders in the other 11 actions. In doing so he incorporated into each of the notices of appeal, including the amended notice of appeal in CA 64 of 1997, an appeal against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision on the assessment of damages. This was again wrong. At the early stage of the appeal, the solicitors for Mr Lee and BG Lee in CA 64 of 1997 objected to the inclusion of Chao Hick Tin J`s judgment in the record of appeal on the ground that there was no appeal against such decision. Mr Tang accepted the objection and removed the judgment from the record. Notwithstanding that, Mr Tang raised an argument against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision in his case filed in that appeal. As for the other appeals, the solicitors for the respondents at that preliminary stage did not object to the inclusion of Chao Hick Tin J`s judgment in the record of appeal. However, before us, nothing turns on this. In these 11 appeals, Mr Tang has also in his cases filed raised a similar argument against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision.
 35.Thus at the commencement of the hearing of these appeals a preliminary objection was raised by Mr Tan Kok Quan for Mr Lee and BG Lee, the respondents in CA 64/97. His contention, shared by the counsel for the respondents in the other appeals, was that the notice of appeal filed by Mr Tang was only against the decision of Goh Joon Seng J and not against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision on assessment of damages. Mr Tang could not by one notice of appeal appeal against two decisions given in separate hearings before two separate judges. There was before this court no appeal against the decision of Chao Hick Tin J on the quantum of damages awarded, except in CA 135/97, which we shall discuss in a moment. Therefore, Mr Tang was precluded from raising any arguments against the assessment of damages made by Chao Hick Tin J, except in CA 135/97, and it followed that there was no need for the court to consider even the merits of Chao Hick Tin J`s decision in all these 12 appeals.
 36.Mr Charles Gray for Mr Tang, on the other hand, contended that the objection was a highly technical one. He argued that what was absent was a piece of paper in each of these 12 appeals against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision, but all the parties concerned were before the court and all were ready and equipped to argue fully on the quantum of damages. In fact, he pointed out that Mr Tan and all the counsel for the respondents respectively in resisting the appeals had in their respective cases set out their arguments at considerable length on the quantum of damages.
 37.In our opinion, there was clearly an error or defect in the notices of appeal filed by Mr Tang. Order 57 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 1996 states as follows: 
Notice of appeal may be given either in respect of the whole or in respect of any specified part of the judgment or order of the Court below; and every such notice must state whether the whole or part only, and what part, of the judgment or order is complained of, contain an address for service, and be signed by the appellant or his solicitor.
 Implicit in the rule, and also in Form 115 (prescribed by the rules for appeal), is that each notice of appeal can only relate to one judgment of the court below, at least where no leave to the contrary has been granted. The equivalent in the English Rules of Supreme Court is O 59 r 3(2) which provides: 
Notice of appeal may be given either in respect of the whole or in respect of any specified part of the judgment or order of the court below; and every such notice must specify the grounds of the appeal and the precise form of the order which the appellant proposes to ask the Court of Appeal to make.
 On this rule The Supreme Court Practice 1997 has the following commentary in para 59/3/14 at p 969: 
 Appeals against more than one order
 - 
 multiple notices of appeal
 - In 
 Hawes v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary
 (
 The Times
, 20 May 1993), the Court of Appeal held that separate notices of appeal are not required in respect of appeals against orders made 
 in the same proceedings at the same trial or hearing
. Thus, if during the course of a trial of one action several orders are made, the appellant can appeal against any one or more of them using only one notice of appeal, and multiple notices of appeal are no longer required in such a case. Where, however, an appellant wishes to appeal against orders made in different actions (even if tried together) a separate notice of appeal will be required in respect of each action. Likewise if orders are made in one action, but not at the same trial or hearing, separate notices of appeal will still be required.
 38.Reverting to the instant cases, what Mr Tang had done here was that he filed one notice of appeal appealing against two decisions, one by Goh Joon Seng J and the other by Chao Hick Tin J, which were given at separate hearings. That clearly he could not do.
 39.The objection raised by Mr Tan and the other counsel for the respondents is, no doubt, a technical one; nonetheless, it is valid objection. Rules of the court must be obeyed and complied with. Parties who initiate or resist any legal proceedings must comply with the rules. Ignorance or inadvertent omission of the rules is no excuse. Cases are many where parties are precluded from proceeding with their appeals for non-compliance with the rules. In 
John Puddicombe Wilkins & Ors v John Patrick Kenelm Wilkins & Anor
 
[1951] MLJ 80
 , an application for leave to appeal out of time arising from a mistake as to the law was dismissed by Thomson J of the High Court in Malaysia. Likewise, in 
Abdul Majeed v Yeo Chng Tay
 
[1964] MLJ 75
 , leave to appeal out of time due to the mistake of the legal advisor was refused by the Federal Court of Malaysia. More recently in 
Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 208
  
[1991] SLR 212
 , the notice of appeal against the order of the High Court here on ancillary matters was filed out of time because the solicitors involved had misread the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970. An application was then made to this court to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal, and the application was dismissed. Therefore, ordinarily, the failure to file a notice of appeal would be a serious impediment ( almost an insuperable one, depending on the circumstances of the case) to the prosecution of the appeal.
 40.In this case, however, having regard to the peculiar circumstances in which these appeals arose and the fact that none of the respondents were in any way prejudiced and their counsel had come fully prepared and equipped to argue on the issues involved, we disallowed the objection. We treated the failure to file proper notices of appeals against Chao Hick Tin J`s decision on assessment of damages in all the 12 actions as a mere irregularity which under the Rules of Court 1996 we are empowered to cure and decided to hear arguments on the issue of damages. In so doing, we gave leave to all the respondents, if they wished, to file additional documents on the issue of damages, together with, if any, a brief submission on that particular document that they wanted to put before us.
 41.There is just one more matter on the procedural aspect we should mention. This concerns CA 135/97 in which the notice of appeal was filed against the decision of Chao Hick Tin J on assessment of damages in Suit No 244 of 1997, but not against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J striking out Mr Tang`s defence on the ground that Mr Tang had no reasonable defence to the claim filed by Mr Goh. However, in the case filed in this appeal, Mr Tang raised a substantive argument against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J. This was yet another omission on the part of Mr Tang. In view of what we have held, we also gave leave to Mr Gray to regularise Mr Tang`s position in that appeal so that he could argue against both the striking out order made by Lai Kew Chai J and the quantum of damages assessed by Chao Hick Tin J. In fairness to Mr Gray, as counsel to Mr Tang, he had no part in the disorganised state of the paperwork occasioned and he was disarmingly penitent.
 42.
 The appeals
We now turn to the appeals proper. We propose to deal with them in this order. First, we shall consider CA 63/97, which is an appeal against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J refusing to recuse himself from hearing the 12 actions and applications relating thereto and to set aside certain interlocutory orders made by him. Next, we shall consider that part of the appeal in CA 135/97 which concerns the decision of Lai Kew Chai J striking out the defence of Mr Tang in Suit No 244 of 1997 on the ground that Mr Tang has no reasonable defence to the claim. Thirdly, we shall consider the group of appeals, CA 64, 111-113, 117-121 and 135 of 1997 on the quantum of damages, subject to one qualification, namely, that the issue of quantum of damages in CA 135/97 will not arise, if we hold that Mr Tang`s defence ought not to have been struck out. Finally, we shall consider the three CA 114-116 of 1997 on the quantum of damages, as there is a common point of law involved in these three appeals.
 43.
 CA 63/97 (respondents - Mr Lee and BG Lee)
The main issue raised in this appeal is whether there was any apparent bias on the part of Lai Kew Chai J in hearing and disposing of the various interlocutory applications which came before him. In order to consider this issue in the proper perspective it is necessary, at the risk of repetition, to advert once again to the application made by the SIC No 1502 of 1997 from which the appeal arose. By this summons Mr Tang applied to the learned judge for, inter alia, the following orders: (i) that he be disqualified from hearing all the 12 actions and any application connected therewith, (ii) that the order joining Madam Teo as the second defendant in all the 12 actions and the Mareva injunctions (and all ancillary orders arising therefrom) against Mr Tang and Madam Teo respectively be set aside, and (iii) that the order appointing the receiver over the assets of Mr Tang and Madam Teo also be set aside. The ground of the application was that there was an appearance of bias or apparent bias on the part of the learned judge. The learned judge dismissed the application and delivered his grounds of judgment on 21 March 1997, reported in 
[1997] 2 SLR 233
. This appeal is against that decision.
 44.In so far as the first prayer of the summons is concerned, ie that the learned judge be disqualified from hearing the 12 actions and applications connected therewith, it is no longer a live issue before us. Following Lai Kew Chai J`s decision, there were two important hearings. One was the hearing of the application by the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the 12 actions to strike out Mr Tang`s defences pursuant to the receivership order on the ground that he had failed to comply with the terms of the Mareva injunction and the receivership order as regards discovery of Mr Tang`s assets. That was before Goh Joon Seng J and he allowed the application and entered interlocutory judgment in each of the 12 actions. Unless and until the orders of Goh Joon Seng J are set aside, those orders concluded the issue of liability in all the 12 actions. The other hearing was the assessment of damages before Chao Hick Tin J, which was consequential on the orders made by Goh Joon Seng J. Chao Hick Tin J heard and assessed the quantum of damages in each of the 12 actions, and unless and until the orders of Chao Hick Tin J are set aside or varied, those orders finally concluded the 12 actions. Thus, there was no question of Lai Kew Chai J hearing the 12 actions or any application connected therewith.
 45.Essentially this appeal concerns the refusal of the second and third prayers of the summons, ie to set aside the interlocutory orders made by the learned judge. At the outset, Mr Gray impressed upon us that he was not in any way suggesting that there was any actual bias on the part of Lai Kew Chai J. What he was going to submit, he said, was that by reason of certain facts on which he relied there was an appearance of bias or an apparent bias, and this offended the cardinal principle that justice not only must be done, but must also be seen to be done. If he made good that submission, the Mareva injunctions and receivership order made by the learned judge were tainted, and were therefore void or voidable and should be set aside.
 46.
 Law on bias
There is really no dispute on the law which is well settled. A judge may be disqualified from hearing or determining a case or matter by reason of actual bias or apparent bias: see 8 
 Halsbury`s Laws of Australia 
, 1996, para 125-290 at 236,159. We are concerned with only apparent bias. The test to be applied in determining whether there is any apparent bias on the part of the tribunal hearing the case or matter in question has been settled by this court in 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
  at p 338, and it is this: would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant concerned is not possible. The court in laying down this test followed and adopted what Ackner LJ said in 
R v Liverpool City Justices, ex p Topping
 
[1983] 1 All E R 490
, 494: 
We conclude that the test to be applied can conveniently be expressed by slightly adapting the words of Lord Widgery CJ in a test which he laid down in 
 R v Uxbridge Justices, ex p Burbridge
 (1972) 
 Times
, 21 June and referred to by him in 
R v McLean, ex p Aikens
 
[1974] 139 JP 261
 at 266: would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible?
 47.In England, since the decision of the House of Lords in 
R v Gough
 
[1993] AC 646
, a more stringent test of apparent bias has been adopted. Lord Goff who delivered one of the main speeches of the House said, at p 670: 
In conclusion, I wish to express my understanding of the law as follows. I think it possible, and desirable, that the same test should be applicable in all cases of apparent bias, whether concerned with justices or members of other inferior tribunals, or with jurors, or with arbitrators Furthermore, I think it unnecessary, in formulating the appropriate test, to require that the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man; and in any event the court has first to ascertain the relevant circumstances from the available evidence, knowledge of which would not necessarily be available to an observer in court at the relevant time. Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias. Accordingly, having ascertained the relevant circumstances, the court should ask itself whether, having regard to those circumstances, there was a real danger of bias on the part of the relevant member of the tribunal in question, in the sense that he might unfairly regard (or have unfairly regarded) with favour, or disfavour, the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him
 Lord Woolf in his speech expressed (at p 671) his agreement with Lord Goff and said that the test is `whether there is a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of the alleged bias`.

 Evidence of bias
For the purpose of this appeal, it is not material which of the two tests we apply in determining this issue. Certainly Mr Gray in making his submissions on this issue does not consider the difference between the two tests as crucial or in any way material. He relies on the `reasonable suspicion test` rather than the `real danger` test. So do counsel for the respondents in all these appeals. It seems to us that whichever of the tests the court applies, the court must ascertain the relevant facts and circumstances on which the alleged apparent bias is founded.

Mr Gray`s contention of apparent bias is founded entirely on the following allegations made by Mr Tang which, he submits, we should take into account not singly but cumulatively. The allegations he relies upon are as follows: (i). Lai Kew Chai J had worked in the firm of Messrs Lee & Lee (of which Mr Lee was the founder) for many years, initially as a legal assistant and later as a partner, before he became a judge of the Supreme Court. Messrs Lee & Lee had advised Mr Lee and other members of his family on many matters in the past. As a member of Messrs Lee & Lee, the judge had a close working relationship with Mr Lee and other members of his family.
 (ii). The judge had acted in a variety of matters involving Mr Lee and other members of his family.
 (iii). It is widely known in Singapore society that the judge was, and still is, a close friend of the Lee family.
 (iv). The judge and Mrs Lai signed the contract for the purchase of their apartment in on the same day (ie 16 May 1995) as Mr Lee and BG Lee signed theirs, and this fact further evidenced the close ties between the judge and the Lee family.
 (v). Lai Kew Chai J`s decisions on certain interlocutory applications, most notably his decision to join Madam Teo as the second defendant, his granting of the Mareva injunctions against Mr Tang and Madam Teo respectively and his order appointing the receiver of their assets were highly extraordinary and unusual, thus giving rise to an inference of apparent bias. In fact, the orders were so extraordinary and unusual that a reasonable hypothetical observer would suspect bias.
 (vi). The judge was one of the `Early Bird Buyers`, and he and two others were parties who paid the lowest price for their apartments.
 50.Mr Gray also draws our attention to what he calls the `vituperative` terms which Lai Kew Chai J had directed at Mr Tang in his grounds of judgment. That, he said, reinforces the conclusion that this is a judge any reasonable rapporteur would immediately say would not appear to be able to view the case and the protagonists objectively.
 51.A claim that there is apparent bias on the part of a judge must be based on facts that are substantially true and accurate. The fact that an allegation of bias has been made against a judge is not enough; otherwise a party could secure a judge of his choice by merely alleging bias or apparent bias on the part of another or other judges. A judge is not obliged to withdraw based on facts which are inaccurate, false or devoid of substantiation. In this connection, it is helpful to refer to the case of 
Bainton v Rajski
 
[1992] 29 NSWLR 539
 where one of the litigants at the hearing of an appeal from an interlocutory order before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales sought to disqualify two of the appellate judges from hearing the appeal before them on the ground of an apprehension of bias. The application was rejected and both the judges decided to sit on hearing the appeal. Mahoney JA who was one of the two judges sought to be disqualified said, at p 541: 
It is accepted that justice must be done in fact and that the appearance of justice must be maintained. But that, and particularly the latter, does not require that, if a party alleges or even believes in the disqualifying facts alleged, the judge should withdraw. If that were so, the administration of justice and the rights of other parties would be governed by the allegation of or the belief in facts, however dishonest, paranoiac, unbalanced or honestly wrong.
 Much earlier, in the case of 
Re JRL, ex p CJL
 
[1986] 
161 CLR 342
 at p 352 Mason J (as he then was) of the High Court of Australia said: 
Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.
 52.It is therefore necessary to examine whether there was any factual basis for the allegations made by Mr Tang. We turn first to the allegations of close personal and professional relationships between Mr Lee and the judge referred to in items (i) to (iii) of ( 48 above. It is true that Lai Kew Chai J had worked in the firm of Messrs Lee & Lee for many years, first as a legal assistant, and later as a partner before he became a judge of the Supreme Court. But Mr Tang had adduced no evidence to substantiate his allegations that Lai Kew Chai J as a member of Messrs Lee & Lee had a close working relationship with Mr Lee and other members of his family. Mr Lee in his affidavit in reply refuted the allegations of Mr Tang and said that he did not have a working relationship of any sort with Lai Kew Chai J and that Lai Kew Chai J had never acted for or advised him on any legal or personal matters, while he was with Messrs Lee & Lee or otherwise. Mr Lee admitted that he was acquainted with Lai Kew Chai J, as he was with the other judges, but said that he and Lai Kew Chai J were not, and are not, close friends. Lai Kew Chai J in his grounds of judgment confirmed what Mr Lee said (see [para ] 18 of his grounds of judgment). What Mr Tang alleged was not supported by any shred of evidence, and there was really no factual basis for these allegations.
 53.It is also a fact that Mr Lee left the firm of Messrs Lee & Lee in 1959 and that was long before Lai Kew Chai J started to work there. Lai Kew Chai J himself, as at the date he made the interlocutory orders, had left the firm for some 16 years and has no connection whatsoever with or any interest, pecuniary or otherwise in that firm.
 54.The same argument of apparent bias based on Lai Kew Chai J`s former association with Messrs Lee & Lee was raised by Mr Gray before this court some five years ago in 
 Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew 
 (supra), and was there disposed of by the court in the following terms, at pp 338-339: 
the fact that the learned judge [Lai Kew Chai J] was with the firm of Messrs Lee & Lee for 13 years cannot possibly be a ground for any right-thinking person to form the opinion that he was biased towards the respondent [Mr Lee] who was the founder of that firm. At the time of the trial, the learned judge had left the firm for about nine years, and had no pecuniary or any other interests in the firm. In the discharge of his judicial functions, the learned judge must have dealt with numerous cases in which that firm acted either for plaintiffs or for defendants. Many of our judges before their appointments were partners of law firms, actively engaged in practice as advocates and solicitors. After their appointments to the bench and after a lapse of a reasonable period of time, they deal with case after case in which their former firms represented either the plaintiffs or the defendants. No one has ever suggested that a reasonable and right-thinking person could or would have reasonable suspicion that in those cases the judges would be biased.
 What was said there is equally applicable here and we hardly need to say more.
 55.It is said that Lai Kew Chai J and Mrs Lai on the one hand and Mr Lee and BG Lee on the other signed their respective agreements for the purchases of their respective apartments in 
 Nassim Jade 
 on the same day, ie 16 May 1995, and that was further evidence of the close tie or relationship between Lai Kew Chai J and Mr Lee. That, in our view, is a very tenuous assertion to make. All that can be said from the date appearing on the agreements is that the agreements signed by them bore the same date; it by no means proves that they signed the agreements 
 on the same day 
. As Lai Kew Chai J observed, and we agree with him entirely, developers generally sign sale and purchase agreements in batches and all the agreements comprised in the same batch are then dated by or on behalf of the developers on or about the date on which they were signed. In fact, of the 28 sale and purchase agreements appearing on the schedule exhibited in Mr Tang`s affidavit, 14 were signed during the period between 16 May and 19 May 1995. The fact that the agreements bore the same date in this case has no significance whatsoever, and certainly cannot reasonably give rise to an inference that Lai Kew Chai J and Mrs Lai on the one hand and Mr Lee and BG Lee on the other had been in consultation with each other as regards the purchases of their respective apartments in 
 Nassim Jade 
. In fact, at the time of their purchases Mr Lee and BG Lee did not even know that Lai Kew Chai J and Mrs Lai had also purchased or would be purchasing an apartment at 
 Nassim Jade 
. Nor, conversely, did Lai Kew Chai J and Mrs Lai at that time know of the purchases made or to be made by Mr Lee and BG Lee. This was deposed to by Mr Lee in his affidavit and confirmed by Lai Kew Chai J in his judgment.
 56.Next, we turn to the nature of the interlocutory orders made by Lai Kew Chai J. The complaint is that these orders are highly unusual and were granted in the absence of sufficient evidence. In particular, it is said that the granting of a worldwide Mareva injunction, a very draconian order, has never been made in a defamation action in any Commonwealth jurisdiction. The same criticism is made of the order appointing a receiver of the properties of Mr Tang and Madam Teo. Then there is the complaint that the order joining Madam Teo as the second defendant was made by the learned judge, even though she had played no part in her husband`s libel or slander of the respondents.
 57.We are quite surprised with such an argument being made at this stage. If the complaint is that the orders made by the learned judge are so extraordinary and unusual or the granting of such orders were not supported by sufficient evidence, the proper course for Mr Tang to take is to apply to set aside the orders or to appeal against them on the merits. The mere fact that the orders are so extraordinary and unusual does not give rise to a reasonable inference of an appearance of bias. Any suggestion that it does is quite untenable. Our judicial process would become most vulnerable, and it would be extremely easy for a dissatisfied litigant to allege suspicion of bias on the ground that the order made against him is so extraordinary and unusual. It may well be that a Mareva injunction has never been granted before judgment in a defamation action. But, in principle, the mere fact that it is a defamation action does not preclude the grant of such an injunction. The grant or refusal of a Mareva injunction depends on the circumstances of the case. The question at the end of the day is whether there is a real risk of dissipation of assets which is a pre-requisite that an applicant for such an injunction must satisfy: see 
Choy Chee Keen Collin v Public Utilities Board
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 604
 ; and 
Heng Holdings SEA Pte Ltd v Tomongo Shipping Co Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 547
 . Hence, the basis for the injunction was a real risk of dissipation of assets by Mr Tang and Madam Teo. The respondents in their application had deposed to various facts in support of their applications and the learned judge on the evidence before him found that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets by Mr Tang and Madam Teo. The learned judge`s conclusions are found in [para ] 23.1 to 23.8 of his judgment (reported in 
[1997] 2 SLR 819
), and the global amount of $11,200,000 was to take into account the total amount of damages claimed by the plaintiffs. If Mr Tang complains that there was insufficient evidence in support or that the learned judge erred in law or misapprehended material facts in granting the injunction against him, he should have applied to set aside or appealed against the injunction. At all material times there were two courses open to him. But, he did not take either of them.
 58.As for the order joining Madam Teo as the second defendant, Lai Kew Chai J found that Madam Teo did not have any independent income at all material times (which was undisputed) and that she probably holds the property (where she is staying) on trust for Mr Tang. Such an order was not unprecedented. The learned judge relied on the English case of 
TSB Private Bank International SA v Chabra & Anor
 
[1992] 1 WLR 231
, 238 and 240, where Mummery J joined as co-defendant a company which was owned and controlled by the defendant and which held certain assets in which it had no beneficial interest and which appeared to belong to the defendant. Mummery J also granted a Mareva injunction against both the defendant and the company. Likewise, Madam Teo had been joined as a second defendant for that reason.
 59.As for the order appointing a receiver of the assets of Mr Tang and Madam Teo, the basis for such an order was their continued failure to comply with the order for discovery contained in the Mareva injunctions. There was clearly jurisdiction for such an order to be made in those circumstances. Again, Mr Tang could have applied to set aside this order or appealed against it on the ground that it was made in error whether in law or on the facts. Again, he did not.
 60.We express no opinion as to the correctness or otherwise of the orders made by the learned judge other than that the orders so made remain in full force until they are set aside or discharged. Whether the orders were correctly made is not in issue before us, nor should we consider such an issue. Crucially, lest it be forgotten, the thrust of Mr Gray`s criticism is not about the correctness of the orders, but that these orders gave rise to an appearance of bias. With respect, this criticism is untenable. It is one thing to say that an order made by a judge is extraordinary and unusual or it is wrong; it is quite another to say that there was an appearance of bias on the part of the judge in making the order because it is so extraordinary and unusual. Even if the learned judge had erred in law or on the facts in making the orders or any of them, such error cannot be translated into an appearance of bias on the part of the learned judge.
 61.We now turn to the argument of Mr Gray based on the receipt of the `early bird discounts` by the judge. His argument runs as follows. The receipt of such a discount was precisely the same subject matter which led Mr Tang to make certain remarks for which he was sued by Mr Lee and BG Lee for libel. The judge`s own personal involvement in the transaction is indistinguishable from that in which Mr Lee and BG Lee had engaged and fell at the very heart of Mr Tang`s defence of fair comment in the libel action. Whilst no impropriety is alleged, the defence as raised by Mr Tang is by its terms highly critical of the circumstances under which the discounts were given and received, and suggests that they merit investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department or Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. This defence had placed Lai Kew Chai J in an impossible position. The judge could not be seen to adjudicate impartially and dispassionately on this defence as he himself had on the same basis received the same discount from the same developer. In other words, the judge`s conduct mirrors that of Mr Lee and BG Lee and would be likely to colour his view at the trial on the criticisms advanced in Mr Tang`s defence.
 62.With respect, this argument is wholly misconceived. First, there is no question of Lai Kew Chai J trying or hearing the action. As we have said, that is no longer a live issue before us. So the question of Lai Kew Chai J hearing the action and adjudicating on the defence of fair comment is really a red herring; it does not arise at all.
 63.Secondly, what Mr Gray is attacking here are the Mareva injunctions and the receivership order made by the learned judge. The Mareva injunctions and receivership orders were made on 27 January and 17 February 1997 respectively. At that stage, Lai Kew Chai J was not called upon to rule on Mr Tang`s remarks. This was only to be an issue at trial. Thus, at the interlocutory stage, there was no real reason for Lai Kew Chai J to decide on that issue one way or the other. The merits or otherwise of the defence of fair comment or for that matter any other defence are totally irrelevant and have nothing to do with such orders.
 64.We have three further observations on what have been advanced before us. First, Mr Tang had conceded in his re-amended defence that there was no impropriety in the `early-bird discounts` in legal or moral terms. Second, the `early-bird discounts` had endured public scrutiny and by the time Lai Kew Chai J came to hear the interlocutory applications, there was already public ventilation and exoneration over the propriety of such discounts. And third, the judge himself had no pecuniary or other interest whatsoever, direct or indirect, in the outcome of the matters before him.
 65.We now come to Mr Gray`s criticism of what he terms the `vituperative` comments made by Lai Kew Chai J on Mr Tang. Admittedly, the learned judge in his grounds of judgment did not mince any words in castigating Mr Tang for making a scandalous and scurrilous attack on his integrity as a judge. Mr Tang not only made unsubstantiated allegations of close personal and professional relationships between the learned judge and Mr Lee and his family but also unjustifiably brought out and highlighted the purchase by the learned judge of his apartment in 
 Nassim Jade 
 which has nothing to do with any of the issues in any of the actions instituted against Mr Tang. It appeared to us that that was brought out with the intention of embarrassing the learned judge personally. On the evidence before us, such a matter has no relevance whatsoever. The purchase made by the learned judge and Mrs Lai was purely coincidental with and was totally unrelated in any way to the purchases made by Mr Lee and BG Lee of their apartments respectively in the same development. In raising this matter, Mr Tang seemed to suggest that there was an element of impropriety in such purchases, which was baseless. In these circumstances, it is not surprising and, perhaps, understandable that Lai Kew Chai J used very harsh and scathing terms in his comments on Mr Tang`s conduct.
 66.However, whatever may be the criticisms of the learned judge`s comments on Mr Tang, they cannot possibly lend any support to the allegation of apparent bias. The crux of the issue before us is simply whether at the times the learned judge granted the Mareva injunctions and the receivership order there was any apparent bias. As we have said, the Mareva injunctions and the receivership order were granted on 22 January and 17 February 1997 respectively. The significance of this is that on either of those dates there was not even a murmur by Mr Tang or his counsel of any bias, actual or apparent. Nor immediately following these orders was there any application made by Mr Tang to set aside these orders, whether on the ground of apparent bias or on any other grounds. On the contrary, on 21 February 1997, Mr Tang applied to Lai Kew Chai J for an extension of time to comply with the Mareva injunctions and the receivership orders. Mr Jeyaretnam, counsel for Mr Tang, said that Mr Tang would comply with the order for discovery contained in the Mareva injunctions and the receivership order, in particular, the filing of a list of all his assets worldwide. The request for an extension of time was opposed by all the counsel acting for the plaintiffs in the 12 actions. However, the learned judge acceded to the request and granted Mr Tang an extension of time to 3 March 1997 to comply with the orders. But on 3 March, instead of complying with the orders for discovery, Mr Tang filed an application to disqualify Lai Kew Chai J and to set aside the interlocutory orders. The application was dismissed by the learned judge, and it was in the course of his grounds of judgment that the learned judge made those severe criticisms of Mr Tang. In these circumstances, these comments clearly cannot be relied on as evidence of apparent bias in relation to the Mareva injunctions or the receivership order.
 67.In our judgment, a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court, equipped with all the relevant knowledge of the case and the surrounding circumstances, would not have any suspicion that the learned judge was biased when he made the orders on 27 January and 17 February 1997 respectively. Alternatively, applying the test laid down in 
 R v Gough 
 (supra), we ask ourselves whether having ascertained all the relevant circumstances from the available evidence there was a real danger of bias on the part of Lai Kew Chai J in granting the Mareva injunctions or the receivership order. The answer is firmly in the negative. In our judgment, the Mareva injunctions and receivership order therefore stand and remain valid.
 68.In conclusion we would add this. We should bear in mind the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in 
 Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim & Ors 
 (
 The Times 
, 4 May 1993), (
 The Independent 
, 30 April 1993, transcript) which we find most apt: 
Just as an inference of apparent bias is not to be lightly drawn, so such a charge is not to be lightly made. That remains true even where, as here, any suggestion of actual bias is expressly disclaimed. Cases may unhappily arise in which evidence of bias or apparent bias is so clear that an application for the discharge or removal of a judge is justified. But such an application is never justified simply by the instructions of the client. Counsel`s duty to the court and to the wider interests of justice in our judgment requires that he should not lend himself to making such an application unless he is conscientiously satisfied that there is material upon which he can properly do so.
 69.
 Order to show cause
In dismissing the application to recuse himself, Lai Kew Chai J made an order under O 59 r 8(1)(b) of the Rules of Court 1996 requiring Mr Jeyaretnam, who was counsel for Mr Tang then, to show cause why he should not pay the costs of the application. The order arose out of the complaint that Mr Jeyaretnam had failed to verify conscientiously that the facts in Mr Tang`s affidavit were substantiated or could be substantiated. This, it was said, should have been done before Mr Jeyaretnam proceeded with the application which involved an attack on the honour and integrity of a judge.
 70.The provision governing the solicitor`s personal liability for costs, or what is known as `wasted costs order`, is found in O 59 r 8 of the Rules of Court which states: 
(1) Subject to this Rule, where it appears to the Court that costs have been incurred 
 unreasonably 
 or 
 improperly 
 in any proceedings or have been wasted 
 by failure to conduct proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition 
, the Court may make against any solicitor whom it considers to be responsible (whether personally or through an employee or agent) an order -
 
(a) disallowing the costs as between the solicitor and his client; and 
(b) directing the solicitor to repay to his client costs which the client has been ordered to pay to other parties to the proceedings; or 
(c) directing the solicitor personally to indemnify such other parties against costs payable by them. [Emphasis is ours.]
 71.The scope of this jurisdiction was comprehensively considered by the English Court of Appeal in 
Ridehalgh v Horsefield & Anor
 
[1994] Ch 205
 which dealt with a similar provision under English procedural law. There, the court approved the three-stage test as conceived in the earlier case of 
Re A Barrister (Wasted Costs Order) (No 1 of 1991)
 
[1993] QB 293
 at 301
. The judgment of the court was handed down by Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) and the court laid down the three-stage test, at p 231: 
(1) Has the legal representative of whom complaint is made acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently? (2) If so, did such conduct cause the applicant to incur unnecessary costs? (3) If so, is it in all the circumstances just to order the legal representative to compensate the applicant for the whole or any part of the relevant costs? (If so, the costs to be met must be specified and, in a criminal case, the amount of the costs.)
 There followed a detailed consideration by the court of what the first limb of the test means, and the court said as follows, at pp 232-233: 
`Improper` The adjective covers, but is not confined to, conduct which would ordinarily be held to justify disbarment, striking off, suspension from practice or other serious professional penalty. It covers any significant breach of a substantial duty imposed by a relevant code of professional conduct. But it is not in our judgment limited to that. Conduct which would be regarded as improper according to the consensus of professional (including judicial) opinion can be fairly stigmatised as such whether or not it violates the letter of a professional code.
 
`Unreasonable` The expression aptly describes conduct which is vexatious, designed to harass the other side rather than advance the resolution of the case, and it makes no difference that the conduct is the product of excessive zeal and not improper motive. But conduct cannot be described as unreasonable simply because it leads in the event to an unsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal representatives would have acted differently. The acid test is whether the conduct permits of a reasonable explanation
 
The term `negligent` was the most controversial of the three That expression does not invoke technical concepts of the law of negligence we are clear that `negligent` should be understood in an untechnical way to denote failure to act with the competence reasonably to be expected of ordinary members of the profession.
 
 
We were invited to give the three adjectives (improper, unreasonable and negligent) specific, self-contained meanings, so as to avoid overlap between the three. We do not read these very familiar expressions in that way. Conduct which is unreasonable may also be improper, and conduct which is negligent will very frequently be (if it is not by definition) unreasonable. We do not think any sharp differentiation between these expressions is useful or necessary or intended.
 72.Before us the matter has only reached the stage of a show cause order under sub-rule (2) of O 59 r 8 of the Rules of Court which states: 
No order under this Rule shall be made against a solicitor unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity to appear before the Court and show cause why the order should not be made
 A mention should be made on this sub-rule. We refer once again to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
 Ridehalgh 
, which said, at p 239: 
this [rule] should not be understood to mean that the burden is on the legal representative to exculpate himself. A wasted costs order should not be made unless the applicant satisfies the court, or the court itself is satisfied, that an order should be made. The representative is not obliged to prove that it should not. But the rule clearly envisages that the representative will not be called on to reply unless an apparently strong prima facie case has been made against him and the language of the rule recognises a shift in the evidential burden.
 We entirely agree.
 73.Mr Tan Kok Quan submits that Mr Jeyaretnam should have verified the contents of Mr Tang`s affidavit, particularly with respect to the alleged close relationships between Lai Kew Chai J and Mr Lee, before proceeding with the application. On this, we were told by Mr Gray that, on the day of the application, Mr Tang was in Hong Kong, and his affidavit was sent by facsimile transmission to Mr Jeyaretnam the same day, and Mr Jeyaretnam had to present the argument and to proffer the affidavit to Lai Kew Chai J that very day. Thus, there was really little opportunity to verify (even assuming there was the need or duty to do so) the affidavit. Besides, there was no reason for Mr Jeyaretnam to disbelieve his client`s affidavit who himself was a practising member of the Bar.
 74.Bearing in mind that in this case Mr Tang was giving instructions to Mr Jeyaretnam from abroad, there probably was hardly any time for Mr Jeyaretnam to check or verify the affidavit of Mr Tang. After all Mr Tang is an advocate and solicitor himself. In any case, we think it would be placing an unduly onerous burden on counsel on every instance to verify the truth or otherwise of what their clients have deposed to in affidavit. In this respect, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) held in 
Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore
 
[1988] SLR 510
 , at p 515 as follows: 
TKQ was under no duty (i) specifically, to take statements from the clients named in GSH`s affidavit; (ii) generally, to verify the source of information of GSH. Counsel for the plaintiff was unable to cite any authority to support his contention that an advocate and solicitor has such a duty generally or in the circumstances of this case. Nor was he able to persuade me, in principle, that such a duty existed. In my view, no such duty existed generally or in the circumstances of this case. It is not for an advocate and solicitor, whether in his capacity as counsel or solicitor, to believe or disbelieve his client`s instructions, unless his client`s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible. His duty to his client does not go beyond advising him of the folly of making incredible or illogical statements.
 We agree with the learned judge.
 75.Next, it is said that Mr Jeyaretnam should have known better than to raise the baseless allegation of Lai Kew Chai J`s close association with Mr Lee. This was especially the case when Mr Jeyaretnam himself was involved in a similar attempt some years back, and the very same contention was rejected by the Court of Appeal. We can see the force of this argument. But, it seems to us that Mr Jeyaretnam might still have thought that there existed some sort of close relationship between Lai Kew Chai J and Mr Lee, and the fact that the judge once worked for a considerable period of time in the firm founded by Mr Lee might have possibly contributed to Mr Jeyaretnam`s perception of apparent bias. This allegation of close relationships had to be considered cumulatively with the other matters alleged by Mr Tang in respect of which it cannot be said that Mr Jeyaretnam had any personal knowledge. It must be borne in mind that the basis of this application was apparent bias and not actual bias. Neither Mr Jeyaretnam nor Mr Tang accused the learned judge of being actually biased.
 76.Mr Tan further points out that Mr Jeyaretnam advanced Mr Tang`s case even when told by Lai Kew Chai J that there were serious factual inaccuracies. On this point, however, the unhappy reality was that Mr Jeyaretnam was in a predicament. On the one hand, he had Mr Tang`s instructions and was obliged to pursue his client`s application. On the other hand, he was confronted by the learned judge`s assertion that there were a series of factual inaccuracies. It is therefore not too difficult to understand that Mr Jeyaretnam`s reply then was that Mr Tang had affirmed the affidavit, and he could not compromise his client`s position by admitting anything without instructions. In those circumstances, Mr Jeyaretnam would have to pursue the application as best as he could.
 77.There is also the complaint that Mr Jeyaretnam had compounded his disregard of his duty to the court when he sought an open court hearing, apparently for the purpose of publicity, since the media would be present. This point can be disposed of briefly. First, in our opinion, applying for the hearing to be adjourned into open court is not improper, even if the motive of Mr Jeyaretnam was to ventilate his arguments in public for the benefit of his client. Secondly, even if an open court hearing was in the circumstances inappropriate, that had not occasioned any costs to be wasted, and the wasted costs jurisdiction would not have been triggered: see 
 Re A Barrister (Wasted Costs Order)(No 1 of 1991) 
 (supra). In any event, the hearing was eventually adjourned to open court - a decision taken by the learned judge himself.
 78.Finally, it must be borne in mind that, in making a show cause order of this nature, the court also has to balance two important public interests. In 
 Ridehalgh 
`s case, Sir Thomas Bingham MR phrased it in this manner at p 226: 
One [public interest] is that lawyers should not be deterred from pursuing their clients` interest by fear of incurring a personal liability to their clients` opponents; that they should not be penalised by orders to pay costs without a fair opportunity to defend themselves; that wasted costs orders should not become a back-door means of recovering costs not otherwise recoverable against a legally-aided or impoverished litigant; and that the remedy should not grow unchecked to become more damaging than the disease. The other public interest is that litigants should not be financially prejudiced by the unjustifiable conduct of litigation by their or their opponents` lawyers. The reconciliation of these public interests is our task in these appeals. Full weight must be given to the first of these public interests, but the wasted costs jurisdiction must not be emasculated.
 We respectfully agree and adopt what has fallen from his Lordship.
 79.The question before us is simply whether Mr Jeyaretnam`s conduct in the application, was, prima facie, plainly unjustifiable, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. We think not. Although, in our view, Mr Tang`s application was unsustainable on the merits, plainly Mr Jeyaretnam did not think so. At any rate, the application was one which Mr Jeyaretnam acting on Mr Tang`s instructions was obliged to pursue. Even if Mr Jeyaretnam had thought that Mr Tang`s case was hopeless, for the reasons given above, we have serious doubt that it can be said that he had acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently. As Lord Pearce observed in 
Rondel v Worsley
 
[1969] 1 AC 191
 at p 275: 
It is easier, pleasanter and more advantageous professionally for barristers to advise, represent or defend those who are decent and reasonable and likely to succeed in their action or their defence than those who are unpleasant, unreasonable, disreputable, and have an apparently hopeless case. Yet it would be tragic if our legal system came to provide no reputable defenders, representatives or advisers for the latter.
 80.In coming to this conclusion, we are mindful of the observations of the Court of Appeal in England in 
 Hashim 
`s case, which we have quoted (in [para ] 68 above) and with which we agree, that counsel`s duty to the court and to the wider interest of justice requires that he should not lend himself to making an application unless he is conscientiously satisfied that there is material upon which he can properly do so. In the circumstances of this case, we do not think it can be said that Mr Jeyaretnam in making the application was not conscientiously satisfied that there was material upon which he could properly do so. He probably thought, but wrongly in our view, that he had the material for the application. In our judgment, no prima facie case has been made out, and we set aside the order to show cause. Save for this order, we dismiss the appeal in CA 63 of 1997.
 81.
 CA 135 of 1997
 The Straits Times 
 The Straits Times 
This appeal is against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J in Suit No 244 of 1997 in which he struck out Mr Tang`s defence as disclosing no reasonable defence to the claim by Mr Goh. There are two issues before us, namely: (a). whether the words spoken by Mr Tang and republished in bore the defamatory meanings or any one or more of them as averred in the statement of claim; and
 (b). whether Mr Tang was responsible in law for the republication of his words in publications other than .
 82.Mr Gray contends that the learned judge should have addressed the question whether it was plain and obvious that the words spoken by Mr Tang, in their natural and ordinary meaning, bore the defamatory meanings or one or more of them as pleaded in the statement of claim. But, the learned judge did not. Instead, he ascribed his own meaning to the words. This approach, Mr Gray argues, is wrong in law. 
 At the hearing of an application for striking out 
, the learned judge was not entitled to substitute his own meaning for that as pleaded by the plaintiff. In other words, the simple question before him was whether the words uttered by Mr Tang bore the meanings or one or more of the meanings averred in the statement of claim.
 83.In considering this argument two questions arise: first, whether the meaning of the words complained of as found by the learned judge was one of the meanings as pleaded in the statement of claim, and second, whether the meaning so found was defamatory of Mr Goh.
 84.At the risk of repetition, we recapitulate the circumstances and the words uttered by Mr Tang. On 10 January 1997 Mr Tang gave an interview to Mr Brendan Pereira of 
 The Straits Times 
 and following that an article entitled 
 `I have fled as I feared being arrested: Tang` 
 appeared in 
 The Straits Times 
. The relevant extract as published was as follows: 
Mr Tang Liang Hong said last night besides fearing for his safety, he fled Singapore because he was concerned that he would be arrested by the authorities.
 
`They were building up this case against me. I could see where it was all heading. I wanted to leave Singapore and be given a chance to tell the world that I am not who they say I am.
 
Once I go back to Singapore, there is a possibility that I may be locked up and not be given a chance to defend myself,` he said.
 
The Workers` Party candidate for Cheng San GRC made these points in a telephone interview.
 
He again declined to reveal his whereabouts, adding that he might return to Singapore in a few days.
 
When told that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had given an assurance that he would not be arrested, he laughed, adding: `Do you think I should believe them?`
 
He said that many years ago Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had given some Nanyang University students a similar assurance. A few days later, some of them were arrested. Mr Tang, 61, said that he did not discount being arrested under the Internal Security Act, especially since he had been accused of playing `international` games.
 85.Now Mr Goh complained that these words in their ordinary and natural meaning were defamatory of him, and in his statement of claim he pleaded no less than six defamatory meanings. The material ones, for the purpose of this appeal, are the following: 
 
(4) will use his power and influence as the Prime Minister of Singapore, to corruptly and illegally, ensure the defendant`s arrest if he were to return to Singapore, so as to suppress and prevent the defendant from contradicting the alleged lies and to prevent him from defending the civil proceedings which the plaintiff, as well as the plaintiffs in Suit No 2523 of 1996 and Suit No 2525 of 1996 had brought against the defendant; 
(5) is not a man of his word and the plaintiff`s word cannot be relied upon; and 
(6) is not an honest person and/or a man of integrity and/or worthy of trust.
 To that claim Mr Tang`s defence was that the words did not bear the meanings as averred in the statement of claim and that the words were not defamatory of Mr Goh. No other defence was pleaded by Mr Tang. The question therefore is whether the defence as pleaded is plainly and obviously unsustainable.
 86.The learned judge found that the words bore the following 
 single 
 meaning in [para ] 63.2 of his judgment (reported in 
[1997] 2 SLR 641
): 
In my judgment, the offending words uttered by the defendant and the article conveyed to the mind of the ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded listener and reader that the plaintiff is not an honest man, not a man of integrity and could not be trusted and that the plaintiff most probably would corruptly and illegally use his power and influence as the Prime Minister of Singapore to arrest the defendant under the Internal Security Act were he (the defendant) to return to Singapore with the consequences that he would be forced to say something against himself and that he would not be able to defend himself in the suits brought against him and to contradict the lies which the plaintiff and others had concocted and spread against him. Counsel for the plaintiff has suggested a range of meanings which are set out in the statement of claim. To my mind, not each and every one of all those meanings were conveyed to the ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded listener and reader. In my judgment what I have set out is the 
 single and the right meaning
 of the utterances and the article. [Emphasis is ours.]
 87.In our respectful view, the meaning as found by the learned judge is not precisely the same as that pleaded in the statement of claim. However, even if the learned judge was not entitled to find this meaning, Mr Gray`s argument, in our opinion, would still not succeed. We think that the words complained of did bear some of the meanings averred by the plaintiff. Reading the extract above, we find it abundantly clear that, at the very least, in the ordinary and natural meaning, the words meant and were understood to mean that Mr Goh `is not a man of his word and [Mr Goh`s] word cannot be relied upon; and is not an honest person and/or a man of integrity and/or worthy of trust.` These meanings were precisely two of the meanings pleaded in the statement of claim which we have quoted.
 88.In our opinion, to an objective and fair-minded man, Mr Tang`s words undoubtedly at least bore the two meanings pleaded above. The words bearing those meanings are clearly defamatory of Mr Goh. It is unarguable otherwise. In our judgment, the defence of Mr Tang that the words in their ordinary and natural meaning were not defamatory of Mr Goh is plainly and obviously unsustainable, and there being no other defence, the learned judge was entitled to strike out such defence, as he did.
 89.
 Republication
The next issue concerns Mr Tang`s responsibility for the republications other than in 
 The Straits Times 
. In the statement of claim, Mr Goh alleged that Mr Tang knew or intended that his words would be republished not only in The Straits Times but also `elsewhere`.
 90.Mr Gray points out that in the defence Mr Tang had only admitted responsibility for the republication of his words in 
 The Straits Times 
. Apart from that, Mr Tang denied the allegation that he was responsible for all other republications. Thus, Mr Gray argues that the learned judge clearly erred when he held in [para ] 56 of his judgment the following: 
On the facts as admitted, I am further of the view that [Mr Tang] also authorised any re-publication in the mass media of the article in the 
 The Straits Times
. However, he did deny `all other respects of para 33` but the denial, bearing on whether the words were `offending words`, is immaterial to the question of his responsibility in law for the publication and re-publications of the offending words.
 91.With respect, we are unable to agree with the learned judge, and we accept Mr Gray`s argument. At the hearing of the application it was not open to the learned judge to hold that Mr Tang had `authorised any republication in the mass media`. The reason is that Mr Tang had expressly denied responsibility for the other republications. Hence, the existence of liability for the further republications is a question of fact for the trial judge and cannot be decided at the stage of a striking out application.
 92.On the other hand, Mr Shanmugam for Mr Goh argues that the point raised by Mr Gray is a non-issue. He refers to the plaintiff`s pleadings and in particular the following: 
32 The [Offending Words] were spoken by [Mr Tang] in the hearing of Mr Brendan Pereira [the journalist who interviewed Mr Tang]. The Offending Words were, and are defamatory of the plaintiff. 
33 The defendant spoke the Offending Words in the knowledge and/or with the intention that the Offending Words or their gist should be published in 
 The Straits Times 
 and republished elsewhere and/or authorised their repetition. Alternatively, the republication was a natural and probable result of the original publication by the defendant.
 It was further pleaded, inter alia, that Mr Tang had falsely and maliciously caused to be published the offending words. Following that, the crucial part of the pleading is as follows: 
41 The plaintiff will rely on the following facts and matters as aggravating the defamation:
 
 
(3) the extent of the publication of the Offending Words or their gist in 
 The Straits Times 
 (as set out in para 34 above) and 
 elsewhere 
 (including the Internet); 
(4) the defendant knew and/or ought to have known and/or intended that the Offending Words or their gist would be published in 
 The Straits Times 
 and 
 republished in other newspapers and media and/or authorised their repetition 
. [Emphasis is ours.]
 93.Thus, on the pleadings Mr Goh did rely on republications elsewhere other than the 
 The Straits Times 
. However, Mr Shanmugam explains that, in this action for slander and libel, Mr Goh was relying on the words spoken by Mr Tang to the journalist and the subsequent publication of his words by 
 The Straits Times 
 and the publication on the Internet. Despite reference to republications elsewhere, the reality was that no other publication was relied upon, save that in 
 The Straits Times 
 and on the Internet. The reason the Internet was identified, as explained by Mr Shanmugam, is that it is a matter of common knowledge that 
 The Straits Times 
has a web-site on the Internet. Therefore, 
 The Straits Times 
 publication will automatically be captured on its Internet web-site. In any event, Mr Shanmugam contends that, even if there were no other republications, Mr Goh would still be entitled to interlocutory judgment because the judgment depended simply on whether or not the words were defamatory; the other republications were merely an issue in the assessment of damages.
 94.In this case there was in fact no other republications. Mr Tang himself admitted that he authorised the publication by 
 The Straits Times 
. As for the publication on 
 The Straits Times 
 web-site in the Internet, this was simply a natural and probable consequence of Mr Tang`s authorisation. Thus, the question of other republications is really no longer in issue in this appeal, and we need only to bear this in mind when we come to assessment of damages.
 95.In the result, the appeal against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J striking out the defence of Mr Tang in Suit No 244 of 1997 is dismissed.
 
 CA 64, 111-121 of 1997
Goh Joon Seng J`s order - striking out defences
 96.We now turn to this group of appeals and consider first Mr Tang`s appeals against the order of Goh Joon Seng J striking out his defence and entering interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in each of the 12 actions from which these appeals arose. Mr Gray`s attack on Goh Joon Seng J`s order is made on the ground that there was apparent bias on the part of Lai Kew Chai J in granting the Mareva injunctions and receivership order and that accordingly these orders were tainted and should be set aside. If these orders are set aside, then it follows that the orders made by Goh Joon Seng J cannot stand and consequently must also be set aside. As we have held that there was no apparent bias in relation to the Mareva injunctions and the receivership order, it only remains for us to consider whether there are any other grounds for setting aside Goh Joon Seng J`s orders.
 97.It is not Mr Gray`s contention that Goh Joon Seng J had exercised his discretion wrongly in striking out Mr Tang`s defences. The orders were made by Goh Joon Seng J on the ground that Mr Tang had failed to obey the interlocutory orders made by Lai Kew Chai J. The terms of the orders with which Mr Tang had to comply are briefly these. By the Mareva injunctions Mr Tang and Madam Teo were ordered, inter alia, to disclose their assets in and outside Singapore within five days. By the receivership order they were ordered, inter alia, to co-operate with the receiver and to disclose their assets to him by 24 February 1997. The deadlines for complying with these orders were extended by Lai Kew Chai J to 3 March 1997. It is not in dispute that the terms of these orders were not complied with by Mr Tang by that date.
 98.The question for consideration is whether the non-compliance with the terms of these court orders justified the striking out by Goh Joon Seng J of Mr Tang`s defences on 10 March 1997. In this regard, cl 16 of the receivership order states as follows: 
In the event the first defendant [Mr Tang] fails to comply with any terms of this order, the plaintiffs be at liberty to apply for an order that the defence in the above actions be struck out and judgment be entered for damages to be assessed.
 99.By virtue of this term, the discovery order contained in the receivership order is in the nature of a peremptory order. On the nature of such an order, 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1997 
 in para 25/1/5 at p 462 states: 
A peremptory order is one which makes clear to the other party, either from its terms or from the circumstances in which it was made, that exact compliance with no further argument, is required by the court within a stated time, and indicating expressly or by implication, that default will incur serious consequences The best practical form of peremptory order is the `Unless Order`.
 Generally, a peremptory order must be complied with until it is set aside. The court will not be astute to find excuses for failure to comply with its orders, since obedience to court orders is the foundation on which its authority is founded (per Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in 
Re Jokai Tea Holdings Ltd
 
[1992] 1 WLR 1196
 at p 1203). If Mr Tang disagrees with the peremptory order, he may and should apply to set it aside or discharge it. But, until then, he must obey the orders.
 100.Before Goh Joon Seng J Mr Tang did not give any explanation for his non-compliance with the orders. Even then, the learned judge took pains to ask Mr Jeyaretnam, counsel for Mr Tang, whether Mr Tang was going to comply with the court orders; and, in fairness to Mr Jeyaretnam, he said he could not answer that. He also indicated that he had no firm instructions as to whether an affidavit explaining the non-compliance would be filed.
 101.In the circumstances, the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that Mr Tang had intentionally flouted the court orders. In the absence of good reasons, disobedience of a peremptory order is generally to be treated as contumelious conduct (per Lord Diplock in 
Tolley v Morris
 
[1979] 1 WLR 592
 at p 603) and such contumelious disobedience justified striking out Mr Tang`s defences. In our judgment, Goh Joon Seng J was fully entitled to make the orders which he did. The appeals against his orders are thus dismissed.
 102.
 Assessment of damages
A major part of the appeals before us concerns the assessment of damages awarded by Chao Hick Tin J. In assessing damages the learned judge found (in [para ] 85 of his judgment, 
[1997] 3 SLR 91
 at p 113) that two aspects of Mr Tang`s conduct stood out clearly, namely: 
One, at every turn Mr Tang would repeat and, thus aggravate the various defamations; two, he has no qualms at all in treating the orders of court with utter contempt and in uttering scandalous and contemptuous remarks about the courts, all because he felt he was beyond the reaches of the courts, being outside Singapore. Such conduct from a person who is an advocate and solicitor of 28 years standing, deserves the strongest condemnation. Indeed, his conduct is that of a man who intends to flee to avoid legal responsibilities, not one who intends to vindicate his own name, as he claims. He is not concerned with the legal proceedings in the High Court here. He has a different agenda.
 Moving forward the learned judge referred to some of the more pertinent precedent cases, which we shall discuss in a moment, and said in [para ] 94: 
From the submissions of counsel and the list of suggested damages which they have tendered to me it is clear that the two most serious defamatory remarks are those related to the HPL purchases and the allegation of lies and conspiracy against PM Goh, SM Lee and the six other PAP leaders (in Suit No 2525/96). I propose to highlight some aspects of these two matters. It is not in dispute that as between the 13 suits there are many common factors eg no retraction or apology and repeated aggravation.
 103.He then proceeded to consider in depth the defamatory statements made by Mr Tang, which formed the subject matters of Suit Nos 1116 of 1996 and 172 of 1997 instituted by Mr Lee and BG Lee and the relevant circumstances which aggravated the defamations and said, inter alia, the following in [para ] 103: 
In the light of the foregoing, quite clearly the amount to be awarded in the two suits should be substantial and significantly more than the highest awards given to date, having regard to the extreme nature of the aggravation.
 104.He turned next to the statement made by Mr Tang, which formed the subject matters of the three actions in Suit Nos 2523-2535 of 1996, instituted respectively by Mr Lee, Mr Goh and the six other PAP leaders. He discussed the imputations it conveyed, the extent of the publication and the inferences he drew from the defences and the conduct of Mr Tang.
 105.He came to the view (in [para ] 110) that the courts have awarded substantial damages against defendants who had attacked the honesty, integrity or character of public figures. He referred in particular to the case of 
Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur & Anor
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 542
 , which we shall discuss shortly, and reached the following conclusion in [para ] 111 and 112: 
111 Taking into consideration the position and standing of the parties, the extent of the publication and republication, and all the factors of aggravation into account, namely,
 
(i) presence of express malice, 
(ii) absence of apology, 
(iii) repetition of the defamation over and over again and the numerous outrageous utterances to the local and international media, 
(iv) defences raised in the suits (justification, fair comment), 
(v) contemptuous disregard of the Mareva injunction and the receivership order and 
(vi) overall conduct of Mr Tang in the proceedings before this court (eg delaying proceedings, misrepresenting the scope of Mareva injunction and falsely accusing the courts of not giving his wife an urgent date for her application to set aside the Mareva injunction),
 
they no doubt warrant an award much higher than the highest award thus far, because the injury, embarrassment and hurt caused are much greater. The more enormous, outrageous, scandalous or scurrilous the defamation and/or aggravation, the greater the damages. This court must show its indignation at the injury inflicted on the plaintiffs.
 
112 However in making the awards set out in the schedule hereto I have also borne in mind the following:
 
(i) that in all the utterances, Mr Tang`s main targets were PM Goh and SM Lee; 
(ii) the awards in previous defamation cases; and 
(iii) that I should not move away from the realm of compensation into the realm of punishment. Whether Mr Tang should be dealt with for scandalising the court is a matter which may have to be taken up at some other time.
 106.In conclusion he assessed damages in the 13 actions as follows:

 CA 64, 111-113, 117-121 and 135 of 1997
Mr Tang appeals against all the awards of damages made by the learned judge. We shall consider, first, the issue of damages in this group of appeals and thereafter the issue of damages in the three appeals in CA 114-116 of 1997, as they raise a common point of law.
 108.The approach of the appellate court in hearing an appeal on the question of damages is well settled. More than 30 years ago, in 
Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd & Ors
 
[1964] AC 371
, which concerned assessment of damages in a libel case before a judge without a jury, Lord Radcliffe laid down the following broad principles, at pp 393-394: 
A trial judge awarding damages for this kind of tort [ie libel and slander] is habitually allowed a certain pre-eminence for his assessment above the assessments that might independently commend themselves to an appeal court. The principles that establish his pre-eminence are laid down in the two decisions of 
Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd
 
[1942] AC 601
; 58 TLR 240; [1942] 1 All ER 657, HL and 
Nance v British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd
 
[1951] AC 601
[1951] 2 TLR 137
[1951] 2 All ER 448
, PC. An appeal court rejects his figure only in `very special` or `very exceptional` cases. Such cases are embraced by the formula that the judge must be shown to have arrived at his figure either by applying a wrong principle of law or through a misapprehension of the facts or for some other reason to have made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered, so that, when an underestimate is in question, it is `unreasonably small` or `wholly inadequate`. Neither 
 Davies
`s 
[1942] AC 601
 nor 
 Nance
`s 
[1951] AC 601
 case was a case of damages for defamation, but it is common ground that damages assessed by a judge in such cases are governed by the same principles. The damages are, to quote Lord Wright in 
 Davies
`s case 
[1942] AC 601
, 616, essentially matters `of impression and of common-sense`.
 In the recent Australian High Court decision in 
Carson v John Fairfax and Sons Ltd
 
[1993] 
178 CLR 44
, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the majority, in their joint judgment said, at pp 61-62: 
If an appellate court is convinced, not that in its own view the amount is too high or too low but that the amount awarded is so high or so low that it is outside the range of what could reasonably be regarded as appropriate to the circumstances of the case, the proper performance of its functions will require it to intervene to prevent a miscarriage of justice.
 109.Before us Mr Gray submits that the damages awarded, whether looked at individually or collectively, are inordinately excessive and are disproportionate to the injury or harm caused to the respondents. He points out that the total or global figure of all the awards amounted to $8.075m, inclusive of the settlement of $900,000 recovered by Mr Lee and BG Lee from the defendants other than Mr Tang in Suit No 1116 of 1996. The sheer magnitude of the awards suggests that the learned judge fell or was led into errors either of principles or of the application of principles to the circumstances of the cases. In his submissions, the learned judge erred in several respects. We propose to deal with his arguments in the following order.
 110.
 No substantial damage suffered
First, Mr Gray submits that none of the respondents have in any objective sense suffered damage: each retains his office, his job, his home and family and circle of friends. For example, he says that Mr Goh himself testified in another trial that 1997 had so far been a good year for him. The reality, Mr Gray points out, is that none of the respondents have suffered any loss over Mr Tang`s libels and slanders. Hence, the injury as was suffered by them is utterly incommensurate with the windfalls represented by these awards. The point he seeks to make is that Mr Goh and his colleagues have not really suffered any loss at all, nor were they injured in their feelings. Mr Gray further argues that the awards must bear some sensible pecuniary relationship to other costs and values, such as the costs of a holiday, a car or house or the average household earnings.
 111.With respect, this argument is fallacious. First, in assessing damages for defamation, apart from compensation for injury to reputation and solatium which are usually considered together to constitute consolation for the wrong done, there is the essential element of vindication. Thus, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment in 
 Carson 
`s case said at pp 60-61: 
there are three purposes to be served by damages awarded for defamation. The three purposes no doubt overlap considerably in reality and ensure that `the amount of a verdict is the product of a mixture of inextricable considerations`. The three purposes are consolation for the personal distress and hurt caused to the appellant by the publication, reparation for the harm done to the appellant`s personal and (if relevant) business reputation and vindication of the appellant`s reputation. The first two purposes are frequently considered together and constitute consolation for the wrong done to the appellant. Vindication looks to the attitude of others to the [plaintiff]: the sum awarded must be at least the minimum necessary to signal to the public the vindication of the [plaintiff`s] reputation. `The gravity of the libel, the social standing of the parties and the availability of the remedies` are all relevant to assessing the quantum of damages necessary to vindicate the [plaintiff].
 It follows that, if the element of consolation is insufficient to vindicate the plaintiff, the damages should be increased accordingly (per McHugh JA in 
John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Kelly
 
[1987] 8 NSWLR 131
 at p 142).
 112.Secondly, damages for defamation are not awarded as if there has been a depreciation in value of a plaintiff`s reputation. In 
 Carson 
`s case Brennan J (as he then was) said, at pp 70-72: 
Although damages are awarded to vindicate the plaintiff`s reputation, damages are not awarded as compensation for the loss in value of a plaintiff`s reputation as though that reputation were itself a tangible asset or a physical attribute which, once damaged, is worth less than it was before. In order to achieve the purpose of vindicating reputation, damages for defamation are quantified by reference, inter alia, to what is needed to achieve that purpose: those damages are not quantified by reference to a depreciation in the value of a plaintiff`s reputation. Other heads of damage are compensation for the external consequences produced by the publication of the defamation and `a solatium` for the plaintiff`s internal hurt, that is, for the complex of reactions that the plaintiff has experienced as the result of the publication and its external consequences
 
Damages are awarded also for the plaintiff`s injured feelings, including the hurt, anxiety, loss of self-esteem, the sense of indignity and the sense of outrage felt by the plaintiff. Indeed, all those objective consequences and those subjective reactions which flow naturally from the publication of the defamatory matter are relevant factors. Of course, the subjective reactions are often produced by the objective consequences of the publication. The two categories are not cumulative heads of damage but descriptions of kinds of intangible factors which must be taken into account in assessing damages.
 His Honour later summed up as follows, at p 72: 
The same sum can operate as vindication, compensation and solatium, for `the amount of a verdict is the product of a mixture of inextricable considerations`. The amount assessed under other heads may itself be sufficient in aggregate to provide the vindication required. The extent of the overlap depends on the circumstances. But the award in total must be sufficient to satisfy the purposes for which damages for defamation are awarded: vindication of reputation, compensation for injury to reputation and solatium for injured feelings.
 113.
 Chilling effect
Mr Gray`s next ground of complaint is really a political one. He submits that these actions contain an intensely political flavour. The political motivation of the respondents, he argues, is itself a reason for clamping damages at a modest level. Libel actions are for vindicating reputation and not for use as political bludgeons. If large damages are allowed to stand, it would have what he describes a `chilling effect` on the freedom of expression and political debate. He cites two cases in support: 
City of Chicago v Tribune Co
 
[1923] 139 NE 86
 and 
Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd & Ors
 
[1993] AC 534
.
 114.We have no hesitation in rejecting this submission. Neither of these cases is of any assistance to us. The first is an American case in which the City of Chicago, a municipal corporation, sued the publisher of a newspaper for libel, and it was held by the Supreme Court of Illinois that the City of Chicago, a public authority, could not maintain an action for libel in view of the provisions of art 2 para 4 of the Constitution of the United States of America. That case essentially turned on the court`s view of the Constitution and is clearly not applicable here.
 115.In the second case, the Derbyshire County Council, again a public authority, brought an action against the defendants in respect of two defamatory articles in their newspaper. The defendants took out an application to strike out the claim and a preliminary point was raised as to whether the plaintiff could maintain the action. The High Court dismissed the application, and the defendants appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that the plaintiff, being a public authority, could not bring an action for libel. The decision was affirmed on appeal by the House of Lords. Lord Keith of Kinkel who delivered the main speech of the House held (at p 547) that a local authority or any body exercising governmental functions is in a special position as regards the right to take proceedings for defamation. Such authority or body is to be distinguished from other corporations such as trading corporations, trade unions and charitable organizations which may sue for defamation. His Lordship said at p 549: 
as is shown by the decision in 
A-G v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)
 
[1990] 1 AC 109
, a case concerned with confidentiality, there are rights available to private citizens which institutions of central government are not in a position to exercise unless they can show that it is the public interest to do so. The same applies, in my opinion, to local authorities. In both cases I regard it as right for this House to lay down that not only is there no public interest favouring the right of organs of government, whether central or local, to sue for libel, but that it is contrary to the public interest that they should have it. It is contrary to the public interest because to admit such actions would place an undesirable fetter on freedom of speech.
 His Lordship then concluded (at p 550) that under the common law of England a local authority does not have the right to maintain an action for defamation.
 116.Clearly these two cases are distinguishable from the instant cases. In each of the two cases the party suing was a public authority and as a matter of policy the laws in those jurisdictions do not permit such an authority to bring an action for libel. In the cases before us, the plaintiffs are individuals suing as private citizens. None of them brought the actions in their official capacity. Even under English law, a prime minister or a minister in office may sue in their private capacity for damages in respect of defamatory matters published of them and depending on the circumstances may recover substantial damages. Mr Gray himself realises this crucial difference because, in the next breath, he says that Mr Tang `is not arguing that politicians should forfeit the right to protect their reputations by means of libel actions`.
 117.As Mr Gray concedes, politicians, like any other citizens, do not forfeit the protection of their reputations merely because they have entered the political arena and assumed high offices. Freedom of expression is perfectly legitimate so long as it does not encroach upon the realm of defamation. On this point, we repeat what this court said in 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
  at p 332: 
It cannot be disputed that the freedom of speech and expression provided in art 14 is not absolute or totally unrestricted. Certainly Mr Gray is not disputing this, and is not contending that the appellant under art 14 has the right to say `anything`. An absolute or unrestricted right of free speech would result in persons recklessly maligning others with impunity and the exercise of such a right would do the public more harm than good. Every person has a right to reputation and that right ought to be protected by law. Accordingly, a balance has to be maintained between the right of free speech on the one hand, and the right to protection of reputation on the other. The law of defamation protects such right to reputation, and, as we have shown, it was undoubtedly intended by the framers of our Constitution that the right of free speech should be subject to such law.
 118.Accordingly, if a person chooses to defame another or others, he must pay for the consequences with damages to be assessed according to the prevailing law. Any argument which calls for a reduction or moderation of damages purely on the basis that the successful plaintiff is a politician, say a minister, or that the case has a political flavour is untenable and wrong. To accept such a contention is to allow a person more latitude to make defamatory remarks of such personality and to escape with lesser consequences for the defamation he committed. Such a result, if permitted, would be in violation of art 12(1) of our Constitution which states: 
All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
 119.No one is free to defame with impunity another person, irrespective of whether such person is a politician or ordinary citizen. Freedom of expression comes with responsibility, and a breach of such responsibility would be visited with consequences ( sometimes serious consequences.
 120.
 Damages for physical injury
The next argument advanced by Mr Gray merits serious consideration. It has not been canvassed below. He submits that the damages awarded are so excessive that they are out of all proportion to damages recoverable for physical injuries. He suggests that one way of testing the correctness of the awards in defamation cases is to compare them with awards of 
 general 
 damages for personal injuries. In support, he cites two cases decided by the Court of Appeal in England: 
Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers (1986) Ltd & Ors
 
[1994] QB 670
 and 
John v MGN Ltd
 
[1997] QB 586
, and one case decided by the High Court of Australia: 
Carson v John Fairfax and Sons Ltd
 
[1993] 
178 CLR 44
.
 121.In 
 Rantzen 
, the plaintiff, a successful television presenter, sued the defendant for damages for libel published in the latter`s newspaper. At the trial before the High Court, the jury awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of 250,000. The defendant appealed seeking a reduction of the damages. Before the Court of Appeal, it was urged by counsel for the defendant (who incidentally was Mr Gray) that the jury should be directed to have regard to conventional awards made in personal injury cases. This argument was rejected. The court said at p 694: 
It has to be recognised, however, that the courts in England have rejected the notion that any satisfactory relationship between damages in defamation actions and damages in personal injury actions can be established.
 The court then referred to the well-known passage from the speech of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in 
Broome v Cassell and Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 1027
, 1070-1071 pertaining to the subjective element in damages for defamation, and said, at p 695: 
We see the force of the criticism of the present practice whereby a plaintiff in an action for libel may recover a much larger sum by way of damages for an injury to his reputation, which may prove transient in its effect, than damages awarded for pain and suffering to the victim of an industrial accident who has lost an eye or the use of one or more of his limbs. We have come to the conclusion, however, that there is no satisfactory way in which the conventional awards in actions for damages for personal injuries can be used to provide guidance for an award in an action for defamation.
 The court, nonetheless, considered the quantum of damages awarded by the jury as excessive and substituted an award of 110,000 in its place.
 122.Immediately following 
 Rantzen 
 came the case of 
 Carson 
(the facts of which we shall narrate shortly) before the High Court of Australia. There, one of the issues raised was the relevance of general damages in personal injury cases in the assessment of damages in defamation cases. The majority of the High Court consisting of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held that in considering the quantum of damages in defamation cases it is legitimate to bear in mind `the scale of values` applied in cases of serious physical injury. They accepted that the harm suffered in defamation cases differs from the `tearing of flesh and bone and the pain of body` suffered in personal injury cases and that `precise comparisons` should not be drawn between the different types of cases. But, they said, at p 58: 
for an appellate court which must test the quantum of a defamation award against some criteria to be prohibited from considering awards of general damages in personal injury cases would exclude reference to a potentially relevant criterion.
 123.The authority most heavily relied upon by Mr Gray is 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 which was decided some two years after 
 Rantzen 
. That was a case involving the rock superstar, Elton John, who sued the newspaper for libel in respect of an article published in the 
 Sunday Mirror 
 about his bizarre new diet, and the jury awarded him a sum of 350,000 comprising 75,000 as compensatory damages and 275,000 as exemplary damages. The defendants appealed. The Court of Appeal considered these awards to be excessive and substituted the figures of 25,000 as compensatory damages and 50,000 as exemplary damages making a total of 75,000. Before the Court of Appeal, counsel for the defendants (who again was Mr Gray) persuaded the court, among other things, to reconsider its decision in 
 Rantzen 
. On this occasion he succeeded. Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 614: 
It has often and rightly been said that there can be no precise correlation between a personal injury and a sum of money. The same is true, perhaps even more true, of injury and reputation But if these personal injuries respectively command conventional awards of, at most, about 52,000, 90,000 and 125,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenity (of course excluding claims based on loss of earnings, the cost of care and other specific financial claims), juries may properly be asked to consider whether the injury to his reputation of which the plaintiff complains should fairly justify any greater compensation. The conventional compensatory scales in personal injury cases must be taken to represent fair compensation in such cases unless and until those scales are amended by the courts or by Parliament. It is in our view offensive to public opinion, and rightly so, that a defamation plaintiff should recover damages for injury to reputation greater, perhaps by a significant factor, than if that same plaintiff had been rendered a helpless cripple or an insensate vegetable. The time has in our view come when judges, and counsel, should be free to draw the attention of juries to these comparisons.
 124.On this decision we wish to make two observations. First, in England, defamation actions are tried by a judge with a jury, and assessment of damages is the exclusive preserve of the jury with the benefit of direction from the trial judge. Until the decision in this case, the trial judge in giving direction to the jury on the damages was precluded from referring, among other things, to scales of damages in personal injury cases or giving some guidance as to the appropriate brackets for the damages. Nor was counsel permitted to submit to the jury the appropriate award to be made. The absence of guidelines to the jury had sometimes led to awards being made which were grossly excessive and divorced from reality. Such wildly disproportionate awards had attracted serious and justified criticisms of the procedure involved resulting in such awards. Juries were likened, in the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR, to `sheep loosed on an unfenced common, with no shepherd`.
 125.The position in Singapore is different. We do not have a jury system, and like any other actions, defamation actions are heard by judges sitting alone and damages are normally assessed by the judges themselves ( in other cases, such as personal injury cases damages are often assessed by assistant registrar) - with the result that a `coherent framework of awards` has emerged from a body of cases developed over the years which enables the courts to pitch their awards on an informed and coherent basis. This is an advantage which the other jurisdictions, eg England, do not enjoy. Sir Thomas Bingham MR was keenly alive to this when he observed in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 (supra), at p 608: 
There could never be any precise, arithmetical formula to govern the assessment of general damages in defamation, but if such cases were routinely tried by judges sitting alone there would no doubt emerge a more or less coherent framework of awards which would, while recognising the particular features of particular cases, ensure that broadly comparable cases led to broadly comparable awards. This is what has happened in the field of personal injuries since these ceased to be the subject of trial by jury and became in practice the exclusive preserve of judges. There may be even greater factual diversity in defamation than in personal injury cases, but this is something of which the framework would take account.
 126.The second observation we wish to make is that the reference to awards in personal injury cases, as decided in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
, is merely a guide to assist the jury in their determination of the amount to be awarded. The Master of the Rolls accepted that it is not possible to equiperate damages for personal injury and damages for defamation. The reference to conventional levels of award in personal injuries is meant to be a check on the reasonableness of a proposed award of damages. His Lordship said, at pp 613-614: 
it is not suggested that juries should not assess damages in defamation actions, only that they should receive guidance when doing so.
 
In the passage from the judgment of the court in the 
 Rantzen
 case 
[1994] QB 670
 which is quoted above, the Court of Appeal essentially adopted the approach of Lord Hailsham LC in 
Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 1027
 in concluding that there was no satisfactory way in which conventional awards in actions for damages for personal injuries could be used to provide guidance for an award in an action for defamation. Much depends, as we now think, on what is meant by guidance: it is one thing to say (and we agree) that there can be no precise equiparation between a serious libel and (say) serious brain damage; but it is another to point out to a jury considering the award of damages for a serious libel that the maximum conventional award for pain and suffering and loss of amenity to a plaintiff suffering from very severe brain damage is about 125,000 and that this is something of which the jury may take account.
 127.In Singapore, it has been decided that in determining the amount of damages in defamation cases, the courts do not have regard to the scale of values applied in the field of personal injury cases. In 
JB Jeyaretnam v Lee Kuan Yew
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 282
  [1978-1979] SLR 197 , this court rejected Diplock LJ`s (as he then was) approach in 
McCarey v Associated Newspapers Ltd & Ors (No 2)
 
[1965] 2 QB 86
 where his Lordship said that he did `not believe that the law today is more jealous of a man`s reputation than of his life and limb.` Wee Chong Jin CJ delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 285: 
we think it would be beyond what the present law on defamation requires to have regard to the relation of the scale of values applied in equating money and physical injuries in the field of personal injuries.
 The court preferred the approach advocated by Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in 
Broome v Cassell and Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 1027
 and approved the following passage from his speech at p 1071: 
In actions of defamation and in any other actions where damages for loss of reputation are involved, the principle of restitution in integrum has necessarily an even more highly subjective element it is not necessarily fair to compare awards of damages in this field with damages for personal injuries. Quite obviously, the award must include factors for injury to the feelings, the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology, or the reaffirmation of the truth of the matters complained of, or the malice of the defendant. The bad conduct of the plaintiff himself may also enter into the matter, where he has provoked the libel, or where perhaps he has libelled the defendant in reply. What is awarded is thus a figure which cannot be arrived at by any purely objective computation. This is what is meant when the damages in defamation are described as being `at large`.
 128.It seems to us that the main reason for not accepting awards in personal injury cases as a helpful guide in determining the amount of damages in defamation cases is that the factors relevant in the consideration of the measure of damages in the latter are quite different. First, a defamation action is fundamentally an action to vindicate a person`s reputation on a matter as to which he has been falsely defamed, and the damages awarded have to be regarded as the demonstrative mark of that vindication (per Lord Radcliffe in 
 Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd & Ors 
 (supra) at p 396). Thus, the amount of damages awarded in defamation actions is not only given in relation to circumstances of the past and present but it must be sufficient to vindicate the plaintiff`s reputation in the relevant respect in the future. As Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC said in 
 Broome v Cassell and Co Ltd 
 (supra) at p 1071: 
Not merely can [the plaintiff] recover the estimated sum of his past and future losses, but, in case the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, he must be able to point to a sum awarded by a jury sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge.
 The court also must bear in mind what Mahoney JA said in 
John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Carson
 
[1991] 24 NSWLR 259
 at p 300: 
the plaintiff has no other way of achieving vindication than by an award of damages. There is no power to force a defendant, by public advertisement or letter or otherwise, to provide a vindication of the plaintiff. Damages, and the size of the award, are the only means which ordinarily are available to attract the public or private attention involved in the vindication of the plaintiff`s position.
 129.Secondly, in defamation cases, the award also has to reflect the aggravation caused to the plaintiff by the defendant`s subsequent conduct or any mitigation, in addition to the need to vindicate the plaintiff`s good name. In 
Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 153
, Lord Donaldson MR made this point very clearly, at 175: 
In relation to claims for personal injury the law calls for compensation to be assessed by reference to the pain and suffering caused by the injury itself. In cases of libel, the law calls for compensation to be assessed by reference not only to the pain and suffering caused to the plaintiff by the publication of the libel, but also to the extent to which this pain and suffering is aggravated, or reduced, by the defendant`s subsequent conduct. It also requires account to be taken of the plaintiff`s need to receive an award which will vindicate his or her reputation in the eyes of the public.
 Hence, in 
 Rantzen 
, the English Court of Appeal concluded thus at p 695: 
Despite Mr Gray`s submissions to the contrary it seems to us that damages for defamation are intended at least in part as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public. This element of the damages was recognised by Windeyer J in 
Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd
 
[1966] 
117 CLR 118
, 150 and by Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in 
Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 1027
, 1071.
 130.Finally, we also find of assistance the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in 
 Carson 
`s case (supra) at pp 73-74: 
An attempt to compare awards made in respect of disparate heads of damage is more likely to confuse than to correct. The issue is not whether the law is more jealous of reputation than of life and limb. As we have seen, damages for defamation are not given for damage to reputation in the way that damages are given for damage to life and limb. If there were any true comparison between the two classes of case, it would be necessary to evaluate the overall depreciation in value of reputation caused by successive defamations and to limit the damages awarded against a later tortfeasor by reason of the damage earlier inflicted on the plaintiff`s reputation. When a plaintiff in a personal injuries case has been partially incapacitated by an earlier tortfeasor, the later tortfeasor`s liability is assessed on the basis that the plaintiff is already partially incapacitated. But that is not the law governing the assessment of damages for defamation. And it would be a mistake to regard the consequences of the injury inflicted in the two classes of case as being comparable.
 131.
 Irrelevant factors
Mr Gray further submits that the learned judge took into account and attached importance to matters which are wholly irrelevant in assessing damages. In particular, he refers to the learned judge`s criticisms of Mr Tang`s application to strike out certain actions by the respondents as an abuse of court processes. The learned judge also referred to Mr Tang`s non-compliance with the discovery orders in the Mareva injunction and the receivership order, his application to disqualify Lai Kew Chai J, and his contemptuous remarks about the court. All these, Mr Gray submits, are irrelevant to the assessment of damages.
 132.We think that, subject to what we say below, the learned judge was entitled to refer to the several matters and take them into account as matters aggravating the damage or harm occasioned in assessing the damages. For instance, he was entitled to take into consideration the conduct of Mr Tang with reference to the defamatory statements he uttered and the various statements he made with reference to the actions against him. It is true that one or two of the statements uttered by Mr Tang after he left Singapore, which did not form the subject matter of any suit against him, taken by themselves in isolation, probably would not aggravate the hurt to the respondents, but they must be read and considered in their proper contexts and, in those contexts, they did aggravate the defamations.
 133.However, in our opinion, there are certain matters referred to by the learned judge which, with respect, are not relevant to the issue of damages. The first is Mr Tang`s non-compliance with the terms of the Mareva injunction and receivership order. Such non-compliance is to be deprecated but is irrelevant to the issue of damages. In respect of such non-compliance, the respondents have their remedy and they successfully invoked it. They obtained orders striking out Mr Tang`s defences and in consequence interlocutory judgments were entered against him. There is yet another remedy that they could have invoked if Mr Tang were within the jurisdiction, and that is to apply for an order committing Mr Tang to imprisonment for disobedience to the court orders.
 134.Next, the learned judge also held (in [para ] 85) that Mr Tang had no qualms at all in treating the orders of court with utter contempt and in uttering scandalous and contemptuous remarks about the courts. We agree with this observation of the learned judge. We think that Mr Tang`s conduct in this respect was absolutely deplorable, and if he were within the jurisdiction, contempt proceedings might well have mounted against him. But, such conduct of Mr Tang has no relevance to the issue of damages.
 135.Lastly, there was the matter of Mr Tang`s application to disqualify Lai Kew Chai J in which he (Mr Tang) made the scurrilous attacks on the judge. We again deprecate Mr Tang`s conduct in respect of such application and the baseless allegations he made. It is obvious to us that Mr Tang found that he could not apply successfully to set aside or appeal against the Mareva injunction and the receivership order on the merits and hence resorted to the frivolous and vexatious attempt to set them aside on the ground of apparent bias. Be that as it may, it is, nonetheless, irrelevant to the issue of damages. Here again, the respondents have their remedy and it is to ask the court to condemn Mr Tang in costs on a solicitor and client basis. Such an order was indeed made against Mr Tang. In respect of these matters, it is important to bear in mind that damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiffs for the harm and injury they have suffered and not to punish Mr Tang for his improper conduct.
 136.
 Totality of the awards
Finally, we come to the last argument of Mr Gray which also has not been raised below. He submits that we must look at the totality of all the awards which is inordinately excessive and out of all proportion to the aggregate harm caused to the respondents, and which calls for a reduction to a more appropriate level. Mr Davinder Singh for Mr Lee contends that each libel or slander in the cases before us is a separate tort and each by itself justifies a separate award, and that each award should be considered individually on its merit. In his submission, the amount awarded in each case is fully justified: it is reasonable and in line with previous awards. The total of all these awards is admittedly huge, but that is because it comprises multiple awards. Counsel for the respondents in the other appeals associate themselves with this contention.
 137.We accept that each libel or slander in the cases before us constitutes a separate tort meriting separate award of damages. Nonetheless, it seems to us wrong in principle to assess and view each award individually without any regard to the totality of the awards made in favour of each of the plaintiffs. In our opinion, where two or more defamatory statements were made of the same person, though each conveying a different defamatory imputation, and there exists a close relationship between them, there will inevitably be some degree of overlap and the court must look at the totality of all the awards and moderate the quantum of the individual awards so that, in the end, it would yield a sum appropriate to compensate the plaintiff for the aggregate harm and injury occasioned by the combined or cumulative effect of the defamatory statements. Damages are compensatory, and the amount arrived at `is the product of a mixture of inextricable considerations` (per Windeyer J of the High Court of Australia in 
Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd
 
[1966] 
117 CLR 118
 at 150) and all such considerations are aimed at yielding to the successful plaintiff a fair and reasonable sum as appropriate compensation.
 138.A similar question came before the High Court of Australia in 
 Carson 
`s case (supra). There, two articles were written by one Mr Slee attacking Mr Nick Carson, a prominent member of the legal profession, which were published in the 
 Sydney Morning Herald 
 by John Fairfax & Sons Ltd. The two publications dealt with aspects of the long-running litigation involving one Dr Leszek Rajski and the company, Tectran Corporation Pty Ltd (`Tectran`). Mr Nick Carson was at the relevant time the solicitor for Tectran. In the first article, there were allegations carrying imputations of gross professional misconduct on Mr Carson`s part, the commission of civil wrongs and contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. They were very serious allegations. In the second article, the allegations there carried imputations of gross professional misconduct again and also of criminal conduct on his part. He instituted two actions: the first was against the publisher, John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (`Fairfax`) alone, and the second was against both Fairfax and Mr Slee. Both the actions were tried together in the Supreme Court of New South Wales with a jury. The plaintiff was awarded A$200,000 in respect of the first article and A$400,000 in respect of the second article. On appeal the Court of Appeal of New South Wales set aside the awards as being excessive and ordered a new trial limited to the question of damages. Upon special leave being granted the plaintiff appealed to the High Court of Australia. By a majority, the High Court dismissed the appeal. The court held, inter alia, that where claims of closely related defamatory publications were heard together it is permissible and sensible to consider `whether the total of the two verdicts so exceeds the amount appropriate to compensate the plaintiff for the total harm he suffered by reason of the combined effect of the two publications that it is apparent that one or both of the verdicts must demonstrably be perverse`.
 139.In reaching its decision, the majority of the High Court consisting of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron JJ said the following, at pp 54-55: 
While the two publications were different and conveyed different defamatory imputations, there was a clear and close relationship between them. Both were written by the same person and published in the same section of different issues of the same newspaper. Each of them was defamatory of the appellant in respect of conduct relating to the same series of litigation. The effect of the defamatory publications was cumulative. The second compounded the harm to the appellant caused by the first: it renewed and expanded the hurt to his feelings; it exacerbated the damage to the reputation which he had hitherto enjoyed in legal, commercial and other circles ` it is permissible and sensible in a case where claims for closely related defamatory publications have been heard together for a jury, in determining what is the appropriate compensation to be awarded to the plaintiff in respect of each publication, to take account of the aggregate `harm` suffered by the plaintiff by reason of both of them. Similarly, 
 it is permissible and sensible
 for an appellate court in such a case
 to address the question whether the total of the two verdicts so exceeds the amount appropriate to compensate the plaintiff for the total harm suffered by reason of the combined effect of the two publications
 that it is apparent that one or both of the jury`s verdicts must demonstrably be perverse. Indeed, there could be circumstances in which common sense and the need to avoid double compensation would make it all but essential that a jury or an appellate court address some such question. [Emphasis is ours.]
 140.We respectfully agree with their Honours. Adopting their words, we are of the opinion that where two or more publications have been made concerning the same person but are 
 different 
 and convey 
 different 
 defamatory imputations, and there is a clear and close relationship between them, it is relevant to inquire whether the total of several awards made in favour of that person exceeds the maximum amount of damages as would reflect or represent the appropriate compensation for the aggregate harm and injury inflicted upon him. Such inquiries will prevent the risk of over-compensation through overlapping, and is eminently a sensible and fair approach.
 141.Reverting to these cases before us, we think that except for the statement made by Mr Tang in the Chinese magazine, 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
, on 2 June 1996 relating to the purchases of the 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
 apartments by Mr Lee and BG Lee, which gave rise to the action in Suit No 1116 of 1996, and which really was a statement standing on its own, all the other statements made by Mr Tang which gave rise to the 12 subsequent actions had a close relationship. They were all made by Mr Tang and all of them arose out of the underlying saga which began when Mr Goh and Mr Lee and their colleagues sought to expose him as a Chinese chauvinist or an anti-Christian and anti-English educated Chinese. Five of these statements, which formed the subject matters of seven of the actions, were made during the short span of three days from 30 December 1996 to 1 January 1997 at the hustings for the General Election. Two of the other statements, which became the subject matters of the remaining five actions, though made subsequently, were, nonetheless, made by Mr Tang in connection with what he had said or done previously. All the statements, as the learned judge found and we agree, were directed principally at Mr Goh and Mr Lee, and all of them had a political flavour. In our opinion, the consideration of these factors weighs heavily in the overall assessment of damages in these cases and calls for a moderation of the individual awards.
 142.
 Aggravating circumstances
There is yet another reason which impels us to come to the conclusion that the individual awards of damages should be moderated. This relates to the treatment of the aggravating circumstances in these cases. What was before the learned judge was highly exceptional. There were altogether 13 cases and, as the learned judge found, among the 13 cases there were many common factors, eg absence of retraction or apology and repeated aggravations. These 13 cases called for a total of 25 awards of damages, and 25 awards were made. The learned judge found (in [para ] 110 of his judgment) that, in terms of aggravation, the 13 cases `have no equal` and he ought to take the very high level of aggravation into account in assessing the quantum. It seems to us that he took this high level of aggravation in assessing each award of damages in favour of each plaintiff in each of the 13 cases. In other words, where more than one award were to be made to a plaintiff, the learned judge applied the same set of aggravating factors in assessing each award in favour of the same plaintiff. This exercise inevitably gives rise to `double` or `multiple countings` of the aggregate aggravating circumstances with reference to a plaintiff entitled to two or more awards of damages, with the result that the totality of the awards to such a plaintiff has become overblown and is hugely disproportionate to the aggregate harm and injury occasioned. Such a high degree of overlap similarly calls for a moderation of the individual awards to each of the plaintiffs entitled to two or more awards.
 143.Further, in considering the aggravation of the defamation, the learned judge found that `at every turn Mr Tang would repeat and thus aggravated the various defamations`. It seems to us, with respect, that strictly this is not correct if the aggravation is considered in totality in relation to the 13 cases. The position as we see it is that during the short period between 30 December 1996 and 23 January 1997, `at every turn`, Mr Tang made statements either defaming the plaintiff or plaintiffs (as the case may be) or aggravating the defamations he had uttered. But those statements which were defamatory - at least most of them - spawned no less than 12 actions against him, and these statements by themselves formed the separate subject matters of the 12 actions in respect of which separate awards of damages were made. Each of these statements therefore cannot constitute or be relied upon as a ground for aggravated damages in the other action or actions. To do so would again give rise to `double or multiple countings`.
 144.
 Precedent cases
Before we consider the individual awards made in the cases before us it is helpful to turn to our `framework` of decided cases over the last few years to determine whether the awards given in these cases are so excessive as to be outside the range of what would reasonably be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances.
 145.We may take as the starting point the case of 
Lee Kuan Yew v Seow Khee Leng
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 172
  
[1988] SLR 832
 , where the allegations were that Mr Lee, who was then the Prime Minister of Singapore, had been guilty of corrupt, criminal and/or dishonourable conduct in the discharge of his office. Following the defamatory statement there was substantial aggravation, although at the trial the defendant admitted the claim and apologised. An award of $250,000 was made.
 146.In 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  
[1989] SLR 1063
 , Mr Lee who was the Prime Minister of Singapore was alleged to have been guilty of dishonourable and discreditable conduct through the improper use of the Internal Security Act and to have attacked the Catholic church. There was also substantial aggravation both before and at the trial and the award made was $230,000.
 147.In 
Lee Kuan Yew v Quek Teow Chuan
 (Unreported) , Mr Lee sued the defendant for two slanders; the first, imputing that Mr Lee corruptly derived personal benefit from compulsory acquisition of land by the government, and the second, imputing that Mr Lee had corrupt intention in participating in the decision of the government to proceed with the construction of the Mass Rapid Transit System. He was awarded a sum of $200,000 for each slander making a total of $400,000.
 148.In 
Lee Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 322
  
[1990] SLR 688
 , Mr Lee, who was then the Prime Minister of Singapore, was alleged to have encouraged and abetted the suicide of a government minister to avoid an embarrassing scandal. He sued for defamation and was awarded a sum of $260,000 which on appeal was upheld by this court: 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
.
 149.In the case of 
Vasoo v Chee Soon Juan
 (Unreported) the defendant, a lecturer of the department of Social Work and Psychology of the National University of Singapore, was dismissed by the University. In an interview with a journalist of 
 The Straits Times 
 he made allegations imputing that the plaintiff, who was then the head of that department and a member of Parliament, had fabricated evidence to Parliament to justify his dismissal. The plaintiff sued for damages for slander and also for libel in respect of the republication in 
 The Straits Times 
 and was awarded a sum of $210,000 in damages.
 150.In 
Lee Kuan Yew & Anor v Vinocur & Ors
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 477
 , a libellous article was published in the 
 International Herald Tribune 
 imputing nepotism in the Government on the part of Mr Lee, BG Lee and Mr Goh. They sued the executive editor, the chief executive and publisher of the newspaper and also the author of the article. An apology was read in open court. The awards made were $350,000 to Mr Goh, and $300,000 each to Mr Lee and BG Lee.
 151.Following that case came 
Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur & Ors
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 542
  (`
 Vinocur (No 2) 
`), in which the amount of damages awarded was $400,000. We shall discuss this case in some detail in a moment.
 152.Finally, in the very recent case of 
Chiam See Tong v Ling How Doong & Ors
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 648
 , the plaintiff who is an opposition member of Parliament was alleged to have been a puppet, stooge and/or lackey of the PAP and to have compromised his political principle and integrity as an opposition MP because of his quest for personal political power and his resentment against the Singapore Democratic Party, to the extent of even attempting to destroy his own party. Damages were awarded to him in the sum of $120,000.
 153.The precedent cases to which the learned judge referred in assessing damages, particularly damages to be awarded to Mr Lee and Mr Goh, were cases where Mr Lee himself was involved: see [para ] 88-93. Such reference is undoubtedly appropriate. The learned judge observed that, as of that date, the highest award given was $400,000 in 
 Vinocur (No 2) 
 and he had earlier held that the amount to be awarded in Suit Nos 1116/96 and 172/97 should be significantly more than the highest award given to date. The learned judge said in [para ] 110: 
On the authorities the highest award given by our courts was $400,000 in 
Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 542
 . It is beyond doubt that the level of aggravation in 
 Vinocur
 was nowhere near that of the present cases. I have already alluded to some of the aggravating circumstances. It cannot be disputed that in terms of aggravation, these 13 cases have no equal. Therefore I ought to take the very high level of aggravation into account in assessing quantum. Nevertheless in law, damages awarded for defamation are to compensate, not to punish.
 154.On 
 Vinocur (No 2) 
 we have the following observations. That case arose out of a publication in the 
 International Herald Tribune 
 which carried an article libellous of Mr Lee and he sued four defendants for defamation. The first, third and fourth defendants were respectively the executive editor, the editor for Asia and the publisher of the newspaper. All of them apologised for the publication. They also reached an amicable settlement with Mr Lee and at the hearing for assessment of damages a consent judgment in the sum of $300,000 as damages was entered against them. The second defendant was the author of the article and he did not apologise. The action therefore proceeded against him. However, he did not enter an appearance, with the result that the plaintiff successfully applied for judgment in default of appearance. Damages were later assessed and a sum of $400,000 (inclusive of the sum of $300,000 recovered from the other three defendants) was awarded. In coming to this figure the trial judge adopted the following approach. He said at p 547: 
For the injury caused to the plaintiff by the article the damages payable was, as between the plaintiff and the other defendants, agreed at $300,000 and a consent judgment entered into to that effect. I am satisfied that that sum was a fair measure of damages to award to the plaintiff for the libel suffered considering the conciliatory way in which the other defendants conducted themselves after the publication of the libel.
 
But the second defendant conducted himself differently
 He then dealt with the various aggravating circumstances occasioned by the second defendant and said: 
The conduct of the second defendant shows that he was motivated by malice and was intent on injuring the plaintiff as widely and gravely as possible. The award of the $300,000 made as against the other defendants did not take these aggravating factors into account. Also that award was against the editors and publisher who, as a general rule, would be less culpable than the author of an article.
 155.In our opinion, with respect, the learned judge erred in two respects. First, the learned judge held that the amount of $300,000 was fair and then added an amount to it as representing the aggravations caused by the second defendant. That, in our opinion, is not a correct approach. He should assess, first, what was a fair and reasonable award to be made for the harm and injury occasioned to the plaintiff, and then take into account the amount previously recovered from the other defendants so as to avoid double compensation for the same harm and injury.
 156.Secondly, it is not correct to take the amount of $300,000 as a criterion or one of the criteria in the assessment, as that was the figure agreed to between the parties. In fact, that was agreed even before the learned judge proceeded with the assessment and the consent judgment was recorded at an earlier hearing before another judge. Its fairness or otherwise did not arise, and should not have arisen, before the learned judge in assessing the damages to be awarded against the second defendant.
 157.Even if we are wrong on the above, we think that in the circumstances of that case the award of $400,000 was on the high side.
 158.
 The individual awards
Before we turn to the individual awards, we wish to register a caveat on quantum of damages for defamation. As reflected in those precedent cases, substantial damages have been awarded for defamation. Indeed, there appears to be a trend of such damages rising steadily and significantly over the past few years, and in a few recent cases, each successive award appeared to overtop the preceding one. Such a trend should be discouraged; otherwise, damages for defamation would mount and eventually become extremely high, ranking almost with the grossly exorbitant awards so often made by juries in other jurisdictions. Lest it should be misunderstood, we are not suggesting in any way that there should be a cap placed on quantum of damages for defamation. We accept that `there could never be any precise, arithmetical formula to govern the assessment of general damages in defamation` (per Sir Thomas Bingham MR in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 (supra) at p 608). Each case depends on its own facts and there is a great deal of factual diversity in defamation cases. However, we wish to stress that damages, even for defamation, should fall within a reasonable bracket so that what is awarded represents a fair and reasonable sum which is proportionate to the harm and injury occasioned to the victim who has been unjustly defamed. On this point, we share the sentiment so succinctly expressed by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 (supra) at p 611: 
Any legal process should yield a successful plaintiff appropriate compensation, that is, compensation which is neither too much nor too little. That is so whether the award is made by judge or jury. No other result can be accepted as just.
 Bearing this in mind we now turn to the individual awards in these cases.
 159.Mr Goh sued Mr Tang in three actions, namely, Suit Nos 2524 of 1996, and 187 and 244 of 1997, in respect of statements made by Mr Tang on three separate occasions. Very briefly, the first statement imputed that Mr Goh had committed a criminal offence and that he was a liar; the second, that, among others, Mr Goh had by taking the defamation suits abused the court process and made use of the legal process as a political weapon to destroy him financially and politically; and the third, that Mr Goh was not an honest person and/or a man of integrity or worthy of trust. Of these, we consider that the first statement is the most serious, and the third is more serious than the second. Mr Goh was one of the main targets of Mr Tang`s defamatory statements. The learned judge awarded him $600,000 in Suit No 2524 of 1996, $450,000 in Suit No 187 of 1997 and $350,000 in Suit No 244 of 1997.
 160.As we have shown, the three statements in the actions were closely related, having arisen out of the same underlying saga, and we must take into consideration the cumulative effect of these defamatory statements and the extent they had exacerbated the hurt to Mr Goh`s feelings. For the reasons we have given and having regard to what we have said in [para ] 132-143 above, the awards made below are, in our judgment, highly excessive, and the individual award in each of the three cases should be moderated so that the awards in their totality would yield an appropriate sum which is fair and reasonable that would compensate Mr Goh for the aggregate harm and injury inflicted. Accordingly, we would reduce the amounts awarded below to $270,000 in Suit No 2524 of 1996, $200,000 in Suit No 187 of 1997 and $230,000 in Suit No 244 of 1997, yielding a total of $700,000. We so order.
 161.Next, we come to the awards to Mr Lee. Five actions were instituted by Mr Lee against Mr Tang. For convenience, we shall deal first with the awards of damages to Mr Lee and BG Lee in Suit No 1116 of 1996 in respect of the defamatory statement made by Mr Tang and appearing in the Chinese magazine, 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
, concerning their purchases of the 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
 apartments. In that suit, Mr Lee and BG Lee sued Mr Tang and three other defendants for defamation. The three defendants apologised and came to an amicable settlement with Mr Lee and BG Lee. They paid Mr Lee and BG Lee each a sum of $450,000 as compensation. By virtue of s 19 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75), Mr Lee and BG Lee would be entitled thereafter to pursue their claims against Mr Tang, and they pursued their claims against him. The court below awarded damages in the sums of $550,000 and $500,000 to Mr Lee and BG Lee respectively, in each case inclusive of the $450,000. In other words, on the basis of the awards what they have been paid must be brought into account so as to avoid double recovery, and Mr Tang had only to pay Mr Lee and BG Lee $100,000 and $50,000 respectively.
 162.Now, the statement was made by Mr Tang on 2 June 1996 and in terms of time it has no relationship with those statements made by Mr Tang about seven months later which gave rise to the other 12 actions taken against Mr Tang. This defamatory statement is `free standing` by itself and must be considered on its own. With the exception of the three statements he made at the WP rallies on 31 December 1997 which formed the subject matters of a separate action in Suit No 172 of 1997, much of what Mr Tang said and did during the hustings for the General Election in late December 1996 and soon thereafter while he was abroad, in terms of aggravation, had little bearing or relevance on the subject matter of the Suit No 1116 of 1996; they did not aggravate the defamatory statement said of Mr Lee and BG Lee.
 163.It is significant that in their amended statement of claim filed on 21 June 1996 Mr Lee and BG Lee relied on as aggravation: (i) their positions and standings; (ii) their conduct in not having provoked the defamatory statement; (iii) the nature and gravity of the defamation; (iv) the mode and extent of publication; and (v) the failure of Mr Tang to apologise and retract. In terms of express malice as pleaded in the amended reply filed on 31 January 1997 they relied substantially on the three statements made at the WP rallies on 31 December 1996. They relied also on some other matters which, in our opinion, are more relevant to the other 12 actions than this action. We are not saying that there had been no aggravations here; quite clearly there were. But in so far as those aggravating circumstances relate to the other 12 actions they have no relevance or have very little relevance to this action, and therefore do not play a significant role in the assessment of damages here.
 164.For the reasons we have given and having regard to the precedent cases which we have discussed, we are of the opinion that the awards made below are highly excessive and should be reduced. In our judgment, in the circumstances, a fair and reasonable award to Mr Lee would be a sum of $400,000 and to BG Lee a sum of $350,000. However, as they have each recovered $450,000 from the other defendants they have been adequately compensated for the harm and injury sustained. In these circumstances, in our judgment, no further award of damages ought to be made. Accordingly, we set aside the awards made below in their favour in this action.
 165.At this juncture it is convenient to deal with Suit No 172 of 1997 which was instituted by Mr Lee and BG Lee in respect of Mr Tang`s statements of their purchases of the 
 Nassim Jade 
 and 
 Scotts 28 
 apartments. It may be recalled that at the three WP rallies held on 31 December 1996 Mr Tang raised again Mr Lee`s and BG Lee`s purchases of their apartments from HPL imputing impropriety on their part. In dealing with damages in this action, Chao Hick Tin J said at [para ] 103: 
In law every defamatory utterance, even though it may be a repeat of the same, could be subject of a separate action. A plaintiff who chooses not to sue on the second utterance is of course entitled to rely on that as a ground for aggravated damages. But, in the case of a plaintiff who chooses to sue on the second utterance, having regard to the principle of overlap, there is some merit in the view that the second utterance should not cause the same degree of hurt and damage as to merit an award of the same or higher amount than for the first utterance. However, in the present case, Suit No 172/97 concerned not only one subsequent utterance but four and expressed in three separate rallies. So any reduction on account of overlap should be minimal. This court is not inclined to sanction any proposition which would allow a person to repeatedly defame another person and get away cheaply just because there was an earlier action on the same defamatory remark. In so saying I am conscious of section 16 of the Defamation Act
 In conclusion, he awarded damages in the sums of $500,000 and $450,000 to Mr Lee and BG Lee respectively.
 166.We agree with the principle adopted by the learned judge in his approach to the assessment. It is with regard to the application of the principle that we respectfully disagree with him. Where a statement is potentially defamatory, and the tortfeasor insists on repeating it, he must take the risk that, should his statement be found defamatory, he will have to pay for every defamatory statement he made. Where a person insists on repeating his libel, he cannot escape with impunity the consequences of his repetition on the basis that there has already been an action on the same libel. That having said, it is equally wrong, in principle, in such a case to consider each defamatory statement separately and determine an amount for each without any reference to the other award made in respect of the other statement.
 167.Reverting to the instant case, it is true that Mr Tang made the three defamatory statements in the course of one day which formed the subject matters of the action in Suit No 172 of 1997 and these defamatory statements were made about seven months after the earlier statement to 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
. But one must not lose sight of the pith and substance of the defamatory statements. In both cases, the subject matters of the defamation relate to Mr Lee`s and BG Lee`s purchases of their properties from HPL. The sting of the defamation in Suit No 172 of 1997 was the same as or similar to that in the earlier libel in Suit No 1116 of 1996. It follows that, to the extent that Mr Lee and BG Lee had received substantial sums in the earlier action, the amounts to be awarded in the second suit must necessarily be moderated. With respect, we do not agree with the learned judge that any reduction of the amount of damages to be awarded in the subsequent action should be minimal.
 168.We also have to bear in mind s 16 of the Defamation Act. That section provides: 
In any action for libel or slander, the defendant may give evidence in mitigation of damages that the plaintiff has recovered damages or has brought actions for damages, for libel or slander in respect of the publication of words to the same effect as the words on which the action is founded, or has received or agreed to receive compensation in respect of any such publication.
 The object of this section is to prevent multiple actions on the same or similar libels or slanders. In 
Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
, the plaintiffs brought two separate actions against two newspapers for defamation in respect of similar libels, and the two actions were tried separately. The House of Lords held that, pursuant to s 12 of the Defamation Act 1952, which is substantially similar to s 16 of our Defamation Act, the jury in each case should be directed to consider how far the damage suffered by the plaintiffs could reasonably be attributed solely to the libel with which they were concerned and how far it ought to be regarded as the joint result of the two libels so that the plaintiffs would not be compensated twice for the same loss. Lord Reid said, at p 261: 
Here there were similar libels published in two national newspapers on the same day and each has to be dealt with by a different jury. If each jury were to award damages without regard to the fact that the plaintiffs are also entitled to damages against the other newspaper, the aggregate of the damages in the two actions would almost certainly be too large. Section 12 of the Defamation Act 1952, is intended to deal with that. In effect it requires that each jury shall be told about the other action, but the question is what each jury should be told. I do not think it is sufficient merely to tell each jury to make such allowance as they may think fit. They ought, in my view, to be directed that in considering the evidence submitted to them they should consider how far the damage suffered by the plaintiffs can reasonably be attributed solely to the libel with which they are concerned and how far it ought to be regarded as the joint result of the two libels. If they think that some part of the damage is the joint result of the two libels they should bear in mind that the plaintiffs ought not to be compensated twice for the same loss. They can only deal with this matter on very broad lines and they must take it that the other jury will be given a similar direction. They must do the best they can to ensure that the sum which they award will fully compensate the plaintiffs for the damage caused by the libel with which they are concerned, but will not take into account that part of the total damage suffered by the plaintiffs which ought to enter into the other jury`s assessment.
 169.Further, there is one other material consideration here. The statements in this action have a close relationship to the other statements made by Mr Tang concerning Mr Lee and BG Lee respectively during the period between 30 December 1996 and 23 January 1997 which gave rise to separate actions taken by them respectively. For these reasons and having regard to what we have held in [para ] 132-143, we are of the opinion that an award of $250,000 to Mr Lee and $220,000 to BG Lee would be fair and reasonable. The awards below are accordingly varied.
 170.There remain the three other suits taken out by Mr Lee, namely, Suit Nos 2523 of 1996, 181 of 1997 and 182 of 1997. They were based on the statements made by Mr Tang during the period from 30 December 1996 to 10 January 1997. Very briefly, the first statement imputed that Mr Lee had committed a criminal offence and that he was a liar; the second, that by taking the defamation suits he had abused the court process and made use of the process to destroy Mr Tang financially and politically; and the third, that he was not an honest person and/or a man of integrity or worthy of trust, in particular having regard to the incident relating to some `Nanyang University students`. Of these we consider that the first allegation is the most serious, and the third allegation is more serious than the second. These statements, as we have held, are closely related and regard must be had to the aggregate of the three awards and the award we have made in Suit No 172 of 1997 as discussed in the preceding paragraph. On the basis of what we have held, the individual awards in each of these actions should be moderated. In our judgment, in the circumstances, the awards made below should be reduced to $270,000 in Suit No 2523 of 1996, $200,000 in Suit No 181 of 1997 and $230,000 in Suit No 182 of 1997 yielding a total sum of $700,000. We so order.
 171.RADM Teo, Mr Ch`ng, Dr Ow, Mr Chin, Dr Ker and Mr Seng together brought two actions against Mr Tang in respect of two statements made by him on 30 December 1996 and 23 January 1997 respectively. Apart from the `totality principle`, vindication and the other relevant factors which we have discussed earlier, there is one further point we should bear in mind in these actions. As found by the learned judge (in [para ] 112 of his judgment), and we agree, all the utterances made by Mr Tang were mainly directed at Mr Goh and Mr Lee. Thus, in so far as these plaintiffs are concerned, we do not think that there was very much aggravation of the defamations in question, and the element of aggravated damages would not be considerable. For this reason and on the basis of what we have held in [para ] 132-143, we are of the opinion that the awards to them should in each case be moderated.
 172.Accordingly, for RADM Teo, who is a Cabinet Minister, we award a sum of $170,000 in Suit No 2525 of 1996 and $130,000 in Suit No 188 of 1997, making a total of $300,000. For Mr Ch`ng and Dr Ow, both of whom have been long-serving members of Parliament, we award each of them a sum of $140,000 in Suit No 2525 of 1996 and $110,000 in Suit No 188 of 1997, making a total of $250,000. As regards Mr Chin and Dr Ker, we award each of them a sum of $120,000 in Suit No 2525 of 1996 and $80,000 in Suit No 188 of 1997, making a total of $200,000 to each. Finally, for Mr Seng Han Thong, we award a sum of $90,000 in Suit No 2525 of 1996 and $60,000 in Suit No 188 of 1997, making a total award of $150,000.
 173.
 CA 114, 115, 116 of 1997
There remain these three appeals which arose from Suit Nos 70, 76 and 82 of 1997 respectively involving a police report made by Mr Tang on 1 January 1997. The plaintiffs in these suits are BG Lee, Dr Tan and Mr Lee Yock Suan respectively. They each averred that the content of the report was defamatory of them and that Mr Tang was actuated by express malice in making the police report, and claimed damages for publication of the report to the police officers and the republications of the report by the media. The content of the police report has been set out earlier, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here.
 174.
 Libel to the police officers
Dealing first with the original libel to the police officers, such an occasion would ordinarily be protected by qualified privilege, since the statement could be said to be made in furtherance or protection of a private interest. But the difficulty here is that in each case Mr Tang`s defence was properly struck out. By reason of that, he would be deemed to have admitted that he made the police report with malice. In law, where the defendant is actuated by express malice, his defence of qualified privilege is defeated. Alternatively, since the defence was struck out, there was no defence of qualified privilege, or for that matter, there was no other defence. Looking at the suits either way, Mr Tang was liable for the original publication to the police. Hence, damages would still be awarded for the publication of the report to the police officers, although a relevant consideration on the issue of damages is the very limited circulation involved.
 175.
 Republications by the media
We turn next to the claim for damages occasioned by the republications of the police report by the media; the report appeared in the various newspapers, including 
 The New Paper 
, 
 The Straits Times 
 and the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
. The 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 article was also made available on the Internet through the
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 Online Home Page AsiaOne which was accessible to worldwide users.
 176.All the plaintiffs in their respective statements of claim averred, in substance, that in making the police report Mr Tang intended the republications of the report by the media or that the republications by the media were the natural and probable consequence of his report. Thus, all three of them attributed to Mr Tang the republications of the police report by the media.
 177.In fact, what had transpired was that on the eve of the polling day Mr Tang made two police reports, and at the WP rally in the evening of the same day Mr Jeyaretnam, who was the running mate of Mr Tang in the Cheng San GRC, at the instance of Mr Tang announced that Mr Tang had lodged two police reports against the PAP leaders. But, Mr Jeyaretnam did not repeat the content of either of the police reports to the crowd. It is accepted that subsequently Mr Goh obtained a copy each of the police reports and authorised Mr Lee to release them, and they were released to the media by Mr Lee`s press secretary. Hence, on the basis of these facts Mr Gray argues that Mr Tang was not responsible for the republications and no damages should be awarded for such republications.
 178.As we have narrated, two police reports were made by Mr Tang but only one of them gave rise to the claims by the three plaintiffs in the three actions respectively, and it was not claimed that the other report was defamatory. Hence, for the purpose of this appeal, we are concerned only with the offending report that gave rise to the three actions.
 179.Before us, counsel for BG Lee, Dr Tan and Mr Lee Yock Suan respectively submit that the republications of the police reports by the media were the natural and probable consequence of Mr Tang`s original publication to the police. The thrust of their contention is that Mr Goh and Mr Lee had to release the reports to the press, and the release was necessary to avoid any erroneous public impression that there was something to hide. Mr Jeyaretnam had, after all, on the urging by Mr Tang, announced the lodging of the police reports. Hence, the police reports had to be released to the media `to contain the harm`, and to defend themselves (that is, the PAP leaders), it was decided that the public should know what had been alleged by Mr Tang. Thus, the republications flowed from Mr Tang`s original publication. Alternatively, it is argued that since Mr Tang had made the reports in those circumstances and having indicated at the rally that he made the police reports, he must also have intended the republications.
 180.As we see it, the police reports were lodged by Mr Tang on the eve of polling day, and the purpose was apparently to boost his electoral chances. It seems to us that it was a matter of political exigency to the PAP leaders that the reports should be made public to neutralise whatever effect Mr Tang sought to make out of them so that the voters could make their choice on an informed basis. Of course, Mr Tang must have known that the press and public would be interested in knowing what allegations had been levelled at Mr Goh, Mr Lee and the other PAP leaders. He also must have known that the media would try to obtain a copy each of the police reports. However, it does not follow that by reason of this, the republications of the contents of the reports were the `natural and probable consequence` of his original publication to the police. Nor can it be said that by acting in the way he did he intended the republications by the media.
 181.We find the decision of Hallett J in 
 McWhirter v Manning & Ors 
 (
 The Times 
, 30 October 1954) of some assistance here. In that case the plaintiff sued Mr Manning and others for defamation in respect of a speech made by Mr Manning at an annual meeting of the National Union of Journalists which was subsequently published. It was held that Mr Manning was only liable for the slander, and not for the libel occasioned by the publication. It was reported as follows: 
His Lordship, giving judgment, said that on the issue of libel it was argued that, because Mr Manning knew that there were reporters at the meeting and that a report of what he said might and probably would appear in the printed report, he must be taken as having caused the publication of the defamatory words in the report.
 
His Lordship referred to the authorities, and said that, on the facts, it was plain that once the words had flown out of Mr Manning`s mouth he did nothing further whatever to procure publication of those words, or some or any of them, in a printed form. From then onwards it was other people who got them into print. There was no evidence which warranted a finding that the first defendant published the libel as distinct from publishing the slander, and he (his Lordship) so held. It followed that the first defendant was not liable in respect of the libel.
 It was further reported that the learned judge held as follows: 
But in the present case the printers were not employed by the first defendant. If one asked the question, `Was Manning the cause or a cause of the libel being published?` the answer seemed to be No. He was a 
 causa sine qua non
 in the sense that if he had never made the speech there would have been no speech to report; but he was certainly not the 
 causa causans
 and did not cause the publication of the libel. The responsibility for producing the libel was quite clearly on the union and the printers whom they employed, and there was no case against the printers.
 182.The fact remains that Mr Tang never procured the republication of his police reports, apart from asking Mr Jeyaretnam to announce to the crowd at the rally that he had lodged two police reports against the PAP leaders. At the highest, and this is purely speculative, it might be said that Mr Tang intended the content of the police report to be released to the media 
 by the police 
 since he had filed the report with the latter. But, since Mr Goh and Mr Lee had obtained a copy each of the reports and authorised their release to the press on their own volition, it cannot be said that in those circumstances the republications were the natural and probable consequence of the original publication. Nor can it be said that Mr Tang intended the republication of the reports by the media.
 183.In assessing the damages in these three cases, Chao Hick Tin J held in [para ] 46 of his judgment: 
The police report was released to the media through the Secretary General of the WP at a rally that evening and it was carried in the media on 2 and 3 January 1997. Mr Tang knew and intended that the report would be so published.
 In all probability, the learned judge reached the above conclusion on the basis of the statements of claim. Counsel for all three respondents in these actions, as well as counsel for Mr Lee and Mr Goh, were quick to inform this court that at the time of the assessment of damages before the learned judge, they did not deliberately suppress the fact concerning who released the police reports to the media. They would have offered the court all the relevant facts, but it did not occur to them at the time, as the matter was never raised. We accept their explanation. It is quite clear that the oversight was unintentional.
 184.In our opinion, as Mr Tang was not responsible for the republications, it must follow that the damage occasioned by the republications of the police report in question by the media cannot be attributed to Mr Tang. This is a very material fact in the assessment of damages. A useful case which illustrates this point is 
 Gorman v Mudd 
 (15 October 1992, Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1076 of 1992, unreported) referred to in the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in 
 John v MGN Ltd 
 (supra). In that case, the plaintiff was a member of Parliament and she sued one of her constituents for a libel contained in a mock press release. The publication was made only to 91 people, but they were `prominent, influential, local and knowledgeable members of the constituency party`. The defendant pleaded justification and persisted in this defence. The plaintiff alleged express malice. The jury rejected the defence of justification and found express malice on the part of the defendant. They awarded damages in the sum of 150,000. On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the award was grossly excessive and in exercise of its power reduced the amount to 50,000. One of the factors that played a part in the reduction of damages was the limited audience. Russell LJ in his judgment said, at p 12 of the transcript: 
A very important consideration must always be the extent of publication and in my view this case is not to be compared with a libel appearing in a national newspaper. It is a fact of life that many people believe everything they read in newspapers, so that defamatory material can attract a very wide audience in a particular damaging way for the victim.
 185.There is also an old local case bearing on the same point which is of some assistance: 
Tan Chee Kong v Lee Ee Liat
 
[1949] MLJ 277
 . There, the defendant sent a letter by post to the plaintiff, and outside the envelope he inserted the words `Ex-Informer - Kempeitai` just after the name of the plaintiff. The latter sued the defendant for damages for libel and it was held that the words were defamatory of him. A point was raised by the defendant that there was no publication as the postal employees were sworn to secrecy. Taylor J who heard the case rejected this argument, but held that since the publication was limited to the postal employees, it materially reduced the damages. He said, at p 278: 
Though there was publication it was limited in extent and the matter is much less serious than publication in a newspaper or in any other form which would ordinarily reach a large number of people on whom no obligation of secrecy rested. This materially reduces the damages.
 186.Reverting to these cases before us, we think the circulation of the report was very limited. The report was published to a few police officers at most, and there was certainly no evidence of a wide circulation of the reports even among the officers. In view of this, the amounts awarded below obviously cannot stand and must be considerably reduced.
 187.We deal first with the quantum of damages awarded to BG Lee: the amount awarded is $350,000. For the reason that the damage occasioned by the republication cannot be attributed to Mr Tang and the very limited circulation involved, and also for the additional reason (which does not apply to Dr Tan and Mr Lee Yock Suan) that BG Lee has already been awarded a sum of $220,000 in Suit No 172 of 1997 which bears a close relationship with this suit, a fair and reasonable sum which we consider appropriate would be $130,000. Accordingly, we vary the award below to this amount.
 188.We now come to the awards to Dr Tan and Mr Lee Yock Suan. Again, as the damage occasioned by the republication of the defamatory report cannot be attributed to Mr Tang and considering the very limited circulation involved, their awards would also have to be reduced. But in respect of each of them, the `totality principle` which we have earlier discussed has no application. So far as both of them are concerned, theirs is a case where the same statement made by a person defames different plaintiffs who instituted parallel suits against him. In these circumstances, it would not be right that, just because the person has defamed multiple victims in one statement, the award to each of them should be moderated or lowered. No doubt, from the point of view of the tortfeasor, he has made only one statement; thus he should pay the `price` of that one statement. But he has defamed multiple victims and each victim is entitled to a sum which will be compensatory in terms of vindication of his reputation and as consolation to him for the wrong done.
 189.In our judgment, a fair and reasonable award would be a sum of $150,000 to Dr Tan and a sum of $130,000 to Mr Lee Yock Suan. We so order.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This appeal arises out of the decision of Lai Siu Chiu J on 2 April 1997 to strike out the appellants` claim for libel pursuant to O 18 r 19 Rules of Court 1996 against the first, fourth and fifth respondents.
 2.The appellants are advocates and solicitors practising as a firm. They were initially appointed by Promenade Properties Pte Ltd (the company) to represent the company in the sale and purchase transaction of a building owned by the company (the Promenade). The respondents were the directors of the company during the relevant period. The action for defamation initiated by the appellants centred around a board resolution passed by the respondents on 10 January 1997 to dismiss the appellants as solicitors in the transaction. The appellants alleged that the resolution contained defamatory remarks against them.
 3.The appellants, being dissatisfied with Lai Siu Chiu J`s decision, petitioned to this court to reverse the learned judge`s finding and to restore the order made by the assistant registrar below to dismiss the first, fourth and fifth respondents` application to strike out the action.
 4.The appeal came up for hearing before us on 20 October 1997. After hearing lengthy arguments by counsel on both sides, we allowed the appeal and dismissed the respondents` application to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim. We will now set out the grounds of our decision.
 5.
 The facts
On 20 February 1997, the appellants brought an action against the first to fifth respondents, directors of the company, by way of a writ of summons, alleging that the respondents had falsely and maliciously, jointly and/or severally, published and/or caused to be published, defamatory words which concerned the way the appellants conducted their affairs in their office and profession. The basis upon which the appellants founded their claim was a board resolution dated 10 January 1997.
 6.Before going into the alleged defamatory words in question, some mention of the background to the passing of the resolution was required as it provided a clearer picture of the context in which the resolution was made. The first to fifth respondents, together with three others, (who were not parties to the action), were directors of the company. On 25 September 1996, the Promenade, a piece of property owned by the company, was sold for $270,865,000. By a shareholders` resolution dated 25 September 1996, the appellants, together with another firm, Wee Ramayah & Partners, were appointed to jointly and severally act and represent the company in the sale. The deposit, which amounted to 10% of the purchase price, was held by the appellants in a fixed deposit account, with two lawyers (one from the appellants and one from Lee & Lee, the purchaser`s solicitors) as joint signatories to the moneys held under stakeholdership. The company wanted the appellants to confirm that the interest on the stakeholders` deposit would be paid to the company. The alleged defamatory statements were made in relation to the dismissal of the appellants as the company`s solicitors in the transaction after unsatisfactory replies by the appellants as to the entitlement of the interest accrued from the 10% deposit.
 7.The contents of the directors` resolution were as follows: 
Directors` Resolution in Writing
 
Whereas the directors of the company were presented with the final form of sale and purchase agreement by Probo Pacific Ltd and required to sign the same on the basis that it had been negotiated and agreed with the purchaser.
 
Whereas at the advice of Messrs Wee Ramayah, the company (or its authorised persons) wrote to Messrs Gabriel Peters as soon as practicable after the execution of the asale and purchase agreement with the purchaser, to require them to confirm that the interest on the stakeholders` deposit would be paid to the company.
 
Whereas Messrs Gabriel Peters has persistently refused to reply to the same.
 
Whereas Messrs Gabriel Peters failed to inform or advise the company with respect to the issue of stakeholders` interest.
 
Whereas Messrs Gabriel Peters are claiming a right to stakeholders` interest without prior agreement despite the company`s clear position that it has never authorised Messrs Gabriel Peters to retain such interest for their own account.
 
It is hereby resolved as follows: 
1 The company do and hereby dismiss Messrs Gabriel Peters and terminate their appointment as joint and several solicitors for the sale of the company`s property known as `The Promenade`, 300 Orchard Road.. 
2 The majority directors be and are hereby authorised to take the necessary to (i) to transfer the joint stakeholder from Messrs Gabriel Peters to Messrs Wee Ramayah. and (ii) seek to recover all stakeholders` interest from Messrs Gabriel Peters. 
3 In connection but without limitation thereto, the majority directors be and are hereby authorised to:
 
i lodge a complaint in the name of the company against Messrs Gabriel Peters with the Law Society of Singapore; and 
ii commence civil action in the name of the company against Messrs Gabriel Peters.
 
4 The majority directors be and are hereby authorised to take all necessary action in relation to the same. 
5 That the majority directors be and are hereby authorised to (i) appoint such firm of lawyers to act for the company in respect of the aforedescribed actions as they shall deem fit and (ii) determine and agree their fees with them.
 
Dated 10 January 1997
 8.In their statement of claim, the appellants contended that the above defamatory remarks were published and re-published to a list of third parties, including the following: (i). the person to whom it was dictated and/or was instructed to so dictate
 (ii). the person who transcribed it onto the computer
 (iii). the person or persons who filed or otherwise dealt with the said publication or copy thereof after it was signed by the respondents
 (iv). Wee Ramayah & Partners
 (v). Lee & Lee
 (vi). Drew & Napier
 (vii). Thomas Enslow
 (viii). Michael Chye
 (ix). Gosta Pjorkenstam.
 The appellants said that the words, in the context in which the were published, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo, meant and were understood to mean, that: (i). the appellants were not diligent in the handling of legal matters of their clients in that the appellants had failed to advise the company on the issue of interest on stakeholders` moneys
 (ii). the appellants did not pay proper attention to their clients` interests in that the appellants had failed or had neglected to bring to the company`s attention the issue of the interest on the stakeholders` moneys
 (iii). the appellants` behaviour was unbefitting of that of advocates and solicitors
 (iv). the appellants were unprofessional in the conduct and handling of their clients` matters
 (v). the appellants did not take proper care of their clients` interests
 (vi). the appellants` conduct was improper, unethical and unbecoming in their practice as advocates and solicitors
 (vii). the appellants` conduct was improper in that they refused to respond to the clients` correspondence
 (viii). the appellants` conduct was motivated by self-interest, to the prejudice and detriment of their clients
 (ix). the appellants had acted dishonestly and/or unlawfully in retaining the interest on stakeholders` moneys
 (x). the appellants were dishonest, lacking in integrity and not of good character.
 9.On 3 March 1997, the first, fourth and fifth respondents filed a summons-in-chambers to strike out the appellants` claim under O 18 r 19(1)(a) Rules of Court 1996. The second and third respondents were not parties to the application. The hearing came before the assistant registrar on 7 March 1997, who dismissed the application. The respondents relied broadly on three arguments. The first was that the respondents, being directors of the company, made the directors` resolution in the course of their duties as company directors and in the best interests of the company. Thus, they could not be sued personally for any alleged libel contained in the resolution. The second argument was that the appellants had brought this action for an unfair collateral purpose, namely, to apply pressure on the respondents to refrain from taking any action against the appellants as authorised by the resolution. The respondents` counsel, in support of this argument, pointed to several factors: the company had not been named in the action; the order in which the respondents had been named in the writ; the specific reference to the first respondent, the former Chief Justice, in the paragraphs in the statement of claim dealing with aggravated damages. Thirdly, there was no cause of action against the first respondent as there was no allegation that he committed the act of publication. With regard to the first argument, the assistant registrar felt that, if it was the respondents` case that they acted in the best interests of the company and in their capacity as directors of the company, then all this meant was that they might be able to raise the defence of qualified privilege. It did not mean that the respondents had no reasonable cause of action against them. As for the second argument, the assistant registrar was of the view that the factors were insufficient grounds on which to conclude that the respondents were proceeding against the appellants for unfair collateral purposes. The last argument was also rejected as para 2 of the statement of claim set out the allegation that all the respondents jointly and/or severally published the allegedly libelous resolution. The complaint put forward by the respondents was really that there were no particulars as to how the first respondent participated in the act of publication. This, the assistant registrar felt, could be made the subject of an application for further and better particulars.
 10.The first, fourth and fifth respondents filed a defence on 17 March 1997, without prejudice to their application to have the action struck out and to their contention that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action or was scandalous, frivolous and vexatious or was an abuse of process. They averred that the appellants` claim was against the company and that there was no cause of action against the three respondents in their personal capacity as directors of the company in the signing of the board resolution on 10 January 1997.
 11.The respondents filed a notice of appeal to the judge of the High Court in chambers on 10 March 1997 from the assistant registrar`s decision. Lai Siu Chiu J allowed the appeal and ordered the writ of summons and statement of claim to be struck out.
 12.
 The trial judge`s decision
Lai Siu Chiu J based her decision essentially on the ground that the appellants had brought the action against the wrong defendants. The learned judge was of the view that they should have brought an action against the company and not the respondents. This was so since the resolution passed was the act of the company. There was no question of ultra vires or that the directors had acted outside their scope of powers. There was also no evidence to suggest that the respondents had authorised, directed and procured the company to pass the resolution, thus subjecting them to personal liability under the test laid down in 
C Evans & Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd
 
[1985] 2 All ER 415
. Besides, the requirements espoused in 
 C Evans & Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd 
 to make the respondents personally liable for the company`s acts were not pleaded in the statement of claim. The company was not even made a co-defendant.
 13.Lai J was also of the opinion that the assistant registrar had erred in referring to the defence of the respondents filed subsequent to the statement of claim and in taking the view that any shortcomings in the statement of claim could be rectified by the filing of further and better particulars. This was contrary to O 18 r 19, which stipulated that no evidence was admissible under O 18 r 19(1)(a).
 14.
 The appeal
The appellants submitted that Lai Siu Chiu J erred in law and in fact by striking out the writ of summons and statement of claim on the ground that it revealed no reasonable cause of action. They raised three main grounds of appeal. The first ground was that the learned judge should not have held that the appellants` claim was not actionable because the alleged defamatory words were published by the respondents in the course of acting as directors. It was submitted that a director could be personally liable for a tort committed by the company if he himself performed those acts constituting the tort, or if he authorised, directed or procured others to perform those acts on the company`s behalf. A plaintiff could choose which of the joint tortfeasors he wished to sue. The appellants should thus not be faulted for bringing an action against the respondents and not the company or the other three directors. The second ground was that the learned judge was wrong in holding that the statement of claim did not disclose an arguable case that the respondents had published or caused the publication of the words complained of. The statement of claim revealed a prima facie case against the respondents. What was alleged was that the respondents committed the acts of defamation personally and were personally liable for the publication, not that the respondents procured the company to do those acts. The issue of ultra vires was thus irrelevant to the matter. The third ground of appeal was that the learned judge should not have taken into account, on an application under O 18 r 19(1)(a), matters extrinsic to the statement of claim. The question of ulterior or collateral motive was an irrelevant consideration as it was an aspect of abuse of process under O 18 r 19(1)(d), which was not relied on by the respondents in their summons-in-chambers application. Similarly, the defence filed by the respondents should not have been looked at.
 15.The respondents rehashed their arguments put forth before the assistant registrar and Lai Siu Chiu J. A few salient points of their submissions were noted. First, it was submitted that the appellants had brought the action against the wrong party. It was not shown that the respondents instigated or procured the commission of the alleged defamation. Thus, they could not be personally liable. The right party to the action was the company itself. Besides, it was not pleaded in the statement of claim that the action was brought because the respondents had authorised, directed and procured the company to commit the alleged libel. It was further submitted that there was no reasonable cause of action against the respondents from a reading of the pleadings in the statement of claim. In particular, there was no cause of action against the first respondent as the appellants had been unable to show that he had published or was responsible for the publication of the resolution.
 16.In considering this appeal, the following issues in this area of law were, in our view, pertinent to the outcome of the petition: (i). the principles for striking out an action under O 18 r 19 Rules of Court
 (ii). the elements in the tort of libel
 (iii). whether the resolution by the majority directors was a resolution of the board and hence an act of the company
 (iv). whether individual directors can be personally liable for a tortious act committed by the company
 (v). whether the writ of summons and statement of claim should be struck out under O 18 r 19.
 We considered them in turn.
 17.
 The principles for striking out an action under O 18 r 19 Rules of Court
Under O 18 r 19, the court may strike out any pleading and order the action to be dismissed on any of the grounds in O 18 r 19(1)(a)-(d). O 18 r 19 provides: 
(1) The court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that -
 
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be; 
(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; 
(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or 
(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court, and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
 
(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a). 
(3) This rule shall, so far as applicable, apply to an originating summons and a petition as if the summons or petition, as the case may be, were a pleading.
 18.In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in 
Hubbuck & Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark
 
[1899] 1 QB 86
 at p 91. It should not be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.
 19.In their application for striking out, the respondents relied on O 18 r 19(1)(a) as the ground in support of their application - that the writ of summons and statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. According to O 18 r 19(2), no evidence shall be admissible on an application under O 18 r 19(1)(a). The only exception to this prohibition against adducing evidence is where there is an affidavit filed in support of the originating summons.
 20.In the hearings both before the assistant registrar and Lai Siu Chiu J, the arguments raised dealt not only with O 18 r 19(1)(a), but also with O 18 r 19(1)(d). We were of the view that, despite the fact that the respondents cited only O 18 r 19(1)(a) in support of their application in the summons-in-chambers, they should not be prohibited from relying on the other three grounds in O 18 r 19(1). The appellants had two occasions, one before the assistant registrar, and the other before Lai Siun Chiu J, to object to the respondents` arguments based on the other grounds besides O 18 r 19(1)(a). This, they did not do. They should not now be able to raise this point before us as they had acquiesced to the respondents` arguments on grounds not within the parameters of their pleading in the summons-in-chambers. Besides, it was not shown that they had suffered any prejudice by reason of this. Ultimately, it was the decision of this court to determine, in the interests of efficacy and in ensuring that the parties were not subjected to a long and tedious trial on an obviously hopeless case, whether the action should be struck out. The court should not be confined to considering only the ground raised by the applicant for striking out. Instead, it should be given the flexibility to consider the other three grounds under O 19(1) should the case at hand merit such consideration. It should not be unduly hampered by some procedural irregularity. Frequently, an order for striking out can be based on more than one of the four grounds in O 18 r 19(1). In this regard, we found that the appellant`s contention that the respondents should not be allowed to raise arguments based on O 18 r 19(d) should be rejected.
 21.The guiding principle in determining what a `reasonable cause of action` is under O 18 r 19(1)(a) was succinctly pronounced by Lord Pearson in 
Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association
 
[1970] 1 All ER 1094
. A reasonable cause of action, according to his lordship, connotes a cause of action which has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered. As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action, or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out. Where a statement of claim is defective only in not containing particulars to which the defendant is entitled, the application should be made for particulars under O 18 r 12 and not for an order to strike out the statement.
 22.The term, `abuse of the process of the Court`, in O 18 r 19(1)(d), has been given a wide interpretation by the courts. It includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. This term signifies that the process of the court must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent the improper use of its machinery. It will prevent the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. The categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process are not closed and will depend on all the relevant circumstances of the case. A type of conduct which has been judicially acknowledged as an abuse of process is the bringing of an action for a collateral purpose, as was raised by the respondents. In 
Lonrho v Fayed (No 5)
 
[1993] 1 WLR 1489
, Stuart-Smith LJ stated that, if an action was not brought bona fide for the purpose of obtaining relief but for some other ulterior or collateral purpose, it might be struck out as an abuse of the process of the court.
 23.
 The elements in the tort of libel
The elements of libel were considered briefly as it impinged on the determination of the application for striking out. First and foremost, libel, as opposed to slander, is actionable per se. There is no need to prove special damage. Special damage here means material loss capable of estimation in money.
 24.There are three elements of liability. The first element is that the allegation must be defamatory. What is defamatory depends largely on the circumstances of each case. We proposed a working definition of `defamatory`: a defamatory statement is one which injures the reputation of another by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule (per Parke B in 
Parmiter v Coupland
 
[1840] 151 ER 340
 at p 342), or which tends to lower him in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally (per Lord Atkin in 
Sim v Stretch
 
[1936] 2 All ER 1237
 at p 1240). The defendant need not have ascertained beforehand the likely effect of his words as long as his writing was voluntary. What is relevant is that the words were understood by others in a defamatory sense. As Russell LJ stated in 
Cassidy v Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd
 
[1929] 2 KB 331
 at p 354, liability for libel does not depend on the intention of the defamer, but on the fact of defamation. The second element is that the defamatory statement must refer to the plaintiff. The identification of the plaintiff depends on whether reasonable persons would believe that the words complained of referred to him. The third element is that there must be publication of the statement. In 
Pullman v W Hill & Co Ltd
 
[1891] 1 QB 524
, Lord Esher MR described publication as the making known of the defamatory matter after it has been written to some person other than the person of whom it is written.
 25.
 Whether the resolution by the majority directors was a resolution of the board and hence an act of the company
It is a fundamental concept in company law that the company acts through its organs. The two organs of the company are the board of directors and the members of the company in general meeting. The acts of the two organs are deemed to be acts by the company itself. The decisions of the members are expressed through resolutions passed in general meeting. Similarly, decisions of the board of directors are reflected in the resolutions of the board. A board resolution is passed by a simple majority of the directors present at the board meeting. Another basic concept is the separation of the company`s powers between the two organs. Generally, the managerial powers are vested in the board. The memorandum and articles of association can, of course, expressly provide for managerial decisions to be made by the general meeting instead. When the organs of the company act within their scope of powers, they act as the company, not just on behalf of the company. There is no question of agency involved. Their acts are the acts of the company.
 26.The question which arose was this: what acts of the board are the acts of the company? In particular, is a resolution passed by the majority of the board the resolution of the company and hence, an act of the company?
 27.Any act of the board, for example, in commencing litigation proceedings, appointing of new directors, issue of new shares, is an act of the company. There is no doubt that, when members in general meeting pass a resolution, that resolution represents the decision of the company. This is because the company is made up of the shareholders. The shareholders in general meeting are the company. Similarly, the members, in approving by resolution, an irregular course of action by the directors which is outside the scope of the board`s powers, will make that the act of the company, per 
Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd
 
[1983] 2 All ER 563
. An act which has the unanimous, albeit informal, approval of the members, is a corporate act and is binding on the company. The resolution of the general meeting is a decision of the company which will lead to a course of action by the company. What of resolutions by the board? Are they decisions of the company? We took the view that a resolution passed by the board, acting within its sphere of competence, should be taken as the company`s decision. Decisions of the board are made by the passing of resolutions. These resolutions in turn form the basis of the validity of any acts by the board in furtherance of the intentions reflected in the resolutions. The acts of the board are the acts of the company, if carried out within the board`s constituent power. As an organ of the company, it is a logical conclusion that any resolution of the board is a decision of the company. Thus, in furtherance of a resolution of the board to that effect, the acts of the board of directors will be acts of the company. There is an important caveat to this: the resolution must be one which is within the scope of the board`s powers to pass. A resolution of the board is a decision of the board and, so it follows, an `act` of the board. The `act` lies in the passing of the resolution itself in coming to a decision on a matter within its powers. The act of the board in the form of a resolution is an act of the company.
 28.In the present situation, the resolution of the board was carried out pursuant to the powers of the board. The board made a managerial decision to dismiss the appellants as the company`s solicitors in the sale and purchase transaction. This, the board had the power to do.
 29.Lai Siu Chiu J accepted the respondents` argument that, since the word `company` was repeated ten times in the resolution, the resolution was that of the company`s and that the company was the proper defendant, not the respondent directors. With great respect to the learned judge, we found that this conclusion was not warranted. The fact that the word `company` was used repeatedly did not in any way make it any less a board resolution. It was not a natural inference that the resolution was an act of the company simply because the word `company` was used. This would be reading too much into the resolution. Incidentally, the resolution was headed `directors` resolution in writing`. The phrasing of the resolution should not be a basis for determining the point of law which arose as to whether a board resolution was an act of the company. We should rely, instead, on first principles of company law and not come to a view on a legal issue based solely on the wording of a resolution.
 30.
 Whether individual directors can be personally liable for a tortious act committed by the company
In this case, the alleged tortious act committed by the company was the alleged libel contained in the board resolution on 10 January 1997. We held that the board resolution passed by the majority directors was an act of the company. That being the case, could the directors be personally liable for a tortious act of the company, even though they were acting within the scope of their powers as a board? If so, what were the requisite conditions before they could be made so liable?
 31.It is clearly established in law that the company is liable in tort for all wrongful acts and omissions of the persons who control the management or operation of its business undertaking when they are acting within their scope of powers as such ( 
Lennard`s Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd
 
[1915] AC 705
 at pp 713-714). In the present case, the board resolution was an act of the company. It naturally followed that the company was liable for its own act since an act of the organ of the company was the act of the company itself. There was no agency or master-servant relationship involved and no issue of vicarious liability.
 32.It is a fundamental principle of company law, as laid down in the landmark decision of 
Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd
 
[1897] AC 22
, that a company is a separate legal entity from its members or shareholders. As such, the members are not liable to be sued in respect of a breach of the company`s obligations. If a company incurs legal liabilities, the company must be sued. The members cannot be sued in respect of the company`s liabilities since they are not in law responsible for the company`s acts, per Lord Parker in 
Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre & Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd
 
[1916] 2 AC 307
. The anxiety of the courts in preserving the separate legal personality can be seen from the fact that the protection of the corporate veil has been extended to the directors and the management. It has been held in the United Kingdom that proof of the commission of a tort by a company does not automatically prove that the directors who manage its affairs are guilty of the tort as well ( 
Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (in liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd
 
[1921] 2 AC 465
, 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Ors v Chan Cheng Kum
 [1975-1977] SLR 1 , 
C Evans & Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd
 
[1985] 2 All ER 415
).
 33.There is, however, an exception to the general principles above. It has been judicially laid down that, where directors order an act by the company which amounts to a tort by the company, they may be liable as joint tortfeasors on the ground that they have procured or directed the wrong to be done. In 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Ors v Chan Cheng Kum
 [1975-1977] SLR 1 , Lord Salmon, delivering judgment on behalf of the Privy Council, opined at p 4D: 
No doubt the fact that the respondent is chairman and managing director of HSC does not of itself make him personally liable in respect of that company`s tortious acts. A tort may be committed through an officer or servant of a company without the chairman or managing director being in any way implicated. There are many such cases reported in the books. If, however, the chairman or managing director 
 procures or directs
 the commission of the tort he may be personally liable for the tort and the damage flowing from it: 
Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd
 
[1924] 1 KB 1
 per Atkin LJ. Each case depends upon its own particular facts.
 In that case, the respondent was found jointly liable with the company for the tort of conversion as he, as chairman and managing director of the company, HSC, personally agreed with the directors of one of HSC`s customers the terms on which HSC would continue to wrongfully convert goods consigned to the banks just as they had done in the past. In 
Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (in liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd
 
[1921] 2 AC 465
, Lord Buckmaster said of the issue of personal liability of the managing directors who were in sole control of the company for a company`s tort: 
If the company was really trading independently on its own account, the fact that it was directed by Messrs Feldman and Partridge would not render them responsible for its tortious acts unless, indeed, they were acts expressly directed by them. If a company is formed for the express purpose of doing a wrongful act or if, when formed, those in control expressly direct that a wrongful thing be done, the individuals as well as the company are responsible for the consequences, but there is no evidence in the present case to establish liability under either of these heads.
 More recently, in 
C Evans & Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd
 
[1985] 2 All ER 415
, Slade LJ reiterated the principles set down in 
Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (in liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd
 
[1921] 2 AC 465
 and 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Ors v Chan Cheng Kum
 [1975-1977] SLR 1 . Slade LJ was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to attempt a comprehensive definition of the circumstances in which a director of a company who had authorised, directed and procured a tortious act to be done would be personally liable. Whether he should be so liable depended on the particular circumstances of the case. His lordship went on to say, obiter, that there was no general requirement that a director would only be liable for torts committed by a company where he had acted recklessly or where he knew that the company`s acts were tortious. Slade LJ opined at p 424: 
The authorities, as I have already indicated, clearly show that a director of a company is not automatically to be identified with his company for the purpose of the law of tort, however small the company may be and however powerful his control over its affairs. Commercial enterprise and adventure is not to be discouraged by subjecting a director to such onerous potential liabilities. In every case where it is sought to make him liable for his company`s torts it is necessary to examine with care what part he played personally in regard to the act or acts complained of
 
I readily accept that (the statements of Lord Buckmaster and Atkin LJ in 
Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (in liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd
 
[1921] 2 AC 465
 and 
Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd
 
[1924] 1 KB 1
 respectively) cannot be regarded as a precise and unqualified statement of the principles governing a director`s personal liability for his company`s torts; I do not think they were so intended. In particular, I would accept that, if the plaintiff has to prove a particular state of mind or knowledge on the part of the defendant as a necessary element of the particular tort alleged, the state of mind or knowledge of the director who authorised or directed it must be relevant if it is sought to impose personal liability on the director merely on account of such authorisation or procurement; the personal liability of the director in such circumstances cannot be more extensive than that of the individual who personally did the tortious act. If, however, the tort alleged is not one in respect of which it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove a particular state of mind or knowledge (eg infringement of copyright) different considerations may well apply.
 34.The issue of the personal liability of a director who is acting within his sphere of competence is a perplexed one, especially since the act which is done is an act of the company, for which the company should be wholly responsible. What is at stake is a very difficult question of policy. On the one hand, there is the principle that a company is separate and distinct in law from its shareholders and directors, and it is in the interests of the commercial purposes served by the incorporated enterprise that they should as a general rule enjoy the benefit of the limited liability afforded by incorporation. On the other hand, there is the principle that everyone should answer for his tortious acts. A cause of concern is that, if the directors are made liable too easily, many commercial decisions will be fraught with the danger of personal liability being imposed on the directors, who might then become over-cautious in making management decisions lest it render them vulnerable to legal suits. This will in turn be disadvantageous to the company commercially. On the other side of the coin, a director of a company should not be allowed to escape personal liability to third parties for torts which he personally committed by his own hand or mouth merely because he committed the tort in the course of carrying out his duties as a director of the company.
 35.After giving much thought to the opposing considerations above, we came to the conclusion that the principles echoed in 
 C Evans & Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd 
and its predecessor cases represent the position as to the liability of directors for a tort committed by the company. It is an established principle of law that a director can, in certain circumstances, be liable for a tort committed by the company if he directed or procured the commission thereof. Employees or servants of the company can be potentially liable personally for torts committed in the course of employment, if it is found that responsibility can be fixed on the particular individual in question. A director should not be able to escape personal liability for such torts any more than can an employee acting in the course of his employment for a company, or an agent acting in the course of his agency for a company. In our judgment, it would offend common sense if the law of tort were to treat the director of the company any more kindly than the servant, who took his orders from the director. Of course, whether a director is so liable depends very much on the factual situation at hand. The level of his involvement needs to be looked at in determining if he did authorise, direct or procure the commission of the tort. This is a matter of degree. If a particular tort is one which requires the satisfaction of the proof of mens rea before personal liability can be founded, then the state of mind of the director when he authorised, directed or procured the act will be relevant. This is only logical as a director should not be more vulnerable to tortious liability than any other individual. However, if the tort is one for which liability can be imposed in the absence of any intention or state of mind of the tortfeasor, the knowledge or the recklessness of the director as to whether the act was tortious will not be relevant.
 36.Applying the principles set out above, we had no problem in coming to the conclusion that the respondents could be potentially personally liable for the alleged libel committed by the company, if the appellants` allegations were made out at a full trial. The respondents were the ones who passed the board resolution. It was argued by the respondents and accepted by Lai Siu Chiu J that, since the names of the directors were not inserted in the resolution, it could not be said that the respondents were the ones who procured or directed the passing of the resolution. We rejected this contention. The resolution was stated to be a directors` resolution. It being so, it was not relevant that the names of the individual directors were not inserted therein. From a perusal of the resolution, it was a logical inference that the respondents were prima facie participants in the passing of the resolution. As a matter of fact, we found that the role played by the respondents went further than simply `directing or procuring` the commission of the tortious act, the threshold for imputing personal liability to a director. Prima facie, they were the ones who passed and phrased the wording of the resolution. The gist of the alleged libel lay in the wording of the resolution itself, not in any act pursuant to the resolution. The passing and the publication of the resolution and the words used therein were the very acts which gave rise to the action. The respondents` counsel dealt at length with the case of 
PLG Research Ltd v Ardon International Ltd
 
[1993] FSR 197
. We remarked that this case was irrelevant to the issue at hand as it dealt with a director who had facilitated, as opposed to procured, a tort. It was held in that case that a facilitator of a tort would not be liable as a joint tortfeasor. Here, there was no question of a facilitation of a tort. The respondents were prima facie the primary participants to the act. To establish liability for libel, there is no requirement of knowledge or intention on the part of the alleged defamer. As such, the state of mind of the respondents when passing the resolution necessitated no consideration. Counsel for the respondents submitted that it was not pleaded in the statement of claim that there had been publication by the first respondent, publication being an element which had to be shown before liability could be attached. From that, counsel argued, the first respondent should not have been made a defendant. Much reliance was placed on para 4 of the statement of claim in support of this argument, which read: 
The publication referred to in para 2 hereinabove was enclosed with a facsimile correspondence signed by the fourth and fifth defendants and addressed to Messrs Lee & Lee on 13 January 1997. Messrs Lee & Lee at all material times carry on the business of advocates and solicitors in Singapore.
 We did not see how para 4 could be interpreted to suggest that the first respondent was not privy to the publication of the alleged defamatory remarks in the resolution. Paragraph 4 merely stated that the resolution was sent to Lee & Lee together with a facsimile correspondence signed by the fourth and fifth defendants. In no way could it be interpreted to mean that the publication was made only by the fourth and fifth defendants, as counsel tried valiantly to impress upon us. On the contrary, it was unequivocally pleaded in para 2 of the statement of claim that all the respondents, including the first respondent, published and/or caused to be published the defamatory words contained in the resolution. Paragraph 2 read as follows: 
On the 10th day of January 1997, 
 the defendants
 falsely and maliciously jointly and/or severally 
 published and/or caused to be published of
 and concerning the plaintiffs in the way of their said office and profession and in relation to their conduct therein, the following defamatory words as underlined -
 37.
 Whether the writ of summons and statement of claim should be struck out under O 18 r 19
We found that the directors` resolution had been passed within the board`s powers. Hence, it was an act of the company for which the respondents could be personally liable. Not only did the respondents direct and procure the passing of the resolution, prima facie, they were the primary participants in the commission of the alleged libel. The appellants had the choice as to who they wanted to bring the action against - the company or the respondents. The respondents were thus the proper defendants in this action.
 38.The only issue which remained for us to consider was whether, from the statement of claim, there was a reasonable cause of action against the respondents. We came to the conclusion that a reasonable cause of action had been disclosed. There were triable issues involved. From a reading of the statement of claim, all the relevant facts giving rise to a claim of libel had been fully pleaded. The alleged defamatory words were particularised and their defamatory effect described. The alleged defamatory words clearly referred to the appellants. The particulars of the publication by the respondents to the various third parties were listed out. A prima facie case had been made out. We felt that the case against the respondents was not devoid of merit. A full hearing should be given for the parties to adduce evidence and to present their arguments before the court.
 39.The court`s power to strike out an action pursuant to O 18 r 19 is a draconian one. The discretion should not be exercised too readily unless the court is convinced it has been clearly shown that the plaintiff`s case is wholly devoid of merit. This, the respondents failed to do.
 40.For all the reasons above, we allowed this appeal and set aside Lai Siu Chiu J`s order to strike out the action.",1997-11-12 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The second appellant, Foo Then Peng (`Foo` also known as `Hainam Peng`), and the third appellant, Lim Lam Hui (`Lim` also known as `Ah Hui`), were jointly charged with the `first charge` which read as follows: 
on or about 2 August 1996, in Singapore, together with others unknown, were members of a criminal conspiracy, and in such capacity, agreed with one another to do an illegal act, the object of the conspiracy, namely, to traffic in diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), whereby Lim Lam Hui would arrange for the delivery of two pounds of heroin containing not less than 90.94g of diamorphine to Foo Then Peng, an offence contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 120(B)(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.The first appellant, Lau Song Seng (`Lau` also known as `Swee Tee`), the second appellant, Foo, and one Khoo Chye Hock (`Khoo` also known as `Peck Hock`) were charged together with the `second charge` which read as follows: 
on 3 August 1996 at about 1.30pm, at Yishun Avenue 2 near the junction with Yishun Avenue 1, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 
 by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking two packets of heroin containing not less than 90.94g of diamorphine in motor car SBG 9172 S
 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 At the close of the prosecution`s case, the second charge was amended by the substitution of the underlined phrase with the following phrase: 
by transporting two packets of heroin containing not less than 90.94g of diamorphine in motor car SBG 9172 S from the car park of Block 753 Yishun Street 72 to Yishun Avenue 2 near the junction with Yishun Avenue 1, Singapore.

 The prosecution`s case
It was alleged that on or about 2 August 1996, Lim agreed to supply roughly two pounds of heroin to Foo for the purpose of trafficking. It was alleged that pursuant to this agreement, Lim, either on his own, or through or with another person or persons, had arranged for a paper box containing two large packets of heroin to be delivered to a staircase at Block 753 Yishun Street 72 on 3 August 1996.
 4.At around 12.55pm on 3 August 1996, an officer from the CNB posted at the carpark around Blocks 748, 752 and 753 Yishun Street 72 observed one Lau Boon Huat ascending the staircase at Block 753 carrying two paper boxes. He was observed going up to the fourth floor. The officer lost sight of him. Shortly afterwards, he was seen walking in the carpark behind Block 753. He was not carrying anything. The officer followed him to Block 748 where he was observed climbing into the cabin of a lorry which then drove off.
 5.CNB officers also observed that around 1.05pm on 3 August 1996, Lau drove a brown Toyota Corona (registration number SBG 9172 S) to the carpark between Blocks 751 and 753 Yishun Street 72. Foo and Khoo were in the car with him. At the carpark, Foo and Khoo got out of the car but Lau remained inside. Whilst Khoo smoked a cigarette nearby, Foo walked to Block 753, ascended the staircase and returned with a paper box (ostensibly the box left there by Lau Boon Huat on instructions given by Lim or a person acting in concert with Lim).
 6.Foo and Khoo then got back in the car which left the carpark. The car, still being driven by Lau, remained under CNB surveillance. It was observed that after leaving the carpark, Lau stopped the car opposite a petrol station whilst Foo got out to make a phone call. Foo then got back in the car, which traveled a short distance before stopping for Foo to alight. Lau and Khoo then proceeded in the car without Foo.
 7.Around 1.30pm, the car was stopped by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau at the junction of Yishun Ave 2, Yishun Ave 1 and Lentor Avenue. Lau and Khoo were arrested. The car was searched and found inside were: (a). a paper box (allegedly that deposited by Lau Boon Huat) containing two large packets the contents of which were approximately 928.9g of heroin which was found on analysis to contain approximately 90.94g of diamorphine;
 (b). a paper bag containing 13 sachets the contents of which were approximately 97.1g of heroin which was found on analysis to contain approximately 4.45g of diamorphine; and
 (c). a clutch bag containing 19 Methadone tablets and 22 Triazolam tablets.
 8.At around 1.40pm, at a coffee-shop at Block 732, Yishun Ring Road, Foo was arrested by CNB officers whilst he was using a coin phone. One Lo Yong Heang (also known as `Ah Heng`) was arrested later in the day. Lim was arrested on either 4 or 5 August 1996.
 9.Lau admitted to owning the Methadone and Triazolam tablets and claimed to use them as substitutes for heroin. No admissions were made as to the ownership of the paper bag and the sachets of heroin it contained. No charges were brought in respect of the tablets and sachets. The charges which formed the subject-matter of this appeal related to the two large packets of heroin. The amount of diamorphine yielded from these two packets exceeded the 15g limit required to attract the death penalty in respect of a conviction for unauthorised trafficking.
 10.The first part of the prosecution`s case was that Lim had agreed to supply or procure the supply of the two large packets of heroin to Foo. This, said the prosecution, amounted to a conspiracy to traffic in those drugs, and Foo and Lim were charged with the first charge accordingly.
 11.The prosecution further alleged that when they drove together to Yishun on 3 August 1996, Foo, Lau and Khoo all knew that the purpose of the trip was to pick up drugs. It was alleged that they knew the type and quantity of heroin that was the subject-matter of the pick-up. They were therefore charged with the second charge - trafficking with common intention.
 12.Lo was not (to our knowledge) ever charged. Lau Boon Huat (who had dropped off the drugs) was arrested and charged and tried separately.
 13.It was alleged that arrangements to purchase, drop off, pick up and pay for the drugs were made by handphone and pager. Telecommunications records for handphones and pagers belonging to Foo, Lau, Khoo, Lim and Lo were obtained to show what communications had taken place between them on 2 and 3 August 1996.
 14.At the close of the prosecution`s case, the learned trial judge acquitted Khoo on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against him to warrant a conviction. The three appellants were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. They mounted appeals against their conviction and sentence.
 15.
 The defences
Each appellant`s defence at trial consisted of allegations of fact which, if proved, would have either exonerated him totally or warranted a lesser sentence. The main issue in this appeal was whether the trial judge erred in rejecting those allegations of fact.
 16.
 Defence to the first charge (criminal conspiracy)
Lim disputed that there was ever a conspiracy between himself and Foo to traffic in heroin. His defence was that Foo had never told him how much heroin he wanted. Nor did they speak about price. Lim asserted that when Foo called him asking if he knew anyone who could supply him with drugs, he did nothing more than to put Foo in contact with another person, `Ah Heng`. Lim asserted that Foo negotiated the transaction with `Ah Heng` directly. Lim also claimed he played no part in arranging for the delivery of the drugs. His counsel argued that if he played no active role in the trafficking, he could not have been party to a conspiracy.
 17.
 Defence to the second charge (trafficking by common intention)
Foo and Lau disputed that they shared a common intention to traffic in 90.94g of diamorphine. They asserted that they only intended to collect ten small sachets of heroin for the purposes of consumption instead of two large packets for the purposes of trafficking. Their counsel asserted that they should have been convicted for offences commensurate with the amounts of the drugs they intended to possess, and further that those amounts were consistent with the `defence` of possession for the purpose of consumption.
 18.
 The appellants` evidence
Much turned on Foo`s evidence because in the course of the CNB investigations, Foo had made written statements incriminating himself, Lim and Lau. In those statements, he suggested that Lau knew full well that the quantity in question was around two pounds of heroin. This in turn suggested that Lau was involved with a view to trafficking in the drugs, not to purchase them for consumption. Foo also stated that Lim was well aware of the negotiated price and quantity of heroin and that Lim had played an integral part in the arrangements for the delivery of the heroin.
 19.In his evidence-in-chief at trial, however, Foo gave a different version of the events: one which exonerated himself, Lim and Lau.
 20.
 Foo`s evidence-in-chief
It was not disputed that prior to their arrest, Foo, Lau and Lim were all treated for heroin addiction. Foo`s evidence at trial was that Lau had called him at around 11 in the morning on 2 August 1996 asking for some heroin for his personal consumption, but did not say how much. Foo replied that he would help him by asking around. Foo said that he then contacted Lim at around 12 noon to ask Lim to provide him with heroin. No mention was made of quantity. It was also not mentioned that the heroin was for Lau. Lim replied that he would ask around on Foo`s behalf. Foo then paged for Lim between one thirty and two in the afternoon of 2 August 1996 for an update. Lim returned his page and informed him that a friend of his would page Foo at around 7am on 3 August 1996, using the code `36`. The name `Ah Heng` was not mentioned.
 21.The handphone and pager records supported Foo`s story. They revealed that paging calls and calls to and from Foo`s handphone were made at the alleged times.
 22.Foo then gave evidence-in-chief that Lau and he subsequently met up at a karaoke lounge in Katong in the afternoon of 2 August 1996 at around 4pm. There, Lau repeated his request for heroin and Foo told him that a friend of a friend would page him the next day using code `36`. According to Foo, it was at this meeting that Lau told him he wanted ten sachets of heroin. This was the first time that quantity was mentioned. The natural conclusion was thus that Foo could not have communicated the quantity required to Lim earlier in the day. The records showed that no calls were made to or received from Lim`s office after 2pm on 2 August 1996. So if Foo really only knew how much heroin Lau wanted around 4pm on that day he could not have communicated this quantity to Lim on 2 August 1996.
 23.Foo then gave evidence that the next morning, Lim`s friend did not contact him around 7am as promised. He therefore contacted Lim and asked him what had happened, to which Lim replied he would check. Lim then paged for Foo. According to Foo, when he called Lim, Lim told him that his friend was delayed as it was raining. This aspect of Foo`s story was confirmed by Lim in his evidence-in-chief. The pager and handphone records also showed that these calls actually took place. It was alleged by Foo and Lim that in all the calls between them on 3 August 1996, neither quantity nor price were discussed.
 24.Meanwhile, according to Foo, Lau had called him to ask after the heroin. They arranged to meet at a coffee-shop in Ang Mo Kio. Whilst at the coffee-shop, Lau received a page from Khoo. Lau called Khoo and invited him to join them at the coffee-shop, which he did around 10.40am.
 25.Foo stated that he was finally contacted by Lim`s friend at around 11.27am. Lim`s friend paged for him leaving a telephone number and the code `36`. Foo called the number using his handphone and spoke to `36` who did not disclose his name. He said that he then told Lim`s friend that he wanted ten sachets of heroin to which `36` replied that the cost would be around $900. `36` then told Foo to go to a coffee shop at Block 747 in Yishun and to await further instructions.
 26.Foo, Khoo and Lau thereafter proceeded to this coffee shop in Lau`s car. According to Foo, Lau knew the purpose of the trip was to collect heroin - but he asserted in his evidence-in-chief that Lau and he expected to receive only ten small sachets. At around 12.30pm, after they had arrived at the coffee-shop in Yishun, `36` paged for Foo. Foo stated that he then contacted `36` using his handphone. He was informed to wait a while longer. He was paged again a little after 1pm, and, upon returning that page, was instructed to go to Block 753 to collect a box at the staircase landing. These communications between Foo and `36` were also borne out by the telephone and pager records. Foo, Lau and Khoo then proceeded to the pick-up point. Foo admitted that he collected the paper box and that it contained two large packets of heroin.
 27.It was clear that according to Foo`s evidence-in-chief, the facts were that (a) Lim did not know of the price and quantity of drugs asked for and (b) both Foo and Lau only wanted ten sachets of heroin. These two assertions went to the heart of the prosecution`s case. The first assertion suggested that Foo and Lim could not have conspired to traffic in drugs because Lim was kept in the dark about the quantity, price and delivery arrangements. The second assertion suggested that Foo and Lau did not share a common intention to traffic in two `liaps` of heroin but only the smaller amount of ten sachets.
 28.To contradict Foo`s evidence, the prosecution relied on statements made by Foo to the investigating officer, Insp Paul Anpualagan.
 29.
 Parts of Foo`s investigation statements incriminating Lau
In statements made on 14 and 16 August 1996, Foo told the investigating officer (through an interpreter) that Lau had paged him around 3pm on 2 August 1996. The statements did not refer to any communication that had taken place earlier between them. When Foo called Lau, Lau invited him to a karaoke lounge. According to the statements, they met and Lau asked him to supply two `liaps` of heroin. Foo replied that one `liap` would cost $3,000, a price to which Lau agreed. Foo stated that Lau told him he would pay him the $6,000 on Sunday, 4 August 1996 and that after the heroin was sold off, he would give him `coffee money` of $200. This was intended to suggest that Foo and Lau had agreed right from the start to traffic in two `liaps` of heroin and not just ten sachets.
 30.Lau`s investigation statement differed from Foo`s in that he stated that he had asked Foo to help him get heroin for personal consumption on 3 August 1996. No mention was made of any events on 2 August 1996. No mention was made of price or quantity. In his evidence-in-chief, he supplemented his statement with sworn evidence that when he met Foo at the karaoke lounge on 2 August 1996, he asked Foo for ten sachets and was told the cost would be between $900 and $1,000. It was, in our view, significant that although Lau`s investigation statements were markedly different from Foo`s investigation statements, his evidence at trial was remarkably consistent with Foo`s evidence-in-chief.
 31.
 Parts of Foo`s investigation statements incriminating Lim
In his police statements of 14 and 16 August 1996, Foo stated that once Lau asked him to supply two `liaps` of heroin at the Karaoke Lounge on 2 August 1996, he immediately called Lim on his handphone. This telephone call, which allegedly took place around 4pm, was very important. It was during this call that Foo allegedly asked Lim to supply two `liaps` of heroin. He allegedly also told Lim that he would pay him $6,000 once he had collected the money. According to the statement, it was during this conversation that Lim told Foo that his friend would page him the next morning using code `36`. This suggested that Lim was involved from the very start: that he knew the price and quantity of the heroin involved and had agreed to arrange to supply Foo with two `liaps` of heroin.
 32.By contrast, Lim asserted in his investigation statements that he had never been informed of the quantity of heroin Foo wanted. He stated that he had done no more than to put Foo in contact with `Ah Heng` and that the price and quantity were negotiated between Foo and `Ah Heng` directly. He maintained this story during his examination-in-chief, stating that although Foo had asked him for heroin, he never knew how much he wanted or the price which he proposed to pay. Lim stated in evidence that he thought Foo wanted it for personal consumption. The consistencies in Lim`s investigation statements and his evidence at trial suggested that he did not tailor his evidence.
 33.Foo`s statements concerning the events of 3 August were also important. They suggested, contrary to his evidence-in-chief, that Lim played an active role in the delivery arrangements. In his statements, Foo stated that Lim paged for him at around 10.50am on 3 August. Foo called him and was told by Lim to go to a coffee shop at Block 747 Yishun by 12 noon. Lim allegedly told Foo that his friend (`36`) would then page Foo to tell him where to collect the heroin. Foo stated that Lau, Khoo and he drove to Yishun where they were paged by a person using code `36`. According to the statement, Foo called `36` using the coffee-shop public phone and was instructed to go to Block 753 to collect the paper box.
 34.The statements therefore incriminated Lim in that they suggested that Lim worked in collaboration with `36` to supply the drugs. These statements were inconsistent with Lim`s own investigation statements and his evidence-in-chief. They were also inconsistent with the telephone records. The prosecution`s version of events was that Foo was contacted first by Lim at 10.50am and then subsequently by `36` sometime after 12 noon. However, the records showed that Foo had received a page from `36` at 11.27am and that he had responded to it using his handphone. The prosecution did not suggest what transpired during this call. Also, the records showed that whenever `36` paged for Foo, he left a different number for Foo to call. Calls to all these numbers were made from Foo`s handphone. This suggested that Foo used his handphone and not the coffee-shop phone to contact `36` once he arrived at the Yishun coffee-shop.
 35.
 Foo`s investigation statements concerning a quarrel after the pick-up
Foo stated in his investigation statement that after receiving the instructions from `36`, he went to Block 753, together with Lau and Khoo. Once he had picked up the paper box from the staircase, he got back in the car and they drove off. According to his statement, he then opened it to check what was inside. He saw two large packets of heroin. He claimed that he became angry and scolded Lau, demanding an explanation as to why the packets were so big. He claimed that although he asked for two `liaps`, he thought that a `liap` was only a small packet. Foo stated that Lau then stopped the car and he got out, leaving the heroin behind in the car.
 36.In examination-in-chief, he changed his story somewhat. He retracted his story that he thought that a `liap` was the same as a `sachet`. Instead, he claimed that he did not ask for two `liaps` but ten sachets. He was therefore taken aback upon seeing two big packets instead of ten sachets. He stated that he quarreled with Lau asking him why two big packets had been delivered. He said that he was afraid and left the car. He claimed that he then went to a coffee-shop and paged for Lim three times over a short period with a view to asking him why there was so much heroin in the box. Before he could contact Lim, he was arrested.
 37.
 Other evidence of a quarrel
There were also differences between Lau`s statement to the CNB officer and his evidence-in-chief concerning the quarrel. In his statement, Lau claimed first of all that he was totally ignorant of the fact that Foo was collecting heroin at the Yishun Block. He said that after Foo retrieved the box, they drove off in the car and Foo opened the box. Foo then asked him to stop the car and got out to make a call on his handphone. During this time, he inspected the box and discovered it was heroin. Foo then got back in the car and appeared angry. Lau stated that a short while later, Foo alighted, taking his handphone with him. Lau claimed that he asked Foo to take away the box but Foo told him to bring the box to the coffee-shop in Ang Mo Kio.
 38.By contrast, in his evidence-in-chief, Lau conceded that he knew that they were going to Yishun to collect heroin. However, he denied that the amount he expected was two `liaps` and maintained that he only wanted ten sachets. He stated that when Foo was opening the box he noticed the quantity was quite large and asked him why he ordered so much. To this, Foo replied that it was a mistake. He testified that they quarreled over the amount and that he was angry with Foo.
 39.Foo, when cross-examined by Lau`s counsel, also gave evidence that Lau was not happy that there was a large quantity of drugs in the car, but stated that he told Lau it was a mistake and that he did not order so much. This appeared to incorporate elements of his own evidence-in-chief and the evidence given by Lau. Again, we noted that this was another area in which Foo and Lau had differed somewhat in their statements, but departed from those statements to give similar evidence at trial.
 40.The evidence of the quarrel was, however, to some extent corroborated by Khoo`s investigation statements. Khoo stated that Lau and Foo quarreled over `heroin matters`.
 41.
 The appeal
In this appeal, we were presented with the task of reviewing the voluminous evidence with a view to determining which version of events - that according to Foo at trial, or that according to Foo when interviewed by the investigating officer - was to be believed. The question was whether the trial judge had wrongly rejected the various appellants` versions of events. Before we directed our minds to that question, however, we first had to consider whether we were entitled to draw inferences from the various appellants` cautioned statements. As the learned trial judge in the court below did not direct his mind to this, we felt entitled to come to our own findings.
 42.
 Cautioned statements and proper inferences
Lau`s cautioned statement read as follows: 
The heroin does not belong to me. I was merely the driver of the car: SBG 9172 S.
 It was urged before us that although he admitted possession of the drugs, his disclaimer of ownership of the two large packets of heroin was consistent with his defence that he only wanted ten small sachets. However, since possession was already admitted, we think it would have been reasonable for him to assert that he had acquired the drugs for the purposes of consumption or that more had been delivered than he expected. We therefore took the view that it was open to us to draw the proper inferences against him.
 43.Foo`s cautioned statement read as follows: 
At the time of my arrest I was not in the car. I was making a phone call in a coffee-shop at Block 747, Yishun.
 Foo totally denied possession or ownership of the drugs. He tried to distance himself from Lau and Khoo. We felt that Foo`s failure to mention that the drugs were meant for Lau or to state that too much heroin had been delivered should be taken into consideration. This was an outright denial and we felt that the proper inferences could also be drawn.
 44.Lim`s cautioned statement reads as follows: 
Only `Hainam Peng` (ie Foo) contacted me and wanted heroin. I then contacted `Ah Heng` and told him about this. `Ah Heng` then made direct contact with `Hainam Peng`. I do not know their arrangements as to the time and place. I also do not know who were the other persons involved.
 Lim`s cautioned statement was in our view consistent with his defence. Although he did not mention the code number `36` or the fact that `Ah Heng` did not contact Foo at the appointed time but only subsequently, these particulars were not so significant that Lim could reasonably have been expected to mention them. We thus took the view that s 123(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code ought not to apply to Lim`s cautioned statement.
 45.Having considered the cautioned statements of the various appellants, we then directed ourselves to the single most incriminating piece of evidence, the statements allegedly made by Foo whilst detained by the CNB.
 46.
 Admissibility of foo`s statements to the CNB: the voir dire
The major difficulty for all three appellants was that the admissibility of Foo`s incriminating statements made on 14 and 16 August 1996 was not impugned despite the following allegations made by Foo at a voir dire: (a). That in the interview on 14 August 1996, the interpreter, Wu Nan Yong, said at the commencement of the interview `Die, die, die, Khoo and Lau accuse you` or words to that effect. This allegation was disbelieved by the trial judge.
 (b). That when he started giving his evidence he was interrupted by the interviewing officer, Insp Paul Anpualagan, who said `Don`t talk cock!` and threw his pen on the table. According to Foo, Insp Anpualagan offered his own version of events and asked Foo if that was correct. According to Foo, he agreed not of his own volition but out of fear of being assaulted. To this, the interviewing officer said `Good, good, steady,` and typed it into the computer. He also allegedly told Foo that it would be good for him to repeat the evidence in court. Foo asserted that the same style of interview was adopted for the statement of 16 August 1996 (although the interpreter did not make similar remarks on that day).Accordingly, Foo asserted that certain incriminating parts of his statements were not his own words but those of the inspector. The trial judge noted that there was no allegation that the inspector said he would beat Foo up. There was also no allegation of actual physical abuse. The trial judge was not convinced that Foo would have given in simply because the inspector shouted at him and threw his pen down, especially since the transformation took place without a finger being laid on him or a threat being uttered against him.
 (c). That the interpreter read back the statements very fast before requiring Foo to agree with them. This was rejected by the trial judge, who found that the statements were read back to Foo at an acceptable speed.
 (d). That the length of the typed statements was disproportionate to the time spent for the interviews. This was not dealt with by the trial judge in his written judgment.
 (e). That in his investigation statement, Insp Anpualagan had stated that at the interview on 16 August 1996, he had printed out the statement before lunch break and had it read over by the interpreter to Foo who agreed with it. In fact, the statement was not printed out until the interview was over after the lunch break. This was also not dealt with by the learned trial judge.
 47.It appeared to us that the essence of Foo`s complaint was that the style of the interview was not that he was given free reign to say what he wished but that he was cross-examined by Insp Anpualagan (thus the allegation that the statement consisted of the inspector`s words and not his). However, the mere fact that the interviewing officer elicits the statement by cross-examination is not sufficient grounds to render the statement involuntary for the purposes of s 24 of the Evidence Act. This has been considered in a number of cases, including 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  
[1991] SLR 150
 in which LP Thean J (as he then was) held that cross-examination does not per se render a statement (in that case, a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code) inadmissible, but that: 
cross-examination could in certain circumstances render the statement or the answers to the questions inadmissible, eg if the questioning is so vigorous or prolonged that it becomes oppressive with the result that a doubt arises as to whether the statement or the answers have been caused by any fear or threat.
 48.This principle was affirmed in 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
  in which it was held that whether the questioning of the person interrogated has been oppressive and whether his will has crumbled such that he speaks when he would have otherwise remained silent is basically a question of fact. Unless the questioning becomes overbearing, there is no basis for exclusion. There was no evidence before us suggesting that the interviews in question were oppressive.
 49.All three appellants contended on appeal that the trial judge wrongly admitted Foo`s statements. We did not agree: the learned trial judge considered the most serious allegations and appeared to exercise his discretion judiciously. Furthermore, there was no subsequent independent evidence to suggest that the statements were involuntary.
 50.At the same time, the fact that his statements were rightly admitted did not conclusively render them accurate, for, as the trial judge observed, parts of the written statements were incontrovertibly wrong. These included the telephone call, allegedly made from Foo to Lim at 4pm on 2 August 1996, but which was proved never to have taken place. We also had to take into account the omission from the statement of the important first conversation between Foo and `36` that took place at around 11.27am on 3 August 1996 and the evidence that Foo called `36` using his handphone and not, as was alleged in the statement, a public phone.
 51.
 Proper approach to Foo`s evidence given retraction and material errors
Given that the statements were admissible but retracted, we think it unfortunate that the trial judge did not explain how he treated them. We were of the view that regard had to be paid to Foo`s explanation of the inconsistencies between his evidence-in-chief and his investigation statements. If he had offered a good explanation, that might have afforded us good cause to reject his statements altogether. However, when asked in cross-examination to explain why his evidence differed from his statements, Foo repeated his allegations that the statements had been involuntarily given. As this assertion had already been rejected by the trial judge and no other explanation was put forth, we had to doubt the veracity of the evidence he gave at trial. The starting point was therefore that the evidence-in-chief should, prima facie, be treated as less reliable than the investigation statements.
 52.At the same time, we had to bear in mind that as parts of the investigation statements had already been proven false, it was necessary to examine them carefully before relying on them. Insofar as they suggested that Lau and Lim were guilty, they were not only accomplice statements which had to be treated with caution owing to illustration (b) of s 116 of the Evidence Act, but also were recanted confessions which the court below was under a stringent duty to examine the veracity of before relying on them to convict a co-accused: 
PP v Rozman bin Jusoh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 317
 . In particular, we were of the view that it was extremely unsafe to rely on an allegation which incriminated one of the co-accused persons if it had been proved false or inaccurate.
 53.
 The case against Lau and Foo on the charge of trafficking
The most important aspect of the case against Lau and Foo was the question whether the transaction was for two `liaps` (around 1 kg) of heroin or for just ten sachets (around 70 to 80g). The mere fact of possession of 90.94g of diamorphine gave rise to the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The starting point was therefore that it was incumbent upon Foo and Lau to prove on a balance of probabilities that they were entitled to an acquittal or lesser sentence. The large quantity rendered the presumption virtually impossible to rebut (see 
Ng Chong Teck v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 863
 ). If, however, the quantity asked for was only ten sachets, then it would have made it much easier for Lau to rebut the presumption of trafficking, warranting only a conviction for possession simpliciter under s 8.
 54.As Foo maintained that the drugs were for Lau, we were of the view that he never really denied the trafficking charge. He never asserted that he did not traffic in the drugs - all that he said was that he intended to traffic in a lesser amount. This was nonetheless significant because if it were proved that he only had an intention to traffic in a lesser amount, this would have attracted a less severe penalty under s 33 read with the Second Schedule.
 55.Notwithstanding that there was a joint charge, we were of the view that it was necessary to treat the cases against Lau and Foo separately for two reasons: (a). Firstly, as we have highlighted, it was necessary to treat Foo`s evidence against Lau with caution because of s 116 of the Evidence Act and the decision in 
PP v Rozman bin Jusoh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 317
 . By contrast, Foo`s evidence did not have to be treated with caution vis-a-vis himself because it was a confession and not an accomplice statement. Although counsel argued that Foo`s statements did not amount to confessions and thus should have been excluded altogether, we did not agree. This argument will be dealt with later.
 (b). Secondly, because Lau`s defence was essentially that he wanted the drugs for consumption, we had to consider the evidence of his addiction. If the degree of his addiction was not compatible with the quantity of ten sachets of heroin, then this would have weakened his defence. As Foo`s defence was not truly one of consumption, we did not have to undertake this examination as regards his case.
 56.We first considered the evidence against Foo. The strongest point was that the only evidence that the quantity asked for was two `liaps` was contained in Foo`s statements to the investigating officer. No other evidence suggested that this was the case - the evidence given by Foo and Lau at trial was that only ten sachets were asked for and Lim`s case was that he was completely ignorant of the quantity. Counsel for Foo contended in this appeal that this was weak evidence because it was given involuntarily and recanted at trial. However, we found that the investigation statements were properly admitted by the trial judge and had to be given more weight than Foo`s evidence-in-chief since he had failed to give a good explanation why he was recanting his investigation statements.
 57.Secondly, the evidence that there was a quarrel suggested that there might have been a dispute over the quantity of heroin delivered and therefore that Foo and Lau had really asked for only ten sachets. In this context, it was significant that certain details concerning the quarrel were corroborated by Khoo in his investigation statement. The evidence of a quarrel indicated that there might be some substance to the first and second appellants` claims that the wrong quantity had been delivered. On the other hand, as the Public Prosecutor pointed out, there was really nothing to show that the quarrel concerned quantity and not something else. Khoo`s own evidence was that the quarrel was over `heroin matters`. This could have just as easily concerned, purity, price or distribution.
 58.Although Foo and Lau were united at trial on the matters of the quantity allegedly asked for and the details of the quarrel, we had in the back of our minds the possibility of collusion between them. This stemmed from the manner in which they departed from their dissimilar investigation statements to deliver very similar evidence-in-chief. We were therefore unwilling to over emphasise the weight to be attached to that evidence. We bore in mind that the trial judge found Foo`s testimony to be thoroughly incredible. We agreed with the trial judge that his retraction of his statements at trial was a desperate attempt to construct a defence in the hope of an acquittal or lighter sentence.
 59.We then directed ourselves to the facts in Foo`s statements that were proved to be wrong. We accepted that insofar as the prosecution relied on those facts, the statements had to be given little weight. However, none of the errors proved material to the second charge against Foo and so this point was of little relevance.
 60.In totality, the evidence was not strong enough for us to conclude that the learned trial judge had erred in coming to the conclusion that Foo knew he was receiving two large packets of heroin. His defence defied logic - why would a supplier asked to supply ten sachets of drugs worth $900 supply two `liaps` worth $6,000? We were not convinced that it stood to reason that the supplier of drugs did so inadvertently. We were also not convinced that such an elaborate scheme would have been devised to deliver such a small amount as ten sachets.
 61.Having accepted that two `liaps` were supplied because two `liaps` were asked for, we asked ourselves who was it who most likely asked for two `liaps`? We took the view that it had to be Foo - he was, by all accounts, the one who contacted the supplier of the drugs. Whether, however, Lau had asked Foo for two `liaps` or ten sachets was less clear and Lau`s liability remained a more open question, to which we will come later.
 62.Even without exercising our discretion to draw adverse inferences against him, we felt that Foo had failed to prove to our satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that he was entitled to an acquittal or varied sentence. We agreed with the trial judge`s finding that he intended to traffic in two `liaps` of heroin and therefore upheld his conviction and sentence on the charge of trafficking.
 63.Even though we were also entitled to draw adverse inferences against Lau, he was in a slightly stronger position than Foo as his defence that he wanted a small quantity of drugs for personal consumption was consistent with his investigation statement. The essence, it seemed to us, of Lau`s case, was that he had asked Foo for some heroin for consumption, and Foo had gone off on his own to order a great deal more, possibly so he could turn a profit from the transaction. This was certainly arguable on the facts, and the evidence of a quarrel between them supported this finding.
 64.We also bore in mind the importance of treating Foo`s retracted confession with circumspection insofar as they incriminated Lau. Although Foo`s statement was a confession vis-a-vis himself, it was a retracted accomplice statement vis-a-vis Lau and had to be treated differently. However, there were two countervailing considerations. Firstly, we were not impressed that Foo`s retractions were bona fide. Secondly, and more importantly, those parts of Foo`s statements that had been proved false did not materially undermine the case against Lau as they did not pertain to the quantity of drugs asked for. We considered that whilst we were still obliged to examine the statement carefully, it was not appropriate to impugn the whole of the evidence simply because there were errors that were relatively immaterial to the case against Lau.
 65.We then directed our attention to the evidence of Lau`s addiction. Lau himself gave evidence that he was a habitual heroin user. He stated that he consumed on average five straws of heroin a day. A urine sample taken from Lau in the morning of 5 August 1996 and submitted to two independent tests yielded 15.67 and 15.97lg of morphine per 5ml of urine respectively. No morphine was detected in urine samples taken from Foo and Khoo. Lau was also medically examined by Dr Catherine Chia of Alexandra Hospital at 9.30pm on 3 August 1996 (the day of the arrest) and was found to be suffering some symptoms of drug withdrawal such as lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, yawning and insomnia. Examinations of Foo and Khoo around the same time did not show them to be suffering from drug withdrawal. At around 12.52am on 4 August 1996, Lau saw Dr Chan Cheh Mun at Alexandra Hospital complaining of rhinorrhoea, diarrhoea and bone pains. An examination by Dr Narjanran Singh at the Prison Medical Unit of Changi Prison Hospital on the afternoon of 4 August 1996 revealed that Lau was suffering from mild heroin withdrawal. Lau was discharged from hospital on 6 August 1996 in satisfactory condition. We accepted that this evidence showed that Lau was an addict at the time of his arrest.
 66.Unfortunately, no evidence was adduced to show what level of addiction could have been inferred from the results of the medical examinations. Whilst it was open to us to remit the case to a lower court for expert evidence to be adduced as to the significance of the urine sample analysis as well as the duration of severe withdrawal symptoms for a person of Lau`s alleged rate of consumption, we elected not to do so as we were of the view that even if a finding favourable to Lau were made in the court below, that would not have affected the outcome of his appeal. The sum total of the evidence raised by Lau, even conjoined with a finding that he was heavily addicted, was not enough to rebut the allegation that he had trafficked in two `liaps` of heroin.
 67.In particular, we were impressed by the fact that there were already 13 sachets of heroin in the vehicle which Lau could have used for his personal consumption. If the heroin did not belong to him, it must have belonged to Khoo or Foo and he could have arranged to buy over some or all of it. Even at the high rate of consumption alleged by Lau, the 13 sachets contained enough heroin to last a single addict at least two to three months or possibly longer.
 68.Furthermore, we noted that Lau gave evidence that he already had a regular supplier from whom he purchased heroin in straws. Although he gave evidence that he wanted to purchase heroin by the sachet (which would last him weeks) instead of by the straw (which would only last him days), we did not give this much weight. The entire elaborate scheme was inconsistent with a transaction for which the quantity of drugs was measured in sachets. Such a small amount as 70 to 80g could have been transacted with much less fuss. The degree of planning involved was more consistent with a large-scale delivery.
 69.Even if Lau had asked for ten sachets at first, we were of the view that once he saw the complex arrangements being made for delivery on the morning of 3 August 1996, he must have suspected that a much larger quantity was involved - a quantity in excess of what he had wanted. His failure to disassociate himself from Foo strongly suggests a pre-arranged plan and rendered him, by virtue of s 34 of the Penal Code, liable on a charge of trafficking.
 70.Thus, even taking into account the fact that Foo`s evidence had to be treated with caution, we came to the conclusion that Lau`s defence that he wanted only ten sachets for consumption was not made out on a balance of probabilities and we therefore upheld his conviction on the charge of trafficking.
 71.
 The case against Lim and Foo on the charge of conspiracy
The other central issue was the extent of Lim`s involvement - was he a mere intermediary, putting the major players in touch with each other, or did he orchestrate the negotiations between Foo and `Ah Heng` by acting as their agent, conveying important details such as the price, quantity and pick-up point for the heroin? If, as he asserted, Lim did not have knowledge of the price or quantity of heroin, he could not be said to have conspired with Foo to traffic in it.
 72.The only evidence truly incriminating of Lim was those parts of Foo`s investigation statements suggesting that Foo and Lim discussed the quantity and price of drugs and that Lim had instructed Foo to proceed to Yishun to await further instructions from `36`. As we have already explained, these statements were properly admitted after a voir dire, and had to be given more weight than Foo`s evidence-in-chief.
 73.However, being at the same time conscious of the court`s duty to treat Foo`s statements with caution and in particular to examine the veracity of the incriminating elements in light of his retraction, we approached the statements incriminating Lim in the same way that we approached those which incriminated Lau. As far as Lau was concerned, the retraction of the statements was not of great significance and we relied on the statements to convict him. However, we were of the view that as regards Lim, the same result was not justified. Although Foo`s statements suggested that Lim played an active role on both 2 and 3 August, the parts of the statements giving rise to that inference were unreliable: (a). Concerning the events of 2 August 1996, it was to our minds of fundamental importance that the trial judge accepted that the call tracing records clearly showed that there was no call from Foo to Lim at around 4pm on that day (this was the call during which Foo allegedly discussed the price and quantity of the drugs with Lim).
 (b). As regards 3 August 1996, the handphone and pager records suggested that Lim never spoke to either Foo or `Ah Heng` after about 11.45am on that day. This showed that Lim was not involved in the closing stages of the arrangements for delivery. Although Foo alleged in his statement that Lim contacted him by calling him on a public phone at the Yishun coffee-shop around 12.30pm, no records were adduced to prove that such a call was placed. The prosecution explained that records are not kept of telephone calls made from public phones. However, no suggestion was offered as to why Lim might have called Foo on a public phone instead of his handphone as was the case in all the other calls. As one of the telephone calls allegedly made by Foo to Lim had already been proved not to have taken place, we felt that this unsupported allegation in Foo`s statement should also be treated with circumspection.
 74.In assessing the case against Lim, we were particularly disturbed that the trial judge`s treatment of the evidence against him lacked completeness. We could not see how the trial judge came to his conclusion in light of the fact that the evidence against Lim had been undermined. The learned trial judge stated that he: 
found it difficult to believe that 
 Lau and Foo
 could have spoken on the telephone about obtaining drugs without mentioning the quantity of drugs wanted. (Emphasis supplied.)
 75.However, he did not state in his grounds of decision that he came to a similar conclusion vis-a-vis Foo and Lim. This was unfortunate because the discussion and agreement on price and quantity formed the essence of the allegation of conspiracy. Without such a finding, it would have been difficult to convict Foo and Lim on the charge of criminal conspiracy. However, other than finding that Foo and Lim did not have a conversation at 4pm on 2 August 1996, the trial judge did not direct himself to the question whether Foo might have discussed the quantity and price of the heroin at any other time. He simply found that: 
Foo and Lim had conspired for Lim to arrange for the drugs Lau wanted to be delivered to Foo.
 76.Whilst this might have been true in the loosest sense (in that Lim did play a role by putting Foo in contact with `Ah Heng`) there was no evidence to support the prosecution`s narrower contention that Lim knew the price and quantity and arranged with `Ah Heng` to deliver such quantity (ostensibly using Lau Boon Huat as the courier) to Block 753 Yishun. In our view, the trial judge`s finding that no call ever took place at 4pm on 2 August 1996 cut the heart out of the prosecution`s case against Lim. Although it was proved that Foo and Lim did speak on the telephone on several occasions on the morning of 3 August 1996, there was nothing to suggest that price or quantity was discussed during those conversations, whether in Foo`s statements, the investigation statements of Lim, Lau and Khoo or the evidence-in-chief of all three appellants. We were also inclined to accept that Lim did not play any part in the delivery arrangements, especially in view of the fact that the phone call between `36` and Foo at 11.27am went unexplained in Foo`s statement and the fact that the prosecution`s allegation that Lim called Foo at the Yishun coffee-shop public phone at around 12.30pm was unsubstantiated.
 77.In the light of the scant evidence, we concluded that the trial judge must have inferred the fact of conspiracy from his observation of the witnesses` demeanour and other evidence. As stated by the Court of Appeal in 
Lai Kam Loy v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 787
 , direct evidence of a conspiracy is not always readily available, and the words and actions of parties, although not constituting a conspiracy, may constitute evidence from which the existence of a conspiracy may be inferred. In such a case, the trial judge must be satisfied of the fact of conspiracy on a totality of the evidence.
 78.However, in that context, we felt that the prosecution`s failure to call `Ah Heng` as a witness was extremely unfortunate. It was clear that he was not a mere fictional mastermind. His handphone and pager records were adduced and they showed a course of communication between him and the appellants. He was even arrested in connection with the investigation. Given that Foo and Lim both referred to him in their evidence, he was in a very advantageous position to clarify matters. Section 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) provides that it should be presumed that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. We were therefore mindful of the possibility that the prosecution did not call `Ah Heng` because he would have supported the case put forward by the various defendants, in particular, that put forward by Lim.
 79.Before coming to that conclusion, we were aware that illustration (g) did not impose on us a mandatory presumption: it only permitted the presumption to be drawn. In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 , Yong Pung How CJ held that: 
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
 See also 
PP v Tan Lay Heong & Anor
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 150
  and 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 . We accepted this as the correct approach. Applying it to the present facts, we took the view that this was an appropriate case to rely on the presumption. This was not a case in which direct evidence of the conspiracy was not available and so the trial judge was left to infer its existence from the surrounding circumstances. This was a case in which evidence of a conspiracy, if any, was known to a witness which the prosecution chose not to call. `Ah Heng` could have given evidence that Lim never contacted him at all, suggesting that Lim was the mastermind. Alternatively, he might have given evidence that Lim was involved, but to a lesser or greater degree than he claimed. In the circumstances, there being no other evidence to incriminate Lim, we felt compelled to construe the failure to call `Ah Heng` against the prosecution.
 80.Lim`s counsel also raised the point that although Lim found out on the night of 3 August 1996 that `Ah Heng` had been arrested, he did not flee but returned to Seletar Work Release Camp on 4 August 1996. We accepted that this showed his innocent mind or lack of mens rea and reinforced his defence accordingly.
 81.We were reminded by Lim`s counsel that in a charge of criminal conspiracy, the burden of proving conspiracy was on the prosecution and they had to do so beyond reasonable doubt. Unlike the case against Lau and Foo, there was no presumption involved. The onus did not fall on Lim to prove anything, but on the prosecution to highlight the evidence which suggested that Lim was actively involved.
 82.In view of the fact that Foo`s evidence, being the evidence of an accomplice, had to be treated with caution because of s 116 illustration (b) of the Evidence Act, the further consideration that as a retracted confession it had to be treated with greater circumspection still, the fact that the elements in the statements which incriminated Lim were proved false, casting additional doubt on the usefulness of the statements, the fact that the prosecution had not called a vital witness, and that there was no other evidence against Lim than that which had been disproved, we felt that the prosecution had failed to meet the standard of proof required of it and we accordingly acquitted Lim on the charge of conspiracy.
 83.Having acquitted Lim, we acquitted Foo as well on the charge of conspiracy. In the absence of any agreement between them to traffic in heroin, both co-conspirators were entitled to an acquittal: see, for example our decision in 
PP v Sugianto
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 1
 . Foo, however, remained convicted of the joint charge of trafficking against him and Lau.
 84.
 Ghazal`s case
Notwithstanding our finding that the price or quantity of drugs was never communicated through Lim, the Public Prosecutor contended that a conviction on a conspiracy charge was nonetheless still warranted. In support, he cited the decision of the English Court of Appeal in 
R v El Ghazal
 
[1986] Cr LR 52
. The facts of that case were that the accused, E, had arranged a meeting between T and C whereby C agreed to buy cocaine from a certain vendor for T. T and C then agreed to cheat the vendor of his money. E was present at this meeting. E accompanied T and C to their meeting with the vendor but left soon afterwards because he was aware that T and C intended to cheat him of his money. E contended that he was not party to the conspiracy but had merely introduced T and C who had afterwards formed the conspiracy to buy cocaine. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that if the purpose of the introduction was so that one of them could buy cocaine, E had entered into an agreement to procure cocaine for one of them.
 85.The prosecution argued that by analogy, Lim, by introducing Foo to `Ah Heng`, had participated in a criminal conspiracy. We were not minded to accept 
 El Ghazal 
 without qualification. For one thing, it was of doubtful authority. The decision preceded by three days the decision of the House of Lords in the now leading case on conspiracy, 
R v Anderson
 
[1986] 1 AC 27
. In 
 Anderson 
, Lord Bridge noted that the mental element of conspiracy is only established when the accused enters into an agreement intending to play some part in the agreed course of conduct in furtherance of a criminal purpose which the agreed course of conduct is intended to achieve. In his commentary on the 
 El Ghazal 
 decision in the 
 Criminal Law Review 
, Professor JC Smith wrote that: 
It seems clear that there was no conspiracy to `unlawfully possess a controlled drug` when the appellant agreed to introduce T to C. When this agreement was fully carried out, no offence under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 would have been committed If there was no agreement unlawfully to possess a controlled drug until T and C met and agreed to procure possession for one of them, it appears that there was no evidence that the appellant was to play any part in the agreed course of conduct. 
 He had done all he was going to do before the conspiracy came into existence. He was not to procure or to receive the cocaine, or even to receive any reward: and therefore, according to
 Anderson, 
 he was not guilty of the conspiracy
. [Emphasis supplied.]
 We agreed with this analysis. Thus, if we were to accept the decision of the House of Lords as a valid statement of Singapore law, then the natural conclusion would be that there could be no conspiracy unless the prosecution proved that Lim participated in the negotiation of price, quantity or delivery of the heroin. In other words, Lim`s liability was contingent on an agreement requiring him to play an active role in the supply of the drugs. His agreement to introduce Foo to `Ah Heng` was not a criminal conspiracy because no offence was committed by `Ah Heng` in contacting Foo.
 86.Counsel for Lim further emphasised that in 
 El Ghazal 
`s case, the appellant was present at the meeting where the agreement to procure the cocaine was arrived at. That circumstance was not duplicated in the present case. This distinguishing factor was, at least in Professor Smith`s view, also significant, for he commented: 
It does not necessarily follow from the decision in the present case [meaning 
 El Ghazal
] that the appellant would have been guilty if he had done no more than arrange the introduction of T to C with a view to T`s obtaining the cocaine.
 By being present when the agreement to procure the cocaine was made, he apparently became a party to that agreement
. [Emphasis supplied.]
 If Professor Smith was right, and the Court of Appeal`s decision turned on El Ghazal`s presence at the meeting between T and C, then there is a real ground of distinction between the present case and that one.
 87.We wish to state that as the compatibility of Lord Bridge`s formulation of the law of conspiracy in 
 Anderson 
 with local cases and the provisions in the Penal Code was not argued before us, we thought it best to leave the question whether it should form part of our law open for future consideration. Suffice it to say, however, that it would have been singularly unwarranted for us to accept 
 El Ghazal 
 as an authority of any kind given that it has not been applied since it was decided, and in particular in light of its inconsistency with the leading English authority. On our own part, we were of the view that the absence of a requirement that a conspirator play some role in the conspiracy means that mere knowledge or consent to a criminal scheme involving other individuals would attract liability for criminal conspiracy, which we can only describe as an unattractive proposition at best.
 88.
 Whether Foo`s investigation statements were `confessions`
Mr Xavier, representing Lau, sought to establish that Foo`s investigation statements ought to be taken out of our consideration altogether as they were not confessions within the meaning of s 17 of the Evidence Act and thus was not evidence against his client under s 30 of the same Act. We admit that, robbed of the investigation statements, the prosecution`s case against Lau and Foo would have faltered. However, we found ourselves unable to accept Mr Xavier`s contentions.
 89.He contended that the statements were exculpatory. We did not agree. All that is required to constitute a statement a confession is that it states or suggests the inference that one has committed the offence. Vital elements suggesting guilt were present in the statement: the fact that Foo was asked to supply drugs, the fact that he agreed to try to do so, the fact that he enlisted Lim`s assistance, the fact that he collected the drugs pursuant to the arrangements with him. We were therefore of the view that Foo`s statements were properly classified as confessions. We wish to reiterate for the sake of clarity, however, that the fact that a statement is a confession does not render it unimpeachable, even if given voluntarily. If elements of the confession are proved inaccurate, then they must be treated with caution accordingly, especially if they are used under s 30. We trust that the guidelines we have set out will prove useful in that respect.
 90.
 Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, we allowed the appeal on the first charge and dismissed the appeal on the second charge. Given that we did not accept Lau`s and Foo`s allegations that they only wanted ten sachets of heroin, it was not necessary for us to consider the appeal against sentence on the second charge. The death penalty was, being mandatory, unappeallable.",1997-11-26 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

December 1994 - September 1995
114,026
October 1995 - September 1996
118,896
Total
232,922
 11.The advertising expenditure of Jumbo Garden for the period May 1993 to September 1995 was:
 
May 1993 - September 1993
43,217
October 1993 - September 1994
121,623
October 1994 - September 1995
119,767
Total
284,607
 12.Often the plaintiffs and Jumbo Garden advertised jointly and promoted themselves as a group. The advertisements were in the English and Chinese press, and by way of calendars, red packets, vehicle stickers, name cards and VIP cards.
 13.Jumbo Garden was a tenant of the East Coast Recreation Centre Pte Ltd (ECRC) paying $25,000 rent per month and occupying a land area of 1,189.16m2 out of a total land area of 21,516.10m2 leased to ECRC at $14,821.28 rent per month by the Land Office. When the Land Office revised the rent payable by ECRC by 5.6 times to $83,000 per month or $996,000 per annum, ECRC revised the rent payable by Jumbo Garden also by 5.6 times to $140,000 per month or $1,680,000 per annum.
 14.Jumbo Garden found it commercially not viable to continue business with the revised rent. It refused to pay the revised rent and was eventually wound up by ECRC on 27 September 1996.
 15.The majority shareholders of ECRC are related to or are members of the Grande group of companies of Hong Kong.
 16.On 28 May 1996, the defendant was incorporated in Singapore. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Grande Entertainment Group Pte Ltd which was incorporated in Singapore on 27 January 1995. The latter is a member of the Grande group of companies of Hong Kong. The Grande group is ultimately owned by the Grande Holdings Ltd of Hong Kong.
 17.On 18 October 1996, the defendant`s restaurant commenced business under the name `Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood Restaurant` at the same premises previously occupied by Jumbo Garden.
 18.On 4 November 1996, the plaintiffs commenced these passing off proceedings for an injunction to restrain the defendant from using the name `Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood Restaurant Pte Ltd` and for damages. They then applied for an interim injunction. The application went before S Rajendran J who ordered an early trial in lieu of an interim injunction.
 19.The proceedings came before me for hearing, at the end of which, I found for the plaintiffs and granted the injunction applied for, restraining the defendant, its servants or agents, from using the name `Jumbo` with a stay for 60 days to allow the defendant to change its name. I also ordered an enquiry to be held before the registrar to ascertain damages. The plaintiffs were also awarded costs. Thee defendant has appealed against my decision. I now give my reasons.
 20.The defence principally contended that: (i) the plaintiffs are not entitled to the reliefs claimed because the plaintiffs did not enjoy any goodwill or reputation in the name `Jumbo`; (ii) the word `Jumbo` is descriptive for which no monopoly could be claimed; and (iii) the plaintiffs appropriated the name `Jumbo` from the internationally renowned Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong, with which the defendant is associated, and its use of the name `Jumbo` is with the consent of the owners of the Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong.
 21.On what constitutes goodwill, Lord Macnaghten in 
Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co`s Margarine Ltd
 
[1901] AC 217
 at pp 223-224 stated: 
What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start.
 22.The relevant date to determine whether a plaintiff has acquired the necessary goodwill or reputation is the date of commencement of the conduct complained of. See 
Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd & Ors v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd
 
[1981] 1 All ER 213
 at p 221 where Lord Scarman stated: 
The judge, it is conceded, misdirected himself in holding that the relevant date for determining whether a plaintiff has established the necessary goodwill or reputation of his product is the date of the commencement of the proceedings (ie 1 June 1977). The relevant date is, in law, the date of the commencement of the conduct complained of, ie 8 April 1975, when the respondent began to market `Pub Squash`.
 23.Applying the dicta of Lord Scarman the relevant date at which to determine if the plaintiffs have the goodwill and/or reputation to entitle them to an order restraining the defendant from using the name `Jumbo` is 18 October 1996.
 24.By that date, the first plaintiff had been operating its restaurant under the name `Jumbo Seafood Pte Ltd` for about nine years and the second plaintiff under the name `Jumbo Serangoon Restaurant Pte Ltd` for about two years and five months. Jumbo Garden had operated for about two years and seven months. An awareness level survey conducted by Frank Small & Associates between 20 and 27 December 1996 showed that 46% out of 300 persons interviewed had heard of Jumbo Seafood, 19% had heard of Jumbo Serangoon Restaurant, 52% of those who were aware of Jumbo Seafood knew that it is situated somewhere in East Coast. 48% of those who were aware of Jumbo Serangoon Restaurant knew that it is in the Serangoon Gardens Country Club or in Serangoon.
 25.The results of this awareness level survey are supported by the turnover of the Jumbo group. From date of commencement of its business to September 1996, the first plaintiff had a turnover of $43,700,000, and the second plaintiff $8,357,869. In the case of Jumbo Garden for the period May 1993 to September 1995, it had a turnover of $8,024,138. All in, the group had a total turnover of over $60,000,000. It had expended about $1,000,000 on advertising and had received favourable write ups in the media on the quality of its seafood. I was therefore of the view that the plaintiffs had acquired, individually and as a group, the goodwill and reputation in the name `Jumbo` in relation to their seafood restaurants in Singapore as of 18 October 1996 when the defendant`s restaurant opened for business.
 26.Is `Jumbo` a descriptive or fancy word? While `Jumbo` means `large` or `big` like `jumbo jet`, it is not synonymous with `large` or `big`. For example, one does not describe a large lake as a `jumbo lake`. So, also one does not describe a big restaurant as a `jumbo restaurant`. On whether a word is fancy or descriptive, see 
Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd v CDL Hotels International Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 726
  at p 741 where Chao Hick Tin J stated: 
A fancy word is one which has no obvious relevance to the character or quality of the goods or business in relation to which it is used. Of course whether a word is fancy or descriptive may depend on how it is used. Whether a word is termed descriptive or fancy, the significance lies in the fact that distinctiveness is very much more easily acquired for fancy words. Whatever it is, at the end of the day, the crucial question is still this, and I can do no better than quote 
 Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off
 (at p 392):
 
`However, the decision to categorise a word as fancy or descriptive is only one part of the wider issue of whether there is a material representation to restrain. Inherent ability to distinguish is always a matter of degree with there being a continuous spectrum between the highly fanciful and the obviously descriptive. Wherever the name may fall on that range, what matters is whether the name is distinctive in fact.`
 In my view, `Jumbo`, in the context of the plaintiffs` names, is a fancy word and distinctive of their seafood restaurants.
 27.On the defendant`s claim that the plaintiffs had appropriated the name `Jumbo` from the Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong, this was admitted by the plaintiffs. However, the claim that the defendant is associated with the Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong is tenuous. The defendant is ultimately owned by the Grande Holdings Ltd of Hong Kong. The Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong is part of the group owned by Melco Holdings Ltd. The only connection between the two groups is their having a common chairman, Dr Stanley Ho, who has substantial interest in both Grande Holdings Ltd and Melco Holdings Ltd.
 28.Be that as it may, neither Grande Holdings Ltd nor Melco Holdings Ltd had any goodwill in Singapore under the name `Jumbo` to authorise the use of the same by the defendant. Grande Holdings Ltd never used the name `Jumbo` in Singapore. In the case of Melco Holdings Ltd, it did operate a floating restaurant in Singapore in the 1990s but under the name `Sea Dragon`. Goodwill must be attached to a business in a locality. See 
 Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co`s Margarine Ltd 
, supra, at p 224 per Lord Macnaghten: 
For my part, I think that if there is one attribute common to all cases of goodwill it is the attribute of locality. For goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the business, and the goodwill perishes with it, though elements remain which may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again.
 29.In 
Star Industrial Co Ltdd v Yap Kwee Kor (t/a New Star Industrial Co)
 
[1976] FSR 256
, the plaintiff there, a Hong Kong company, manufactured toothbrushes in Hong Kong with a characteristic get-up with the words `Ace Brand`. For several years prior to 1965, it had marketed substantial quantities of these toothbrushes in Singapore mainly for the purpose of re-export to Malaysia and Indonesia. Some of these toothbrushes were also sold in Singapore for local use. In 1965, the plaintiff stopped marketing and selling in Singapore. In 1968, the defendant set up a firm with a name similar to the plaintiff`s, commenced marketing toothbrushes under a get-up indistinguishable from that formerly used by the plaintiff except that the letter `C` in `ACE` was replaced by the letter `G`. In 1968 the plaintiff formed a subsidiary plastics company in Singapore in which it owned half the equity and to which it assigned its residual goodwill in Singapore together with the right of user of the marks in issue, on an exclusive basis. Its action for passing off was dismissed by the Singapore High Court. Its appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council were also dismissed. In delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Diplock stated at p 269: 
Whatever doubts there may have previously been as to the legal nature of the rights which were entitled to protection by an action for `passing-off` in courts of law or equity, these were laid to rest more than 60 yeas ago by the speech of Lord Parker of Waddington in 
AG Spalding & Bros v AW Gamage Ltd
 
[1915] 32 R P C 273
 (`the 
 Gamage
 case`) with which the other members of the House of Lords agreed. A passing-off action is a remedy for the invasion of a right of property not in the mark, name or get-up improperly used, but in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation made by passing-off one person`s goods as the goods of another. Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached. It is local in character and divisible; if the business is carried on in several countries a separate goodwill attaches to it in each. So when the business is abandoned in one country in which it has acquired a goodwill the goodwill in that country perishes with it although the business may continue to be carried on in other countries. (See: 
Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co`s Margarine Ltd
 
[1901] AC 217
, per Lord Macnaghten at p 224; per Lord Lindley at p 235.) Once the Hong Kong company had abandoned that part of its former business that consisted in manufacturing toothbrushes for export to and sale in Singapore it ceased to have any proprietary right in Singapore which was entitled to protection in any action for passing-off brought in the courts of that country.

Taco Bell Pty Ltd v Taco Company of Australia Ltd
 
[1982] 40 ALR 153
.
 30.The defendant allegedly chose the name `Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood Restaurant` to associate itself with the Jumbo group of Hong Kong which has three floating restaurants in Hong Kong and one in Shanghai. This however offers no answer to the plaintiffs` action for passing off if it causes confusion or likely to cause confusion. See 
Excelsior Pte Ltd v Excelsior Sport (S) Pte Ltd
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 130
  at p 132; [1984-1985] SLR 591 at p 594 per FA Chua J: 
The defendants say that they are associated in Hong Kong with a company with a similar name and their choice of their name was not intended to deceive or confuse. The plaintiffs and the defendants carry on the same type of business and it is not incumbent on the plaintiffs, in order for them to succeed, to establish that the defendants set out to deceive (see 
Mun Loong Co Sdn Bhd v Chai Tuck Kin
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 356
 ).
 
The trade name will normally have attached to it a goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off, as I have said, will lie wherever the defendant company`s name is calculated to deceive, and so to divert business from the plaintiff to the defendant, or to occasion a confusion between the two businesses (
 Kerly
 para 16-50). If a trade name suggests that the defendant`s business is an extension, branch or another agency of or otherwise connected with the plaintiff`s business an injunction will be granted (Ewing v Buttercup Margarine Co Ltd [1917] 2 Ch 1).
 31.The use of the name `Jumbo` by the defendant`s restaurant operating in the premises previously occupied by Jumbo Garden which is within two to three kilometres of the first plaintiff`s restaurant along the same stretch of road at East Coast Parkway has caused confusion. It has also given rise to the suggestion that Jumbo Garden has re-opened or that the defendant`s restaurant is connected with the plaintiffs. For this, an action for passing off will lie. See 
The Clock Ltd v The Clock House Hotel Ltd
 
[1936] 53 RPC 269
 at p 275 Romer LJ stated: 
No man is entitled to carry on his business in such a way or by such a name as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on the business of another man or to lead to the belief that the business which he is carrying on has any connexion with the business carried on by another man.
 
 
The persons who are likely to be misled are the persons who do not know the plaintiffs` road house, but have heard of the reputation which it enjoys. When a motorist hears that there is near Welwyn a place where he can get an excellent luncheon and that that place is known as the 
 Clock
, the 
 Clock House
, the 
 Clock Hotel
 or some such name and when he gets in the neighbourhood of Welwyn, as he does when he is passing the defendants` premises, there is a very good chance, I should think, of his being deceived into believing that he has come to the place which has been recommended to him and taking his luncheon there. Five miles is not a very great distance to the modern-day motorist, and the plaintiffs` road house is not in Welwyn village. Road houses seldom are in the actual villages. The road house in question is on the Welwyn by-pass. The defendants` premises are on the by-pass with which most of us are familiar, the new road that by-passes Hatfield and Welwyn. Not only do I think that it is likely, indeed, I should say certain, that confusion would be caused by the defendants` calling their hotel `
 Clock House
,`
 32.For an action for passing off, no intention to deceive or cause confusion is necessary. Likelihood of confusion is sufficient. See 
Berkeley Hotel Co Ltd v Berkeley International (Mayfair) Ltd & Anor
 
[1972] RPC 237
 per Pennycuick VC at p 242: 
A trader is not entitled to represent that his goods or services are those of another trader. The test habitually applied is whether the name or make-up, or whatever it may be, applied by the former trader to his goods or services is likely to cause deception or confusion in the minds of the relevant section of the public. Here one is concerned with a name. The relevant section of the public is clients of and prospective clients of the hotels and their agents, either professional travel agents or business associates. In considering whether there is a likelihood of deception all relevant circumstances must be taken into account. The decision is one which must be made by the court after considering all admissible evidence.
 33.There is ample evidence of confusion caused by the defendant`s use of the name `Jumbo`. Even before the defendant`s restaurant opened for business some tradesmen delivered to the first plaintiff`s restaurant goods meant for the defendant. Thereafter, there were numerous instances of the first plaintiff`s customers who had made reservations, finding themselves or their guests at the defendant`s restaurant by mistake and who either did not turn up at the first plaintiff`s restaurant at all or turned up late. Some were under the impression that Jumbo Garden had reopened for business or that the defendant`s restaurant was a branch of the plaintiffs. Evidence of this confusion came from the evidence of two of such customers, and the questionnaires and transcripts of the taped telephone conversations between the plaintiffs` staff and customers. There was also the survey by Frank Small & Associates which found that 40% of those interviewed, that is 120 persons, thought that the defendant`s restaurant was somehow associated or connected with the plaintiffs` Jumbo group. Of these 120 persons, 69% of them attributed the confusion to the word `Jumbo`, 13% to both having the same or almost the same name and 8% to both being seafood restaurants with the same name.
 34.On the admissibility of such survey report without the attendance of those interviewed, see 
Saga Foodstuffs Manufacturing (Pte) Ltd v Best Food Pte Ltd

  at p 744 where Warren LH Khoo J stated: 
In 
Customglass Boats Ltd v Salthouse Bros Ltd
 
[1976] RPC 589
, it fell upon Mahon J in the Supreme Court of New Zealand to consider this very question in the context of a market survey report. After analyzing English and American authorities, including 
A Baily & Co v Clark Son & Morland
 
[1938] AC 557
, 
General Electric Co (USA) v General Electric Co Ltd
 
[1972] 1 WLR 729
 (Graham J, CA and HL), 
 People v Franklin National Bank
 105 NYS 2d 81 (NY SC, 1951), as well as US academic writers, the learned judge held as follows:
 
`A properly drawn market research questionnaire, carefully framed so as to elicit opinions or beliefs held by persons adequately informed, can only reveal, in my opinion, the existence or otherwise, in a defined proportion of the persons interviewed, of the relevant opinion or belief, and I do not think it can be right in cases involving trade mark infringement or passing off where evidence of reputation is relevant, and especially in a passing off action where affidavit evidence is not receivable, to compel a party to produce in the courtroom an interminable parade of witnesses to depose individually as to their knowledge and understanding of the trade association involved in a particular trade mark or design, so long as there are followed the cautionary procedures recommended in the article in the 
 New York University Law Review
 above cited. The evidence obtained by research survey is in my view legitimate proof of the fact the opinions obtained had in fact existed, whether rightly held or not, and on that view of the matter it is my opinion that such evidence is not hearsay at all and that, even if it did fall within the technical concept of hearsay or representing a collation of individual statements made out of court, then the evidence would still be admissible by way of exception to the hearsay rule because it exhibits the existence of a state of mind shared in common by a designated class of persons.`
 
The article in the 
 New York University Law Review
 which the learned judge referred to suggested as a condition of its admissibility that the evidence must have been obtained by research scientifically conducted `under circumstances where a sincere and accurate statement naturally would be uttered so that there exists at least a circumstantial probability of the reliability of such evidence.`
 
The learned judge himself suggested the following requirements:
 
`There must be a formulation of questions cast in such a way as to preclude a weighted or conditioned response, there must be clear proof that the answers were faithfully and accurately recorded, and there must be evidence that the answers were drawn from a true cross-section of that class of the public or trade whose impression or opinion is relevant to the matter in issue.`
 
In 
Lego System A/S v Lego M Lemelstrich
 
[1983] FSR 155
, Falconer J accepted the primary view of Mahon J that such evidence is not hearsay but is evidence proving an external fact, namely, that a particular opinion is held by the public or a section of the public.
 
I respectfully agree with this view. It seems to me that evidence of the results of a market survey research of the kind in question in this suit is evidence of the existence of the belief or opinion held by the respondents to the survey. The purpose of tendering such evidence is to show that such belief or opinion exists; there is no question of tendering it for the purpose of proving the truth or merits of the belief or opinion so held. In my view, evidence as to whether and the extent to which a certain belief or opinion is held by a person or a group of persons, when that is in issue, is evidence of a fact in issue, and its admission falls within the general provision of s 5 of the Evidence Act for the reception of evidence of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue.
 35.The survey by Frank Small & Associates was, inter alia, to establish: (i). the awareness level of the first plaintiff`s restaurant and the second plaintiff`s restaurant; and
 (ii). if any confusion exists between the plaintiffs` Jumbo group of restaurants and the defendant`s restaurant.
 To establish (i) the respondent was asked: Question 1:. Have you heard of the following seafood restaurants:
 . Jumbo Seafood
 . Jumbo Serangoon Seafood
 If the answer to question 1 was `Yes`, the respondent would be asked by question 2 to give the locations. In either case, the respondent would then be asked by question 3 if he thought that the restaurants listed were connected or associated with each other and if the answer was `Yes`, which ones. The restaurants listed were: . Jumbo Garden Restaurant
 . Jumbo Seafood
 . Jumbo Serangoon Restaurant
 . Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood Restaurant
 . Hong Kong Sar Teen Restaurant
 . Hong Kong Zhai Tim Sum Centre Pte Ltd
 36.The 300 persons interviewed comprised 80% Chinese, 10% Indians, and 10% expatriates of ages ranging from 15 to 50 and above. The sample profile percentage of the age groups was said to have been based on the national population profile. The interviews were conducted in busy locations, being Orchard Road, Bugis Junction, Ang Mo Kio Town Centre, Bishan Junction 8, Tiong Bahru Plaza, Clementi Town Centre, Jurong Point, Bedok Town Centre, and Tampines Town Centre. In my view, the formulation of questions was proper and the survey was conducted among a true cross-section of our population whose opinion is relevant to the issues herein. There was no suggestion that the answers were not accurately recorded.
 37.There was also the evidence of a customer, Brian D Abrams, who is a marketing manager by profession. He testified that he and his friends identified the plaintiffs by the name `Jumbo` and that consumers would be confused into thinking that the defendant was associated with the plaintiffs because the defendant occupied the premises previously occupied by Jumbo Garden.
 38.Another customer who testified was Jonathan Foo, a television producer, who lived in Singapore almost all his life. He and three colleagues intended to go to the first plaintiff`s restaurant to attend a farewell dinner for another colleague. They ended up in the defendant`s restaurant. It was only after he called a member of another group attending the same farewell dinner on his handphone that he realised he had gone to the wrong restaurant.
 39.Likelihood of damage due to confusion is sufficient for an action for passing off. See 
Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 361
  
[1991] SLR 133
 per Yong Pung How CJ at p 362 (MLJ) and p 135 (SLR): 
The law of passing-off is well established. The appellant must establish reputation in the get-up, misrepresentation and likelihood of damage.
 I was satisfied on the evidence before me that there was confusion between the plaintiffs` restaurants and that of the defendant due to the use by the defendant of the name `Jumbo`.
 40.The defendant however contended that as the plaintiffs appropriated the name `Jumbo` from the Jumbo Floating Restaurant of Hong Kong with which the defendant is associated, no injunction, which is an equitable remedy, should be granted because the plaintiffs did not `come with clean hands`. For this proposition, the defendant relied on 
Brewster Transport Co v Rocky Mountain Tours & Transport Co
 
[1931] 1 DLR 713
. The plaintiff there carried on a sightseeing business in Alberta, Canada, for many years. In 1927 it inaugurated a service under the trade name `Royal Blue Line`, knowing that it was already in use by the American corporation, the Royal Blue Line Inc, in the United States and in Canada and that the reputation of the American Royal Blue Line Inc would likely bring in large volume of business it would not otherwise obtain. Later the defendant with the leave and licence of the American Royal Blue Line Inc began to use the name `Royal Blue Line` for its sightseeing business in the areas served by the plaintiff. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction. In dismissing the plaintiff`s appeal, Anglin CJC said at pp 714 to 715: 
The plaintiff in this action invokes the equitable jurisdiction of the court for the protection of its alleged right to the trade name of `Royal Blue Line` by an injunction to restrain the defendants from making use of that name. In such a case the well-known maxim of equity clearly finds its application, - `He who comes into equity must come with clean hands.`
 
 
While the statement of defence does not directly charge fraud against the plaintiff in making use of the name `Royal Blue Line,` at the outset of the trial of the case its counsel stated that the right of the plaintiff or defendants, or either of them, to the use of the name `Royal Blue Line` in Alberta was the issue to be tried. The plaintiff`s exclusive right to use the name in the Province of Alberta is also expressly denied in para 2 of the statement of defence. Without, therefore, determining whether the plaintiff has been guilty of such fraud in the appropriation of that name as would justify an injunction being granted against them at the suit of the United States Co (The Royal Blue Line Inc), the evidence seems to establish that the 
 plaintiff took this name for trade purposes knowing that it was already in use by the American company, and its affiliated corporations, in a large way, both in the United States and Canada
, and that the reputation of the American Royal Blue Line would be quite likely to result in a large body of trade coming to the plaintiff through the use of this name, which it could not otherwise look for. This, in my opinion, amounts to a use of the name calculated to mislead the public to such an extent that its use by the plaintiff cannot be said to have been proper. [Underlining added.]
 41.As the name `Royal Blue Line` had been in use by the American corporation and its affiliates in a large way in Canada the American corporation had acquired a goodwill and reputation in Canada attached thereto and thus could license the use of the name by the defendant in Canada. 
 Brewster` 
s case was therefore of no assistance to the defendant herein.
 42.The law of passing off has been succinctly stated by Lord Oliver in 
Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc &Ors
 
[1990] RPC 341
 at p 406: 
The law of passing off can be summarized in one short general proposition - no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying `get-up` (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff`s goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff`s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff. For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet action that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant`s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant`s goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.
 43.On the evidence before me I was satisfied that the plaintiffs have a goodwill or reputation in the name `Jumbo` in connection with their seafood restaurants. The defendant`s use of the word `Jumbo` as part of the name of its restaurant has caused confusion and will continue to cause confusion. The plaintiffs have suffered damage or are likely to suffer damage as a result thereof. Accordingly, I made the orders appealed against.",1997-12-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

You, Lim Keng Chia m/39 Yrs (NRIC S 1274448-Z) are charged that you, on or about 29 January 1996, at Singapore, did consume a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, morphine without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
And further that you before commission of the said act, that is to say that you on 25 September 1967, at Court No 26 of the subordinate court, Havelock Square, Singapore, vide MAC 8480/78, had been convicted for an offence under s 6(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, which conviction had not been set aside, and you are liable to punishment under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 2.Having heard the submissions of the petitioner`s counsel, I concluded that the petition was without merit and I dismissed it accordingly. I now set forth my reasons for doing so.
 3.
 The facts of the case
Briefly, the events leading to the petitioner being charged in the district court were as follows. On 29 January 1996 the petitioner was apprehended by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at the NTUC Fair Price Supermarket in Bedok. The following day, he was placed in Kaki Bukit Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) pursuant to an order made by the Director of the CNB in exercise of his powers under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He remained in detention at Kaki Bukit DRC for over a year. He was eventually discharged on 28 February 1997.
 4.On 2 March 1997, the petitioner was brought before Court 26 of the subordinate courts on a charge of unauthorised consumption of a controlled drug under s 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. I have already set out above the terms of this charge. It may be noted that the instance of drug consumption alleged in the charge was apparently the same incident which formed the catalyst for the petitioner`s apprehension and subsequent detention in the DRC in January 1996. Before the district judge, the petitioner`s counsel submitted that the charge was bad in law. The submission was rejected and on 19 September 1997, the petitioner elected to plead guilty. He was convicted on his plea of guilt and sentenced to three years` imprisonment.
 5.
 The grounds for the petition
 autrefois convict 
 acquit 
At the hearing before me, the petitioner`s counsel reprised the same arguments canvassed before the district judge. These were: (a). that the petitioner`s conviction on 19 September 1997 violated the doctrine of and enshrined in our Constitution;
 (b). that the Attorney General`s decision to prosecute the petitioner constituted an `abuse of the court process`; and
 (c). that Parliament could not have intended `that a person who has been sent to DRC is to be subsequently charged for the same fact that caused him to be sent to the DRC, unless he is apprehended on a fresh count of consumption of drug`.
 6.
 Whether the petitioner`s conviction on 19 September 1997 violated the principle of autrefois convict and acquit
In respect of the argument summarised at (a) above, counsel contended that the detention order made by the Director of the CNB on 30 January 1996 amounted to a conviction; and that the conviction sustained by the petitioner on 19 September 1997 amounted to a second conviction in respect of the same offence. In counsel`s submission, this was a clear violation of art 11(2) of the Constitution, which article endorses the doctrine of 
 autrefois convict 
 and 
 acquit 
in the following terms: 
A person who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence shall not be tried again for the same offence except where the conviction or acquittal has been quashed and a retrial ordered by a court superior to that by which he was convicted or acquitted.
 7.The above argument depended on the proposition that a detention order under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act amounted to a conviction. I asked counsel if he knew of any authorities which supported such a proposition. He said he did not. He referred me, however, to the case of 
Harry Lee Wee v Law Society of Singapore
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 1
  [1984-1985] SLR 41 , which he said involved an analogous situation.
 8.Regrettably, having read the judgment delivered in that case, I could not see that it bore any relevance to the petition before me. In 
 Harry Lee Wee 
`s case, the Privy Council was asked to determine whether the two successive sets of disciplinary proceedings brought against the appellant were based on the same instance of misconduct; and if so, whether the second set of such proceedings amounted to a violation of the doctrine of 
 autrefois convict 
 and 
 acquit 
or at the very least, an abuse of the disciplinary process provided for in the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217). The Privy Council answered these questions in the affirmative. It must be pointed out, however, that the Privy Council in 
 Harry Lee Wee 
`s case was faced with two sets of the same sort of proceedings. I did not see, therefore, how the court`s reasoning in 
 Harry Lee Wee 
 illuminated in any way counsel`s efforts at persuading me, in this case, that a detention order made by the Director of the CNB amounted to the same sort of process as a conviction sustained in a court of law. Counsel`s proposition required from me a leap of reasoning for which no support could be found in 
 Harry Lee Wee 
`s case.
 9.In fact, the cases to which I have had regard indicate a state of affairs which is in complete opposition to that argued for by counsel.
 10.In 
Daud bin Salleh v Superintendent, Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 191
  [1980-1981] SLR 415 , for example, the appellant was sent for a medical examination following an order made by the Director of the CNB under what was then s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (our present s 37(1)). The medical report issued following the examination stated that the appellant was a heroin addict; and based on this report, the Director of the CNB ordered that the appellant be detained at Sembawang DRC, pursuant to what was then s 33(2) of the Act (our present s 37(2)). The appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus. In allowing the application, Choor Singh J made the following observations about the nature of orders made under ss 33(1) and 33(2): 
In my judgment the condition precedent for requiring a person to be medically examined is the subjective satisfaction of the director. Section 33(1) provides that any person whom the director `reasonably suspects to be a drug addict` may be required to be medically examined. The director alone has to decide whether there is a reasonable cause to suspect a person to be a drug addict. If the director has acted in good faith, he cannot be called upon to disclose what circumstances made him to `reasonably suspect` a person to be a drug addict. It is obvious that in many cases the director will be acting on information of the most confidential character, which could not be communicated to the person concerned or disclosed to the court without the greatest risk of prejudicing the future efforts of the director in such cases. 
 The question is one of detention justified by suspicion, not of criminal conviction which can only be justified by legal evidence
. [Emphasis added.]
 11.Clearly, Choor Singh J`s view was that a detention order made by the Director of the CNB could not be equated with a conviction sustained in a court of law.
 12.In the above case, Choor Singh J also went on to hold that the medical report provided to the Director of the CNB failed to provide an adequate basis for the exercise of his powers under s 33(2) - our present s 37(2) - because it contained only the bare opinion of the medical officer concerned: for that reason, he felt that a writ of habeas corpus was justified. In the subsequent case of 
Subramaniam s/o Marie v Superintendent, Selarang Park Drug Rehabilitation Centre
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 194
  [1980-1981] SLR 488 , a court of three judges composed of Wee Chong Jin CJ, T Kulasekaram and TS Sinnathuray JJ held that s 33(2) contained no requirement that a medical officer `furnish the Director with detailed facts and analysis of his examination, observation or test`: the court expressly disagreed with Choor Singh J`s views in this respect. It must be noted, however, that the court did not express any disagreement with his observations on the nature of orders under ss 33(1) and 33(2) (our present ss 37(1) and 37(2)).
 13.I also found assistance from the judgment in 
Yeap Hock Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia & Ors
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 279
 , a case cited in the deputy public prosecutor`s written submissions. Although this case actually involved detention orders made pursuant to the Malaysian Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969, I found the principles stated by Abdoolcader J equally applicable to the petitioner`s case. The applicant in 
 Yeap Hock Seng 
`s case was initially charged with murder under the Malaysian Penal Code. Subsequently, on the prosecution`s application, he was discharged by the court but on leaving the court room, he was immediately re-arrested and detained pursuant to a ministerial order made under s 4(1) of the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969. The applicant applied for a writ of habeas corpus. One of the grounds of his application was the submission that the detention order violated the principle of protection against `double jeopardy` enshrined in art 7(2) of the Malaysian Constitution (which article is in pari materia with article 11(2) of our Constitution). In rejecting this submission, Abdoolcader J held as follows: 
The constitutional protection against double jeopardy embodied in art 7(2) of the Constitution and the principle of autrefois acquit and convict enacted in s 302 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be applicable as satisfaction under the [Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime)] Ordinance is not a prosecution or trial. Indeed the very essence of preventive detention is incarceration without the benefit of a prosecution or trial and with no offence proved nor any charge formulated or preferred. There is and can be no identity of offence or of prosecution between detention under the Ordinance and a conviction upon trial by a court of law.
 14.Applying the above reasoning to the present case: all that was required for a detention order to be made against the petitioner under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that the Director of the CNB be satisfied that it was `necessary` for the petitioner to `undergo treatment or rehabilitation or both at an approved institution`. To paraphrase Abdoolcader J, in the making of the detention order, there was no question of any specific offence being identified as having been committed by the petitioner and certainly no question of the petitioner being tried on any particular charge. In short, I could see no basis for saying that the detention order made against the petitioner on 30 January 1996 amounted to a criminal conviction. In my view, therefore, the conviction sustained by the petitioner on 19 September 1997 could not be said to constitute an instance of `double jeopardy`.
 15.
 Whether, in the circumstances of the case, the Attorney General had the jurisdiction to prosecute the petitioner for unauthorised drug consumption
I next considered the arguments summarised at (b) and (c) of para 5 above. These two arguments really came to the same thing: the point being made was that the Attorney General had no jurisdiction to prosecute the petitioner for unauthorised drug consumption if the instance of consumption relied on was the same incident which had been the catalyst for the petitioner`s detention in the DRC. In the petition for revision, it was submitted that the Attorney General`s power to prosecute for offences under s 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act had in this case been `curtailed` by the making of a detention order under s 37(2). Counsel contended that in enacting the Misuse of Drugs Act, Parliament could not have intended `that a person who has been sent to DRC is to be subsequently charged for the same fact that caused him to be sent to the DRC, unless he is apprehended on a fresh count of consumption of drug`.
 16.In support of the above argument, counsel referred me to the case of 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
 . However, as I pointed out to him, 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 was concerned with the regime of reformative training provided for in s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The decision in 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 provided no support for the proposition put forward by counsel in this case, which proposition required me to conclude that the penal sanctions in the Misuse of Drugs Act and the detention provisions in the Act were mutually exclusive. Having examined the relevant provisions in the Act, I did not find this a sensible interpretation of the legislative intent. Consider, for example, the following scenario. X, a drug addict, is charged in court with unauthorised drug consumption. Certain weaknesses in the prosecution`s chain of evidence and/or dismal performances by prosecution witnesses on the stand result in X`s acquittal. In the meantime, the Director of the CNB receives medical evidence which satisfies him of X`s drug addiction. In such circumstances, is the Director of the CNB to be barred from ordering X`s detention in a DRC? Is X to be allowed to remain at large in the community, free to continue feeding his drug addiction and possibly to influence others into picking up that addiction? I do not think Parliament can have intended such a situation. In my view, the intention must be for the detention provisions in the Misuse of Drugs Act to complement the penal sanctions provided by the Act.
 17.I found support for the above view in the relevant Parliamentary debates. I had regard, for example, to the Parliamentary debate which preceded the enactment of Act No 12 of 1977. This amending Act brought about various changes in the detention provision we now know as s 37: it introduced, for example, a minimum detention period of six months for any person admitted to a DRC. When the then Minister for Home Affairs moved the second reading of the amendment Bill, he was asked inter alia why a drug addict should be detained in a DRC if he was due to be prosecuted for unauthorised drug consumption anyway. The Minister`s reply was particularly instructive: Mr Baptist:. Why can we not charge the drug addicts in court? Why do we detain them without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves? Is it because it is very difficult to make a case against them that we take this sort of attitude?
 Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs):. Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we adopted this practice is, if we allow the drug addicts to go free, there is a possibility that they may go deeper into drug addiction and infect others. As you know, any person being charged for any offence can be bailed out. As a result he is free. And he can ask for an adjournment. In the meantime he can infect other people. On the other hand, as far as this procedure is concerned, a person is detained for rehabilitation on the basis of a urine test
 18.Evidently, therefore, Parliament never viewed the making of a detention order under s 37(2) as a bar to subsequent prosecution of the detainee after his release from the DRC. To put it another way, if the Attorney General decides to prosecute a DRC detainee for unauthorised drug consumption after his release from the DRC, that is precisely what Parliament has empowered the Attorney General to do.
 19.Of course, prior to such subsequent prosecution being brought, the Attorney General will presumably consider all the relevant factors in the individual detainee`s case and then assess whether prosecution is appropriate. I have perused the notes of evidence taken by the district judge on 19 September 1997; and I have noted the submissions made by the deputy public prosecutor as well as the petitioner`s counsel during that hearing. According to the deputy public prosecutor, in deciding to prosecute the petitioner for unauthorised drug consumption, the Attorney General took into account the fact that the petitioner was `a repeat offender and recalcitrant`. In the hearing before me, counsel for the petitioner did not attempt to suggest that the Attorney General`s decision was in any way mala fides. His position was, simply, that an exercise of the detention powers in s 37(2) precluded a subsequent exercise of the Attorney General`s power to prosecute; and that, as I have said, was an untenable position.
 20.
 Conclusion
In the light of the reasons given above, I dismissed the petition for revision.",1998-01-02 00:00:00,SG High Court
