     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Wednesday, 26 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Johnny GHARIBIAN 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: The applicant, Johnny Gharibian, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Judge Luland of Queen’s Counsel after the applicant had been convicted by a jury in the District Court of two counts of supplying prohibited drugs. On a charge of supplying cocaine, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years comprising a minimum term of one year commencing on 19 August 1998 and expiring on 18 August 1999 and an additional term of one year commencing on 19 August 1999 and expiring on 18 August 2000. On a charge of supplying methylamphetamine his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of six months, commencing on 19 August 1998. His Honour directed the release of the applicant to parole at the expiration of the minimum term and directed that thereafter he be under the supervision of the parole service for the period of the additional term. 
     
      
    2   The applicant was stopped by police during a random mobile breath testing exercise on 12 August 1996. His behaviour made police suspicious and they searched his car. They found a small quantity of powder. He tried to hide something in his trousers and that turned out to be a large plastic bag containing a number of smaller re-sealable plastic bags containing a drug. Also found in his car was a set of electronic scales and a razor blade bearing cocaine residue. He had $785 in cash in one of his pockets. He made no admissions to the police and pleaded not guilty. At the time of sentence, he was still denying that he had the drugs other than for his own use. 
     
      
    3   Counsel for the applicant did not attack the length of the overall sentence. It was submitted on appeal that his Honour did not give proper weight to the evidence of rehabilitation that was presented on behalf of the appellant. Dealing with the question of rehabilitation, his Honour remarked that the fact that the applicant had gone down the road of rehabilitation enabled him to find the existence of special circumstances for the purposes of s 5(2) Sentencing Act. 
     
      
    4   Counsel for the appellant drew attention to the report of a clinical psychologist, Mr Borenstein, 15 September 1998, which was before his Honour for consideration on sentence. That report set out the background and family history of the applicant and proffered an explanation of how he first became involved with the use of cocaine, through his membership of the militia in Lebanon. 
     
      
    5   Mr Borenstein stated his opinion that the custody the applicant was then suffering had the effect of reactivating early traumatic life experiences such as those he had mentioned in his report. That was a reference to early separation from his parents, and familiarity as a child with the horrors of war and civil unrest as well as his violent experience after conscription at age fifteen. 
     
      
    6   It was submitted that his Honour should have taken into account that it will often be in the best interests of society if emphasis is put on rehabilitation, particularly where the offender can genuinely be at cross roads between a useless, drug-ridden and probably criminal existence and relatively normal life in society, supported by a caring family. Reference was made to R v Molina (1984) 13 A Crim R 76. 
     
      
    7   In my opinion, his Honour paid proper regard to the report of Dr Borenstein. His Honour remarked on the applicant’s family history and the other problems which had beset him. Having said that, his Honour was not satisfied that the explanation given by the applicant through Dr Borenstein of why he began to take drugs was acceptable. His Honour took the view that the question why the applicant began taking drugs was left unanswered. 
     
      
    8   In my opinion, his Honour was correct in recognising that those who deal in drugs must accept gaol sentences unless there are exceptional circumstances that would allow a court to take some other course. His Honour concluded that there were no such exceptional circumstances, in my opinion correctly. 
     
      
    9   It was submitted that his Honour imposed a minimum term that was too severe in the circumstances, but in my opinion that submission has no substance. The total term of the sentence and the minimum term imposed by his Honour were well within the bounds of his Honour’s proper sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    10   I would refuse to grant leave to appeal. 
     
      
    11   McINERNEY AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    12   BARR J: The order of the Court is as I have proposed.

     60655/98 
     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Wednesday, 26 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Bruce Allan BURRELL 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: Bruce Allan Burrell seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Judge Luland, QC, in the District Court. The applicant was called on for trial on 3 August 1998 and pleaded guilty to one count of larceny as a bailee, three counts of receiving stolen motor vehicles, one count of disposing of a stolen motor vehicle, and one count of possessing a prohibited weapon. 
     
      
    2   He was remanded for sentence and eventually came before Judge Luland. On the counts of larceny as a bailee and possessing a prohibited weapon his Honour sentenced the applicant to concurrent terms each of six months penal servitude. On counts of receiving a stolen Suzuki motor vehicle, disposing of the stolen Suzuki motor vehicle, and receiving a stolen Pajero motor vehicle he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms each of one year six months accumulated upon the two six month fixed terms. For the offence of receiving a stolen Jaguar motor vehicle he was sentenced to penal servitude for three years, comprising a minimum term of two years accumulated upon the two six month fixed terms and an additional term of one year. 
     
      
    3   In sentencing the applicant for this offence his Honour took into account pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act four offences; namely, having registration plates calculated to deceive, driving an unregistered motor vehicle, driving an uninsured motor vehicle and using a firearm without a licence or permit. 
     
      
    4   The total effective sentence was three and a half years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of one year. 
     
      
    5   The offence the subject of the first count occurred in 1992. The applicant had been given a Ruger rifle by a man to sell on his behalf. Later on he told the owner that it had been stolen. That statement was false. The rifle was found at the applicant’s house during a search carried on in May 1997. During the same search a crossbow and bolts were found in the applicant’s wardrobe. He said he was minding them for a friend and was unaware that it was a prohibited weapon. That was the offence charged in the sixth count. 
     
      
    6   On 16 May 1997 police saw the applicant driving a Mitsubishi Pajero in Goulburn. The registration plates on the vehicle were ascertained to belong to another vehicle and that prompted police enquiries, which showed that the Pajero had been stolen in October 1993. The applicant was interviewed about it and said he had purchased the vehicle in 1993 for $17,000 cash from a man called Tony. He admitted having had a suspicion that the vehicle may have been stolen. It was worth over $43,000 at the time. That was the fifth count. 
     
      
    7   On 21 May 1997 police searched the applicant’s property and found a 1995 Jaguar motor vehicle bearing number plates which turned out to have belonged to a stolen Suzuki Vitara. In a formal interview the applicant admitted purchasing the Vitara for $5,800 after reading an advertisement in a newspaper. It was worth $16,000 at the time. The applicant went on to say that he had sold the Vitara in December 1996 for $7,000. The receiving was charged in the second count and the disposal in the fourth. 
     
      
    8   The second, fourth and fifth counts resulted in the concurrent fixed terms of one year six months. 
     
      
    9   The third count concerned the Jaguar which the police had found. It had been stolen in November 1995 from a firm of car dealers. It was worth almost $140,000. The applicant told the police he had bought it for $25,000 from a man called Tony, whom he met in a hotel in Sydney. He had a good idea the car was stolen. He had been using it since 1995. 
     
      
    10   The matters taken into account in the imposition of sentences on that count concerned the use of registration plates on the Pajero and driving the Pajero unregistered and uninsured, as well as using a revolver on an occasion in 1990 without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. 
     
      
    11   The first ground of appeal asserts that the six-month concurrent fixed terms imposed for the first and sixth counts were manifestly excessive. It was submitted, given that his Honour had regarded the applicant as a first offender, that this was effectively a conviction on a first offence of larceny following a plea of guilty. The objective gravity of the offence was not high and if the applicant had stood for sentence on that matter alone a range of non-custodial options would have been available to the sentencing judge. It was submitted that the offence occurred within the time span of the other offences in the indictment and it would therefore have been appropriate to construct a sentencing regime which did not entail an additional period in custody for the first count. 
     
      
    12   I think the submission well made that the applicant was being sentenced as a first offender and that if the plea had stood alone one might have expected to see a more lenient result. 
     
      
    13   It was submitted in respect to the sixth count that the catalogue of armaments in the schedule to the Firearms Act lists weapons more dangerous than a crossbow. The applicant gave an explanation to the police when asked about his possession of the crossbow. He told the police that a friend, whom he named, had on an occasion a long time earlier left the weapon at his property, having brought it there, unexpectedly to the applicant, on a weekend’s shooting. The applicant said that he did not know that the crossbow was a dangerous weapon, the possession of which was prohibited without a licence or a permit. The police followed up those enquiries and it was ascertained that the applicant had given a true account. 
     
      
    14   It seems to me that in the circumstances that offence was not one of the most serious that one would find under the appropriate section of the Firearms Act. I think that the attack on the sixth month fixed terms on the first and sixth counts is made out and, in my opinion, justice would be done by adjusting the commencement dates of the remaining counts so as to coincide with the commencement of the fixed terms for counts 1 and 6. 
     
      
    15   The second ground of appeal attacked the length of the sentences imposed on the receiving counts by reference to sentencing statistics. It was submitted that within the past eight years there has been no sentence of this magnitude in a comparable case. However, the statistics relied on related to offenders who had no prior convictions. Although his Honour dealt with the applicant in the initial stages upon the proper basis that the stealing of the rifle was effectively a first offence, that was not the appropriate basis for dealing with the remaining offences, which took place over a number of years between 1992 and 1997. 
     
      
    16   It is more appropriate, if statistics are to be considered, to look at cases in which offenders have had prior convictions. Statistics tendered by the Crown show that between 1990 and 1998 fifty-one cases of receiving have been dealt with in the higher courts and that they have produced a range of minimum or fixed terms varying between six months and five years and a range of total terms ranging from six months to seven years. 
     
      
    17   It seems to me that one cannot conclude by reference to statistical information that the sentences imposed by his Honour were outside the available range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    18   In the third ground of appeal it was submitted that his Honour had erred in principle in giving insufficient weight to the age and previous good character of the applicant. It was submitted that proper weight ought to have been given to the long life the applicant had spent before beginning to offend, which significantly mitigated the penalties which would otherwise have been appropriate. The applicant was born in 1953 and was in his mid-forties when sentenced. 
     
      
    19   I think that the submission is well made for the first of the two offences charged; namely, the theft of the rifle and the receiving of the motor vehicle. However, the other offences were not committed until 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. It could not be maintained that over the period of years the applicant had continued to be a man of good character. By the time he committed the third of the offences charged he had already stolen a rifle and received a vehicle he knew to be stolen. 
     
      
    20   It was submitted that the overall sentence imposed was so long that the applicant had been inappropriately denied the opportunity of consideration of home detention. By s 5(1) of the Home Detention Act 1986, home detention may be imposed only where the fixed or aggregate term does not exceed eighteen months. Such a short term was, in my opinion, entirely out of the question in this case. 
     
      
    21   I think that his Honour succeeded in his intention to impose for counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 a total effective sentence which matched the applicant’s total criminality. The offences were more serious in combination and called for a substantial punishment to deter others from acting in a similar systematically criminal manner. I do not think that, viewed as a whole, the sentences fall outside the proper range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    22   I would make the following orders. 
     
      
    23   Grant leave to appeal. Allow appeal. Quash the sentences for counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 and impose the following sentences in lieu. On each of counts 2, 4 and 5 a fixed term of one year and six months commencing on 20 October 1998 and expiring on 19 April 2000; on count 3 penal servitude for three years comprising a minimum term of two years commencing on 20 October 1998 and expiring on 19 October 2000 and an additional term of one year commencing on 20 October 2000 and expiring on 19 October 2001. 
     
      
    24   The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 19 October 2000. 
     
      
    25   McINERNEY AJ: I agree with the orders proposed. 
     
      
    26   BARR J: The orders of the Court are therefore as I have proposed.

     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Friday, 28 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Murat KARATAS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: Murat Karatas seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. On 7 November 1997 a jury convicted him of four counts of sexual intercourse without consent. On 16 December 1997 Sides DCJ QC sentenced the applicant on two counts to concurrent terms, each of nine years’ imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of six years and nine months and an additional term of two years and three months. On the two remaining counts, his Honour sentenced the applicant to two concurrent fixed terms each of six years, commencing at the same time as the minimum terms on the other counts. The total effective sentence was therefore imprisonment for nine years with a minimum term before eligibility for parole of six years and nine months. 
     
      
    2   The applicant originally appealed against his conviction as well but abandoned that appeal by a notice filed on 18 January 1999. 
     
      
    3   The complainant was a twenty-four year old woman who had come from Hong Kong to Australia to study. She was at Wollongong University in 1996. She occupied her own flat and purchased a small refrigerator from a business in Wollongong. She had occasion to return it because it was faulty and the vendor repaired it and returned it to her. The applicant was one of the vendor’s men who redelivered it. 
     
      
    4   The refrigerator still gave trouble however and the complainant and the vendor agreed that the vendor would buy it back. The complainant therefore expected somebody to call and collect the refrigerator. 
     
      
    5   The applicant knew this and he knocked on her door at 7.40am one Sunday, waking her up. He asked about the refrigerator and the complainant let him in, believing that he had come to collect it. He pretended to examine the refrigerator and then asked whether he could use the lavatory. He was permitted to do so. When he came out, he attacked the complainant without warning. He slapped her face and broke her glasses. He grabbed her by the hair and pushed her onto the bed. The complainant shouted for help but the applicant warned her that if she were not quiet, he would kill her. The complainant believed him and let him do what he wanted. 
     
      
    6   The applicant is a big man, about six feet two tall. The complainant is reported to have been a little over five feet tall. 
     
      
    7   Over the next three hours, the applicant engaged in numerous acts of intercourse with the complainant, including cunnilingus, digital penetration of the vagina, fellatio and penile penetration of the anus. They were the acts giving rise to the four counts of which the applicant was convicted. 
     
      
    8   During the attack the applicant had difficulty in entering the complainant’s anus and vagina, so he tried to further his purposes by use of saliva and a banana which he had taken to the premises for the purpose. 
     
      
    9   During the attack, the complainant caught sight of a rope which the applicant had in a bag that he was carrying and that was an additional cause of fear for her. 
     
      
    10   His Honour regarded those as aggravating features. 
     
      
    11   When the applicant was leaving the premises he made the complainant give him her telephone number and she did so, acting under the fear previously instilled in her by the threat and the sight of the rope and no doubt by the disgraceful acts which had taken place during the attack. 
     
      
    12   Not long after he left the premises, the applicant did telephone the complainant at her premises. 
     
      
    13   The complainant was very badly affected by the attack. She had been a virgin beforehand but had apparently normal sexual interests. She found herself unable to remain in Wollongong. She suffered long term loss of appetite and nightmares. Being of Chinese origin, she experienced great personal shame, even though she was blameless. One result was that she could not even consider any relationships with men and stopped dating them. 
     
      
    14   The applicant submitted on appeal that the sentences were in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. It was pointed out that the maximum penalty for each count was only fourteen years and that all the offences had been committed during the one period of criminal activity. Given their obvious qualification for concurrency, it was submitted that the total sentence came too close to the available maximum. 
     
      
    15   Then it was submitted that his Honour made errors of reasoning. During his Honour’s remarks on sentence, he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        The complainant’s will was overcome by violence and a threat. The force used was not sufficient to leave any evidence of physical injury. This seems to have been calculated on the part of the prisoner who sought not to leave any evidence that might be interpreted as being inconsistent with his assertion that the complainant consented. For example, he was careful not to rupture the hymen, ... 
        
       
      
    16   It was put that his Honour had regarded as an aggravating feature what was really a mitigating feature, namely deliberate conduct on the part of the applicant resulting in less injury to the complainant. The Court was informed, with the consent of the Crown, that at the trial there was evidence that the applicant, upon realising that the complainant was a virgin, left off his unsuccessful attempts at entry of her vagina and transferred his attention to her anus. That was apparently a matter he regarded as appropriate and likely to be of less concern to his victim. 
     
      
    17   Those circumstances were put against the remark that his Honour later made to the effect that there was no mitigating feature of the crime. It was put that that finding could not stand. 
     
      
    18   It seems to me that the circumstances in which the applicant ceased his attempts at entry of the vagina and transferred his attention elsewhere has to be seen for these purposes in the light of the totality of the attack. This was an attack which lasted for three hours. The applicant attempted to have intercourse in every way known to the courts. As his Honour observed, the very length of the attack was an aggravating feature because in effect the complainant was detained against her will. 
     
      
    19   Furthermore, notwithstanding the circumstances pointed to by the applicant, the fact of the matter was that the complainant, as his Honour accepted, no longer regarded herself as a virgin and had abandoned any thought of relations with men. It is not overstating the position I think to observe that any opportunity the complainant had for a fulfilled sexual life has been lost. 
     
      
    20   It seems to me in all the circumstances that his Honour was entitled to take the view that there was no mitigating feature. 
     
      
    21   Secondly, it was put that his Honour erred in treating the manner in which the applicant gained entry, described as a technical break-in, as a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    22   In his careful and detailed remarks on sentence, his Honour identified a number of aggravating features including that the attack on the complainant was made in her home, that the effect of it was to detain her against her will for three hours, that the applicant gained entry by the trick of pretending to have called to collect the refrigerator and that the attack was calculated as evidenced by the fact that the applicant walked five kilometres to the complainant’s premises carrying a bag containing a rope and a banana and that he took care not to leave marks on the complainant’s body. It was in that context that his Honour made the remarks complained of. 
     
      
    23   Although it is correct to say that the case would have been worse if the applicant had inflicted serious bodily harm on the complaint, it was legitimate in my opinion for his Honour to look at all the aspects of the applicant’s preparation and treatment of the complainant as demonstrating a coldly calculated act rather than a hot-blooded attack as is often the case, even in a bad rape. 
     
      
    24   In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to regard these features collectively as very serious among their kind and his Honour’s expressed desire to fix sentences towards the top of the range was justified. 
     
      
    25   The applicant’s subjective features did not favour him. He had a bad record of offences of violence and dishonesty and his rehabilitation prospects were not good. There was no contrition and he was still denying lack of consent at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    26   The Court has had regard to the statistics published by the Judicial Commission. The longest full term for multiple counts of sexual intercourse without consent is ten years and the longest minimum term seven years. The statistics comprise only twenty-six cases, which is not a large number statistically speaking, and as the Court has observed before, the use of statistics is to be encouraged but they need to be treated with caution. They do not, in this case at least, delineate the top of the available sentencing range. A proper penalty for an offence of the worst kind is the one prescribed by statute, namely fourteen years. His Honour did not find this to be a case that fell into the worst category of cases but it had many of the features of such a case. 
     
      
    27   In my opinion the sentences imposed were within the proper range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion and I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    28   McINERNEY AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    29   BARR J: The orders of the Court therefore are as I have proposed.

     REGINA v Mark Spencer LOACH 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    2   BARR J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Acting Judge Nader of Queen’s Counsel in the District Court. He originally appealed against his convictions as well, but abandoned that part of his appeal. 
     
      
    3   The applicant pleaded guilty of three offences and asked the sentencing judge to take a fourth matter into account under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. For the offence of escaping from lawful custody he was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months’ imprisonment, commencing on 21 August 1998 and expiring on 20 August 1999. For the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and the offence of resisting two police officers in the execution of their duty he was sentenced to concurrent terms each of two years’ imprisonment commencing on 21 August 1999 and expiring on 20 August 2001, each comprising a minimum term of six months and an additional term of 18 months. The total effective sentence, taking into account the fourth offence, was therefore a three year term, comprising a minimum term of 18 months and an additional term of 18 months. 
     
      
    4   The facts are as follows. On 31 July 1997 police officers approached the applicant and his girlfriend in a shopping arcade in Scone believing that they might have heroin. Detective Ford told the applicant that he was going to be taken to a police car and searched. When they arrived at the car the applicant tried to get rid of a packet, which turned out to contain five small balloons of rock heroin, weighing 1.48 grams, and a struggle ensued which lasted for about four minutes. It was very violent. The applicant punched Detective Ford in the head and shoulders a number of times. He broke free and ran away. 
     
      
    5   On the following day, having received some information, four police officers went to a large shed on a property in the nearby township of Wingen. They saw the applicant in the shed. When he saw them he bent down towards a knife lying on the floor. Detective Ford and Constable Conway charged him and another struggle took place. Detective Morrall and Constable Craig ran to help the other two. After a struggle which appears to have been no less violent than the one that took place on the day before, the applicant was subdued, handcuffed and taken into custody. 
     
      
    6   Detective Ford suffered swelling and soreness of the right side of the face, of the shoulders and back. Constable Conway’s right palm was lacerated and his glasses were broken. Senior Constable Craig sustained a small laceration on the right knuckle. The applicant was injured as well. 
     
      
    7   The accused was kept in custody bail refused from then until 20 August 1997 when he entered conditional bail. 
     
      
    8   The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in identifying the offence charged and taking into account irrelevant material. The struggle which took place on 31 July led to the charges of assaulting Constable Ford in the execution of his duty and escaping from the lawful custody of Constable Ford. The charge resulting from the events of the following day was of resisting Constable Ford and Constable Craig in the execution of their duty. 
     
      
    9   Having recited the facts of the events of both days, his Honour dealt with injuries received by the appellant and then said this - 
     
      
       
        
        As a result of the assault by the prisoner on police, Detective Ford received swelling and soreness to the right side of his face, shoulders and back area, Constable Conway received a laceration to his right palm. During the struggle Constable Conway’s optical glasses were also smashed, Senior Constable Craig received a small laceration to the right knuckle … 
        
       
      
    10   His Honour went on to note that photographs of the injuries had been put into evidence. 
     
      
    11   The first submission was that his Honour erred in taking into account injuries received by Constable Conway because he was not one of the officers the applicant had pleaded guilty to resisting. Then it was submitted that the manner in which his Honour accumulated the sentence for the assault of Constable Ford on 31 July on the sentence imposed for escaping from lawful custody and made it concurrent with the sentence for resisting arrest on 1 August showed that his Honour had treated the facts relevant to the resistance of Detective Ford on 1 August as constituting an assault, with which he was not charged. Then it was submitted that it was inappropriate to accumulate the sentence for the assault on 31 July upon the sentence for the escape. 
     
      
    12   His Honour’s judgment was given ex tempore and during the course of it he read verbatim from a statement of facts agreed by the parties to be accurate and from portions of the statement of a police officer about which there was no dispute. The passage I have extracted was his Honour’s only mention of injuries received. There was no attempt to attribute injuries received by the applicant or Detective Ford to either of the two incidents. 
     
      
    13   The injuries were not an element of either of the assault and resist charges, of course, and it is not submitted that his Honour erred by taking them into account as an aggravating feature. The description of the two incidents read by his Honour shows how violent they were. His Honour was obliged to assess the degree of violence, and was entitled for that purpose to look at the injuries received. That is presumably why his Honour mentioned injuries received by the applicant and Constable Conway as well as by the two officers named in the indictment. 
     
      
    14   That was the relevance of Constable Conway’s injuries. 
     
      
    15   I do not think that his Honour took into account irrelevant material or sentenced the applicant for resisting Constable Conway, an offence with which he was not charged. 
     
      
    16   In my opinion his Honour did not apply any wrong principle in the manner in which he structured accumulated and concurrent sentences. The duty of a sentencing judge where there is more than one offence is to assess the total criminality and to structure a total effective sentence which accords with it. That is what his Honour did. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        So that his overall sentence, and that is what I have sought to achieve, an overall sentence representing the total criminality will be a sentence of a minimum term, an effective minimum term of 18 months and an effective additional term of 18 months. 
        
       
      
    17   The first ground of appeal should fail. 
     
      
    18   Then it was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to consider sentencing alternatives to full-time imprisonment. Criticism was made of a statement by his Honour to this effect - 
     
      
       
        
        However, (defence counsel) has asked me in this case to deal with him in an non-custodial way, but I am afraid that is out of the question, the matters are far too serious. 
        
       
      
    19   It is submitted that his Honour made no mention of the alternatives to full-time imprisonment which had been set out in the pre-sentence report which was before his Honour and that his Honour did not appear to have given any of those options any proper consideration. 
     
      
    20   The first of those submissions has no substance. His Honour could scarcely have forgotten the pre-sentence report which he had read a few minutes before delivering judgment. To say that a non-custodial sentence is out of the question does not suggest to me that the speaker has failed to consider alternatives, but rather that they have been considered and adjudged inappropriate. 
     
      
    21   The second submission really falls to be considered with the principal submission made in the application, namely that the total effective sentence was so great that it fell outside the discretionary range reasonably open to his Honour. 
     
      
    22   Counsel for the applicant summarised for the Court statistics of sentences imposed in the Local Court for assaulting or resisting police officers in the course of their duty. It was submitted that it was appropriate to consider them because the applicant appeared to have been dealt with in the District Court only because he was first committed to that Court for a more serious offence, concerning the knife which I have mentioned, and which was later withdrawn. It was put that the other offences could have been dealt with by a magistrate. 
     
      
    23   The Crown conceded that if the present three offences had been the only ones charged against the applicant in the Local Court and if he had pleaded guilty, there was a reasonable possibility that all matters would have been dealt with in the Local Court. It is not a matter about which there can be any certainty, since the consent of the prosecutor would have been necessary, and these were serious offences. 
     
      
    24   Local Court magistrates have a lower sentencing jurisdiction than judges of higher courts. For example, the maximum penalty for each of the assault and resist charges would have been two years, and a magistrate would have been unable to impose a total sentence for all charges exceeding three years. That does not mean that this Court should regard three years as a maximum sentence. However, it is a matter which the Court may take into account. 
     
      
    25   The sentencing statistics for higher courts are helpful, I think, because they incorporate a substantial number of cases. Between 1990 and 1998 155 sentences were imposed for assaulting police officers or resisting them and 50 resulted in gaol terms. Half were for fixed terms of six months. The other half ranged up to four years. The statistics are for single counts, however, and it has to be remembered that his Honour was sentencing the applicant for two such offences. 
     
      
    26   Higher court statistics for escaping from lawful custody show that 26 out of 30 offenders were given gaol terms. 16 of them were six month fixed terms. The maximum was two years. 
     
      
    27   It seems to me that his Honour was really sentencing the applicant for three criminal acts or episodes of criminality. The first was his responsibility for the struggle that took place when Detective Ford tried to search and restrain him on 31 July. I regard the assault and the escape as incidents of the one episode. The second was the struggle which took place when he was arrested in the shed on the following day. The third was the possession of the heroin, which was criminally unrelated to the other two. 
     
      
    28   As his Honour pointed out, it is a matter of considerable seriousness to assault police in the execution of their duty and to resist them, especially in the violent way in which it was done in this case. As his Honour remarked, that happened twice, and the second occasion took place after the applicant had had time to cool down. In my opinion his Honour was correct in regarding those two events in combination as being very serious. 
     
      
    29   As well, his Honour was obliged to have in mind that the applicant had escaped from lawful custody and to take account of the offence of possessing the heroin, though it was not serious. 
     
      
    30   In view of these matters, the sentencing statistics do not demonstrate that the total sentence imposed by his Honour was outside the range of his proper sentencing discretion. The matter becomes one of impression. His Honour is a highly experienced sentencing judge. Although the sentence was substantial, I do not think that it was outside the limits of his Honour’s discretion and I would not interfere with it. I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

     R v Christopher William OWEN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    2 DUNFORD J. The appellant, Christopher William Owen, appeals against his conviction before Pain ADCJ in the District Court at Sydney on 22 June 1998 on one count of procuring the complainant to commit an act of indecency on him contrary to s 81A Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of assaulting the complainant and committing an act of indecency upon him contrary to s 81. He was at the same time acquitted of a further charge of assaulting the complainant and committing an act of indecency upon him. Following his conviction, he was on 21 August 1998 sentenced by his Honour to three concurrent terms of imprisonment for twelve months to be served by way of periodic detention.3 The appellant is the uncle of the complainant, being married to the sister of the complainant's father. The complainant who was born on 23 June 1967 attended Primary School in Wollongong and High School in Sydney. Whilst at High School he resided in Sydney with his grandparents during the week and spent the weekends with his parents in Wollongong. He left school after completing Year 10 and obtaining his School Certificate in 1983.4 He said that there was an occasion when he stayed overnight with the appellant at the latter's house at 20 Hillcrest Street, Wollongong at a time when the appellant's wife was in Wollongong Hospital for the birth of their second child, Lara. The complainant said he arrived there about 5 or 6 pm and remained until the following morning. He said the appellant indicated to him that he would be sleeping in the master bedroom with him and after the appellant had a shower and returned to the bedroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, he told the complainant (who was then twelve or thirteen) to get undressed, lie down and relax, which he did, after which the appellant produced a vibrator or massager which the complainant described as having a round rubbing part and a square body. The complainant was lying face down on the bed and the appellant used the vibrator on the complainant's back and then all over his body including his penis and scrotum. After a few minutes the complainant became erect and the appellant performed fellatio on him for about five to ten minutes until he climaxed (count 2). The appellant then began to masturbate and asked the complainant to use the vibrator on him, which he did (count 1), and soon afterwards the appellant ejaculated. He said the appellant performed fellatio on him three or four other times during the evening. The following morning the appellant told the complainant that if anybody asked, he was to say that he slept in another room, not the master bedroom.5 The third count was based on the complainant's evidence of an occasion when he worked at the appellant's chemical factory known as Nitro Tech in Kenny Street, Wollongong for a week doing work experience whilst he was in either Year 7 or 8 at school, although he had visited these premises on about ten to twenty other occasions. He said the appellant had his office in the building and he the complainant had been in that office five or six times. He recalled the first occasion when he was in the appellant's office and the appellant said to him ""show us your muscles, take your shirt off"". The complainant complied and the appellant squeezed his muscles and said he was developing well. He then took out a blue sander without the sandpaper on it, it had a square pattern and an electrical cord, and he placed it on the complainant's genitals. The complainant said he did not see from where the appellant got the sander, but it was turned on and vibrating when placed on his genitals. At first the complainant had his pants on but later the pants were removed or pulled down. He said his penis became erect and the appellant knelt down or sat on a chair and performed fellatio on him until he climaxed. The appellant then put some eye drops in his own eyes and he told the complainant that they could not tell anyone about what they were doing as others would not understand. He later drove the complainant home in his motor vehicle and during the trip home spoke to the complainant about the ""Hippocratic oath"" that doctors and lawyers take. The complainant said that the appellant's office door at Nitro Tech was locked during this incident with a bolt and persons could not see in from outside the office as the windows to the street were tinted a bronze or gold colour. He said another similar incident (which is not the subject of a charge) took place on another occasion in the Nitro Tech office.6 In relation to count 4, on which the appellant was acquitted, the complainant said that the appellant later rented a house at 21 Hillcrest Street opposite where he lived, to store chemicals and run the business, and whilst there invited the complainant to do some work for him at this house putting lids on bottles. He said this was in 1982 when he was in Year 9 at school. It took the complainant about half an hour to do this work with the bottles, during which time the appellant went away but later returned and performed fellatio on him for about five to ten minutes.7 The complainant first told his mother about these incidents and then his father in mid 1991. His first statement to the police was dated 2 September 1991 and he made a later statement on 6 May 1996. In the September 1991 statement he said that the incident that gave rise to count 3 was the first incident, but in the May 1996 statement he said that the incident giving rise to counts 1 and 2 at the appellant's home was the first incident. In relation to count 3 he told the DPP in conference on 21 May 1998 that the sander had been used on only one occasion, but in evidence before the jury said that it had been used on two occasions and he agreed that his memory had changed during the course of his giving evidence. No explanation was offered for the delay in complaint.8 Grant Farrawell (born 30 October 1967) gave evidence that during his mid teenage years he lived at 100 Kenny Street, Wollongong almost opposite Nitro Tech, and for about six to twelve months prior to leaving school in Year 10 he worked there on a part-time basis, mainly acid cleaning. He said he went into the appellant's office quite a few times, and on one occasion the appellant told him to sit down on the floor and relax and then produced a sander which was vibrating and began moving it over his body and then on to his groin area next to his testicles. The appellant asked Farrawell how he felt but the latter did not answer and immediately after the incident he ceased working at Nitro Tech. He said he did not know the complainant and had not heard his name used around the factory premises. In his first statement to police he did not make any reference to a sander applied to his person but later had a conference with the Crown's solicitor and made another statement in which he did refer to the sander being used. He could not remember the colour of the sander nor whether it was plugged into a power point.9 Peter Yeaman (also born 1967) said that after he left school aged about fifteen he worked full-time as a trainee laboratory assistant for about three or four years at Nitro Tech, starting there about 1982 or 1983. He said some school boys worked there part-time and one of these was Grant Farrawell. Initially he said that he did not know the complainant and did not recall hearing his name around the company but later in his evidence he said he could recall seeing the complainant on a couple of occasions visiting the plant. He said he saw a blue Makita brand sander in the appellant's office on one occasion in a cupboard behind the desk, it was electrical with a cord attached, and he had seen it plugged in, and he used it once to sand the front doors leading into the building.10 The complainant's father (Robert Cowin) gave evidence. He initially said that the complainant had stayed overnight at the appellant's house possibly on three occasions, but later said he could not remember when they were. He said that on 12 April 1980 he attended a chiropractic conference in Sydney and after the conference he and his wife remained in Sydney and went to the theatre whilst his children stayed with relatives in Wollongong overnight. He could not recall which relatives the children stayed with. He said that the High School that the complainant attended in Sydney in 1980 maintained school holidays in accordance with those applicable at State schools and in 1980 the holidays ran from 4 to 14 of April, but later in cross-examination he agreed that in 1980 a three term school system applied and the holidays for State schools were in May and not April. There was other evidence (exhibit 1) which established that in 1980 those holidays were from 2 to 19 May and the Easter long weekend was 4 to 7 April. 11 Detective Senior Constable Pearson said that on 19 April 1996 she went to the home of the appellant with Detective Beck. She put to him that there had been an allegation that he had assaulted his nephew. He replied that it was not true. She then said ""Clague is alleging that you have sexually assaulted him at your business premises and that during the assault you have used a sander or a vibrator which you placed on his genitals."" He said ""No, that's not true"". Detective Pearson said ""Do you own a tool such as this?"" He said ""No"". There was further conversation in which inter alia he denied any fellatio and after that the further statement dated 6 May 1996 was taken from the complainant, and the appellant was arrested and charged in relation to these matters on 24 March 1997. She was not cross-examined.12 The appellant gave evidence denying each of the allegations. He said his first child Daniel was born on 11 August 1978 and his second child Lara on 10 April 1980. He said that about one week prior to Lara's birth, his wife was admitted to hospital, she remained there until ten days after the birth and that during this time he and Daniel lived with his mother-in-law. He visited his wife in hospital each day and can recall the complainant and his father visiting the hospital on one occasion. He said the complainant did not stay overnight at his home during this time and has never stayed overnight at any other time, that there were only two bedrooms in his house at Hillcrest Street, one containing a double bed and basinet, and the other room at the time contained Daniel's cot. He said that in 1980 neither he nor his wife owned a piece of equipment which could be described or used as a massager. 13 He said that in 1980 and 1981 Nitro Tech carried on its business at 107 Kenny Street, Wollongong and his office contained a desk and a credenza, a filing cabinet, a timber locker and a chair and that the only power point in the room was located behind the credenza. He said to access that power point in 1980 or 1981 it would have been necessary to move the extremely heavy credenza and he produced a photograph showing the office furniture at the relevant time (exhibit 4). He said that he did not keep any electrical equipment in his office such as a sander. He admitted that he had used eye drops on a regular basis since an industrial accident at the age of eighteen. He agreed that there were occasions in 1980 and 1981 when the complainant would come to the factory, Peter Yeaman worked at Nitro Tech, but did not sand the front doors as he had stated in his evidence, and the only person who had sanded the doors became very ill due to the type of wood used and consequently there was to be no further sanding of the wood at the factory. He said he had never owned a blue sander whilst at Nitro Tech. He said that Grant Farrawell was not a full-time employee of Nitro Tech and at no time had he put any type of sander on his person nor had he asked him to lie down in his office. He denied there was at any time any bolt type lock on the inside of the door to his office.14 In 1982 the business ran into financial difficulties and in December 1983 it relocated to the appellant's house for a few weeks and then in January 1984 to 21 Hillcrest Street, virtually opposite his house for about twelve months, and then later moved to Corrimal. He denied assaulting the complainant at any time and said that on one occasion he had a disagreement with the complainant about the latter's way of life, saying that he was disappointed at the way he was conducting himself so far as living on the dole and not working and using the dole money to purchase drugs, to which the complainant had replied that if the Government was stupid enough to pay him the dole then he was stupid enough to buy drugs. In cross-examination he placed this conversation at about 1985 although he said he had similar disagreements with the complainant over a period of a couple of years.15 Graham Riley was the owner of the premises at 21 Hillcrest Street and by reference to diary notes and other records he was able to say that Nitro Tech did not take up occupation of those premises until 9 January 1984, and that it remained there until the end of that year. 16 The appellant's wife, Janet Owen, gave evidence that when she went to hospital, Daniel and the appellant stayed at her mother's house. She could remember the complainant and his father Robert Cowin visiting her in hospital. She said the appellant did not have a massager / vibrator and neither she nor her husband used one during the course of their marriage. She said the complainant did visit their house but never stayed overnight in 1980 or 1981. She recalled there was only one power point in the appellant's office at Kenny Street and she did not see any electrical equipment in the office.17 The written submissions made on behalf of the appellant, as refined in oral argument, may be summarised as follows: -  
     
      
      1. That the verdicts of guilty on counts 1 to 3 were inconsistent with the acquittal on count 4, as there was no reasonable basis on which the counts could have been distinguished, and doubts entertained by the jury about the complainant's credibility on count 4 damaged his credibility in relation to counts 1 to 3. 
       
      2. The verdicts of guilty on counts 1 to 3 were unreasonable and/or not supported by the evidence for a number of reasons, including: 
       
       (a) There was a substantial delay in the making of the first complaint. 
       
       (b) There was a substantial delay between the time the complaint was first made to police and the time when the prosecution was commenced. 
       
       (c) The evidence in relation to the first two counts was uncorroborated. 
       
       (d) There were very significant inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the witnesses called to support him to some extent. 
       
       (e) There was an incomplete investigation and the matter was not properly prosecuted. 
       
      3. His Honour's directions in relation to the failure to call a number of witnesses were deficient. 
      
    18 In my view the verdicts of guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3 should not be regarded as inconsistent with the verdict of acquittal on count 4 and do not indicate any compromise on the part of the jury, nor does the acquittal on count 4 indicate that the jury did not accept the complainant as a reliable and credible witness. The different verdicts are readily explicable on the basis of the dates. Counts 1, 2 and 3 were laid between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1981, whilst count 4 was laid between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 1982. However, there was evidence, not only from the appellant but also from the landlord, Mr Riley, which established that it was not until about January 1994 that the appellant's business, Nitro Tech, relocated to the premises at 21 Hillcrest Street where the complainant alleged the offence the subject of count 4 took place. In his Summing Up the learned trial judge told the jury that they needed to be satisfied in respect of each of the counts in the indictment that it ""took place within the period delineated by the count"" and later, following a request by counsel for the appellant, his Honour reminded the jury that ""the time and place founding each count is of course one of the elements of which you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"". The appellant's acquittal on count 4 is therefore readily explicable on the basis that, although the jury believed that the event had happened as described by the complainant, they were not satisfied that it occurred within the period laid in the indictment. To put it another way, the fact that the jury had a reasonable doubt as to the relevant time period would not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they must have doubted the complainant's word about what happened to him at that address, and so it does not follow that the acquittal in respect of count 4 necessitates the conclusion that the jury was not satisfied that the complainant was otherwise telling the truth, even if he got the date and time period wrong. The first submission accordingly fails. 19 The High Court has now made it clear that the correct ground for challenging the verdict of a jury is not that it is ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" but that it is ""unreasonable and/or not supported by the evidence: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379. This ground may also be considered in conjunction with the other grounds in s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for their cumulative effect, including whether ""on any other ground whatsoever there has been a miscarriage of justice:"" R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53 at [31]-[43]. The test for determining whether a verdict is unreasonable and/or cannot be supported by the evidence remains as set out in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-3, namely whether on this Court's own independent assessment of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant, bearing in mind that the jury is the primary tribunal charged with the determination of issues of fact and has had the advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence being given, but that if the evidence contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead this Court to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted then the verdict should be set aside.20 In relation to the various matters specified by the appellant's counsel in his oral submissions, I have already indicated why I consider the verdict of not guilty on count 4 explicable by reference to the date and as not necessarily indicating a general rejection of the complainant as a credible witness21 The matter of the failure of the complainant to complain for many years, the way the jury were entitled to take that into account in assessing his credit and the difficulties which the delay in complaining and in the subsequent prosecution could produce for the appellant in defending the charges were all explained to the jury in the Summing Up and presumably also in Counsel's final address, and no doubt the jury took them into account.22 The complainant said he told his parents about these incidents in August 1991 and he made his first statement to police on 2 September 1991. The police apparently did not speak to the appellant about the matter until 19 April 1996, following which a second statement was taken from the complainant on 6 May 1996, and the appellant was subsequently arrested and charged on 24 March 1997. These delays, particularly from September 1991 until April 1996 were totally unexplained, but the appellant was represented at the trial, as on appeal, by able and experienced counsel who, presumably for good reason, chose not to explore the reasons for such delay. Indeed he did not ask Detective Pearson any questions in cross-examination and did not require the other police officer (Detective Beck) to be called at all. This delay or any suggested incomplete or incompetent police investigation was simply not an issue at all at the trial. There may have been a good reason for the delay from 1991 to 1996; the police were never invited to say what it was. Moreover, there is no general proposition that a complete and unexceptional investigation of an alleged crime is a necessary element of the trial process or of a fair trial: Penney v The Queen (1998) 155 ALR 605 at 609.23 It is correct to say that the evidence of the complainant in relation to the first two counts was not corroborated, but the jury was warned by the trial judge in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 of the necessity for them to scrutinise his evidence with great care, and that they could only convict if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his truthfulness. 24 I turn now to consider what were suggested to be inconsistencies and deficiencies in the complainant's evidence of the type identified in M v The Queen, which it was alleged render the verdicts of guilty on the first three counts ""unreasonable""; but before doing so I would point out that most of such alleged inconsistencies and deficiencies arise not from the complainant's evidence alone, but from that evidence when compared with the evidence of the appellant and his wife. 25 Moreover, a reading of the complainant's evidence, without the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing it being given, conveys to me a firm impression of an apparently honest witness endeavouring to tell the truth about events occurring some seventeen to eighteen years earlier. For example, there were a number of details on which he was not sure, whereas if the evidence was fabricated, one would have expected a definite answer; eg who pulled his pants down during the incident the subject of count 2, and whether the appellant was sitting on a chair or kneeling down when performing fellatio, and he said he believed the office door was locked but did not remember seeing the appellant lock it.26 As to counts 1 and 2, the complainant said that the incident occurred one evening whilst the appellant's wife was in hospital for the birth of Lara when he stayed overnight at the appellant's home. This placed the period between about 3 and 20 April 1980, but the appellant said that whilst his wife was in hospital he stayed each night with his son Daniel at the home of his mother-in-law (since deceased) at 2 Robinson Street, Wollongong and not at his own home. Both he and his wife denied that the complainant had ever spent a night at their home, although, of course, the wife could have no direct knowledge of who stayed where on any particular night whilst she was in hospital. Other evidence established that this was not a school holiday period so it could only have been at a weekend, but photographs were produced (exhibits 2 and 3) said to be taken on Sunday 13 April 1980 showing in one photo the complainant at the hospital with Lara and her mother, and in the other the complainant's father and another family member likewise at the hospital. It was submitted this evidence indicated that the complainant could not have stayed with the appellant that weekend because he and his father were both at the hospital on the Sunday.27 However, the complainant's father gave evidence that on Saturday 12 April 1980 he attended a chiropractic conference in Sydney and he and his wife stayed that evening in Sydney after attending a show, and that the complainant was not with them, but stayed overnight with relatives in Wollongong (he could not recall with whom). In my view this evidence can easily be reconciled and does not indicate any inconsistency in the complainant's evidence. It is consistent with the complainant staying at the appellant's house overnight on 12-13 April whilst his mother and father spent the evening in Sydney and then being at the hospital and having his photo taken the following day, probably taken there either by his parents after they returned from Sydney, or possibly by the appellant, on the Sunday morning.28 Although the complainant claimed in examination-in-chief that the incidents referred to in counts 1 and 2 took place following the birth of Lara and repeated this in cross-examination it was submitted that later in cross-examination he accepted that he was confused as to whether it occurred then or following the birth of Daniel (11 August 1978), thereby placing the incident outside the time laid in the indictment, and thus entitling him to an acquittal on this ground alone. But this later evidence was in response to a number of leading questions and only amounted, at most, to a suggestion that he was confused. The jury was entitled, in my view, to accept his evidence that it was following the birth of Lara consistent as it was with his father's evidence of the latter staying in Sydney with his wife over the relevant Saturday night.29 The complainant said that the appellant told him to say, if asked where he slept, that he slept in the other room and both the appellant and his wife gave evidence that there was at the time of Lara's birth no bed in the other room but only a cot for Daniel; and it was submitted that the appellant knowing this would not have made the comment attributed to him, and so for the complainant to say he did, indicates fabrication, or at least must give rise to a reasonable doubt about him staying at the appellant's property at the relevant time. I do not agree. The alleged comment was somewhat peripheral, the only evidence there was no bed in the other room came from the appellant and his wife, and it was for the jury to assess; and the absence of another bed would not necessarily mean that the complainant could not have slept on a spare mattress or cushions in the other room.30 Reference was also made to the fact that in his September 1991 statement the complainant described this incident at the appellant's home as the ""third"" incident, whereas in his later statement in May 1996 and in his evidence he described it as the ""first"" incident, and in cross-examination readily conceded that he had got them mixed up; this does not indicate dishonesty or unreliability, but is consistent with an honest witness getting the order of events mixed up many years later.31 Finally, in relation to counts 1 and 2, both the appellant and his wife gave evidence that they had never owned or used a vibrator, but this conflicted with the complainant's evidence that the appellant used one on the occasion in question, and it was ultimately a question for the jury to resolve.32 These various matters identified by counsel for the appellant, either individually or together, do not lead me to the conclusion that the verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 2 were unreasonable or cannot be supported.33 In relation to count 3, the Crown case was considerably stronger because it was supported by the tendency / coincidence evidence of Grant Farrawell and Peter Yeaman. The former described a similar incident where the appellant had applied a sander (minus the sanding attachment) to his body, moving it to his groin area and touching his testicles with it. He was unable to say whether the sander was battery operated or connected by line to an electricity power point and said that he never actually saw it being plugged in. He was unable to say what colour it was and he said that that was because he was too scared to look. He ceased the part-time work he was doing at Nitro Tech immediately after the incident.34 Mr Yeaman said that from about 1982 or 1983 he had been working at Nitro Tech for about three to four years and whilst he had been there he had seen a blue ""Makita"" brand sander in a cupboard behind the desk in the appellant's office, that it had a cord and he had seen it plugged in, although he couldn't say where the power point in the office was. He said he himself had used it once to sand the front doors leading into the building. Not only did Mr Farrawell's evidence provide tendency evidence, but the evidence of both of them contradicted the evidence of the appellant that he had never had a sander in the office. 35 The appellant and his wife also said there was only one power point in the office and that it was behind the credenza which was difficult to move to obtain access. This was a matter ventilated before the jury and was in my view entirely a matter for the jury. He also denied that Mr Yeaman had ever sanded the front doors with a sander supplied by the office but it was open to the jury to accept Mr Yeaman who apparently had no interest in the case, and this involved rejecting the evidence of the appellant on that point at least. 36 The appellant also relied on evidence given by himself and his wife that there was no bolt on the door of the office but this once again was a conflict in the evidence to be resolved by the jury. I can see no inconsistencies or inadequacies in the evidence relating to count 3 which would render the verdict on that count unreasonable or not supported by the evidence. 37 Finally complaint is made about the judge's directions in relation to witnesses which the appellant claims ought to have been called by the Crown and it was submitted that such directions were not in accordance with the principles laid down in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298. In the course of summarising the defendant's counsel's submissions the learned trial judge said: ""In relation to the overall Crown case he submitted to you that there was some matters on which other family members might have commented but that no other family members other than the complainant and his father had been called and that you were therefore entitled to infer that they would not have assisted the Crown case."" 
     
      
      and after completing his summary of counsel's arguments, he went on: 
       
        
      ""In so far as Mr Scragg made reference to the absence of any other family members who, he suggested, might have been called to provide information about the relevant periods, well members of the jury, in so far as those witnesses you find that further witnesses should have been called and, having regard to the passage of time it may be difficult to envisage how such witnesses recollections might have assisted, but in any event, in so far you might find that - and there has been no such witnesses identified, save of course the deceased grandmother - in so far as they were absent then you would be entitled to, in so far as you found there were any, to assume that their evidence would not have assisted the Crown. That perhaps is only another roundabout way of saying, members of the jury, the onus lies on the Crown and if there are deficiencies in the Crown evidence, however it arises, then they are deficiencies which affect the Crown case."" 
      
    38 Later, in the absence of the jury, Mr Scragg, said that he had identified another witness, namely the sister of the appellant, (apparently named Maria) who lived next door to the grandmother in Robinson Street, and it was suggested that she might have been able to give evidence as to whether the complainant had ever stayed at the appellant's house whilst the appellant's wife was in hospital for the birth of Lara. He did not seek to identify any other witnesses who might have been called. His Honour declined to ""revisit"" the issue. 39 Mr Scragg then sought a further direction based on Jones v Dunkel that in the absence of this other evidence which the jury might have expected from other witnesses to be called, they could more readily accept the appellant's evidence that the complainant was never over at his home. Once again his Honour declined to give any further direction. 40 On the hearing of the appeal it was submitted that other witnesses who should have been called in the Crown case were the persons who took the photographs (exhibits A and B) purporting to show a bed in the second room of the complainant's house to prove when the photographs were taken, and in relation to count 3 a person named William Brass, because in cross-examination it was put to the appellant that in 1984 he had lent a sander to such person and it was submitted that Mr Brass (whom it is said was in court at the time) should have been called on this point, and also on the number of power points there were in the appellant's office.41 In my view it was not appropriate for his Honour to identify any further witnesses who should have been called by the Crown. Although the appellant's wife said that her sister who lived next door to her mother gave her mother support when looking after her grandchildren, there was no basis for believing that eighteen years later she would remember, if she was ever aware, that one of the grandchildren had stayed with her brother-in-law at his house on a particular occasion or on any occasion, the photographs (exhibits A and B) were admitted by consent when they were tendered at the trial and no questions were asked about their authenticity or when or by whom they had been taken, and likewise the suggestion that Mr Brass should have been called was raised for the first time on the appeal. Finally, if anyone was to call the sister living next door to the grandmother, and she did have any recollection one way or another as to whether the complainant had ever stayed at the appellant's house overnight, one might reasonably have expected it to have been the defence to whom she was more closely related. In my opinion she came within the second of the categories of expected witnesses referred to by Street CJ in R v Buckland [1977] 2 NSWLR 452 at 457, i.e. a witness whom the accused would normally have been expected to call in his defence against the Crown case.42 The final submission was that the direction given was incomplete and should have gone on to say that in the unexplained absence of these expected witnesses the jury could more readily accept the appellant's evidence that the complainant never stayed overnight at his home. As I am not satisfied that it could reasonably be inferred that the sister next door would have had any recollection, and that it was for the appellant, if anyone, rather than the Crown to call her, the point is rather academic, but I note that the further direction sought is based on the judgment of Menzies J in Jones v Dunkel at 312, and not on the more commonly referred to judgment of Windeyer J in that case at 321, as explained by Street J, as he then was, in Dilosa v Latec Finance Pty Ltd (1966) 84 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 557 at 581-2. That does not mean it may not be appropriate in some cases to give the further direction about more readily accepting the evidence of the other party; but in R v Buckland at 458-9, Street CJ in the context of criminal trials quoted extensively from what he had said in Dilosa including: ""The inference which a court can properly draw in the absence of a witness, where such absence is not satisfactorily accounted for, is that nothing which this witness could say would assist the case of the party who would normally have been expected to call that witness."" 
     
      
      This, on my understanding, is the standard direction given to juries (both civil and criminal) in this state and it is not necessary generally for the trial judge to go any further, although he did go further in this case by saying that: 
       
        
      ""If there are deficiencies in the Crown evidence, however it arises, then they are deficiencies which affect the Crown case."" 
       
      In my opinion it was not necessary for his Honour to say any more on this point than he did, and this last submission accordingly fails. 
      
    43 For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the convictions.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

     L012/92 REGINA v Sam CONSTANTINOU 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Sam Constantinou pursuant to s13A of the Sentencing Act that the Court set minimum terms and additional terms to replace three sentences of imprisonment for life, which were imposed on the applicant by Lusher J on 24 September 1984, after the jury in a trial conducted before Lusher J had found the applicant guilty of the murder of John Thomas Gibson at Marrickville on 14 October 1982, of the murder of Leonard Herbert Carey at Camperdown on 26 November 1982 and of the murder of Michael John Condon Brown at Lilyfield on 10 December 1982. At the trial the applicant was also found guilty of four charges of robbery with striking and wounding of four other victims, all of these offences having been committed on 10 December 1982 and a charge of robbery with striking on 17 December 1982.2 The applicant was tried jointly with a co-offender, Christopher Hatziathanasiou, on the charges of murdering Mr Gibson and Mr Brown. Hatziathanasiou was found guilty on both charges of murder. Hatziathanasiou had pleaded guilty to four charges of robbery with striking and wounding, committed with the applicant. Hatziathanasiou also pleaded guilty to nine other charges of robbery with striking and wounding, one charge of assault with intent to rob with striking and wounding and one charge of robbery in company.3 The applicant did not dispute the statement of the facts of the cases of murder contained in the notice filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to Practice Note 57 and the following statement of the facts of the offences and the course of the criminal proceedings against the applicant is taken from the notice filed by the Director and from the recorded interviews of the applicant on 9 and 10 January 1983. Murder of Mr Gibson4 As I have already stated, the victim, John Thomas Gibson was murdered on 14 October 1982. On the afternoon of 14 October 1982 the applicant met the co-offenders Hatziathanasiou, a youth named Boland and a juvenile named Vassilakis at a milk bar at Earlwood. The group discussed obtaining money for the purchase of heroin by robbing some one. The group travelled by bus to Marrickville Railway Station and then walked in the direction of Marrickville R.S.L Club. When questioned by police on 9 January 1983 the applicant said, “we were walking along the road… I saw an old bloke walking through the park and Arthur (Boland) or George (Vassilakis), I don’t know who it was, said, ‘there’s a mug’”. I interpolate to say that I understand what was said to mean that the old man, who was Mr Gibson, was thought to be a suitable target for a mugging. Mr Gibson was seventy-two years old. The applicant continued in his answers to the police as follows:- “We followed him across into the park and I pushed him to the ground and then reached for his pockets… I got some money out of his pockets, I think it was two or three dollars”.5 The applicant, Hatziathanasiou and Vassilakis lifted the victim up and placed him behind a park bench. The four offenders then left the park, having been disturbed by passers by. The offence was committed in daylight.6 The post mortem examination of the deceased revealed extensive fractures of the skull and nasal bones. The cause of death was found to be haemorrhages due to the skull fractures.7 When interviewed by the police, the applicant, while admitting that he had pushed Mr Gibson over, denied that he had kicked Mr Gibson. 8 Vassilakis, who, as I have said, was a juvenile, had already been dealt with for his part in this offence by the time of the applicant’s trial. Boland, who was tried at the same time as the applicant and Hatziathanasiou was found guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Gibson.9 In his remarks on sentence delivered on 24 September 1984 Lusher J simply found:- “As he (Mr Gibson) walked through the park, Constantinou ran at him from behind, pushed, shoved or held him to the ground, where he was kicked, robbed”.10 His Honour made no finding about who did the kicking. Murder of Mr Carey11 Shortly after midnight on 25 November 1982 the applicant, who was alone, was sitting on a bench at Annandale, when he observed Mr Carey, who was sixty-five years old, walking along Parramatta Road. The applicant followed Mr Carey for over 500 metres, until he turned into a lane. The applicant then ran up behind Mr Carey, pushed him heavily in the back and punched him, causing him to fall to the ground. As Mr Carey attempted to get up, the applicant punched him about the head, until Mr Carey fell unconscious to the ground. While the applicant was searching Mr Carey’s pockets, he was disturbed by a barking dog. The applicant took Mr Carey’s wallet, ran to a nearby street, extracted about $50 in cash from the wallet and threw the wallet away. 12 The pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased observed that Mr Carey had substantial abrasions and brain injuries and formed the opinions that the abrasions were consistent with blows from a fist and that the brain injuries could have been caused by the victim’s head striking the ground. Robbery Offences13 Between 9.30 pm and 11.00 pm on 10 December 1982 the applicant and Hatziathanasiou robbed four men in the Annandale/Glebe area. They used the applicant’s motor cycle as a means of transport. Three of the victims were elderly men and the other victim was a man in his thirties. Three of the victims were assaulted and robbed by the applicant, while Hatziathanasiou kept watch. The other victim was initially assaulted by the applicant but Hatziathanasiou then kicked and robbed the victim. All the victims suffered head injuries of some kind. Murder of Mr Brown14 The victim of the third murder, Mr Brown, was murdered later on the same night, that is the night of 10 December 1982. Shortly after 11.00 pm the applicant and Hatziathanasiou travelled on the applicant’s motor cycle to a part of Annandale. There they kept three elderly men, who were walking together, under observation. After the three men had separated, the applicant and Hatziathanasiou selected one of the men, Mr Brown, who was sixty-three years old, as the target for a robbery. The applicant and Hatziathanasiou followed Mr Brown on foot for some distance. Both the applicant and Hatziathanasiou then ran up behind Mr Brown. The applicant pushed Mr Brown heavily in the back and punched him in the head, causing him to fall face forward to the roadway. The applicant and Hatziathanasiou moved Mr Brown to a nearby street, searched his clothing and took about $80 from his pockets.15 Mr Brown’s body was later found, lying in a pool of blood. A post mortem examination of Mr Brown’s body revealed extensive fractures to his nose and skull, which could have been caused by his face striking the roadway. The doctor who performed the post mortem examination considered that the immediate cause of death was the inhalation of blood from the nose and skull fractures.16 When interviewed by police on 9 January 1983, the applicant said, “I ran up behind a man and I saw he did not have a wallet in his hip pocket, so I hit him from behind with my fist… he fell down on the road. I pinned him while he was struggling and went through his pockets”. Robbery with Striking17 The offence of robbery with striking was committed on 17 December 1982. The applicant followed the victim to his home. When the victim had arrived at his front door, the applicant tapped him on the shoulder. As the victim turned the applicant punched him on the jaw, rendering him unconscious. The applicant took $15 and a cigarette lighter from the victim.18 The applicant was arrested on 9 January 1983 and has been continuously in custody ever since.19 In his summing-up to the jury at the trial the trial judge identified as the act which on the Crown case caused the death of each victim as being “the act of running a man down from behind, in effect so that he does not see you and so striking him and he goes to the ground”. At the trial the Crown, under the provisions of s18 of the Crimes Act as then in force, relied on two heads of murder, contending that the act causing death was done in each case, either with reckless indifference to human life, that is with the knowledge that it was probable that death would result, or during or immediately after the commission of a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life, such as robbery with striking and wounding (that is felony murder). The Crown did not allege that any of the accused had acted with an intention to kill or with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The trial judge also gave the jury directions about common purpose, including a direction that an accused who did not himself do the act causing death would nevertheless be guilty of murder, if that act was within his contemplation as an act which might be done in the course of carrying out a common purpose to which he was a party.20 In his remarks on sentence Lusher J described the nature of the offences as being “to select some elderly man, follow him and then on getting close to him to run fast at him from behind, either to push or hurl him to the ground and then rob him”.21 In his remarks on sentence Lusher J did not make any finding about the basis on which the applicant was to be regarded as having murdered the victims. In my opinion, the applicant should be regarded in all cases as having committed felony murder. The case against him that he had committed felony murder was overwhelming. On the other hand, it would, in my opinion, be difficult to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant foresaw that it was probable that death would result from an act performed in carrying out the common purpose of robbery with striking. Among other considerations the applicant had committed a number of robberies without a weapon but with striking and wounding, where the death of the victim had not resulted.22 In his remarks on sentence Lusher J referred to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. The applicant was born on 1 April 1963. His parents were Greek Cypriots. The applicant had convictions in the Children’s Court and convictions in 1982 but his Honour stated that none of those offences had any effect upon his Honour in dealing with the matters he was concerned with. The applicant had had an unfortunate history at school and had been asked to leave school, following an altercation with a teacher. He had had various jobs as a bricklayer and labourer but had been dismissed on grounds of unsuitability, poor attendance and suspected drug use.23 The applicant began taking drugs when he was eleven years old. In his teenage years he experimented with drugs and by the age of eighteen he was addicted to heroin. Lusher J found that the applicant “presented as rebellious and undisciplined with a lifestyle that was irresponsible and without direction and had descended to the pursuit of excitement and enjoyment through alcohol and drug abuse“.24 Lusher J after reviewing the subjective circumstances of the applicant and Hatziathanasiou continued as follows:- “The whole picture presented by these two young men is, of course, a devastating one. It is sad and sickening to relate it. They are both fine looking, well built young men. In another time and circumstances they would no doubt have been fine young citizens”.25 At the time at which Lusher J sentenced the applicant and Hatziathanasiou, the penalty for murder was imprisonment for life, unless it appeared to the sentencing judge that the prisoner’s culpability was “significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances”. Lusher J found that there were no such mitigating circumstances in the case of either the applicant or Hatziathanasiou. His Honour then proceeded to sentence the applicant to penal servitude for life on each of the three charges of murder and to concurrent terms of imprisonment for ten years on all the charges of robbery with striking and wounding or with striking. Hatziathanasiou was sentenced to penal servitude for life on each of the two charges of murder of which he had been convicted and, with one immaterial exception, to concurrent terms of imprisonment for ten years on all of the charges of aggravated robbery.26 As I have already stated, the applicant’s application was made as long ago as 26 July 1992. A report of the Serious Offenders Review Board concerning the applicant was made on 11 November 1992. I have read and have taken into account this report and all the annexures to the report. The summary-conclusion at the end of this report included the following:- “Until fairly recently Constantinou’s gaol history has been unstable. For a long time there was no progress or any attempt on the prisoner’s part to come to terms with his problems. He must face these before he is to become an acceptable member of the community at large. He has close family ties”. 
     
      * * * 
      
       “He has been a heroin addict, undisciplined and rebellious. He is now making good progress. He still has to make more progress but, if his present behaviour continues to improve, hopes for the further down grading his security and for preparing him in due course to the community are real”. 
      
    27 Because of the long delay in the applicant’s application coming before the Court, a supplementary report of the Serious Offenders Review Council authenticated on 9 March 1999 was prepared. I have read and have taken into account this report and all the annexures to this report. At the end of the report the Serious Offenders Review Council commented as follows:- “This supplementary report outlines Constantinou’s progress in custody since 1994. His admissions to the Special Care Unit and the Violence Prevention Programme are evidence of a willingness to address issues associated with his criminal activity. In spite of his being the target of numerous allegations there has been little concrete evidence to substantiate the suspicions of authorities. There is support, however, for the view that he is manipulative and that his motivations may be open to question”.28 Mr Saxby, the secretary of the Serious Offenders Management Committee, gave brief evidence at the hearing of the application. Mr Saxby said that on 14 September 1998 the applicant’s classification as a prisoner was reduced to C1 and it has remained at C1.29 The applicant has been in custody in the Industrial Training Centre since August 1998. A memorandum from the Acting Governor of the Industrial Training Centre dated 5 May 1999 contained the following passages:- “(1) In the period of time Sam Constantinou has been at the I.T.C he has without doubt kept a low profile.  
     
      * * * 
      
       By and large… his conduct has been quite good both from an officer and inmates’ point of view. 
      
      (2) Sam has completed the KAIROS course and has demonstrated a preparedness to undertake personal development. In many ways all he has known since his late teens is prison. “Prison” has dictated much of his thinking and interaction with officers, other inmates and also those that visit him. Understandably this institutionalisation of Mr Constantinou has made it very difficult for him to learn the many coping mechanisms and behavioural models that most of us take for granted. 
      
      (3) Consideration for a sentence determination at this time I feel is appropriate and would give him an opportunity to be placed on a programme that would eventuate in his ultimate progression to a C3 classification. That is not saying that he, Constantinou, will get it easy, without doubt this period will be a difficult transitional stage and require a considerable amount of counselling and a preparedness to undertake personal development courses”. 
    30 While in custody the applicant has in fact completed a number of courses, including personal development courses.31 No psychiatric or even psychological evidence about the applicant was placed before me, even though some of the documents which were admitted into evidence disclose that he has been seen by psychologists while in the Industrial Training Centre. Senior counsel for the applicant said that it was apparent from the reports of the Serious Offenders Review Board and the Serious Offenders Review Council that the applicant had had his “ups and downs” within the prison system and it had been considered by him that any further material would not be helpful to me.32 The applicant gave evidence on the hearing of the application. He said that he was the eldest of the three children of Greek Cypriot parents. His mother, sister and brother were in Court on the hearing of the application. His father is in Cyprus. The applicant gave evidence that in February 1999 he had married within the prison system a young woman, whom he had known for twenty years and by whom he had had a child born in May 1995. From soon after the applicant’s arrest and until he was sentenced, he was in protective custody but the applicant has not since been in protective custody. The applicant said that he would undertake the considerable amount of counselling and the personal development courses referred to in the memorandum of the Acting Governor of the Industrial Training Centre.33 According to a letter from the Department of Corrective Services, the concurrent terms of penal servitude for ten years imposed on the applicant for the offences of aggravated robbery expired on 29 March 1989 and as at the date of the hearing of this application the applicant had served a period of ten years one month eight days exclusively referable to the sentences for murder.34 As is usual, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions communicated with the relatives of the deceased victims. The widow of Mr Brown replied, opposing the granting of the present application. 35 An application under s13A of the Sentencing Act made by the co-offender Christopher Hatziathanasiou on 1 April 1991 was heard and determined by me in 1995. I granted Hatziathanasiou’s application and set minimum terms and additional terms to replace the original sentences of imprisonment for life for the murders of Mr Gibson and Mr Brown. For each of the two murders Hatziathanasiou was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude of twenty years commencing on 6 January 1983, being the date on which Hatziathanasiou was first taken into custody, and expiring on 5 January 2003, that being the earliest date on which he would be eligible for release on parole, and an additional term of six years, the sentences to be served concurrently. 36 No appeal was brought from my decision on Hatziathanasiou’s application and the redetermined sentences for Hatziathanasiou stand.37 Because of parity arguments which have been advanced on the hearing of the present application, it is important to note some of the findings I made in determining Hatziathanasiou’s application. Hatziathanasiou, of course, was not involved at all in the murder of Mr Carey. As to the murders of Mr Gibson and Mr Brown, I noted that at the trial the Crown had accepted that Hatziathanasiou did not have an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm and I found that he did not foresee that it was probable that either victim would die. I found that the actual perpetrator of most, at least, of the physical violence was Constantinou, and not Hatziathanasiou. I found that Hatziathanasiou was to be regarded as being sentenced in each case, on the basis that it was within his contemplation that his co-offender Constantinou, in carrying out the common purpose of robbing the victim with striking, would do acts, which in fact caused the victim’s death. 38 Hatziathanasiou is about the same age as Constantinou; he is in fact a few months older, having been born in August 1962. Unlike the present applicant, Hatziathanasiou had spent most of his sentence on protection, in more than usually onerous conditions of imprisonment. In Hatziathanasiou’s case I had the advantage of a psychiatric report from Dr Westmore. I found that there were some prospects of rehabilitation for Hatziathanasiou. 39 The applicant’s application, having been made as long ago as July 1992, is not subject to the amendments to s13A of the Sentencing Act which came into effect on 21 November 1993. Under ss(4) of s13A the court may set a minimum term and an additional term to replace an original sentence of imprisonment for life or decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. Under ss(9) the court is to have regard to:- “(a) The knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under s463 of the Crimes Act 1900 and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences; and 
     
      (b) Any report on the person made by the Serious Offenders Review Board and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person’s rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court; and 
      
      (c) Any relevant comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence,  
      
      and may have regard to any other relevant matter”. 
    40 I have already discussed and I have had regard to the reports of the Serious Offenders Review Board and the Serious Offenders Review Council and the remarks on sentence of Lusher J. I have also had regard to the matters referred to in par(a) of ss(9). 41 The principles to be applied by a court hearing an application under s13A of the Sentencing Act have been stated in a number of cases, some of which are referred to in my judgment of 25 October 1995 in Hatziathanasiou’s case. Without attempting to state all of the relevant principles, I will simply note some of them.42 1. The principles to be applied in sentencing for murder under s19A of the Crimes Act are generally applicable, except that a court on an application under s13A is able to take into account all that has happened to the applicant since he was originally sentenced.43 2. In general at least, an application under s13A should be refused, only if the judge hearing the application considers that a sentence of penal servitude for life would be appropriate, that is only if the judge considers that the case falls within the worst category of cases of murder. A case falling within the worst category of cases is a case dealing with the worst type of offence committed by the worst type of offender (R v Boyd (1995) 81 A Crim R 260 at 264).44 (3) A judge is prohibited from adopting a two tiered process of sentencing and is required to draw together the relevant objective and subjective circumstances (R v Twala (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 4 November 1994). However, a judge is entitled to consider sequentially the arguments for and against a conclusion that the case before him is a case of the worst type (R v Garforth (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 23 May 1994).45 (4) If a judge decides to set a minimum term, then in setting a minimum term a judge fixes the minimum period which the prisoner must serve in prison. On the expiration of the minimum term set by the judge the offender will be eligible for release on parole but he will not be entitled to be released on parole unless a parole order is made by the Parole Board and the Board is not to make a parole order unless the Board has inter alia determined that the release of the offender is appropriate, having regard to the principle that the public interest is of primary importance.46 (5) By virtue of the provisions of s13A(5) it is not possible to impose cumulative sentences on an application under s13A. Consequently, where, as in the present case, more than one sentence was imposed by the original sentencing judge, then, if the application is granted, the longest of the sentences imposed by the judge hearing the s13A application must reflect the totality of the criminality in all of the offences committed by the offender, including the offences for which determinate sentences were originally imposed.47 At the hearing of this application senior counsel appearing for the Crown opposed the application that I should set determinate sentences to replace the sentences of imprisonment for life originally imposed. Counsel submitted that the three murders which the appellant had committed fell within the worst category of cases of murder, for which the appropriate sentences would be sentences of imprisonment for the remainder of the offender’s life. Counsel pointed to the facts that there were three murders, and not merely one; that they were committed on separate occasions; that two of the murders were committed in company; and that the applicant and his co-offender were strong young men and the victims were elderly, defenceless persons.48 A submission was made on behalf of the Crown that I should find that the applicant at least had the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on the victims. It was contended that it would have been apparent to the applicant that it was unlikely that any of the victims were carrying much money and that I should not accept that the purpose of the assaults was to rob the victims, as distinct from injuring them.49 However, at the trial the Crown did not contend that the applicant had the intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm to any of the victims and in his remarks on sentence Lusher J found, notwithstanding the small, and even trifling, amounts of money actually taken from the victims, that the applicant’s motive in assaulting the victims was to obtain money for drugs. In these circumstances, as in the case of Hatziathanasiou, I find that the applicant had no intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on any of the victims.50 Senior counsel for the Crown accepted that the youth of an offender is a relevant factor in sentencing and that the applicant at the time of committing the offences was only nineteen years old. However, counsel pointed to recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal R v Leonard (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 7 December 1998) and R v Fernando (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 14 April 1999), in which life sentences for murder imposed on offenders only a few years older than the applicant had not been disturbed on appeal.51 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that, while it could be that the applicant had some prospects of rehabilitation, the existence of some prospects of rehabilitation will not necessarily prevent a case falling within the worst category of cases, for which the only appropriate sentence is imprisonment for life. 52 Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that it was of concern that there was no psychiatric evidence about the applicant. 53 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the applicant’s case could be distinguished from Hatziathanasiou’s case, in which I had allowed the application to set determinate sentences, on the basis that the applicant had committed three murders, and not two, and that the applicant had been the perpetrator of most at least of the physical violence, Hatziathanasiou having been treated as criminally liable under the doctrine of common purpose. 54 What was described as a “fall back” submission was made by the Crown that, if the application was granted and determinate sentences set, a very substantial minimum term should be set with an additional term for life. Reference was made by the Crown to R v Rees (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 23 September 1995 and R v McCafferty (unreported New South Wales Supreme Court 15 October 1991), in both of which an application under s13A of the Sentencing Act by an applicant who had committed three murders was granted and determinate sentences set.55 Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that I should accept that all the murders were felony murders, the applicant not having intended to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury. The murders had been committed on separate occasions but, it was submitted, during one period of criminality extending over a couple of months. The applicant was nineteen years old at the time the offences had been committed and has been continuously in custody since he was nineteen. It was submitted that the applicant has some prospects of rehabilitation and that the comment in the report of the Serious Offenders Review Council and the remarks of the Acting Governor of the Industrial Training Centre were, to some extent at least, favourable to the applicant.56 As to parity, it was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant that, notwithstanding such differences as might exist between their cases, the applicant would have a legitimate sense of grievance, if, Hatziathanasiou’s application having been granted, the applicant’s application was refused. It was submitted that the applicant should receive a minimum term of the same length as that set for Hatziathanasiou and that, if there was to be any difference in the sentences passed on the two offenders, that difference should be limited to a longer additional term in the case of the applicant.57 It is clear that the objective circumstances of the crimes of murder were very serious, for the reasons given by the Crown. 58 I am satisfied that the applicant’s case is worse that Hatiathanasiou’s case. The applicant was convicted of three murders; Hatziathanasiou was convicted of two murders. The additional murder more than offsets the additional offences of aggravated robbery to which Hatziathanasiou pleaded guilty. The applicant was the perpetrator of at least most of the physical violence to which the victims were subjected, whereas Hatziathanasiou was dealt with on the basis that he was liable under the doctrine of common purpose. Hatziathanasiou had spent most of his sentence on protection, in more than usually onerous conditions of imprisonment, whereas the applicant, apart from a period between being arrested and sentenced, has not been on protection. In Hatziathanasiou’s case there was some psychiatric evidence; in the applicant’s case there is no psychiatric evidence. Accordingly, as the applicant’s case is worse than Hatziathanasiou’s case, the applicant should be dealt with more severely than Hatziathanasiou. 59 The question for decision is whether, in accordance with the Crown’s primary submission, the applicant’s application should be refused, on the ground that the case falls within the worst category of cases of murder involving offences of the worst type.60 I have concluded, after anxious consideration, that I should grant the application. I am aware of the need to avoid a two tiered process of sentencing but I should indicate the factors which have led me to my conclusion.61 In my opinion, notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mills (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 3 April 1995) it is a mitigating factor, even if only slight, that in no case did the applicant intend to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury or foresee the probability of death.62 The offences were committed when the applicant was nineteen years old and he has been in gaol since he was nineteen. His youth is relevant, both because of his immaturity at the time of committing the offences and the severity to him of a sentence for the rest of his life. If the applicant is to serve a life sentence, he could spend upwards of fifty years or more in prison. I appreciate that in a proper case a judge is required to impose a life sentence on an offender as young as the applicant, however severe the impact of the sentence on the offender. However, the youth of the applicant at the time of committing the offences and at the time of entering into custody is a matter I should take into account.63 I find that the applicant has some prospects of rehabilitation and the memorandum by the Acting Governor of the Industrial Training Centre offers some encouragement.64 In my opinion, there is some force in the argument based on parity. Hatziathanasiou’s application was granted and under the determinate sentences set Hatziathanasiou is eligible for release on parole in January 2003, when he will be forty years old, and he will be entitled to be released no later than January 2009, when he will be forty-six years old and, if not earlier released, would have served twenty-six years in gaol. Even though there are differences, and important differences, between the cases of Hatziathanasiou and the applicant, which should be reflected in the applicant receiving severer sentences, I have concluded that the differences are not such as to warrant a situation where Hatziathanasiou will be released from custody at some stage in his forties, while the applicant will be kept in custody, with no prospect of ever being released, even if he lives to the age of sixty or seventy or more. As noted by the Crown, there have been cases in which applications by triple murderers have been granted. See McCafferty and Rees.65 In setting a minimum term I take into account inter alia that in setting a minimum term I am fixing the minimum term of imprisonment which the applicant must serve before becoming eligible for release on parole and that whether, and when, the applicant will be released on parole depends on the Parole Board deciding that it should make a parole order. In all the circumstances, including that it was the applicant who was the perpetrator of at least most of the violence to which the victims were subjected, I should set an additional term for the remainder of the applicant’s life.66 I have concluded, taking into account the objective facts of the murders, the facts of the offences of robbery and the sentences imposed for them, the subjective circumstances of the applicant before and after he was sentenced, the terms of s13A including the matters I am required to take into account, and the principles of sentencing which I have stated or referred to, I should impose the following sentences.67 Mr Constantinou for each of the murders of John Thomas Gibson, Leonard Herbert Carey and Michael John Condon Brown, I sentence you to a minimum term of penal servitude of thirty years commencing on 9 January 1983 and expiring on 8 January 2013, that being the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole and an additional term for the remainder of your life, the sentences to be served concurrently.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    GROVE J : This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Rummery DCJ in the Liverpool District Court. On that occasion the applicant appeared before his Honour on a single count of supplying a prohibited drug namely heroin. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of three years imprisonment which he divided into minimum and additional term components of six months and two years and six months respectively.  
     
      
       
      
    2    The facts giving rise to the offence were unusual. The applicant is a young woman without prior convictions and had the care of her two daughters, aged at the time five years and eleven years. It appears, she being fluent in both Vietnamese and English, she acted as an interpreter in a conversation between her friend and a second person who, in the event, turned out to be an undercover police operative. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The facts upon which the learned sentencing judge was asked to deal with the applicant included reference to acting as an interpreter on one occasion between the persons whom I have mentioned at an address in Liverpool. On that occasion the conversation related to the intended sale of twelve ounces of heroin for the sum of $72,000. The typed statement of facts prepared by the relevant Federal agent uses language in which it is said that the applicant “negotiated” with the operative acting as an interpreter for her friend. His Honour did not find that the applicant was a negotiator in the usual sense that that word is used and rather it is to be said she was acting as a mere conduit between the two languages. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The proposed deal, it appears, did not in fact take place although another arrangement with which the applicant was not concerned (even as a translator) apparently did take place. There were, however, noted to have been meetings between those involved in the criminal activities, including meetings at the applicant's home. There was no evidence before his Honour from which a sinister inference against the applicant could be drawn in relation to those meetings. However it was an agreed fact before his Honour that acting as such an interpreter the applicant had a full and conscious understanding of the topic of discussion was the supply of heroin and it was not possible the parties were talking about anything else. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The division of the total sentence into minimum and additional terms so favourable to the applicant (in terms of the lesser period to be served in custody) followed a finding by the learned sentencing judge that the role of the applicant in the operation was a minimal one. That is a finding that must stand for present purposes, although I am moved to comment that it is frequently observed to be the case that dealing in illicit drugs can only be achieved by the contributions of many people, some of whose individual contributions might be seen to be relatively small or minimal but without which the total criminality could not be achieved. 
     
      
       
      
    6    I would not for myself have regarded the essential contribution of communication between two intending participants in a criminal enterprise as only minimal. Nevertheless, as I have indicated, that was the sentencing judge's finding and it is not the subject of challenge in the present application. 
     
      
       
      
    7    By consent certain material has been put before the Court. As I have indicated, the applicant had the care of two relatively small children. That families of people who commit crimes are going to suffer is an inevitable consequence of punishment by detention. It is only in the most exceptional cases that the effect upon family can have a direct effect upon the appropriateness of the sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    8    In this case by way of background the judge had been informed that the applicant was the carer for the two children and although she did not reside with their father, it appears that relations between them were cordial. What has happened since sentence is that when the applicant was taken into custody as ordered by his Honour the children's father assumed his responsibility for their care. In early January he died. Thereafter a relative of the applicant took the children into her home, adding to her responsibility for children of her own. We have some briefly sketched facts put before the Court by agreement and it can be stated that the arrangements for the children are less than satisfactory. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The applicant was released on bail pending this appeal in February. She had served in custody some two months and eight days, or more than one-third of the custodial element of the sentence passed upon her by his Honour Rummery DCJ. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The whole of the circumstances are unusual. It is of course a matter which could not have been anticipated at the time of sentence that the father of the children, having assumed his responsibility, would die. Having regard to the proportion of custody already served and the matters to which I have referred, I have come to the conclusion that the balance of justice would be served if the appeal were allowed and a sentence substituted which would enable the applicant to continue the care of her children without being returned to custody. 
     
      
       
      
    11    As this Court is embarking upon re-sentence, we have heard certain submissions relative thereto and I am persuaded from the substance of the assurances of the applicant given to the Court through her counsel that she has perceived the error of her ways and she is unlikely further to offend. 
     
      
       
      
    12    It can be noted that when interviewed for the purpose of the pre-sentence report, the applicant expressed the view she had worked only as a translator and was not involved in the physical exchange of drugs. That, of course, is the fact but it would appear that she has now realised the importance of her contribution even though in one sense it can be seen to be simply acting as a translator. 
     
      
       
      
    13    I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
         1. That the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
          
          
         2. Appeal allowed. 
          
          
         3. Sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of two years five months and twenty-seven days imprisonment to consist of a minimum term of five months and twenty-seven days commencing on 10 December 1998 and expiring on 6 June 1999, together with an additional term of two years, commencing today 7 June 1999. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    14    I would order the applicant be released to parole today and whilst on parole she be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
       
      
    15    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    16    GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

        JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by O'Reilly DCJ in the Liverpool District Court on 4 September 1998. On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging robbery in company contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act. The maximum prescribed penalty for that offence is twenty years penal servitude. 
     
      
       
      
    2    His Honour imposed a total sentence of four years penal servitude, which he divided in accordance with the prescription in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, so as to impose minimum and additional term components of three years and one year respectively. At the same time his Honour cancelled a community service order to which I will make later reference. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The facts of the matter were that at about half past eight on the evening of Tuesday 30 September 1997 the applicant and two other males entered a video shop in Kogarah. Weapons were produced. They consisted amongst other things of a small hand gun. An employee of the video shop was forced to open a safe. He had an electrical cord tied around his neck. There was a failed attempt to open the safe and further demands were made. At one stage the victim was pushed to the ground and kicked to the chest area. 
     
      
       
      
    4    Of the three offenders the applicant was identified because police fingerprint staff attended the scene and were able to identify a print of the applicant upon a video recording which had been handled by him during a preparatory phase to the offence. 
     
      
       
      
    5    That short recitation indicates the seriousness of the offence. His Honour clearly was correct in describing the offence as being of that category. I add that a second weapon, a knife, was produced and there have been repeated observations in this Court of the seriousness with which the commission of offences with weapons of that nature must be regarded. 
     
      
       
      
    6    I said I would return to the cancellation of the community service order. The applicant had acted as what was described as a ""cockatoo"" during a theft from a bank which had occurred on 17 January 1997. The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to two counts, one of larceny in respect of the theft of $2,500, and the other of aiding and abetting a robbery. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The applicant was on bail in respect of the charges relative to those offences when he committed the crime currently under consideration.  
     
      
       
      
    8    By coincidence the applicant also appeared before O'Reilly DCJ in respect of the matters arising out of events in January 1997. That appearance was on Friday 24 October 1997. Thus it can be seen the applicant committed the current offence approximately one month before he was due to appear in court to be dealt with for the earlier matters. As his Honour observed, the circumstances of the later offence were aggravated by reason of it having been committed whilst on bail. It is no surprise then that his Honour cancelled the community service order which he made in favour of the applicant when he appeared before him in October 1997. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The applicant has appeared for himself in the current application. In response to the directions of the Registrar, he has sent a letter setting out the grounds upon which he wishes to rely. He pointed out that he did not feel he could speak freely to the Probation and Parole office at the time of the preparation of the pre-sentence report. The matters set out in his letter however, do not in my view provoke intervention by this court by reason of demonstrating any error in approach or conclusion by the sentencing judge. In addition to the written submissions, the applicant has today told the Court that he has learnt his lesson, that he would like to see his family and support his mother and be a better example to his brothers and sister. That realisation, if achieved is commendable. 
     
      
       
      
    10    This is, of course, a court of error and its jurisdiction is invoked only in such circumstances. The matters adverted to by the applicant would be relevant to mitigation at a first instance hearing but would not be relevant unless for some reason this Court was persuaded that its jurisdiction to intervene had been provoked. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Given the very serious facts of the offence, added to which is the aggravating circumstance of its commission whilst on bail, it seems to me that the sentence imposed by his Honour was within the range of sound exercise of sentencing discretion, and indeed if I may respectfully say so, it represents a considerable grant of lenience towards this applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    12    I am unpersuaded that this Court should intervene. I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    13    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    14    GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     1    
     JAMES J:  
     This is an application brought by Paul Thomas Smith (“the appellant”) for an extension of time in which to appeal and, if an extension of time is granted, an appeal by him against verdicts, which were given at a special hearing held in December 1995 under the  
     Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
      (“the Act”) before his Honour Judge Twigg and a jury in the District Court, that on the limited evidence available at the special hearing the appellant had committed the offences charged, being two offences of aggravated sexual assault under s61J of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , committed on the same date 20 July 1993 against the same adult female complainant. The circumstances of aggravation on the first charge were that the appellant had maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the complainant. The circumstances of aggravation on the second charge were that the offence had been committed in company. 
      
       
      
     2    
     On 3 May 1994 another District Court judge, sitting alone without a jury, had found that the appellant was unfit to be tried on the charges of aggravated sexual assault. On 8 August 1994 the Mental Health Review Tribunal made a determination that the appellant would not become fit to be tried during the period of twelve months after 3 May 1994. Subsequently the Attorney General, acting under s18 of the Act, had directed that a special hearing be conducted. It was pursuant to this direction that the hearing before Judge Twigg took place.  
      
       
      
     3    
     The verdicts that on the limited evidence available the appellant had committed the offences charged were given in accordance with s22(1)(c) of the Act. An appeal lies to this Court from these verdicts by virtue of s22(3)(c) of the Act and the extended definition of the term “conviction” in s2 of the  
     Criminal Appeal 
      Act. 
      
       
      
     4    
     After the jury had returned their verdicts Judge Twigg on 22 February 1996 held that, if the special hearing had been an ordinary trial, the sentence he would have imposed on the first charge would have been a fixed term of penal servitude for one year from 20 July 1993 and the sentence he would have imposed on the second charge would have been a sentence of penal servitude for five years, consisting of a minimum term of three years commencing on 20 July 1994 and expiring on 19 July 1997 and an additional term of two years. It was suggested in the appellant’s written submissions that what his Honour did on 22 February 1996 may not have been in accordance with s23 of the Act but it is unnecessary to explore this suggestion further on the present application and appeal, which are concerned only with the appellant’s convictions. 
      
       
      
     5    
     On the hearing of the appeal the Court received an affidavit by a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission, to which was annexed a letter from the Mental Health Review Tribunal. This letter disclosed that on 17 February 1999, the Mental Health Review Tribunal, pursuant to s89(1) of the  
     Mental Health Act 1990 
     , classified the appellant as a continued treatment patient and also, pursuant to s131 of the  
     Mental Health Act 1990 
     , made a community treatment order releasing the appellant into the care of the Central Coast Area Mental Health Service. On 6 May 1999 this order was varied, so as to transfer the appellant’s care to the Kempsey Mental Health Service.  
      
       
      
     6    
     The complainant gave evidence at the special hearing and her evidence may be briefly summarised as follows:- 
      
       
      
     7    
     In July 1993 the complainant was living in an Aboriginal settlement close to the town of Moree. On the afternoon of 20 July 1993 she left her home to walk to the Moree District Hospital to see her brother, who was a patient in the hospital. As she was walking, she met three brothers named Swan and the appellant, all of whom she knew. The complainant and one of the Swan brothers, who was named Desmond but known as “Boy-Boy”, bought a flagon of port at a hotel. The group was joined by another male, who the complainant did not know and who was apparently a juvenile. The whole group walked across a stock bridge over a river. Everybody in the group then drank some port out of the flagon. After a few minutes the complainant said that she wanted to go to the hospital and she started walking back across the bridge. 
      
       
      
     8    
     As the complainant was walking back across the bridge, the appellant punched her more than once in the face with his closed fist, causing the complainant to fall. The appellant then forcibly removed most of the complainant’s clothing, dragged her across the bridge, pinned her to the ground and had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her without her consent. 
      
       
      
     9    
     The appellant said to Desmond Swan “do you want a go” and Desmond Swan had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, while the appellant was lying on the complainant’s shoulder, restraining her. The appellant then attempted to have the complainant fellate him but the complainant would not open her mouth. The appellant punched the complainant again. The other two Swan brothers then had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, while the appellant continued to restrain the complainant by lying on her shoulder. The appellant then had sexual intercourse with the complainant again, without her consent The other unidentified person did not take any part in the assaults on the complainant.  
      
       
      
     10    
     After the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant the second time, the group of males moved away from the complainant. The complainant jumped up and ran, picking up some of her clothing off the bridge. The complainant continued running and came across a male cousin of hers. The cousin hit Noel Swan, who had been chasing the complainant. The complainant made a complaint to her cousin about what had happened. She was taken to a police station and reported the offences. She was taken to a hospital and examined by a Dr Mahoney.  
      
       
      
     11    
     At the special hearing none of the three Swan brothers or the other unidentified male person were called to give evidence and Judge Twigg in his summing-up gave a form of  
     Jones v Dunkel 
      direction against the Crown, by reason of the Crown not having called these persons as witnesses. 
      
       
      
     12    
     The complainant’s evidence was, however, supported in a number of respects by evidence from other persons, who were called as witnesses.  
      
       
      
     13    
     A taxi driver gave evidence that at about 5.15 pm on the afternoon of 20 July 1993, as a result of a radio booking, he had picked up the three Swan brothers and the appellant, all of whom he knew, and had dropped them in Moree at about 5.30 pm. 
      
       
      
     14    
     The complainant’s brother gave evidence that at some time between 6 o’clock and 7.30 on the evening of 20 July 1993 he had seen the three Swan brothers and the appellant together in Moree. He had known the three Swan brothers and the appellant all his life. 
      
       
      
     15    
     The complainant’s cousin gave evidence that he had seen the complainant, Noel Swan and the appellant together on the night of 20 July 1993, that Noel Swan was punching the complainant, that the complainant was screaming, that he himself had punched Noel Swan and that Noel Swan and the appellant had then run off. The cousin observed that the complainant had no clothing on the lower part of her body, that her face was bleeding and that she had mud on her arms and legs. The complainant and her cousin got into a car driven by a woman named Phyllis Brown. In the car the complainant told her cousin “Noel, Paul and them raped me”. 
      
       
      
     16    
     Phyllis Brown gave evidence of the complainant making a complaint. She said that she had driven the complainant and her cousin to a house where the complainant’s mother was and had then driven the complainant and other persons to the police station. 
      
       
      
     17    
     A number of police officers gave evidence that at about 8 o’clock on the evening of 20 July 1993 the complainant’s parents and then the complainant entered the police station. The complainant had no clothing on, apart from a jumper and a jacket (the jacket had been given to her by her cousin), she had no shoes on, she had mud on her legs, she had swelling around her right eye and jaw and dry blood around her mouth and nose and she appeared very upset and distressed. According to a notebook entry made by a police officer within five minutes of the complainant entering the police station, the complainant said inter alia: 
      
       
        
         
         “I was stripped naked, there were three males… Noel Swan, Paul Smith and Lloyd Swan…they f- me.. all three of them”. 
         
        
       
      
     18    
     Dr Mahoney gave evidence that at about 10 pm on the night of 20 July 1993 he had attended the emergency department at the Moree District Hospital and examined the complainant. She was very distressed, she had clothing only on the upper part of her body, her legs and feet were covered in mud, she had bruising and abrasions on her face and other parts of her body, her right shoulder was tender and there were swelling and abrasions of her genitalia.  
      
       
      
     19    
     In cross-examination Dr Mahoney said that, in his opinion, the injuries he had observed were too severe to be consistent with “fairly violent” consensual intercourse. The following question and answer occurred in Dr Mahoney’s cross-examination:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Let me put to you this hypothetical question, would injuries of that sort be consistent with a person who had had five or six instances of (consensual) intercourse within a short time? 
         
        
        
         
         A: I wouldn’t have thought so, but possible. I doubt it, but possible. I would say unlikely really. Certainly on the external aspects possibly, but not with the - she had very substantial internal injuries…” 
         
        
       
      
     20    
     An uncle of the Swan brothers gave evidence that at about 9 o’clock or half past nine on the evening of 20 July 1993, Noel Swan and the appellant had arrived together at his house. 
      
       
      
     21    
     When spoken to by the police on 21 July 1993, the appellant denied that on the previous night he had been with the Swan brothers or had seen the complainant. The appellant declined to take part in a recorded interview. 
      
       
      
     22    
     At the special hearing the appellant did not give evidence. Because he had been charged before 10 June 1994, he had the right to make an unsworn statement at the special hearing but he did not do so in the defence case, as it was presented before Judge Twigg commenced his summing up. In the defence case one witness was called on behalf of the appellant, who said that she had seen the appellant on the evening of 20 July 1993 after about 8 o’clock and that he had not looked dishevelled or “roughed up” to her.  
      
       
      
     23    
     The notice of application for an extension of time in which to appeal was not lodged until late December 1997, almost two years after the time for lodging an appeal had expired. 
      
       
      
     24    
     Counsel for the Crown submitted in written submissions that the Court should not grant an extension of time in which to appeal. It was contended that the delay in lodging an appeal was considerable, that under the provisions of the Act the verdicts returned by the jury did not count as convictions, except for certain very limited purposes, that the applicant had been released from custody and that the entire “limiting term” indicated by Judge Twigg would soon expire. It was also submitted that no explanation had been given for the delay in lodging an application for an extension of time. 
      
       
      
     25    
     On the hearing of the appeal the Court received another affidavit from the same solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission. In the affidavit the solicitor gave evidence of events which had happened after the Legal Aid Commission had received, on 5 January 1998, copies of the appellant’s notice of application for an extension of time in which to appeal and notice of appeal. There had been a long delay after January 1998 before the transcript of the special hearing had become available and a further delay in receiving advice from counsel on whether there was any merit in the appeal against conviction.  
      
       
      
     26    
     The solicitor’s affidavit did not offer any explanation for the delay in lodging the two notices. The deponent said in her affidavit:- 
      
       
        
         
         “When I first spoke to the appellant I could not induce him to tell me the reasons for delaying the bringing of this appeal, save for discussion regarding new evidence. I am not satisfied that he has any appreciation that failing to bring his appeal within a specified time limit is in any way significant”. 
         
        
       
      
     27    
     The reasons advanced by the Crown are strong reasons for not extending the time within which an appeal could be brought. However, it has to be borne in mind that the appellant is a person who had been unfit to be tried and who has apparently continued to suffer from mental disabilities. It is appropriate for the court to undertake an examination of the merits of the appeal, before deciding whether an extension of time in which to appeal should be granted. 
      
       
      
     28    
     There is only one ground of appeal in the appellant’s notice of appeal against conviction, which is:- 
      
       
        
       The verdicts that upon the limited evidence available the appellant committed the offences charged constitute miscarriages of justice. 
        
       
      
     29    
     In order to appreciate the matters sought to be relied on by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground of appeal, it is necessary to refer to a number of parts of Judge Twigg’s summing-up. 
      
       
      
     30    
     Judge Twigg commenced his summing-up on Friday 8 December 1995. After saying a number of introductory things, his Honour excused the jury until the following Monday 11 December. In the absence of the jury the Crown Prosecutor said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I was a bit concerned about my friend telling the jury that this person had been in custody for two years…. I don’t know whether he is entitled to tell the jury that”. 
         
        
       
      
     31    
     Judge Twigg then said to counsel for the appellant at the special hearing, ”what you have put to them is to get a bit of sympathy for your client…” 
      
       
      
     32    
     His Honour asked counsel for the appellant at the special hearing, whether there was any evidence that the appellant had been in custody since July 1993. Counsel replied that there was evidence that the appellant had been taken into custody in July 1993 but acknowledged that there was no evidence before the jury that the appellant had been in custody since July 1993. Counsel said that the appellant had in fact continuously been in custody since July 1993, bail not having been granted. 
      
       
      
     33    
     The trial judge then took up with counsel what comment he should make on the appellant’s failure to give evidence at the special hearing. The transcript of the summing-up continues as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Don’t you think you should have said he had the right to give evidence? Yes, Mr Smith, do you want to say something? 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: I want to give evidence, but he won’t let me. Every time.. (not transcribable) .. he gets it wrong every time, so I want to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR:: That’s a matter you must discuss with your legal advisers. I’ve given you every opportunity to discuss-- 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: Seems like he’s been hearing voices. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Coombs, I’ll give you an opportunity to speak to your client now and on the weekend, if you wish, in the light of what he said”. 
         
        
       
      
     34    
     This Court received an affidavit from counsel who was counsel for the appellant at the special hearing. No objection was taken by the Crown to the Court receiving this affidavit. In this affidavit counsel said that he had conferred with the appellant, after the court had adjourned on 8 December 1995. The appellant demanded that he be allowed to address the jury. Counsel told the appellant “that the time had passed for this and that, in any event, I strongly advised him not to”. Counsel’s affidavit continued as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “He (the appellant) had become increasingly agitated and disordered as the hearing had proceeded and I formed the view that he had not been getting adequate medication. In particular I recall that at times he had screamed, spat and bashed his hands against the cell walls. 
         
        
        
         
         On Monday 11 December I asked his Honour whether we could discuss a matter in chambers before the hearing continued. I thought prudent to inform the judge of Mr Smith’s request. Myself and the Crown Prosecutor discussed with his Honour in chambers the difficulties with Mr Smith speaking to the jury. I spoke generally about the fact that Mr Smith was suffering from a mental condition and had been found unfit. I explained to his Honour that I was not willing to make the application for Mr Smith to speak to the jury. I said further that his Honour was entitled to refuse the request made by Mr Smith, given the stage of the hearing. His Honour indicated that he would have to see what he thought. 
         
        
       
      
     35    
     In the courtroom but in the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant, in response to a question from his Honour, said that he had no application to make. After the jury were brought into the courtroom, Judge Twigg proceeded with the summing-up. 
      
       
      
     36    
     In the summing-up on 11 December 1995 Judge Twigg referred to what counsel for the appellant had said in his address about the appellant having been in custody., His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “In that aspect Mr Coombs put to you, at the very opening at his address, that the accused was taken into custody on 21 July 1993 where he has remained ever since. He went on to say ‘if as the defence suggests to you that you cannot be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of these offences, then you might think for a person who is unfit to plead that a terrible injustice has been done’. I must tell you that there is no evidence before you that the accused has been in custody since his arrest, but that having been said to you by Mr Coombs you must consider that the accused may have been detained for a multitude of reasons which are unknown to you and to me. They are matters that you and I are not able to consider and perhaps it is best for me to say to you that you ought to put out of your mind that factor….” 
         
        
       
      
     37    
     At the virtual conclusion of the summing-up and while the jury were still in the courtroom, the transcript records the following exchange as having taken place: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Mr Coombs your client is attracting my attention, do you want to speak to him before I ask a question in front… 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: Your Honour, I want to speak to you myself. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well, I’ll allow you to-- 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: While the jury is here. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes well I’ll allow you to speak to Mr Coombs about that, because it is a very important matter to be considered. So I am going to adjourn now Mr Smith-- 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: What about me? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes well I-- 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: I’m locked up for nothing. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well I’ll let you have that right, but let me ask the jury to go and we’ll take the morning adjournment. 
         
        
        
         
         (Accused speaking out loud while jury departing)” 
         
        
       
      
     38    
     In the absence of the jury the following exchange then occurred between the trial judge and the appellant:- 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Well Mr Smith, you must be guided by the lawyers who have greater knowledge than I have about this case. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: What about me? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well yes but-- 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: --say it in front of the jury? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well that’s a matter you and your lawyers must decide, I can’t. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: There was no ..(not transcribable) .. or anything.. (not transcribable).. we never done nothing to her. (not transcribable) .. fella, they’re probably done it, he’s the fella put all the charges on us. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well I’m going to adjourn now, because Mr Coombs wants, I think, to talk further to you about that, I will leave that decision to him and you. I’ll ask you to go down now and leave that till later”. 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the appellant said that he would have to confer with the appellant. 
        
       
      
     39    
     After a short adjournment the whole court, including the jury, reconvened. The transcript records:- 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury now that you have had the morning tea adjournment, I did say to you I might call you back especially to say, retire to consider your verdicts and bring - have in mind the special findings but I ask you to come back particularly. Mr Coombs do you have an application to make on behalf of the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         COOMBS: No, I don’t have an application your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Smith do you want to say something to the jury? 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: Yeah 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well I will grant you leave to make that application, even though the evidence is closed but I would ask of you to speak slowly so that it can be properly recorded and so that the jury can hear you. Stand up if you wish, that is you choice and I want to make sure that you keep your voice up because there is a microphone there that will take it all down. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: ..(not transcribable) .. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR Whatever you wish, yes you go ahead. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: I am not guilty of these charges-- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Just pause the lady is coming down. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: I am not guilty of this charge, never - I would never rape her and for one thing she reckon we raped her and suppose to rape her till she had blood or whatever come out of her. No blood, no evidence of no blood on my trousers or anything, if that can’t prove that I’m not guilty, well why no drag marks or anything in the sand. There’s only two condoms here in the picture and there’s supposed to be five, six of us or whatever. I have to say this because my lawyer won’t say it for me, all he say is these big, long, hard words that no one can understand. The doctors took hairs and all that from us, they found nothing, we never done it. I don’t know how they - them other three got found guilty, I reckon they shouldn’t of and I hope they go mad when they get out. And that’s all”. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Now members of the jury, as I said to you earlier, Mr Smith has the right to remain silent and you are to take what he said into account along with all the other material, that is the sworn evidence and the exhibits that have been presented to you and bearing in mind what I told you earlier that he had been declared unfit to plead by a judge and jury. 
         
        
        
         
         You should, though, take into account what he has said in those circumstances and in the light of the way it is presented to you. Mr Coombs, is there any further address you wish to make? 
         
        
        
         
         COOMBS: No your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Or to raise any matters on what I have just put to the jury in the context in which I put it? 
         
        
        
         
         COOMBS: No your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown anything else you wish me to add? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour”. 
         
        
       
      
     40    
     After these references to relevant parts of the summing-up, I can turn to the submissions made by counsel for the appellant on this appeal. 
      
       
      
     41    
     One submission made in the written submissions for the appellant was that, even though counsel for the appellant at the special hearing had in his address to the jury told the jury that the appellant had been in custody since July 1993, when there was no evidentiary basis for such an assertion, the trial judge should have said nothing about what the appellant’s counsel had said and that what the judge had actually said, and particularly his Honour’s remark “that the accused may have been detained for a multitude of reasons” could have been prejudicial to the appellant. 
      
       
      
     42    
     I do not consider that this submission should be upheld. As counsel for the appellant at the special hearing acknowledged, no evidence had been adduced that the appellant had been in custody since July 1993 and hence there was no evidentiary basis for the assertion made by counsel in his address. The trial judge inferred that counsel for the appellant at the special hearing had deliberately made this assertion, with the object of enlisting the jury’s sympathy for the appellant and it seems to me that this was an inference his Honour was entitled to draw. It is true that in the summing-up Judge Twigg told the jury that the appellant might have been detained for a multitude of reasons but his Honour then proceeded to say that any such reasons would be unknown to both the jury and himself and the jury ought to put “that factor” out of their minds. In my opinion, these later directions removed any possible prejudice. 
      
       
      
     43    
     The principal submissions made by counsel for the appellant in support of the ground of appeal that the verdicts constituted miscarriages of justice related to Judge Twigg’s decision to permit the appellant to make what was in effect a statement to the jury and to what the appellant had said to the jury in the concluding part of that statement. 
      
       
      
     44    
     It was submitted that Judge Twigg had made a wrong decision on a question of law, within the meaning of that expression in s6 of the  
     Criminal Appeal 
      Act, by permitting the appellant to make a statement to the jury, when the proceedings were not an ordinary trial but a special hearing under the Act, no application had been made by counsel for the appellant at the special hearing that the appellant should be permitted to make a statement and counsel for the appellant at the special hearing was, as Judge Twigg knew from the conference in private chambers, opposed to the appellant making a statement. It was submitted that if an accused person is represented at a special hearing, then, as a matter of law, for so long as the accused person is represented, all decisions about how the defence of the accused person should be conducted, including whether he should give evidence or make a statement (if that procedure is open to the accused person) are to be made by the legal representative, and not by the accused. At a special hearing, if there is any conflict between how the legal representative considers the defence case should be conducted and how the accused person considers the defence case should be conducted, then the legal representative’s view prevails. If at a special hearing the accused wishes to give evidence or make a statement (if that procedure is open) but counsel for the accused informs the judge that in counsel’s opinion the accused should not give evidence or make a statement, then the judge makes an error of law, if he permits the accused person to give evidence or make a statement. 
      
       
      
     45    
     In support of these submissions counsel for the appellant made the obvious point that an accused person at a special hearing has already been found unfit to be tried. Counsel referred to s21(2) of the Act which provides that at a special hearing an accused person must, unless the court otherwise allows, be represented by counsel or solicitor and the fact that a person has been found unfit to be tried for an offence is to be presumed not to be an impediment to the person’s representation. It was put that if an accused person at a special hearing can make his own decisions about the conduct of his case and instruct his counsel accordingly, then it is likely that, even if some decisions made by the accused are rational and advantageous to his case, other decisions are likely to be irrational or disadvantageous. The approach advocated by counsel would have the practical virtue of removing the difficulty that counsel for an accused at a special hearing would otherwise have, of distinguishing between those of his client’s instructions which he should follow and those of his client’s instructions which, in his client’s own interests, he should disregard. Counsel said that if an accused person can make his own decision to give evidence or make a statement, against the advice of his legal representative, then it is likely that in giving evidence or making a statement the accused, in the mental state he is in, will say something detrimental to his interests. It was submitted that this was what had in fact happened in the present case.  
      
       
      
     46    
     In my opinion, the problems raised in this case stem from the fundamental contradiction, or at least incongruity, in the concept of a hearing of a criminal charge against a person who is unfit to be tried. On the one hand, the accused person at a special hearing is a person who has been found unfit to be tried, as not meeting the minimum standards with which an accused must comply before he or she can be tried without unfairness or injustice. These standards were stated by Smith J in  
     R v Presser 
      (1958) VR 45 at 48, in a passage which was approved by the High Court in  
     Kesavarajah v The Queen 
      (1994) 181 CLR 230. On the other hand, under the Act a special hearing is to be conducted, “as nearly as possible” and subject only to contrary provision in the Act, as if it were an ordinary criminal trial. 
      
       
      
     47    
     I have already referred to s21(2) of the Act, which provides that at a special hearing the accused must, unless the court otherwise allows, be represented by counsel or solicitor. At an ordinary criminal trial, if an accused is represented, then, although the legal representative gives advice, decisions on fundamental matters, such as whether the accused should give evidence or make a statement (if that procedure is open), are made by the accused person himself, who instructs his legal representative accordingly. At a special hearing the capacity of the accused to make decisions and give instructions is absent or at least diminished. Accordingly, it must follow, in my opinion, that at a special hearing the accused’s legal representative has a greater power to make decisions, without receiving instructions from his client, than would be the case in an ordinary trial. In many cases, it will be impossible for the accused’s legal representative to obtain instructions. However, I have reached the conclusion that I should not accept the submissions made by counsel for the appellant that at a special hearing the power to make decisions on behalf of the accused is exclusively vested in the accused’s legal representative, to the exclusion of the accused himself, with the consequence that a judge at a special hearing makes an error of law, if he permits the accused to take a step which is opposed by the accused’s legal representative.  
      
       
      
     48    
     In my opinion, even in the case of a person who has been found unfit to be tried, a court should be cautious in finding a legislative intent that an accused person has been deprived of fundamental rights which he would have had in an ordinary trial, in the absence of clear legislative provision to that effect. I do not consider that such a clear legislative provision can be discerned in the Act. 
      
       
      
     49    
     Section 21(1) of the Act provides that “except as provided by this Act” a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings. As I have already stated, in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings it is the accused and not his legal representative, who makes the decision whether he should give evidence (or make a statement).  
      
       
      
     50    
     Section 21(2) does lay down a general rule that an accused person must be represented at a special hearing. However, the subsection includes the words “unless the court otherwise allows”, so that the legislature must be taken as having considered that there could be cases where a court could properly allow the accused person at a special hearing to appear for himself, in which case the accused person would necessarily have to make his own decisions about the conduct of his defence. 
      
       
      
     51    
     Section 21(3)(b) confers on an accused person’s counsel or solicitor, if any, the power to exercise the rights of the accused person to challenge jurors or the jury. However, this provision conferring this particular power is the only provision in s21 expressly conferring on the accused person’s legal representatives a power or right of the accused. 
      
       
      
     52    
     Paragraph (c) of ss(3) of s21, by way of comparison, speaks of the accused person (and not his counsel or solicitor) as having the power to raise a defence. Under paragraph (d) of ss(3) of s21 the accused person at a special hearing is entitled to give evidence (or, until the Act was amended, to make an unsworn statement). This entitlement is not expressed to be subject to the accused person having sought or received advice from his counsel or solicitor or to the accused person’s counsel or solicitor having advised that the accused should give evidence (or make a statement).  
      
       
      
     53    
     Section 21(3)(d) can be compared with s21A of the Act. Under s21A of the Act the question whether the accused person has committed the offence charged (or some other offence) is to be determined by a judge alone “if the person so elects in accordance with this section and the judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor”. It is to be noted that under s21A it is the accused person who makes the election, and not his barrister or solicitor. It is a requirement of the accused person so electing that he should have sought and received advice but it would not appear to be a requirement that the election should have been made in accordance with that advice. 
      
       
      
     54    
     I do not consider that the Act provides that a respect in which a special hearing is not to be conducted as if it were an ordinary trial, is that all decisions about the conduct of the accused person’s defence at the special hearing are to be made by the counsel or solicitor of a legally represented accused, to the exclusion of the accused. If an accused person at a special hearing is able to communicate and communicates that he wishes to give evidence (or make a statement), then I do not consider that the judge at the special hearing makes an error of law, if he permits the accused person to give evidence (or make a statement), even though counsel for the accused person is opposed to such a course. 
      
       
      
     55    
     I would reject the submission that Judge Twigg made a wrong decision on a question of law in permitting the appellant to make an unsworn statement to the jury, in the absence of an application by the accused’s counsel and against the advice of the accused’s counsel. 
      
       
      
     56    
     The next submission made by counsel for the appellant was that, even if Judge Twigg had not erred in law in deciding to permit the appellant to make a statement, nevertheless his Honour had erred in law in the manner in which his Honour had made and given effect to that decision. It was submitted that the procedure which his Honour should have adopted would have been to send the jury out of the courtroom and in the absence of the jury to have enquired of the appellant whether the appellant wished to apply to make a statement, to have decided any application the appellant made and if an application by the appellant to make a statement at that late stage of the proceedings was granted, to have adjourned the proceedings, so as to have enabled counsel for the appellant to participate in the preparation of the statement.  
      
       
      
     57    
     I do not consider that Judge Twigg erred in law in adopting the procedure he did. The appellant clearly wished to speak directly to the jury. The jury already knew, from what had been said in their presence, that the appellant wished to speak himself to the judge and the jury. Counsel for the appellant knew that the appellant wished to make a statement to the jury and had informed Judge Twigg that he (counsel) did not wish to make any application and was opposed to the appellant making a statement. It was not suggested on the hearing of the appeal that there was anything further that counsel would have said about the appellant’s application, which counsel was prevented from saying by Judge Twigg’s prompt granting of the appellant’s application. His application having been granted, the appellant himself did not ask for any further time in which to prepare a statement and the terms of the statement, brief though the statement is, suggest that the appellant had already collected his thoughts on what he wanted to say to the jury. In all the circumstances, including particularly the complaints which the appellant had made about his counsel, it seems to me improbable, if the proceedings had been adjourned after the appellant’s application was granted, that the appellant would have been willing to let his counsel determine what was included in, and what was omitted from, the statement he was to make to the jury. 
      
       
      
     58    
     The final submission made by counsel for the appellant was that, even if Judge Twigg had not made any error of law in permitting the appellant to make a statement or in the procedure his Honour had adopted in making or giving effect to that decision, nevertheless a miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the appellant, as a person who had been found unfit to be tried, making a statement, not edited by his counsel, which included the second last sentence of the statement. 
      
       
      
     59    
     Most of the statement made by the appellant was quite rational and made a number of points, which if they had any validity, would have tended to assist the appellant’s defence of the charges. 
      
       
      
     60    
     However, counsel for the appellant submitted that the inclusion in the statement of the second last sentence:- “I don’t know how they - them other three got found guilty, I reckon they shouldn’t of and I hope they go mad when they get out” had led to a miscarriage of justice. The jury had not previously been informed that the alleged co-offenders (the three Swan brothers) had been tried and found guilty. It was submitted that the disclosure by the appellant that another jury had found the co-offenders guilty, which the other jury could only have done if it had accepted the complainant’s evidence, would have bolstered the complainant’s credibility in the minds of the appellant’s jury. 
      
       
      
     61    
     It was also submitted that the hope the appellant expressed that the co-offenders would “go mad when they get out” would have been understood by the jury as a hope that the co-offenders would “get angry” (not that they would go insane), when they were released from custody. It was further submitted that the hope the appellant expressed would have been understood by the jury as a hope that the co-offenders would exact some kind of revenge, after they were released.  
      
       
      
     62    
     I would accept that the jury would have understood that the appellant was expressing a hope that the co-offenders would be angry, when they were released from custody. However, I would not accept that the jury would have understood that the appellant was hoping that they would exact some kind of revenge.  
      
       
      
     63    
     I would accept that in some cases where an accused person at a special hearing makes a statement or gives evidence a miscarriage of justice might result from something said by the accused person in making the statement or in giving evidence.  
      
       
      
     64    
     However, although it might have been preferable, in the appellant’s interests, if the appellant had not disclosed to the jury that the co-offenders had been found guilty by another court and if the appellant had not expressed a hope that the co-offenders would be angry when they were released from custody, I do not consider that the inclusion of these matters in the appellant’s statement led to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
      
     65    
     In the statement the appellant denied his own guilt. It is implicit in the appellant saying “the other three got found guilty” that the other three had denied their guilt and in the statement the appellant stated his opinion that the other three should not have been found guilty. A hope that the other three would feel angry was consistent with the appellant’s assertion that they should not have been found guilty.  
      
       
      
     66    
     Whether the inclusion of these matters in the appellant’s statement led to a miscarriage of justice has to be assessed in the light of the overwhelming evidence against the appellant, including the evidence supporting the credibility of the complainant, which I have summarised earlier in this judgment. The evidence of the complainant was supported by the evidence of persons who had seen the appellant and the Swan brothers together before and after the assaults, by the evidence of Dr Mahoney and by the evidence of other witnesses who had observed the condition of the complainant after the assaults. The credibility of the complainant was further supported by her prompt complaints naming the appellant to her cousin and to the police. 
      
       
      
     67    
     I would be prepared to grant an extension of time in which to appeal, notwithstanding the long unexplained delay in lodging the notice of application for an extension of time, but in my opinion the only ground of appeal relied on should not be upheld and the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
     69    
     CARRUTHERS AJ 
     : I have had the benefit of reading, in draft form, the judgment of James J. I respectfully agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and his reasons therefor. I would merely add the following comments in relation to the conduct of a special hearing under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. 
      
       
      
     70    
     The concept of a special hearing, the procedure for which is set out in section 23 of the Act, does not fit happily into the established procedures for the administration of criminal justice in this State. However, it is understandable that the legislature has taken the view that, in appropriate cases a special hearing, as envisaged by the Act, is the most just way to resolve a charge or charges which have been laid against an accused person who has been held to be unfit to be tried for such charges. However, the procedure will necessarily from time to time create difficulties for the Judge presiding over the special hearing. It could not be considered to be a remarkable occurrence for a person judged unfit to be tried, to behave inappropriately at the special hearing. Such inappropriate behaviour could well involve his or her making prejudicial statements or indulging in disruptive behaviour. This imposes the obligation upon the Judge to deal as best he or she can in the circumstances, to avoid such statements or behaviour causing the trial to miscarry. 
      
       
      
     71    
     The community would expect that jurors having been made aware of the nature of the proceedings in which they are involved, would adopt a mature and sensitive attitude towards such statements or conduct, and thus avoid them culminating in a miscarriage of justice. Of course, questions of fact and degree arise here.  
      
       
      
     72    
     In the instant case Judge Twigg was faced with a difficult problem and he adopted a course which he believed was fair, just and appropriate in the circumstances. It is possible that other Judges may have taken a different course. One will never know. I am quite satisfied in my own mind that the course which Judge Twigg took was not capable, in the special circumstances of this case, of leading to a miscarriage of justice.

     ABADEE J IRELAND J BARR J Tuesday, 22 June 1999 
     
     REGINA v Daniel Stephen BENECKE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   ABADEE J: I will ask Justice Barr to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   BARR J: The appellant, Daniel Stephen Benecke, appeals from his conviction by a District Court jury of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife. 
     
      
    3   At about 3.50 am on 15 September 1997 a man wearing a dark-blue sloppy joe with a hood and having a black handkerchief covering his face below the eyes, entered a service station at North Ryde and at knifepoint robbed the console operator, Mr Abignano, of a sum of money. 
     
      
    4   The Crown adduced four pieces of evidence. The first was Mr Abignano’s voice identification of the appellant as the robber. The second was of a police dog handler whose dog picked up a scent near the service station about an hour after the robbery and followed it to a certain house. The third and fourth were of independent witnesses who put the appellant in the general neighbourhood of the service station shortly before the robbery. 
     
      
    5   It is convenient to deal first with the second and third grounds of appeal, which are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       2. The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the police officer from the Tracker Dog Squad. 
       
       
       3. The learned trial judge failed adequately to direct the jury in relation to the tracker dog evidence. 
       
      
    6   Senior Constable Mahony, a police dog handler, arrived at the service station with his dog about an hour after the robbery. The dog indicated human scent on a garden bed at the northern end of the service station. The dog followed the scent into a car park and then through a series of grassed places or garden beds. 
     
      
    7   Senior Constable Mahony explained that human scent is most easily detectable by a dog if it is fresh and if it has been left on a soft surface. Scent is too difficult to detect on a hard surface like bitumen or concrete, especially an hour after a person has passed. A scent which is an hour old is an old one and much less easy to detect than a fresh one. Senior Constable Mahony’s dog could detect scent about one hour and forty minutes old. 
     
      
    8   The dog followed the scent intermittently, picking it up on soft surfaces and losing it on hard, until it stopped at a six foot wooden paling fence at the rear of a house at 388 Lane Cove Road. The dog behaved in a way that made Senior Constable Mahony think that the scent continued over the fence, but neither he nor the dog went over the fence. 
     
      
    9   Mr Abignano telephoned police straight away after the robbery and Senior Constable Farat went to the service station at about 4 am and spoke to him. Mr Abignano told him that he thought the robber was like the accused, whom he knew. The accused had worked at the service station for a number of months until 5 August 1997. Senior Constable Farat recorded in his notebook that the accused was possibly the offender. 
     
      
    10   Between November 1996 and April 1997 the appellant had resided in the house at 388 Lane Cove Road. Police had that information and broadcast it over the radio. Officers were present at the house when Senior Constable Mahony was using his dog. They entered the house and woke the occupant, Mr Sularyo. 
     
      
    11   Mr Sularyo was asleep and had been at the time of the robbery. He did not see the appellant there at all on that night. In fact he had had no contact with him since he left the premises in April the same year. There was no evidence that the appellant was at the house on that night. 
     
      
    12   Objection was taken to the tender of the evidence of Senior Constable Mahony and of Mr Sularyo. 
     
      
    13   It was submitted on appeal that the evidence had little or no probative value. In my opinion that submission has been made good. 
     
      
    14   The scent was not picked up at the place of the robbery but in a garden bed at the edge of the service station. There was no evidence whether the trail approached the place of the robbery or emerged from it. Senior Constable Mahony’s dog followed the scent only in one direction, and it might be thought that that was the direction in which the person had travelled whose scent it was. Yet there was no evidence of that. There was no evidence that the scent was taken up at its end or at its beginning or at some other point. It might have continued away from the garden bed in the direction opposite to the house at 388 Lane Cove Road, but if it did, the fact never became known because no enquiry was made. Such a conclusion would have been consistent with the evidence of Mr Abignano, who said that the robber fled north-west towards Pymble. 
     
      
    15   The scent might have been of more than one person, and there was no evidence that Senior Constable Mahony would have known if that had been so. 
     
      
    16   The scent or scents began, ended or continued at or through a house premises, yet there was no evidence that the appellant had been at that house within the last five months. 
     
      
    17   The potential for unfair prejudice was great. The evidence of the behaviour of tracker dogs has been regarded as potentially unreliable. (See R v Trupedo [1920] SALR 58; R v Barnes, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 1 December 1998, unreported; R v Pieterson and Holloway [1995] 1 WLR 293; R v Sykes [1997] Crim LR 752.) 
     
      
    18   The danger has been recognised that juries may place too much weight on the untested and untestable ability of a dog to track a scent. This was evidence which could not be easily tested by cross-examination and which might possibly show that the robber jumped the fence into the house at 388 Lane Cove Road, but other inferences were equally open; for example, that there was more than one scent; that the person whose scent it was did not go into the premises at 388 Lane Cove Road but came out of them; that that person had nothing to do with the robbery, and that the scent or scents had been left by a police officer or police officers. 
     
      
    19   The evidence showed that the first officer to arrive did so about fifty minutes before the dog began to track. There was an historical connection between the house and the appellant because he had resided there for a period of time, yet there was no evidence that he had been there for five months, so there was no contemporary connection between the scent and the appellant. 
     
      
    20   Taken at its highest and putting aside all its weaknesses, the evidence was capable only of showing that a person had been in the vicinity at about the time of the robbery. The evidence that the appellant had lived at the house five months previously had no probative value in my opinion. 
     
      
    21   There was a risk that if the evidence about the behaviour of Senior Constable Mahony’s dog were admitted, the jury might misuse it by combining it with a speculation that the appellant had returned to his old residence that night, and falsely concluded that the scent must therefore have been his. That was a conclusion that was unavailable on the evidence. 
     
      
    22   In my opinion the evidence about the behaviour of the dog had little or no probative value. Whatever probative value it had was vastly outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the appellant, constituted by the risk of its misuse by the jury in the manner I have indicated. The evidence ought to have been rejected either because it proved nothing or in the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. 
     
      
    23   The trial judge gave the jury no special warning or instruction about the approach they should take to this evidence, notwithstanding the difficulty of testing it and the dangers to which I have adverted. In R v Barnes, Gleeson CJ considered appropriate and adequate a warning in relation to tracker dog evidence that the jury should bear in mind that the dog was not able to be cross-examined and that the jury should be careful to avoid over-estimating the reliability of the operation of a dog’s senses so as to avoid too rapidly arriving at the conclusion contended for by the Crown from the evidence of the dog’s activities. 
     
      
    24   The evidence having been admitted, such a warning was essential in this case. Trial counsel failed to ask for a warning, but proper objection was taken to the tender of the evidence and the matter is of such fundamental importance that I would grant leave to appeal and uphold the appeal on this ground also. 
     
      
    25   Success on the second and third grounds would lead only to an order for a new trial, as would success on the remaining grounds, other than the first and seventh grounds. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the remaining grounds, other than the first and seventh grounds which are as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. The learned trial judge erred in refusing to withdraw the identification evidence from the jury and directing an acquittal at the close of the Crown case. 
       
       
       ... 
       
       
       7. The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
    26   Although it has been convenient in times past to use a formulation which asserts that a conviction is “unsafe and unsatisfactory” that term is imprecise and it is necessary to have regard to the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. By s 6(1) the Court in any appeal under s 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    27   In the present appeal the attack on the verdict was made in two ways. The first depended upon an accumulation of the matters catalogued in the other grounds of appeal which was said to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice in the sense referred to in R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. If the appeal succeeded on that basis it would lead only to an order for a new trial and it is therefore unnecessary to consider it further. 
     
      
    28   The second basis which, if made good, would entitle the appellant to an acquittal, turns upon the test settled in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 72 ALJR 78, namely whether, after making its own independent view of the evidence, this Court concludes that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
    29   In view of the conclusion I have reached about the second and third grounds of appeal, I have undertaken a review of the evidence excluding the evidence of Senior Constable Mahony and Mr Sularyo. 
     
      
    30   Mr Abignano was working at the service station at about 3.50 am. He was bending down stocking the refrigerator when he heard the sliding doors open. He saw a man having the appearance I have described. The man held a knife and started shouting, “Give me the money”. He told Mr Abignano to go to the counter. Mr Abignano opened the cash register and placed the drawer on the counter. The man said, “Give me the notes and give me the tin under the counter”. 
     
      
    31   Mr Abignano told him there were no tins under the counter, but when he opened the cupboard he realised that there was a blue tin containing a cash float. He put this on the counter. The man picked up the cash register drawer and the tin and ran away. 
     
      
    32   In his evidence Mr Abignano described the man as solid and about 180 centimetres tall. He was in his early twenties, about twenty to twenty-five years old. He was of Anglo-Saxon appearance. Mr Abignano told the jury that whilst the man was speaking to him he started immediately recognising the voice. He explained that the accused, like himself, had been a casual console operator at the service station. 
     
      
    33   Although operators worked alone, they spent some time together as shifts changed over. It was necessary for reliever and relieved to speak to each other during the changeover process, which might take twenty minutes or so. Such changeovers between Mr Abignano and the accused had taken place about three times a week. He estimated that there had been about thirty such changeovers during the period of a few months, ending when the appellant ceased to work at the service station. 
     
      
    34   Records of the business throw some doubt on Mr Abignano’s estimate of the number of times he and the appellant were together at a changeover and suggest that there were eight shifts within the relevant time at which the duties of Mr Abignano and the appellant coincided. 
     
      
    35   In addition Mr Abignano said that the appellant had come to the business as a customer on about ten occasions and Mr Abignano had spoken to him then. He had also spoken to him about five times on the telephone. He thought that he knew his voice quite well. 
     
      
    36   He told the jury that once he had gone around the counter at the robber’s order he knew almost immediately that it was the appellant. He was asked why he did not tell the appellant that he had recognised him and he said that he did not do so because he was afraid that if he did the appellant might come after him. 
     
      
    37   He said that there was one distinctive feature about the robber’s voice and that was that he spoke in a very broad Australian accent, which he described as “ocker”. The appellant did not give evidence but the jury heard a tape recording of a formal interview which took place not long after the robbery between a police officer and the appellant. 
     
      
    38   A number of criticisms were made about Mr Abignano’s evidence. First, distinctions were drawn between things he said to a police officer immediately after the robbery and things he said in a more formal interview which took place three days later. Straight after the robbery he said that he thought the robber was “like Mr Benecke”. He described the robber as twenty-two to twenty-seven years of age, even though he knew that the appellant was twenty years of age. 
     
      
    39   Three days later he told another police officer that he was “positive” that the robber was the appellant. He estimated the age of the robber as twenty to twenty-five years. Mr Abignano said in cross-examination that when he told the police that he believed the robber was twenty-two to twenty-seven years of age, he honestly believed that to be true. 
     
      
    40   Apart from the strong and distinctive Australian accent of the robber, Mr Abignano noticed nothing distinctive about the sound or appearance of the robber. 
     
      
    41   There were circumstances which might have made it difficult for Mr Abignano to recognise or identify the voice of the robber. The attack on him was unexpected. He was put in great fear and the robber was shouting. Mr Abignano conceded that the accused had never shouted at him before. 
     
      
    42   On the other hand, as the evidence shows, he was familiar with the voice of the appellant. The conversation lasted about a minute, a not inconsiderable time. 
     
      
    43   The criticisms made of Mr Abignano and what is asserted to have been a change or improvement in his evidence, were well able to be weighed by the jury. The robber knew that there was a tin or box under the counter where money was kept. Only someone who had been behind the counter would know that fact. The evidence showed that during the appellant’s employment at least one tin was kept in that place. That evidence pointed to a small class of persons as including the robber. The appellant was a member of that class of persons. 
     
      
    44   The appellant did not give evidence and the jury were entitled to take that fact into account in evaluating the strength of the Crown case. R v Gordon (1991) 57 A Crim R 413. 
     
      
    45   Finally, this Court must have regard to the advantage the jury had in comparing Mr Abignano’s description of the appellant’s accent with the sound of his voice on the tape, which was played to the jury. 
     
      
    46   In my view, a jury weighing all these considerations would be entitled to regard Mr Abignano’s identification of the appellant as sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the robber. I am unable to conclude that the jury, hearing the evidence, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant.  
     
      
    47   I do not think that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that there was any miscarriage of justice. I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial. 
     
      
    48   ABADEE J: I agree with the reasons and proposed orders of Justice Barr. 
     
      
    49   IRELAND J: I agree. 
     
      
    50   ABADEE J: The orders will be as proposed by his Honour.

     REGINA v Paul Matthew BRYANT 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by his Honour Justice Dowd on 10 August 1998. The applicant had been found by a jury to be not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total period of ten years comprising a minimum term of six and a half years and an additional term of three and a half years.  
     
      
    2    During the course of the evening of 5 July 1995 a fight occurred between the applicant and the deceased. His Honour summarised the conclusion of this altercation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A struggle occurred in the kitchen of the premises between the deceased and the prisoner in which no injury was inflicted on the prisoner but the deceased received a number of wounds, the principal wound being to the chest and the last penetrating his skull near his left eye and the sharp knife remaining embedded deeply in his skull. The deceased shortly thereafter bled to death."" 
        
       
      
    3    His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Gary Waller died on 6 July 1995 as a result of a stab wound he received to the left side of his chest just to the side of his nipple. The depth of that wound was about 180 mms or seven inches. The knife passed through his left and right lungs, through his pulmonary artery, one of the main arteries to the lung, through the pericardium terminating at the back of the fourth right rib. The knife missed the heart but slightly bruised the blood vessels that came out of the heart."" 
        
       
      
    4    His Honour also summarised other cuts and stab wounds which the deceased had suffered including cuts and wounds to the hands. 
     
      
    5    Manslaughter was open to the jury on the basis of either provocation or an unlawful and dangerous act. For purposes of the sentencing exercise, his Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant acted under provocation in the relevant sense. His Honour set out his findings as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have no difficulty in finding to the requisite criminal standard that the prisoner by the use of a Wiltshire Stay Sharp knife stabbed the deceased in the chest which together with other stab wounds to his body caused the death of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        The nature of the blows struck by the prisoner particularly to the head were forceful and savage blows with a deadly long bladed and sharp weapon. The ready availability of such now normal domestic implements does not detract from the dangerous and life threatening nature. 
        
       
       
        
        The blow to the chest was almost inevitably fatal in the circumstances of its infliction to the deceased. The blow to the head, whatever the reasons for the knife becoming embedded was a savage action, I do not accept the evidence of the accused as to the circumstances in which the wounds were inflicted. 
        
       
       
        
        I find to that same standard that the prisoner's act was deliberate and voluntary. 
        
       
       
        
        Having determined two of the necessary elements of the verdict of manslaughter above, it is necessary to examine the alternative basis for the court's finding as to the finding of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        I am, however, satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased occurred by an unlawful and dangerous act. The unlawful and dangerous act being the stabbing of the deceased through his lung penetrating to the back of the deceased's rib cage. 
        
       
       
        
        Although only a moderate amount of force was necessary to cause such an injury, nevertheless it was carried out with force and it was at least moderate force and such an action with such a weapon enables the court to find beyond reasonable doubt that the act of the prisoner was an unlawful and dangerous act. 
        
       
       
        
        I find, therefore, beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of the prisoner was an unlawful and dangerous act. I find, therefore beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person in the position of the prisoner would have realised that by the act of stabbing the deceased through the chest that the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. I further find beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did not do that act in self defence."" 
        
       
      
    6    The first ground of appeal is that his Honour's reasoning in this regard was not consistent with the jury's verdict of not guilty for the charge of murder. It was submitted that on his Honour's analysis of the facts the only missing element for a charge of murder was the requirement that the Crown prove that the accused intended to kill the deceased, or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him, or that he foresaw the probability that the death of the deceased would result from his act. It was submitted that a finding that the stabbing of the deceased through his lung penetrating through to the back of the rib cage was ""deliberate and voluntary"", necessarily meant that the appellant intended at least to inflict grievous bodily harm to him. It was submitted that that is in substance what his Honour found and on this basis the trial Judge sentenced the applicant, so it was submitted, on a basis inconsistent with the verdict of the jury. 
     
      
    7    The relevant principle to which his Honour himself adverted is set out in this court's decision in a five person bench in Isaacs (1997) 90 ACrimR 587 at 591 where after their Honours referred to the need for the sentencing Judge to find facts material to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, the court said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision making referred to above is that the view of the facts adopted by the Judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. This may produce the result that, in a particular case, the view of the facts which the Judge is obliged to take is different from the view which the Judge would have taken if unconstrained by the verdict. (cf  
        Maxwell  
        (1996) 184 CLR 501). In the present case, for example, a trial judge might have considered that the facts supported a verdict of murder, not manslaughter; nevertheless, the Judge would be obliged to sentence on the basis that the case was one of manslaughter. The fact that a judge may not agree with a jury's verdict, and thus may be required to sentence on a basis different from the Judge's personal view of the case, is an inevitable consequence of the division of functions inherent in trial by jury."" 
        
       
      
    8    A not dissimilar principle is at work in the context of the principle based on the High Court decision in De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 583, that sentencing must not be done on the basis of an offence which would have exposed the accused to a more serious maximum penalty. In the passage in his Honour's reasoning quoted above, it is clear that his Honour treated as a separate element of the offence of manslaughter what he described as ""a deliberate and voluntary act"".  
     
      
    9    The first ground of appeal is based on the proposition that his finding with respect to the action of the accused as being ""deliberate and voluntary"" was, in the particular circumstances of this case, inconsistent with the finding of not guilty of murder. Counsel for the applicant submitted that in the circumstances the finding that the act was deliberate and voluntary necessarily implied that it was done with the intention of at least inflicting grievous bodily harm and, accordingly, would be murder.  
     
      
    10    It is not clear to me where his Honour obtained the formulation that an act had to be deliberate and voluntary as a necessary act of manslaughter. For present purposes it is unnecessary to resolve the matter. The issue is whether or not the reference is inconsistent with the jury's verdict of not guilty of murder.  
     
      
    11    In Bollen (1998) 99 ACrimR 510 at 528-529 the trial judge had made a finding when sentencing for manslaughter that the act of stabbing was ""deliberate"". As Hunt CJ at CL found: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The judge did make a finding that ‘at the last moment everything happened rapidly’, and that the appellant’s act of stabbing the deceased, although deliberate, was by way of reaction only and without specific intent to harm him at the moment when it occurred. Although the Crown did not require the jury to be satisfied that that act was a deliberate one, the judge’s finding does not infringe the  
        De Simoni 
         principle, because that act did not make the appellant liable to a more serious maximum penalty."" 
        
       
      
    12    The words ""deliberate and voluntary"" each qualify the word ""act"" of the accused below and the applicant in this Court. An act may be ""deliberate and voluntary"" without any connotation that the person doing the act intended a consequence such as the infliction of grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    13    In the present case, counsel for the appellant sought to obtain the necessary inconsistency by focusing on his Honour's identification two paragraphs after the reference to ""deliberate and voluntary"", of the relevant “unlawful and dangerous” act which his Honour found and I repeat in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The unlawful and dangerous act being the stabbing of the deceased through his lung penetrating to the back of the deceased’s rib cage."" 
        
       
      
    14    It was submitted that by reason of his Honour's identification of the unlawful and dangerous act in this manner, that his Honour's earlier reference should be understood in the same way. When I say his Honour's earlier reference, I mean to the appellant's act which his Honour found to be “deliberate and voluntary”. Reasons for sentence should not be construed in this way.  
     
      
    15    There is no reason to believe that his Honour's reference to ""the prisoner's act"" was a reference to precisely the same act which his Honour a few paragraphs later identified as the relevant ""unlawful and dangerous act"". In my view, his Honour's reference to the ""prisoner's act"" which his Honour found to be ""deliberate and voluntary"" is more likely to refer to acts involving the knife, but not acts of the degree of precision involving the penetration of the lung, in the way his Honour subsequently identified. On this basis there is no inconsistency between his Honour's use of particular terminology and the jury's verdict. 
     
      
    16    The first ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    17    The second ground of appeal was that the verdict of ten years, comprising a minimum term of six and a half years and an additional term of three and a half years, was manifestly excessive. His Honour referred to authorities which reflected the well-known principle that the range of sentences for manslaughter is a wide one, by reason of the range of variety of circumstances upon which a conviction for this offence can be based. His Honour stated that he had before him a schedule of decisions on sentencing for manslaughter provided by each of the counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown.  
     
      
    18    His Honour recited the relevant facts which have not been challenged before us. That the applicant had a long history of heavy binge drinking caused in part by a disturbed family background. His Honour referred to previous offences. His Honour accepted the expression of remorse on behalf of the prisoner and found it to be genuine. His Honour also noted that counsel for the applicant had also offered a plea of guilty of manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment, which offer was rejected by the Crown. His Honour indicated that he had taken that factor into account on sentence. His Honour also took into account the effect that alcohol had on the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence. This clearly was substantial and it appears to be the basis on which the jury found the appellant not guilty of the primary offence and found him guilty of manslaughter.  
     
      
    19    His Honour specifically referred to what he described as the ""unpremeditated nature of the crime"". There is no doubt that this finding was also related to the state of inebriation of the applicant on the particular day. His Honour referred to the broad range of factors relevant to the sentencing task, including deterrence and rehabilitation.  
     
      
    20    His Honour referred to a number of matters relevant to a finding of special circumstances, specifically the need for counselling for alcohol addiction and found such circumstances to exist. This finding is not challenged before us.  
     
      
    21    There can be and there was no criticism of the range of factors which his Honour took into account. The criticism was of the result. 
     
      
    22    Plainly, a significant factor in the ultimate decision was the objective seriousness of the offence in terms of the attack with a knife with a number of wounds, including the fatal stab wound, and the final stabbing which caused the knife to fix in the deceased's eye. On any basis, this was a vicious attack.  
     
      
    23    The task before the Court is to determine whether or not the sentence imposed is within the range of the exercise of a broad discretion in the particular circumstances of the offence and of the offender. Numerous cases have been referred to in written and oral submissions that the Court has received. Necessarily, for a crime of this character, they range over a broad number of years in terms of the final sentences imposed. On the basis of the materials before the Court it appears that the sentence imposed in this case is at the top of the range of sentences for this offence and very few cases to which we have been referred involve sentences of greater length than the sentence imposed in the instant case.  
     
      
    24    However, the task for this Court is to determine whether or not the sentence his Honour determined, bearing in mind the sentences that have been found to be appropriate in the past, was within the range of the discretion for his Honour to exercise. 
     
      
    25    Prior cases are of limited utility in terms of guidance but do give some guidance, because it is important that an element of consistency exists in sentencing practice in this regard.  
     
      
    26    Whilst, in my opinion, the sentence on this occasion can be seen to be a high one and perhaps towards the top of the range, but within the range and therefore permissible. In all of the circumstances of the case I am of the view that his Honour did not exceed the bounds of reasonable exercise of discretion on this occasion and that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    27    DUNFORD J: I agree. 
     
      
    28    ADAMS J: I also agree. 
     
      
    29    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

      REGINA v MAXWELL JOHN HESLEHURST 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J: The appellant, Maxwell John Heslehurst, appeared before his Honour Judge Graham in the Parramatta District Court where he was sentenced in respect of three counts in an indictment alleging obtaining money by deception. 
      
       
      
     2     
     On that occasion, in respect of one of the counts in the indictment two form 1 documents containing a further forty charges of obtaining money by deception and one charge of failing to appear were taken into account. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The result of the appellant's appearance was that his Honour imposed an effective sentence of three years imprisonment, comprising minimum and additional terms of eighteen months each respectively. The minimum term was ordered to commence on 18 November 1997 and expire on 17 May 1999. The applicant was ordered to be released at the expiry of the minimum term. That time has passed and we were informed that the appellant is at large. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The appellant has been notified of the listing today. It might be recorded that this appeal was previously listed before the Court on 3 March 1999, whilst the appellant was in custody. He did not appear on that occasion as information was received from the prison that he had been admitted to hospital and was incapable of travelling to court. By coincidence I was a member of the court constituted on that occasion. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The appellant has been called three times today, once at 10 a.m., again at 11 a.m. and finally at 12.15 p.m. He has not appeared on any occasion. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The appellant, in response to the directions of the Registrar, has supplied written submissions. It does not appear that the appellant had legal representation and it was anticipated that he would appear for himself in this appeal.  
      
       
      
     7     
     In those circumstances the appeal may proceed upon the written submissions which have been received. It is unnecessary to detail all of the offences. One example will suffice. It was the modus operandi of the appellant to approach people with an assertion that in his employment as a debt collector he had available repossessed motor vehicles which he was prepared to sell for the amount alleged to be outstanding pursuant to hire purchase agreement. There were in fact no such vehicles, but on many occasions he obtained money from would-be purchasers. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The appellant pleaded guilty before the District Court. It is perhaps sufficient to indicate the posture then adopted to recite the content of brief cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor when the appellant gave evidence in mitigation. That evidence was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. You have pleaded to three counts presently before the court? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Q. And you were out on bail on that eventually? 
          
         A. Yeah, I believe, yeah, I'm not sure which is which any more. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you went out and systematically duped people? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To obtain further money? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You had no intention of delivering any of the goods that you had promised? 
          
         A. No, none whatsoever. 
          
          
         Q. And in each one of those cases there was a total of 45 counting (sic) you took advantage of those people whether they could afford it or not? 
          
          
         A. Yes, virtually, yes. I can't argue with you. What you are saying is the truth."" 
         
        
       
      
     9     
     The appellant's record shows that he has been, over many years, a persistent fraudster. These offences are further manifestations of that activity. 
      
       
      
     10     
     In the written submissions forwarded to the Court the appellant has made assertions that the guilty plea entered was done so at the behest of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the promise of a benefit to him in sentencing arrangements. He complains that this was not adhered to. He submits this with an assertion that there had been some agreement between the DPP and his lawyer as to the “amount of charges” (to use his expression) that were put before the Court. Again he complains this did not happen. 
      
       
      
     11     
     As best those grounds can be understood, they would appear to be of some challenge seeking to go behind the pleas of guilty entered in the District Court. There is no evidence whatever to support the assertions in the written submissions and, for my part, I would not grant the appellant leave to rely upon them. 
      
       
      
     12     
     Other matters raised in the written submissions refer to the appellant's state of health which, it is claimed, was not fully taken into account, and further, the appellant states that the sentencing Judge did not take into account that whilst in custody the appellant's incarceration would be in maximum security. As best this last proposition can be understood, it is a reference to the appellant's medical conditions and the anticipated consequence that he would spend his time in custody probably in a prison hospital, rather than in places of lesser security. 
      
       
      
     13     
     In fact, the appellant's asserted medical condition was the subject of evidence below and there was considerable reference made to it by the learned sentencing Judge in his remarks on sentence. Not only is it unsupportable to suggest that his Honour did not take those matters into account, or even fully into account, it is apparent that his Honour gave the appellant considerable lenience in respect of those matters. Indeed, speaking for myself, I regard the appellant as having received a surprisingly generous amount of lenience at first instance. 
      
       
      
     14     
     In my view there is no substance in this appeal. I propose that the appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     15     
     ABADEE J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     16     
     BARR J: I also agree. 
      
       
      
     17     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

     GROVE J ABADEE J BARR J Wednesday, 30 June 1999 
     
     REGINA v Lenhi PAEK 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GROVE J: I will ask Justice Barr to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   BARR J: The appellant, Lenhi Paek, was convicted by a District Court jury of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 440 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    3   Judge Luland of Queen’s Counsel sentenced her to eight years’ imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of five years and an additional term of three years. The appellant appealed against her conviction and sought leave to appeal against the sentence. She has not pressed her application for leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    4   The Crown asserted that the appellant supplied heroin to Van Hung Nguyen. There were only two witnesses to the precise conversations and arrangements made by and between Nguyen and the appellant, namely Nguyen and the appellant. Although there was a good deal of evidence from police officers who observed the movements of Nguyen, the appellant and others, they could not say precisely what was happening from time to time. 
     
      
    5   Nguyen’s version was as follows. He lived in Melbourne. He telephoned the appellant and arranged to meet her at Sydney Casino. The two of them met there twice and on the second occasion they had a conversation about heroin. She mentioned a Chinese man who could supply it. She pointed him out. 
     
      
    6   Nguyen asked how much half a kilo would cost and the appellant said that she would find out. They arranged to speak about the matter later and the appellant gave Nguyen her telephone number. He telephoned her again within a couple of days and she told him that the man had quoted $96,000 for half a kilogram of heroin. 
     
      
    7   Nguyen made his own enquiries and collected money from people who would buy the drug from him. Then he telephoned the appellant and told her that he wanted to buy half a kilogram. A little later he was told by another Melbourne resident, Hai Le, that he wanted to buy half a kilogram as well and he telephoned the appellant and told her as much. 
     
      
    8   On 26 May 1997 the appellant told Nguyen that she could supply the drug. On the same day Nguyen flew to Sydney. A man called Minh, a resident of Sydney who had been temporarily visiting Melbourne, accompanied him. Nguyen had $96,000 with him. When Nguyen arrived in Sydney he telephoned Le and arranged to collect cash from him for his share. 
     
      
    9   Nguyen and Minh were met at Sydney Airport by a number of people in a Toyota Tarago van. They were the appellant and Minh’s wife and sister, called In or Yen. Minh’s wife drove the van and they all went to Newtown and had a meal at a restaurant. During the meal Nguyen asked the appellant whether the goods were ready and she said, “Nine o’clock”. Nguyen again spoke to Le on the telephone. 
     
      
    10   Minh’s wife and sister parted company from the group and Nguyen, the appellant and Minh returned to the van. The appellant told Minh to drive to Park Street, Sydney, and he did. On the way they stopped near Central Railway to pick up Le. Le got into the van and gave Nguyen money in a plastic bag. 
     
      
    11   Nguyen put the two bundles of money together. Le got out of the van and the other three continued the journey to Park Street. Minh parked the van and the appellant and Nguyen got out. Nguyen handed the bag of money to her and she said that she would return to the van in ten or fifteen minutes. 
     
      
    12   Nguyen was nervous about the matter in view of the substantial sum of money he had handed over and followed the appellant as she walked along the street. He saw her meet the Chinese man she had previously pointed out to him at the casino. He followed them until they entered a building. He waited outside the building and the appellant returned ten minutes later. She told him that the drug was in the handbag she was carrying. 
     
      
    13   They returned to the van and sat side by side in the back seat. The appellant took heroin out of her handbag and handed it to Nguyen. There were two packages and Nguyen put one of them on the front seat. That was for Le. He put his own in a bag and left it under his feet on the floor of the van. 
     
      
    14   The van moved off again and stopped at a place which had been arranged with Le. He got in, sat in the front seat, collected the drug intended for him and got out of the van again. He was arrested shortly afterwards with about 445 grams of heroin in his possession. 
     
      
    15   The van continued towards the western suburbs of Sydney and was stopped by police. The appellant and Nguyen were arrested and another, about equal, amount of heroin was found in the van. 
     
      
    16   The other account came from the appellant. She said that she was a beautician who was friendly with a customer of hers called Yen. She met her at the casino about a week before her arrest. Yen joined the appellant at her table and pointed out Nguyen who was nearby, and told her that he was her (the appellant’s) foster brother. Nguyen looked at her and smiled. He exhibited a sentimental interest in her. 
     
      
    17   When the time came to go home, he offered her a lift. The next day he invited her out to lunch and they went to a Thai restaurant in Fairfield and then spent some time at a motel where he was staying. That would have been 21 May. 
     
      
    18   On 23 May he telephoned her and invited her to the casino for dinner. She accepted. At the casino Nguyen continued to display a friendly and sentimental attitude towards the appellant. They parted good friends on that night and Nguyen said that he was returning to Melbourne. There was no mention of drugs. 
     
      
    19   On 26 May Nguyen telephoned her again and told her that he was coming to Sydney and that he was missing her. She was thinking that she might like to go to the casino that evening and that she might ring a friend and suggest a visit. Then, luckily, Yen telephoned her and said she was going to go to the casino. The appellant accepted the offer of a lift. They arranged that Yen would collect her and she came to the appellant’s home at six o’clock and picked her up in the Tarago van. Minh’s wife was there as well. 
     
      
    20   Unexpectedly to the appellant, the van went to the airport and not the casino. When she arrived there she saw Minh and Nguyen. She was surprised. The group went to Newtown to a restaurant. During the time they were there, there were conversations between various members of the group which she did not understand. 
     
      
    21   After the meal Yen and Minh’s wife decided to go home by taxi. The other three got into the van and Nguyen told Minh, the driver, to go to George Street. He made a telephone call. They went to George Street and there was Le. He got in and spoke to Nguyen about the money, whether there was enough. Nguyen told Le that when he was ready he would pick him up.  
     
      
    22   The van went to Park Street, but not at the appellant’s directions. The van stopped and Nguyen got out carrying the bag. He asked the appellant to go with him, so she got out. He asked her to do him a small favour, to carry the bag and give it to a person waiting at the corner of a nearby building. 
     
      
    23   She said, “What’s that, it’s money, isn’t it?” She thought it was money because she had heard conversation about money in the van. Nguyen said, “It’s a lot of money in there. It’s better if I stay back and watch out.” The appellant thought that Nguyen was acting as he did out of fear of a possible robbery. 
     
      
    24   Nguyen told her to go to where there would be a man waiting. She complied with his request and met a man, who greeted her and asked her where her friend was. He kept walking and the appellant followed. He entered a building, but the appellant was afraid because she could not see Nguyen. The man reassured her and she accompanied him up in the lift. The man went through a doorway and the appellant waited outside. He came out again holding a small package. 
     
      
    25   The appellant was familiar with the system of pawning jewellery and other valuables and thought that what was happening was that Nguyen had previously pawned valuables and was now redeeming them. She took the bag, went down in the lift and found Nguyen waiting nearby. She told him she had something for him but he told her to leave it where it was. They returned to the van and got inside. 
     
      
    26   Nguyen took the package out of her bag and opened it. She did not look at what was in it. Minh made a telephone call, she assumed to Le, and the van started off again. When it stopped, Le got in. There was some conversation but she took no notice of it and after a short time Le got out again. 
     
      
    27   Nguyen then said that they would go to a motel and began holding the appellant’s hand. On the way, they were stopped by the police and arrested. 
     
      
    28   She had no idea that Nguyen or Le were intending to buy drugs or that there were drugs in the bag the man handed to her to give to Nguyen. 
     
      
    29   The first ground of appeal argued asserted that his Honour failed to direct the jury that before they could convict the appellant they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she knew that the quantity of heroin was not less than the commercial quantity. In summing up the case to the jury, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        What is it then that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt? The Crown must prove to you these three elements before you convict the accused and prove them beyond reasonable doubt, as I say. First, it must be proven by the Crown that the accused knowingly supplied a substance; it must be then proved that the substance that she in fact supplied was a prohibited drug; and thirdly, in respect of this case, it must be proved that the amount of the prohibited drug she supplied was not less than a commercial quantity of that prohibited drug. 
        
       
       
        
        Let me deal with the second and third elements of those, first of all. It would seem that those particular elements are not in dispute in this case in that it has not been contested, as I see it, that the substance that was ultimately found both in Hai Le’s possession and also in the motor van that was stopped by police, there has been no issue that the substance was not in fact heroin. 
        
       
      
    30   Later on his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ... there has been no challenge that it was in excess of 250 grams, so it would seem to me that you would have to spend little time being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both it was a prohibited drug and that it was not less than a commercial quantity. As both counsel have indicated, this case is really about whether the accused knowingly supplied that heroin to any person. 
        
       
      
    31   It was submitted that the learned trial judge was obliged to instruct the jury that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the appellant knew of the presence of heroin but that she knew that the amount exceeded the commercial quantity, namely 250 grams. 
     
      
    32   Reference was made to Regina v Yee Kam Lau (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 2 December 1998). It was submitted that without such a full instruction there was a real possibility that the jury convicted the appellant on the basis that she knew of the existence of the heroin but not how much there was, especially since his Honour had told the jury that the element of quantity was not in dispute. 
     
      
    33   As appears from the summary of the evidence which I have set out in this judgment, the Crown relied upon the evidence of Nguyen. If the jury had a reasonable doubt that he was telling the truth, they would have had to acquit the appellant. That was the way counsel saw and conducted the case. 
     
      
    34   During his summing-up his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence really has been within a relatively short compass. You have heard both counsel say that the case, to the greatest extent at least, relies upon the two main persons, Mr Nguyen and what the accused says herself. That is pretty clear, the way the case has been conducted by both parties. 
        
       
      
    35   Later on his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown, as I see it, relies on, to prove its case, the accused’s knowledge that she supplied a prohibited drug, principally on the evidence of Mr Nguyen. 
        
       
      
    36   The defence case was that the appellant simply did not understand what was happening at the airport and during the journey to Park Street. She did not understand the conversation about money. She gave no directions. She was not a supplier of drugs. She admitted carrying the money to the man and returning with the heroin, but in the belief that the bag contained redeemed valuables or some such thing. 
     
      
    37   The defence could hardly have challenged the payment of $96,000 on behalf of Nguyen and of a similar sum on behalf of Le, or the handing over by the man of the amount of heroin Nguyen had ordered, namely about a kilogram. 
     
      
    38   Although there was some cross-examination of Nguyen about the precise amount of money handed over - by reference to a record of $90,000 in the transcript of an interview between Nguyen and the police - it was never suggested to him that he was not, on that occasion, paying a large amount of money for one kilogram of heroin, one half for himself and the other half for Le. The defence case was simply that Nguyen had decided falsely to implicate the appellant in order to obtain a sentence less than the one he deserved for his crime. 
     
      
    39   So, in the way the trial was conducted, the jury had no reason to differentiate between one part of Nguyen’s evidence and another. If they accepted his evidence generally, they must have accepted it as to the amount of money paid and the amount of heroin contracted for. 
     
      
    40   On the case conducted by the Crown and the defence, the appellant either knew that a kilogram of heroin was being sold for $192,000 or she did not know that heroin was being sold at all. That explains why his Honour directed the jury as he did and why, when invited to do so, defence counsel declined to ask for a redirection. 
     
      
    41   This was not a case like Yee Kam Lau, where the facts gave rise to a real issue whether the accused knew or was aware of the likelihood that what he possessed was a quantity of heroin which exceeded the commercial quantity. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    42   The next ground of appeal argued complained about what was said to be the failure by his Honour to instruct the jury that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of Nguyen. On his own evidence Nguyen was an accomplice, and his evidence had to be made the subject of a warning: Evidence Act s 165(1)(d). However, no particular form of words was required: subs (4). 
     
      
    43   His Honour said this to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        I give you this direction now, because it is a very important direction in this case. Not that the others are not important, but this is very important because of the very nature of this case and what the Crown relies upon to prove it, and I give it to you now because I will be making reference back to it when I am dealing with Mr Nguyen’s evidence. Mr Nguyen has admitted himself that he was involved in this crime. He pleaded guilty to it. Therefore, you might have very little problem determining that Mr Nguyen is an accomplice, that is, a party to this crime. He says so himself. 
        
       
       
        
        The law requires me to tell you people that his evidence could therefore be unreliable. You see, the reason the law requires me to tell you people this is not that the law thinks that you people do not have any commonsense, but the law is built up from a great history of experience. We sit in these courts every day of our lives, and we see cases over and over again. The law has been operating for centuries and the law recognises that certain types of evidence can be unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        You people coming from your everyday lives, we do not know if you have sat on a criminal trial before. Chances are that some of you have never sat on a criminal trial or all of you have not, so you come to this experience as a unique experience and you therefore might not readily recognise the dangers of a particular area of evidence that in fact can be unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        Therefore, there is an obligation upon judges to emphasise to juries when such occasions arise, and the law recognises that when there are joint parties in a crime that there may be very good reasons why one participant may say something that is in fact untrue to further his own interests, and he may do so to the real prejudice of some other person. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, that could apply in this particular case, because we know that Mr Nguyen was a participant in the trial and we know that Mr Nguyen has given evidence, and very damning evidence against the accused, from what he has said. Now, it may be that his evidence is unreliable. Ultimately it is a matter for you, the jury, to say whether you accept it or whether you reject it, having regard to all of the material in this case, but it is for me to tell you to carefully scrutinise his evidence and be conscious of the fact that it is, or could be unreliable. It is a matter for you. You see, there may be many and varied reasons why such a person would give untruthful evidence to further his own interests to perhaps encourage considerations from all sorts of areas. It may be to make life more comfortable in prison where he knows he must go or to look after the interests of some third person that we do not know about, so therefore you blame some other person. They are some examples as has been suggested in this case. To look after his own interests and his own interests being to get the best result he can for himself by way of a reduction of sentence that we in fact heard he got. So you can see that there might be many and varied reasons why such a person’s evidence could be unreliable. And I mention the last of those, because we do know that he got a discount on his own sentence because he assisted authorities and was willing to give evidence against the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, he, like anyone else, could probably easily manufacture evidence if he chose to do so. On the other hand, it is a matter for you, he may very well be telling the truth. It is again a matter for you. You have to make the ultimate decision. Let me say this to you, though. There is nothing particularly unusual about what Mr Nguyen has done. People often give evidence in these courts, and often they have been parties to crimes themselves, and often in giving evidence against somebody else they have got reductions of sentences. Our law makers have in fact told us there is a section of our law that says a judge has to take that into account on sentence, and give a person the advantage of it if he assisted the authorities in bringing other wrongdoers to justice and when you think about it, perhaps it is not an unjustifiable thing for law makers to do, because as Mr Crown put to you, there is a community interest to ensure that all wrongdoers are brought to justice. So if one wrongdoer is prepared to assist the authorities in bringing other wrongdoers to justice, it can be seen perhaps why our law makers have regarded that as being something that they should be, as it were, given credit for. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, it can bring about that very real unreliability that we speak about that they might be willing to tell lies about other people to get a benefit that they should not get because they are telling lies. What Mr Glennon says to you is that in this case that is exactly what has happened here. He has told lies about the accused so as to feather his own nest and get that couple of years reduction on the sentence that he got. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Crown says to you that is not the case. At all times when he was arrested he immediately made a clean breast of his own involvement in this case, and there has been no evidence before us, anyway, that he was saying anything about the accused at that stage, maybe he did, but it was not until later in the piece on the evidence in this case that we heard that he became aware that he would get a discount on his sentence, or some consideration, if he was prepared to come along and give evidence against the accused, and the Crown says to you that is exactly what happened. There has been no deal, as has been put, between the police and him. It is the Crown that is prosecuting this case, and the Crown has called in Mr Nguyen in evidence, and the Crown who has prosecuted Mr Nguyen, and who ensured through the police that the court became aware of his assistance, and thus he got his discount for that. 
        
       
       
        
        So ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will see that it is a very important direction I give you to scrutinise his evidence carefully, because it does fall into that area of the possibility of being unreliable, and you have to treat it with great caution. On the other hand, it does not mean for one moment that simply because he did give evidence against the accused, simply because he did get a discount on sentence, that you should disbelieve him. You look at what he says, together with all the other evidence, and look at it very carefully and ask yourself in the end result do you believe him, and that is your ultimate task. 
        
       
      
    44   Defence counsel did not ask for any further direction. It was submitted on appeal that his Honour failed to comply with the requirements of s 165(2)(c) Evidence Act in that he did not instruct the jury that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant in the absence of corroboration of Nguyen’s evidence. 
     
      
    45   In fact, s 165(2)(c) contains no reference to the danger of conviction or to the presence or absence of any need for corroboration. The subsection is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
         
         ... 
         
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
        
       
      
    46   Reference was made to s 164 which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        164 (1) It is not necessary that evidence on which a party relies be corroborated. 
         
         
         (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of a rule of law that requires corroboration with respect to the offence of perjury or a similar or related offence. 
         
         
         (3) Despite any rule, whether of law or practice, to the contrary, but subject to the other provisions of this Act, if there is a jury, it is not necessary that the judge:  
         
         (a) warn the jury that it is dangerous to act on uncorroborated evidence or give a warning to the same or similar effect, or  
         
         (b) give a direction relating to the absence of corroboration. 
        
       
      
    47   It was submitted that notwithstanding s 164(1) and (3)(a), it is necessary, when the Crown relies on evidence of an accomplice, to have a warning about the danger of convicting upon the uncorroborated evidence of that accomplice. I do not accept that submission. The Evidence Act has, in plain terms, removed the need for corroboration, at least in a case like the present, and the necessity for the trial judge routinely to warn the jury that it is dangerous to act on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness. 
     
      
    48   However, that does not mean that such a warning will never be appropriate. The general law requires a warning to be given, whenever it is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case. Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86. 
     
      
    49   There is no fixed body of rules requiring a warning in specific circumstances or in particular terminology. See the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 369, in which his Honour cited, with approval, the remarks of Lord Hailsham in Regina v Spencer [1987] AC 128 at 135. 
     
      
       
        
        ... modern cases ... are reluctant to insist on any magic formula or incantation, and stress instead the need that each summing-up should be tailor-made to suit the requirements of the individual case. 
        
       
      
    50   It was put on behalf of the appellant that the fact that Nguyen was an accomplice and that he had received a significant discount on his sentence in return for his anticipated evidence, that the trial pitted oath against oath, and that the appellant raised good character, led to the need to give the direction contended for. I do not agree. In my opinion the summing-up clearly warned the jury that the evidence could be unreliable and why, and that they should carefully scrutinise it, bearing in mind that it could be unreliable. 
     
      
    51   In my opinion the directions were appropriate to the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    52   There is a further reason why this ground of appeal should fail in my opinion. When the van was stopped and the occupants arrested Nguyen and the appellant were seated side by side in one of the rear seats. According to the evidence of Constable Thompson there was a bag at the appellant’s feet, containing blocks, which turned out, on analysis, to comprise more than the commercial quantity of heroin. 
     
      
    53   If his Honour had given the direction contended for, he would have been obliged to direct the jury’s attention to evidence capable of corroborating Nguyen’s evidence, including the finding of the heroin at the appellant’s feet, and the acknowledged facts that the appellant had taken the purchase money from Nguyen to the supplier and collected the heroin from him and brought it back into the presence of the man who ordered it. 
     
      
    54   In my opinion, any reasonable jury would have regarded that evidence as corroboration of the strongest kind and that may explain why defence counsel did not ask for such a direction. 
     
      
    55   I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground also and I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    56   GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    57   ABADEE J: I agree. 
     
      
    58   GROVE J: The order of the Court, therefore, is that the appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J 
      : 
       
      These are appeals against convictions following trials in the District Court before McGuire DCJ and juries.  
      
       
      
     2     
     Some background should be sketched. The appellant was formerly a priest in the now disbanded society of St Gerard Majella. At the relevant time the appellant was a Superior in one of the houses of the Order and also occupied the position of Master of Novices.  
      
       
      
     3     
     He came to trial as a result of complaints by four men and consequent upon his application, not opposed by the Crown separate trials were ordered which were heard following each other. The Court was informed that the juries in the cases of the first and third trials were discharged upon being unable to reach agreement and that the Director of Public Prosecutions has determined not to proceed further in respect of those complaints. The second trial proceeded upon an indictment for indecent assault upon a male contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act which pertinent to the time of the offence (between September and October 1981) carried a prescribed maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. Upon conviction the appellant was sentenced to a total term of two years divided into minimum and additional components of 18 months and 6 months respectively. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The fourth trial proceeded upon an indictment for a single count of an act of indecency by a male with another male contrary to s 81A of the Crimes Act which pertinent to the time of that offence (between April and September 1979) carried a prescribed maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. The appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 9 months to be served concurrently with the first 9 months of the minimum term imposed in respect of the conviction following the second trial. 
      
       
        
       The Second Trial 
        
       
      
     5     
     The complainant whom I will refer to as G had obtained his leaving certificate at the Newman High School which had some affiliation with the Society of St Gerard Majella. He left school and after engaging in employment for several years moved into a monastery as a boarder later commencing a postulancy prior to intended entry into the Order. He progressed to the novitiate. During this time he engaged in studies completing his Higher School Certificate at Liverpool TAFE and between 1983 and 1985 obtained a Diploma in Education through the Australian Catholic University. He taught school until he left the Order in 1987.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The incident giving rise to the indictment occurred when the complainant alleged he was studying for the Higher School Certificate and had been requested by the appellant (in what he thought was routine) to call upon him when he returned to his quarters. G knocked on the door and was told to return and when he did he was instructed to come in, leave the light off and take off his clothes except his underpants. He was further instructed to lie on the bed and sexual activity which it is not necessary to describe in detail took place. Evidence was admitted of some conduct of the appellant towards the complainant in the period prior to the subject of the indictment including kisses, massage and apparent attempts to touch the complainant’s genitals. 
      
       
      
     7     
     No complaint was made at the time of any of these occurrences. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The prosecution case was entirely dependent upon the testimony of G. A police officer was called who stated that when questioned on 28 April 1995 about the subject matters the appellant exercised his right to decline to be interviewed. In cross examination he was asked to confirm that he was aware that the appellant had no prior convictions.  
      
       
      
     9     
     The appellant did not give or call any evidence at the trial. 
      
       
      
     10     
     As I have concluded that one of the grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the appellant must be sustained with consequences to which I will later make reference, it will suffice to deal briefly with other grounds of appeal.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Grounds 1 and 2 were derived from media publicity surrounding the trials and specifically an article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald. The learned presiding judge rejected applications to adjourn the trials and I am unable to perceive any error in his exercise of discretion. He had given the jury firm directions about the need to determine issues upon the evidence in Court at the very outset of the trial and, it can be observed, in his final directions to the jury he was emphatic about the need to avoid contamination of jury deliberations by bias. The essence of the complaint by the appellant was, of course, that the publicity may have diverted jurors from their duty. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The third ground was not pressed. The fourth ground complained of the directions in the summing up concerning the evidence which had been admitted concerning the relationship between the appellant and the complainant. What was important was for his Honour to instruct the jury what use might be made of such evidence and following an application by trial counsel he gave a precise direction which included the instruction that a finding that the appellant “performed the other acts must not be used as proof of his guilt on the charge in the indictment. The Crown must still prove beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crime charged ……” I would not sustain this ground. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The fifth ground complained that the trial judge “failed to fully warn the jury of acting upon the complainant’s evidence.” As the terms of that ground imply, there was a warning and the challenge is to its sufficiency. Reference was made in the appellant’s submissions to the observation in  
     R v Murray 
      1987 11 NSWLR 12 that it is always open to a trial judge to direct that the evidence of a witness must be scrutinized with great care and to draw the jury’s attention to the features in the complainant’s evidence going to credibility. The trial judge had instructed the jury that the Crown case “stands or falls” upon the evidence of G. He added that if they were not persuaded that he was “an essentially reliable witness” the jury would acquit. No application was made by trial counsel for a direction in the terms now sought and Rule 4 applies. As noted this ground is essentially focussed upon alleged insufficiency. The ground is not made out. 
      
       
      
     14     
     Ground 6 was again a complaint concerning the alleged inadequacy of directions to the jury in this instance as to how they could treat the absence of complaint. This was a trial in which the totality of evidence amounted to the testimony of the complainant and the brief evidence of the police officer which I have earlier summarized. It is obvious from the terms of his Honour’s charge to the jury that submissions of trial counsel were centred upon the absence of complaint as a principal argument against acceptance of the Crown case. The arguments in this regard advanced on behalf of the appellant were forcefully summarized in that charge to the jury. Trial counsel made no application suggesting that what his Honour had said was inadequate. I would reject this ground. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The seventh ground complained that the trial judge failed to direct the jury as to the likely effects of delay upon the ability of the appellant to meet the charge. Once again this assertion has arisen in the context of examination of the trial by other than counsel who was conducting it on behalf of the appellant. It is readily understandable that no application for a direction in this regard would have been made bearing in mind the election of the appellant to remain silent. It is readily perceptible that counsel might regard it as more than faintly tactically unsound to seek a direction that delay hindered the opportunity and ability of the appellant to meet a charge which he had been unwilling to meet by pledging his oath in denial.  
      
       
      
     16     
     Ground 9 was expressed in the now precluded terms that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. Insofar as the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked in the terms of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act I am unpersuaded that the verdict was insupportable having regard to the evidence. Indeed this is the very sort of case in which it was highly advantageous for a tribunal of fact to hear the evidence and determine whether the oath of the complainant satisfied them beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. Ground 9A asserts that his Honour’s comment on the failure of the accused to give evidence, although conceded not to have breached the provisions of s 20(2) of the Evidence Act, contravened “the continuing common law restrictions upon the ambit of appropriate comment”. It is unnecessary to explore the detail of the argument advanced on this added ground. It suffices to say that in this case I am unpersuaded that his Honour said anything which could be categorized as giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
      
     17     
     I return however ground 8 which complained that the trial judge failed to direct the jury in relation to how the appellant’s good character could be taken into account. 
      
       
      
     18     
     As noted the police officer was expressly asked in cross examination to confirm that the appellant had no prior convictions. In a written submission to this Court the Crown included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is not a case where the appellant raised good character. All that was adduced by the defence was that the appellant had no convictions. That does not constitute the raising of character. The appellant gave no evidence of his own good character, nor did he call any witnesses as to character. It was not an appropriate case for his Honour to direct the jury as to the good character of the appellant.” 
         
        
       
      
     19     
     In response to inquiry from the bench, counsel for the Crown withdrew his contention that the appellant had not raised the issue of character. As was pointed out in exchange, and I affirm, the only issue at the trial to which the question addressed to the police officer relating to absence of conviction could be germane would be the raising of the asserted good character of the appellant.  
      
       
      
     20     
     His Honour gave no direction concerning the use that might be made of this evidence. He made reference to it in his summing up and it is convenient to set out the context in which the reminder was given. Towards the end of his summing up as his Honour was summarizing the case advanced by the appellant he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In short the accused, through his counsel, says that you would not accept the account of G. 
         
        
        
         
         I remind you that the accused has no prior convictions. 
         
        
        
         
         Any verdict of either guilty or not guilty is to be unanimous.” 
         
        
       
      
     21     
     His Honour then went on to elaborate the need for unanimity and to make reference to the absence of any jury input into possible penalty if there was a finding of guilty. 
      
       
      
     22     
     No application was made for any direction concerning the issue of character which had been raised. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Formerly s 412 of the Crimes Act 1900 provided that “evidence as to the character of the accused shall in all cases be received and dealt with as evidence on the question of guilt”. Provision is now made in s 110 of the Evidence Act 1995 in particular that the hearsay, opinion, tendency and credibility rules do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.  
      
       
      
     24     
     That statutory provision does not erode the established law that good character is relevant to the guilt of an accused:  
     R v Andrews 
      1982 2 NSWLR 116. In this case there was no evidence that the appellant when confronted about the charge made any response, specifically no evidence that he responded by denial. He exercised his right to silence. Hence it would be understandable that there would be an omission to direct a jury that evidence of good character was relevant to the credibility of the appellant in his or her denial of the charge:  
     R v Murphy 
      1985 4 NSWLR 42. However, unchallenged evidence of good character (even if limited to absence of prior conviction) was material to considering whether it was unlikely that the appellant committed the offence:  
     R v Stalder 
      1981 2 NSWLR 9. It is not incumbent upon a trial judge to give directions on the relevance of character by any fixed formula:  
     R v Gillard 
      CCA unreported 15 July 1991 but it is standard practice to inform juries along the lines that if they accept that the accused is a person of good character that fact may persuade the jury that the Crown evidence must be mistaken. Even in the absence of s 412 of the Crimes Act the common law would require a jury to take the character of the accused into account on the question of guilt. See Phipson on Evidence 12th Edn para 528 et seq. The present issue is whether the failure to give any such direction beyond the mere mention that the accused had no prior convictions resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Such a failure has been held to amount to miscarriage:  
     R v Groves 
      CCA unreported 20 June 1986.  
      
       
      
     25     
     Despite the absence of application by trial counsel, I conclude that the failure to bring to the jury’s attention the circumstance that the asserted good character of the appellant was germane to their deliberations on the issue of guilt amounted to miscarriage and this ground must be upheld. 
      
       
      
     26     
     The ground relates to what might be classified as a procedural defect and ordinarily the discretion of the Court should, in my opinion be exercised to order a new trial. However the appellant has been in custody since the imposition of sentence on 27 March 1998 and has therefore served just over 15 months of the 18 months minimum term. Pursuant to the order made at trial the appellant is to be released to parole on 26 September, that is to say, in less than three months. He has therefore served over five-sixths of the custodial element of the sentence passed upon him. I would not order a new trial cf.  
     R v Piazza 
      CCA unreported 16 June 1997. It should be recorded that that conclusion does not in any way imply that any view adverse to the credibility of the complainant has been formed or is being expressed. 
      
       
        
       Fourth Trial 
        
       
      
     27     
     The complainant whom I shall refer to as C joined the Society of St Gerard Majella as a postulant in March 1979 when he was aged 17. He had left school after completing Year 10 and had been employed for some time before seeking to enter the Order. The incident complained of occurred at a retreat house in Bowral where a retreat was being conducted for school girls and the complainant was allocated duties as a cook during the weekend. The appellant was present as a spiritual director and in his capacity as an ordained priest. 
      
       
      
     28     
     C claimed that the appellant tapped on his door in the evening and invited him to attend for the sacrament of reconciliation. Upon the complainant agreeing he was told to come to the appellant’s room in about five minutes time. When he arrived he found the appellant in his pyjamas but wearing his purple stole which was a traditional accoutrement for the sacrament. The complainant made professions of affection for him and later uncovered his penis and masturbated to ejaculation. The complainant ran away.  
      
       
      
     29     
     There was evidence admitted of other relationship between the parties in that the appellant was said to have made a crude remark of sexual significance to him at an earlier point of time and sent him flowers and cards professing love. The complainant reported what had happened to another member of the Order called Muir whose response was to invite him to read biblical passages. The complainant asked for money to go home and he returned to his mother to whom he made complaint that he had been sexually assaulted. Thereafter he returned on occasions to the monastery apparently at the behest of the Superior General of the Order, Father Sweeney. 
      
       
      
     30     
     At the trial the complainant gave evidence as did his mother and Mr Muir. Mr Muir testified that he did not have any recollection of the matters adverted to by the complainant although when shown a card upon which certain biblical references were endorsed (alleged by C to have been the advice received) he stated that whilst he did not recognize the writing on the card it was similar to his own.  
      
       
      
     31     
     The appellant gave sworn evidence denying the happening of the incident upon which the indictment was based as well as denying the comment asserted to have been made to C and further denying that he ever sent him cards or flowers.  
      
       
      
     32     
     Grounds 1 and 2 essentially repeat the matters complained of concerning the media attention to the trials of the appellant in terms similar to those raised in connection with the second trial. I see no miscarriage in his Honour’s discretion in ordering that the trial proceed. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Ground 3 asserted in substance that his Honour’s summing up was not balanced in relation to the respective cases of the Crown and the appellant. Balance is a matter of impression to be gained from the reading of the whole. Detailed submissions on behalf of the appellant repeat references made during the course of the summing up to matters inculpatory of the appellant but it should be observed that those references were made in summary of the Crown’s case and I am unpersuaded that the summing up was in any sense unfair so as to cause the jurisdiction of this Court to be invoked.  
      
       
      
     34     
     The fourth ground extracted an expression used by his Honour during the course of the summing up when he invited contemplation as to whether the complainant had “concocted a terrible lie” and it is argued that thus there was a reversal of the onus of proof. 
      
       
      
     35     
     Whether there is substance in this ground must be gauged from the tenor of the summing up as a whole. It is trite law that no trial is a contest between credibility of a complainant and an accused. Nevertheless it was not inappropriate for his Honour to observe that the Crown case “stands or falls” upon the reliability of the complainant. His Honour expressly told the jury that the trial was not some sort of contest between the complainant and the appellant.  
      
       
      
     36     
     Amongst other things his Honour specified to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is plainly the position that one of those two (referring to the complainant and the appellant) is a liar. It is for the Crown to establish that C is telling you the truth and it would follow, if that be the case, that the (appellant) is a liar. But he does not have to prove that he is telling you the truth. It is for the Crown to prove that C is giving a reliable account.” 
         
        
       
      
     37     
     Whilst, for my part, I would deem it preferable to refrain from any reference to the obvious situation that direct contradiction must mean that at least one of the proponents is lying, I am unpersuaded that in the context of the whole of his Honour’s summing up there was any significant unfairness. It is noteworthy that trial counsel made no observations in relation to this nor was any application made concerning the remark now complained of.  
      
       
      
     38     
     Ground 5 is couched in terms that the trial judge failed to adequately explain to the jury what was at issue in the trial with particular relationship to the evidence concerning complaint and how the jury may treat the evidence of absence of delay and complaint. 
      
       
      
     39     
     As is implicit in the terms of the ground this is a complaint of adequacy not of absence. This was a very short trial. The contest (in the sense of the existence of contradiction) was unmistakably plain and again it is significant that the trial counsel did not perceive that the matter now complained of required application for elaboration. I would not uphold this ground. 
      
       
      
     40     
     Ground 6 referred to the absence of direction to the jury as to the possible effect of the delay upon the ability of the appellant properly to meet the charge. It is acknowledged that such a direction is often appropriate where there has been long delay:  
       
      cf  
     R v Johnston 
      1998 45 NSWLR 362 but as Spigelman CJ observed in his review of authorities (@ p 375) whether or not there is need for any, and if so what, warning will depend upon the circumstances of the case. Whilst the written submissions on behalf of the appellant contain a series of suggestions as to how delay might have been inhibiting in the preparation of the appellant’s case, once again this is a matter that has been raised subsequent to and not at trial. The defence was conducted by experienced counsel and, indeed, this was the fourth of the series of trials being conducted. I am unable to perceive that the absence of reference to the matters now addressed was productive of miscarriage. I would apply rule 4. 
      
       
      
     41     
     The final ground is expressed in the terms that the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. The conclusion of the jury (who were able to see the appellant and the complainant) was reached in circumstances where they had a distinct advantage over this Court which can only examine transcript. It was of similar importance that the jury could make an assessment of the complainant’s mother and the witness Muir and determine whether any inconsistencies in description, timing or recollection were significant in coming to a conclusion upon the indictment. I am unpersuaded that the jury ought to have had a doubt about the guilt of the appellant.  
      
       
      
     42     
     The sentence imposed in respect of the conviction upon this indictment is now spent. In the light of my conclusion concerning the appeal against the conviction following the second trial I propose the following: 
      
       
      
     43     
     In respect of the second trial 
     : the appeal be allowed and the conviction and sentence quashed and in the exercise of the discretion of this Court no new trial ordered and therefore a verdict and judgment of acquittal on this indictment entered.  
      
       
      
     44     
     In respect of the fourth trial 
     : the appeal be dismissed and the conviction and sentence confirmed. 
      
       
      
     45     
     In the absence of any reason extraneous to these appeals for the detention of the appellant, he be ordered released forthwith.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The applicant appears for himself without any legal representation. 
      
     2     
     He arrived in Australia on 4 March 1998 aboard a flight which originated in Buenos Aires in Argentina. The applicant is a citizen of Colombia. Upon arrival in Australia a brief case he was carrying attracted the attention of the Customs Service and Australian Federal Police were called. A false bottom in his brief case was opened and found to contain white powder, later analysed to be cocaine with a total pure nett weight of 844.6 grams. Initially the applicant told police that he was hoping to migrate to Australia with his family and had brought the cocaine with the intention of selling it presumably to fund re-establishment of his family in this country. He was arrested and charged. Later he requested further interview with Federal Police and he asserted that he had brought the prohibited drug into the country at the request of a man named Fernando Lopez. Subsequent inquiries have not located this individual. 
      
       
      
     3     
     It should be commented that the trial Judge dealt with the applicant on the basis that he was a courier, that is to say the second version given to Federal Police, rather than as a principal acting on his own behalf. Whilst the learned sentencing Judge expressed some scepticism, which is entirely understandable, it follows that the applicant was dealt with on the basis that his participation in the offence was not as serious as it would have been had he been treated as a principal. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years. It should be commented also that that sentence is well within the range of anticipated sentences for those who act as couriers for the importation of drugs into this country. The sentencing Judge made reference to the matters which I have sketched and took into account matters advanced on behalf of the applicant who was represented at the sentencing proceedings. His Honour was clearly conscious of the applicant's claims of concern for his family, including concern arising out of asserted threats emanating from the as yet unlocated man Lopez. It is almost trite to observe that those who involve themselves in international drug trafficking must expect condign sentences when they are caught. 
      
       
      
     5     
     In response to the Registrar's directions the applicant has sent a short note setting out what he describes as written argument in support of appeal. Having regard to the applicant's handicaps with the English language no doubt he had some assistance in formulating this letter. The first two propositions assert that he was unaware of the prohibited drug in his suitcase and unaware that he was committing an offence. Those are not available assertions to be advanced in this application. In so far as by implication it is sought to go behind the plea of guilty, no material is advanced to this court entitling the applicant to such an order. The third matter raised in the correspondence is an acknowledgment that the applicant is aware that he is being punished for his crime. The inconsistency of that acknowledgment with the previous two grounds can be observed and he says that he is truly remorseful. He remarks he is feeling that life is difficult being separated from his wife and two daughters.  
      
       
      
     6     
     This morning he informed the court that in January this year there had been an earthquake in his home city and this is adding to his concern about his family. The expression of general concern related of course to a matter which was taken into account by the sentencing Judge and it is not a matter which would cause the invocation of the jurisdiction of this court. The happening of the earthquake was obviously an event which occurred subsequent to the sentencing proceedings in October last year. On the scant information before the court I would draw the inference that whilst the concern of the applicant is understandable his family would be in the same position as other residents of the city afflicted by that disaster. The circumstance does not give rise to the exercise of jurisdiction by this court. 
      
       
      
     7     
     It needs to be understood by the applicant that the jurisdiction of this court is founded upon error and it is not a court of general review. I made earlier reference to the remarks on sentence in the court below. Those remarks demonstrate no error in assessment or weighing of the circumstances, and certainly no error of law. In those circumstances this application cannot succeed. Given the length of the sentence it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal but its failure is, in my view, inevitable. 
      
       
      
     8     
     I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that appeal be dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONBADGERY-PARKER AJWednesday, 14 July 1999No: 70202/97 REGINA v Byron Edward SPENCER SENTENCE1    HIS HONOUR: Byron Edward Spencer was indicted before me in Sydney on 9 July upon two charges to each of which he pleaded guilty. The charges arose out of the following circumstances. On 25 June 1996 four men set out from a hotel in Yass in a car owned and driven by Gary Teale. The prisoner was one of the passengers. The others were brothers, Dean and Michael Privett. 
    2    The prisoner had come to Yass from Albury a few days earlier in the company of Michael Privett in order to attend a party. He had met Dean Privett only once about a year earlier, and he had had no previous association with the man Teale. 
    3    The excursion in the car was instigated by Dean Privett. I accept the prisoner's account of how he came to be involved. Dean Privett invited him to go with the others to steal some tools and some generators from one or more rural properties. There is no doubt that the prisoner was willing to engage in this criminal activity. I accept that he was somewhat intoxicated at the time, and probably to a degree disinhibited, but he was well aware of the criminal nature of what was proposed. He involved himself willingly, and I accept that the prospect of some easy money was what motivated him. He had been unemployed for over four years, a circumstance which does not excuse but does explain his willingness to engage in such criminal conduct.  
    4    The four men travelled first to a property known as Yass Plains in Dog Trap Road Yass. Entry to the property was blocked by a chain gate. They returned to Yass where Dean Privett obtained some bolt cutters, then went back to Yass Plains. The chain was cut and they drove in to a shed. 
    5    The prisoner took an active part with the others in collecting various tools, including some expensive power tools, and placing them in the boot of the car. They transported those items back to Yass where they were secreted in the backyard of premises occupied by Dean Privett. Again the prisoner took an active part in the unloading and concealment of the stolen goods. 
    6    In respect of that matter he was charged in the second count of the indictment, that on 25 June 1996 at Yass he did break and enter the workshop of Peter Walker situated at Yass Plains, Yass, and then in the said workshop did steal certain property, to wit, numerous tools, including one Makita drop saw, bench grinder, pop rivet gun, and other tools at the property of the said Peter Walker, in the said workshop then being. 
    7    The charge is laid under s112 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for fourteen years. 
    8    Again at the instigation of Dean Privett, the four men again drove out of Yass, on this occasion to a property at Gundaroo where Dr Peter Rowland was building a house, and where there were a couple of sheds, in one of which Rowland sometimes stayed overnight. 
    9    The intention, as made known to the prisoner by Dean Privett, was to steal one or more generators. Dean Privett mentioned that he knew that such items were to be found on those premises. During the journey to the Gundaroo district, the prisoner became aware that Dean Privett had with him a shotgun. He loaded a number of cartridges into it. 
    10    On arrival at a gate close to the sheds, Dean Privett told Teale to stay in the car. Then the Privett brothers and the prisoner alighted. They climbed over a fence and went to towards the sheds. At that stage the prisoner became aware that Dean Privett was carrying a gun. He asked, ""Why bring this along if you only want generators?"". Privett reassured him, ""Don't worry about it, it's just in case you know, if there's some dogs or something."" Dean and Michael Privett went towards one shed in which there was a light. The prisoner went to another shed and used a torch to look for the generator.  
    11    When the Privetts entered the shed, after one of them had kicked the door down, shots were fired. Dr Rowland was shot dead. 
    12    I refer to those matters at this stage only for the purpose of pointing out that the prisoner was not in any way involved in the death of Dr Rowland, and the fact that the killing occurred at the time and place where the prisoner was present with intent to steal is not a matter relevant to be considered in sentencing the prisoner for the offence for which he has now been charged.  
    13    In respect of this second matter, the prisoner was charged in the first count of the indictment that on 25 June 1996 at Gundaroo, whilst in company with Dean Privett and Michael Privett, did break and enter the dwelling house of Peter Browne Rowland situated at a property named Kingsgrove near Gundaroo via Yass with intent to commit a felony, to wit, stealing in circumstances of special aggravation.  
    14    The circumstances of special aggravation which the Crown alleges, and which the evidence clearly establishes, are in terms of the definition of s105A, that the alleged offender was armed with a dangerous weapon. 
    15    It is not the Crown case that the prisoner himself carried a weapon, but that he was knowingly part of a joint enterprise with others, one of whom was so armed. 
    16    The senior public defender who appeared for the prisoner properly conceded that that was sufficient to satisfy the definition of circumstances of special aggravation in s105A. 
    17    The charge is laid under s113(3) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty years. The heavy penalties prescribed by the legislature reflect the serious view which is taken of offences of this kind. Even in cases where no circumstances of aggravation exist, the prescribed maximum is fourteen years.  
    18    The availability of sentences of such magnitude reflects the vulnerability of property owners, and the economic and personal loss that the victims of such a crime sustain, and the sense of personal violation the victims may experience. All those factors may be regarded as present in the present case, and I am especially conscious of the vulnerability of those who live in remote, or relatively remote thinly settled rural areas. 
    19    Obviously the maximum penalty is to be reserved for cases far more serious than this one, but nevertheless the nature of the prisoner's crime is such as to lead the Court to consider a significant sentence of penal servitude.  
    20    But the sentencing process does not end with any evaluation of the objective gravity of the crime. The sentence ultimately that is to be imposed is required to reflect that of course, but not only that, regard must be had to a number of other factors. They include in this case the following. First, that the prisoner has pleaded guilty. The policy of the law expressed in s439 of the Crimes Act is to encourage pleas of guilty and to reward those who by pleading guilty make a contribution to easing the cost burden of the criminal justice system. The Act requires that a sentencing court take into account the plea of guilty, and authorises the court to reduce accordingly the sentence that would otherwise have been passed. The sentence reflects the common law and the principles to be applied are those of the common law stated in cases such as Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345. The extent of discount will vary according to whether the plea of guilty is no more than the recognition of the inevitability of conviction entered to take advantage of the section, or is a genuine manifestation of contrition . 
    21    In this case I am satisfied that the plea of guilty does represent contrition, and there is other evidence of that. The prisoner was interviewed by police officers on 30 June, 1996 after he voluntarily went to Yass Police Station for that purpose. It was made clear to him that the interview was for the purpose of a murder investigation. Indeed he was arrested for murder immediately upon his arrival and before the interview began. That circumstance explains, I think, the fact that he was not altogether forthcoming about some aspects of the event, but the fact is that he did make at that early stage a full disclosure of his own role in the two offences for which he now stands for sentence.  
    22    In February 1997 he was committed for trial on the charge of murder, and at that time he offered to be further interviewed with a view to giving evidence at the murder trial. That further interview took place on 1 May 1997, and he again made full disclosure of his own guilt. 
    23    It is the policy of the law expressed in s442B of the Crimes Act that offenders should be rewarded for giving assistance to the prosecuting authorities, and in particular giving information to the police about crimes in which they were involved, or about which otherwise they had knowledge. Many crimes would otherwise go unsolved or unpunished. 
    24    In the interview on 1 May 1997 the prisoner gave police a great deal of information about the events surrounding Dr Rowland's death, and he has since given a written undertaking, and before me an oral undertaking on oath to give evidence at the trial of Dean and Michael Privett.  
    25    The weight to be given to an offender's cooperation in disclosing information and giving evidence varies with the circumstances. The likely value of his cooperation in securing the conviction of a major offender is highly relevant. So too any personal consequence that the witness may have suffered or may suffer in the future. In this case I am satisfied that but for the cooperation of the prisoner, Dean Privett would not have been brought to trial. Indeed at committal he was discharged. Further I am satisfied that the prisoner holds genuine fears for his own safety by reason of his cooperation with police, and I accept the evidence of Detective Inspector O'Neill that such fears have a realistic foundation.  
    26    The prisoner, who was born on 22 September 1970, has no significant criminal record. He has one minor conviction for dishonesty about 1991, and some drink driving offences subsequently. They are not significant in the present sentencing exercise.  
    27    When the prisoner was admitted to bail in February 1997 a condition imposed was to the effect that he make diligent efforts to obtain employment. Until the time of his arrest he had, as I think I previously observed, been unemployed for over four years. The evidence shows that on his release from custody he went to live at his family home in Altona East in Victoria. He obtained employment on 14 May 1997 as a construction worker. The employing company has given him an excellent reference. He left that employ after a couple of years for less strenuous work, and became a leading hand cleaner in a major shopping mall; and that employment continues at the present time, and remains open to him indefinitely. Again his employer is full of praise of his honesty, his enthusiasm, his reliability, his competence and his efficiency. During 1998 the prisoner was married, and his wife is now seven months pregnant with their first child.  
    28    Those facts satisfy me that the prisoner is fully rehabilitated and will not again offend against the criminal law. 
    29    Mr Nicholson submitted that I should extend some measure of leniency in addition to what is attracted by the foregoing circumstances by reason of the fact that the prisoner was arrested for and charged with murder, and has had that matter hanging over his head since 30 June 1996. I am not persuaded that that is a relevant matter and I make no allowance for it. 
    30    The prisoner's offences were, as I have observed, such as to call for consideration of a custodial sentence. However, any sentence that could be imposed would not be of great duration given that the offences fall towards the lower end of the range of seriousness of offences of the kind, and given his evidently complete reformation since 1997. Any sentence which would now be imposed, and which would have the effect of returning him to custody would seriously threaten his rehabilitation, and it would necessarily be in any event a very short sentence by reason of the considerations to which I have referred as resulting from the application of s439 and s442B of the Crimes Act.  
    31    Ultimately, the objective of all sentencing is the protection of the community. Sometimes it is necessary to impose a sentence of physical detention to prevent reoffending, or to deter other offenders as well as the instant offender from similar criminal conduct. Where rehabilitation can be achieved, that also effectively protects the community. Where, as here, rehabilitation is evidently complete, the interests of the community will rarely be served by the imposition of a sentence that would disrupt that rehabilitation by returning the prisoner to custody thus damaging his family life and his employment prospects. Particularly so in the present case, whereas I have observed any sentence that I did impose would necessarily be a short one.  
    32    For those reasons I am convinced that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, the appropriate sentence is not one which would require the prisoner to return to custody at this stage. I say ""return to custody"" in recognition of the fact that from the time of his arrest on 30 June 1996 he was held in prison until 7 September 1996. There was a further period of about three weeks in custody early in the following year, so he has in fact served a total of rather more than three months.  
    33    I have considered the option of imposing upon him a sentence in the form of a community service order, such as was imposed on the man Gary Teale who came for sentence in the District Court at Wollongong. That is not, however, an available option in the present case because the prisoner lives and works in Victoria, and remarkably there do not exist reciprocal arrangements for the interstate enforcement of such an order.  
    34    That option being removed, I come to the conclusion that the prisoner should be dealt with in the following manner, and I impose the following sentence. In respect of the first count in the indictment, you are sentenced to penal servitude for a term of three months. That is a fixed term commencing on 30 June 1996, which would have expired on 29 September 1996.  
    35    The reason for imposing a fixed term, so far as it cannot be gathered from everything that I have said up to now relates to the fact that the prisoner is apparently rehabilitated, is not in need of supervision, and that there is therefore no reason to impose a period of parole. Furthermore, the sentence in respect of the next count adequately substitutes for an additional term.  
    36    In respect of the other count on the indictment, I record a conviction but defer passing sentence, and order the prisoner to enter into a recognisance, himself in the sum of $1,000, to be of good behaviour for the period of two years, and to come up for sentence if called upon to do so in the event of any breach within that period. I see no need for and make no order for supervision.

     REGINA v James Allan ROBINSON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    3   BARR J: This is a reference by the Attorney General under Pt 13A Crimes Act. On 18 August 1972 the appellant James Allan Robinson was convicted by a Sydney Quarter Sessions jury of assault while being armed with intent to rob and malicious wounding with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension. Judge Robson sentenced him to fourteen years’ penal servitude on the first count and eight years’ penal servitude on the second. The appellant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his convictions. His appeal was dismissed on 26 April 1973. 
     
      
    4   The appellant petitioned the Governor under the provisions of s 474B Crimes Act for a review of his convictions. A number of things may happen after such a petition has been considered. One of them is that the Attorney General may refer the whole case to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act, as has happened here, but only if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt or as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s 474C(1), (2). 
     
      
    5   Once this Court is invested with jurisdiction by such a reference, the issue whether the appeal should be upheld is solely for this Court, notwithstanding of the perceived doubt or question that led to the reference. Regina v Pederick, Court of Criminal Appeal 21 May 1997 unreported; Regina v Pohl, Court of Criminal Appeal 17 December 1993 unreported; Regina v Rendell, Court of Criminal Appeal 22 June 1994 unreported; Regina v O’Connor (1995) 80 A Crim R 214 at 222. 
     
      
    6   At about 12.15 am on 19 October 1971 two men entered the office of the University Motor Inn at Forest Lodge. The night porter, Mr George Ryan, was behind the reception desk. One of the men was armed with a knife and the other with a sawn-off rifle. Both had stockings over their heads. 
     
      
    7   The man with the rifle announced that it was a hold up. The one with the knife tried to open the till. Mr Ryan called for help, rousing the manager, Mr Brain, and the assistant manager, Mr Disley. The two attackers fled. The one with the firearm climbed over a fence and reached the street. Whilst the other was trying to climb the fence, Mr Disley grappled with him and was stabbed. Mr Brain fired a shot from a pistol and the man in the street also fired. The man with the knife, whose name was Darrell Burrell, fell from the fence and hurt himself as he escaped. 
     
      
    8   Burrell thought he had been shot. He was admitted to St Vincent’s Hospital and gave a false story explaining how the shooting had happened. In fact his injury was a broken leg. He was arrested. 
     
      
    9   The appellant was arrested in Melbourne on 9 February 1972 and was extradited to New South Wales. Detective Harding accompanied him back to Sydney on 12 February 1972. 
     
      
    10   The appellant and Burrell were jointly tried. The Crown asserted that the appellant was the man with the rifle. The case against him relied heavily upon identification evidence from Mr Ryan and evidence of admissions made to investigating police officers. 
     
      
    11   Mr Ryan said that both men had stockings over their faces, though they were not tightly drawn or tied. The men’s faces were quite visible through the stockings, which did not distort their features. He had them in view for three or four minutes. 
     
      
    12   The man he identified as Burrell was the taller of the two and fair. He held the knife. He had a slight twist to his nose which was not caused by the stocking and which he noticed when he later saw him in court. 
     
      
    13   The man he identified as the appellant was the man with the rifle. He had dark hair and eyes. He had a prominent nose and side levers. He had sharp features with tightly wrapped nostrils and a mouth which Mr Ryan described as rather cruel. 
     
      
    14   Mr Ryan identified both accused from a series of photographs shown to him by police officers on the day after the robbery. 
     
      
    15   In his remarks on sentence the trial judge said this about the evidence of identification - 
     
      
       
        
        There was a great deal of cross-examination and criticism of Mr Ryan because he said he identified these two persons the following day from photographs given to him. I am satisfied on the evidence before me that he chose these photographs in a manner that was fair to the accused, and that that identification was powerful evidence and the jury was entitled to accept it, and I am certain that the jury did accept it. 
        
       
      
    16   The evidence about admissions by the appellant was as follows. Detective Harding first saw him at Prahran police station, Melbourne on 11 February 1972. He introduced himself and read to the appellant the warrant he had for his arrest. He told him that he was going to apply for an order for the appellant’s extradition to Sydney. The appellant said that he understood. He continued - 
     
      
       
        
        It was a bad blue. It should never have reached the stage that it did or happen. 
        
       
      
    17   Detective Harding then cautioned him and the appellant responded - 
     
      
       
        
        I know that. I realise you would not be here for nothing. I came down here after you got Darrell and I was told the heat was on. 
        
       
      
    18   There was further conversation which it is not necessary to relate. 
     
      
    19   The two men boarded a plane to Sydney and sat side by side. The appellant made to speak further about the matter and Detective Harding cautioned him a second time. The appellant said - 
     
      
       
        
        Well, I didn’t mean to fire at anyone. I’m not that bad. The gun went off accidentally. I was shitting myself. 
        
       
      
    20   The appellant and Detective Harding were met at the airport by Detective Sergeant Kelly and Detective Potter. The appellant was taken to police premises in the City of Sydney and a formal interview was conducted. Detective Harding asked the questions and Detective Potter typed them and the appellant’s answers. According to the evidence of Detective Harding, the appellant agreed that the transcript correctly recorded the conversation. The following conversation then took place - 
     
      
       
        
        HARDING Will you sign it? 
         
        APPELLANT No, I don’t think I should. It reads dreadful. 
        
       
       
        
        HARDING What do you mean by that? 
         
        APPELLANT Well, I have dropped myself right in for the stick up. What is going to happen about the shooting? 
        
       
       
        
        HARDING You will be charged with shooting at Mr Disley with attempt to avoid lawful apprehension. 
         
        APPELLANT Well, in that case I will not sign it. 
        
       
       
        
        HARDING You are not suggesting this, that your reason for refusing to sign this document is that it is an incorrect record of our conversation? 
         
        APPELLANT No. 
        
       
      
    21   The record of interview contained substantial admissions as to the appellant’s participation in the hold up. Question and answer number 18 were as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Where did you go after the hold up? 
         
        After Darrell got to the hospital, I just went into smoke and then went to Melbourne. 
        
       
      
    22   After the interview was over, Detective Harding left the room and spoke to Detective Sergeant Kelly. He and Detective Sergeant Kelly returned to the room and according to them the following conversation took place - 
     
      
       
        
        KELLY I understand that Det Harding has told you that you need not say anything unless you wish and this still applies. Do you understand that? 
         
        APPELLANT Yes 
        
       
       
        
        KELLY I understand Detective Harding has just completed this record of interview with you 
         
        APPELLANT That’s right 
        
       
       
        
        KELLY Is it a true and accurate record of your conversation with him? 
         
        APPELLANT Yes 
        
       
       
        
        KELLY But I understand that you do not wish to sign it 
         
        APPELLANT That’s right 
        
       
       
        
        KELLY Would you care to give me your reason for not signing it 
         
        APPELLANT I have already told Mr Harding why 
        
       
      
    23   Further conversation followed. 
     
      
    24   The record of interview was received into evidence. 
     
      
    25   The appellant’s defence at trial was that Mr Ryan’s identification of him as the gunman was mistaken, that he had made no admissions to any police officer and that they had fabricated their evidence. He said that he was in Melbourne at the time of the attempted robbery. 
     
      
    26   It was proved at trial that the appellant had received a telegram in Melbourne during the morning of the day of the robbery. However, it would have been possible for anyone to fly from Sydney to Melbourne between the times of the robbery and the receipt of the telegram. 
     
      
    27   One of the attacks on the police evidence arose out of what they said the appellant had said about having gone to Melbourne. The appellant tendered evidence which tended to prove that he was resident in Melbourne at the time of the hold up. He told the jury that he went to Melbourne to reside on 25 September 1971 because he had recently been given a very lenient sentence for assault and feared that police, resentful of the fact, might work retribution upon him. He lived in premises in St Kilda and Richmond. 
     
      
    28   In order to show why the police might harbour such resentment he put his full criminal record before the jury. It included convictions for vagrancy, attempted stealing, breach of recognisance and several convictions for stealing. It showed that the appellant had been to gaol more than once and could make no strong claim to be honest. 
     
      
    29   The appellant called evidence from Mr Leitch, the proprietor of a boarding house, who had booked the appellant into a rented room in East Richmond on 4 October 1971. The appellant shared the room with another man. He left the room on 6 December 1971. Mr Leitch was not privy to the daily comings and goings of the appellant. 
     
      
    30   This attempt to raise a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant required the jury to conclude both that the appellant was genuinely resident in Melbourne at the relevant time and that the words attributed to him before and during the formal interview were consistent only with the appellant’s then residing in Sydney. 
     
      
    31   It is not difficult to understand why this evidence and this argument did not raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. 
     
      
    32   The issues raised and rejected in the first conviction appeal concerned the trial judge’s directions about identification, confessional and alibi evidence and the admission of the unsigned record of interview. 
     
      
    33   There is a single ground of appeal in the present appeal, namely that there is now available fresh evidence which shows that the conviction was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    34   The fresh evidence may be summarised as follows - 
     
      
       
      1. On 24 June 1975 Detective Potter accepted a bribe of $480 from some thieves. 
       
       
      2. In 1994 Arthur Stanley Smith, a notorious criminal, told the Independent Commission Against Corruption that in December 1984 he had paid $10,000 to Detective Harding to escape prosecution over a robbery. 
       
       
      3. In 1994 Detective Harding gave evidence at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Commissioner concluded that he had told lies to the Commission. 
       
       
      4. At a trial in 1985 Detective Harding and seven other police officers all gave evidence to the same effect about why a man had been treated in a certain way at a police station. In 1996, at the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, three of the officers said that that account was false. 
       
      
    35   The evidence about Detective Potter must be considered separately from that about Detective Harding because the discrediting of one officer will not affect the reliability of another. Regina v Kevin Craig Hastings, Court of Criminal Appeal 29 September 1997 unreported. 
     
      
    36   Our system of justice strives to achieve finality in the determination of issues between parties. Cases which have been decided and in which all available avenues of appeal have been exhausted will not be re-opened without good reason. However, the Court will re-open a concluded matter if it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Where fresh evidence is relied on it is for the appellant to establish that the absence at the trial of that evidence has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259. 
     
      
    37   The evidence must be material, credible and cogent. An appellate court will conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice only if it considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the evidence had been before them. Gallagher v The Queen; Mickelberg v The Queen. 
     
      
    38   Notwithstanding that way of putting the test, the evidence which may be considered on appeal is not restricted to matters which were in existence at the time of trial. It is well established that evidence of subsequent events is capable of being fresh (or new) evidence for these purposes. Gallagher v The Queen; Mickelberg v The Queen. Neither has any distinction been made in principle between evidence to be adduced in chief and evidence to be adduced in cross-examination. 
     
      
    39   A more appropriate way of putting the test for present purposes might be whether there is a significant possibility that a reasonable jury, having before them the evidence adduced at the trial together with the proposed evidence, would acquit the appellant. 
     
      
    40   Assuming, as is appropriate here, that the fresh evidence is not sufficient to satisfy the appellate court that the appellant is innocent or that there ought to be a reasonable doubt about his guilt, and subject to the exercise by the Court of its discretion, a successful appeal on this ground ordinarily results in a new trial. If the Court were to conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice in this appeal, however, a verdict of acquittal would have to be entered, because there could not be a fair trial in 1999 of a case in which the Crown depended in large measure on evidence of an identification made in 1971. The principal witness, Mr Ryan, was 57 years old at committal and nothing is now known of his history or his present circumstances. If he is still alive, he is 82 years of age. 
     
      
    41   The material upon which it was sought to rely was set out in considerable detail in statements and transcripts annexed to an affidavit sworn by David Phillip Barrow on 18 March 1999. 
     
      
    42   It is convenient to deal first with the evidence relating to Detective Harding. According to the report of the Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Mr Temby QC, Smith gave evidence about a robbery at an RSL Club on 28 December 1994 in which a doorman had been injured. The limited extract of transcript provided to the Court gives the impression that Smith considered himself and another well-known criminal, Graham John Henry, responsible. The next day Detective Harding telephoned Smith and told him that he had been foolish. He may also have told Smith that he was likely to be arrested. Smith asked what could be done, and a meeting was arranged at an hotel. Smith, Henry, Detective Harding and a police officer called Rogerson attended. Smith and Henry paid over $5,000 each and a further $2,000 was paid to Rogerson. Smith knew that the doorman would be paid and that Detective Harding would share the money with other police officers. 
     
      
    43   Detective Harding gave evidence and denied the meeting and the payment. 
     
      
    44   The Commissioner was not satisfied that Detective Harding had warned off Smith, though he found that he had involved himself in an investigation which was not his. The commissioner was not sure that Detective Harding was lying, but found that he had not behaved in the manner to which he had testified. The Commissioner found that with one exception none of the principal witnesses was credible. There was no finding that money had been paid as asserted by Smith. 
     
      
    45   The conversations between Detective Harding and the appellant, leading to the preparation of the unsigned record of interview, took place in February 1972. That was when Detective Harding concocted his evidence, if that is what happened. He gave his evidence at trial in August 1972. If he received a bribe from Smith and Henry, that happened at the end of 1984, more than twelve years later. 
     
      
    46   The questions which arise are to what extent if any a reasonable jury might make adverse findings about Detective Harding’s conduct at the end of 1984 and, if so, to what extent if any they might draw from them any inference adverse to his credibility in 1972. As I have already observed, there could not be another trial, but it is necessary to suppose what might happen if there were. 
     
      
    47   The credibility rule, made by s 102 Evidence Act 1995, would not permit evidence of the events of December 1984 to be adduced except by cross-examination of Detective Harding, and then only if it had substantial probative value: s 103(1). It is proper to assume, I think, that if Detective Harding were required to answer questions he would deny meeting Smith and receiving money as he did before the Independent Commission Against Corruption. In that event, the jury would be told that there was no evidence of the asserted bribe. In the result, they would be unable to be influenced by any such matters in forming a view about Detective Harding’s credibility at any time. 
     
      
    48   There is a further reason why this evidence lacks the necessary quality. This case is to be distinguished from those in which juries are asked to infer present dishonesty of witnesses from their past dishonesty. A jury may have no difficulty in concluding that a witness who has been dishonest in the past continues to be dishonest. Such a conclusion may be informed by the impression the jury receive from seeing and hearing the witness. 
     
      
    49   However, the problem of assessment becomes less easy when the jury is asked to infer dishonesty at an early time by reference to later events. No doubt a jury might readily infer that a witness they consider to have been dishonest on one day was dishonest the day before or the week before. But the further apart the two events are, the more tentative the conclusion must become, not least because the jury know nothing about intermediate events and are denied the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witness at the time of the asserted dishonesty. 
     
      
    50   It is common experience that honest people may become dishonest under the influence of external events. They may yield to sudden temptation. They may become influenced, especially when immature and impressionable, by the attitudes of those around them. Such things are known to have happened among members of the New South Wales Police Service. See generally chapter 2 - Policing and Corruption - of the final report of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, May 1997. It is significant to note the Commissioner’s conclusion (at 31) that very few if any police officers enter the job with corruption on their mind. 
     
      
    51   A number of appeals have come before this Court in recent times relying on fresh evidence which has emerged in the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service which, though unrelated to the issues raised at trial, has tended to impugn the credibility of police officers who gave significant evidence at the trial. They include Regina v Richard George Miller, 3 May 1996 unreported; Regina v Mustafa Marsala, 31 May 1996 unreported; Regina v Dean McLaren, 22 October 1996 unreported; Regina v Geza Vastag, 20 June 1997 unreported; Regina v John Leslie Baartman, 30 June 1997 unreported; Regina v Peter Franks, 11 December 1997 unreported and Regina v Christopher Hasenkamp, 24 February 1998 unreported. All these cases seem to refer, expressly or impliedly, to circumstances tending to affect the credibility of the relevant police officers at the time of the events giving rise to the trial. 
     
      
    52   However, the Court was informed that in Hasenkamp two of the incidents which tended to impugn the credibility of a police officer took place about three months after the trial. I think that that fact has no significance for the present appeal, however, because many instances of dishonest conduct were relied on as fresh evidence in that appeal and by implication most of them would have been contemporary with the events at trial. 
     
      
    53   It appears that there is no decided case in this Court in which the fresh evidence has related only to credibility and has been of events which happened significantly later than the time at which the credibility of the relevant witness fell to be examined. 
     
      
    54   In my opinion, even if the evidence were available I do not think that a trial judge would admit it. The desired cross-examination of Detective Harding would not be permitted because it would not be proper to use findings about the conduct of Detective Harding in 1984 to draw conclusions about his probity in 1972, so long was the time that elapsed between the two dates. The evidence about the events of 1984 would have no substantial probative value. 
     
      
    55   The next body of evidence relating to Detective Harding concerns his receipt on 8 April 1993 of a summons to give evidence at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. A fellow officer called Bowen received a similar summons at about the same time. Each summons contained a warning that the person to whom it was directed should not disclose any information about the summons which was likely to prejudice the investigation to which it related. Disclosure was permitted only to obtain legal advice and for certain other limited purposes. As the Commissioner observed at page 132 of his report, one object of the warning was to discourage a rehearsal of the evidence and to avoid any inference that any witness had colluded with others and concocted evidence to tally with their evidence. 
     
      
    56   Detective Harding and Mr Bowen were personal friends. After they received their summonses they spoke to each other in guarded terms on the telephone. Their conversations were lawfully listened to. Detective Harding admitted them but put an innocent explanation on them. 
     
      
    57   His evidence was not accepted and the Commissioner concluded as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        My conclusion is that Harding repeatedly lied to the Commission and that he did so deliberately … Harding shifted his position in a clever attempt to accommodate the undeniable. Even under pressure he has a fine functioning intelligence and his performance in the witness box really belies the proposition that significant events of recent happenings had simply dropped out of memory. 
        
       
      
    58   Detective Harding was subsequently charged with four offences under s 87 Independent Commission Against Corruption Act and four offences under s 330 Crimes Act. The former offence is committed by a person who at a hearing before the Commission gives evidence that is to the knowledge of the person false or misleading in a material particular. The latter offence is committed by any person who makes a false statement on oath which does not amount to perjury knowing it to be false or not believing it to be true. 
     
      
    59   Detective Harding was acquitted of all those charges. 
     
      
    60   If the proposed evidence were admissible the appellant would be entitled to introduce evidence of it in chief, as well as by cross-examining Detective Harding about it. See Evidence Act s 106(e). However, the events which took place at the Independent Commission Against Corruption occurred so long after the time at which Detective Harding’s credibility had to be considered that in my opinion evidence of them was not capable of bearing upon it. Such evidence would therefore lack the necessary substantial probative value and would be inadmissible. 
     
      
    61   The final body of evidence proposed in relation to Detective Harding concerns the arrest in June 1984 of a man who was codenamed YM1 in the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. After his arrest he was taken to Sutherland police station. The officers who seemed to have most to do with him were called Davidson and McGann. YM1 was not giving the police the co-operation they would have liked. He was withholding consent to be fingerprinted and refusing to tell them his real name. He was taken into a small room and seated upon a chair. He was handcuffed. An officer discharged three jets or sprays of mace into his face. One of the effects of the spray was to break down his resistance to being identified and to permitting his fingerprints to be taken. He asserted that the investigating detectives trumped up admissions or confessions, on the strength of which he was convicted of a series of offences and ordered to serve prison sentences. 
     
      
    62   Detective Harding was not directly concerned with the case but seems to have been present at the time of the events related by YM1. The common evidence of eight police officers who made statements or gave evidence about the matter in court was to the effect that it was necessary to use the spray on YM1 because he had escaped within the police station and had barricaded himself in a room. 
     
      
    63   At the Royal Commission three of the eight police officers said that the original account was false. The other five, including Detective Harding, continued to assert the truth of the original version. 
     
      
    64   It is asserted that Detective Harding gave false evidence at the trial in 1985 and false evidence at the Royal Commission in 1996. 
     
      
    65   If on a new trial the appellant were permitted to prove these matters, he could call evidence to prove that Detective Harding had knowingly or recklessly made a false representation whilst under an obligation to tell the truth: Evidence Act s 106(e). 
     
      
    66   However, I do not consider that any such matter would be capable to bearing upon the credibility of Detective Harding in 1972. The evidence would lack substantial probative value and would be inadmissible. 
     
      
    67   It follows from what I have said that in my opinion none of the proposed fresh evidence is capable of bearing upon the credibility of Detective Harding at any relevant time.  
     
      
    68   The material relating to the conduct of Detective Potter comprises a transcript of evidence taken before Mr Reason, Stipendiary Magistrate, on 9 September 1975 and of his Worship’s remarks in imposing sentence. As appears from that material, Detective Potter was on 24 June 1975 a plain clothes Detective Constable First Class. His work colleague and superior officer was Detective Senior Constable Hobson. Potter was attached to the Bankstown police station and Hobson had recently been transferred from that station to another posting. 
     
      
    69   One, Mr Wilson, was in charge of the security staff at David Jones Limited, Bankstown Square. During the afternoon of 24 June 1975 four thieves were in the Bankstown store of David Jones trying to steal goods and to obtain a cash refund on a stolen item, pretending that it had been purchased. A member of the staff realised what was happening and alerted Mr Wilson, who was in his office. Detectives Hobson and Potter, who were off duty at the time, were with him. 
     
      
    70   Realising that they had been found out, the thieves ran to a car and drove off. Detectives Hobson and Potter and Mr Wilson followed them in Detective Potter’s car. They caught up with them and a conversation took place between the seven people, as a result of which the thieves paid $480 to Detectives Hobson and Potter and Mr Wilson. The thieves were allowed to leave. They paid a further $120 on the following morning, though Detective Potter was not present on that occasion. 
     
      
    71   Detective Potter was then 27 years old and had been a police officer for almost eight years. He had an excellent departmental record. This was his only offence. The learned magistrate found that this was an isolated incident in which he gave way to temptation that suddenly presented itself. 
     
      
    72   The time which elapsed between the investigation and these events - about three years - is much less than in the complaints about Detective Harding. Even so, it 1`is significant in my opinion, especially where the evidence if adduced would show that Detective Potter was in 1975, as he had been for the whole of his police career, a man of excellent character who succumbed to a sudden and unsought temptation in the presence of a senior officer. 
     
      
    73   I do not think that a jury could properly draw any conclusion from that evidence about the credibility74   of Detective Potter in 1972. 
     
      
    75   In my opinion the proposed evidence lacks the materiality and cogency necessary to justify this Court in setting aside the convictions. I would dismiss the appeal.

      JUDGMENT (Re Police Academy) [No 2] 
       
      
     
     
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The Crown has foreshadowed that it will rely upon the participation by the accused, Mr Patsalis, in the recruitment programme of the Police Academy. It intends to call Sgt Gorman, an officer responsible for the records of the Academy. 
     
      
    2   The records reveal that, between 28 January 1990 and 14 March 1990, Mr Patsalis was enrolled as a student at the Academy at Goulburn. He left the Academy, however, before the completion of Phase 1 of the course. 
     
      
    3   Mr Patsalis re-enrolled at the Academy on 28 April 1991. He completed an eight week residential course (Phase 1), and a four week field work course (Phase 2). He then began a further residential course (Phase 3). The course was scheduled to last fourteen weeks. Upon completion, students were to be sworn in as probationary constables. However, less than two weeks before the completion date, Mr Patsalis left the Academy. 
     
      
    4   Sgt Gorman, by reference to the records, is able to describe the instruction given to Mr Patsalis during his time at the Academy. The courses included Police Practice, Patrol and Investigation. 
     
      
    5   The Crown suggests that, having had such training, Mr Patsalis would have been aware of the steps that could be taken to conceal the crime. Gloves were purchased before the murder. The Crown invites the inference that this was done to avoid fingerprints. The vehicle in which Mr Ludwig was stabbed was destroyed by fire. The knife which had been used to stab Mr Ludwig was left within the cabin of the truck, as were petrol tins used to set the vehicle alight. These items were destroyed or damaged, again eradicating fingerprints. 
     
      
    6   Objection is taken on behalf of Mr Patsalis. It is suggested the evidence is irrelevant. It is also prejudicial. Indeed, it is a matter of some sensitivity. Mr Patsalis, part way through his course, was charged with a criminal offence. The matter was brought before the Local Court. The charge was dismissed. Mr Patsalis was then allowed to resume the course. However, before completing Phase 3, he was again subject to further allegations. A female police cadet apparently made the allegations. Mr Patsalis was then dismissed from the Academy, without charges having been laid. 
     
      
    7   I believe the relevance of the evidence is slight. Any adult, and certainly one who has watched television, would know that, from the viewpoint of someone who had engaged in crime, gloves were desirable to avoid fingerprints, as was the destruction of evidence. Tuition at the Police Academy would hardly be necessary to impart that knowledge. 
     
      
    8   I believe there is some danger of unfair prejudice to Mr Patsalis, were the evidence led. The jury may wonder why he left the Academy when he had almost completed his course. 
     
      
    9   I therefore believe that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Under s137 Evidence Act 1995, I refuse the application by the Crown to adduce such evidence.

     IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALES CRIMINAL DIVISIONBELL JFriday, 23 July 199970088/97 - REGINA v Susan Maria HALL70214/97 - REGINA v Colin George HANSLOWSENTENCE1    HER HONOUR: On 29 March 1999 Susan Maria Hall and Colin George Hanslow appeared before me together with a co-accused, Colin David Simpson. On that occasion, Susan Maria Hall pleaded guilty to one count on indictment charging her with the manslaughter of Gary Henderson on a date between 19 August and 26 August 1996. Colin David Simpson pleaded guilty to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Gary Henderson on or about 19 August 1996. Colin George Hanslow was not represented on that occasion and I stood his matter over, without taking a plea, to enable him to obtain a grant of legal aid. 2    The proceedings against Hall and Simpson were stood over for submissions on sentence. On 4 June 1999 I sentenced Colin David Simpson to a term of twelve months penal servitude comprising a minimum term of eight months and an additional term of four months. It should be noted that this sentence was expressed to take into account the circumstance that Mr Simpson had already served, prior to his release on bail, a period of two years and twenty-six days custody solely referable to the commission of the subject offence. 3    On 27 May 1999 when the matters of Hall and Simpson were listed before me for submissions on sentence Colin George Hanslow was arraigned on an indictment which charged him with the manslaughter of Gary Henderson and with being an accessory after the fact to the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Gary Henderson by Colin Simpson. He pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter count and guilty to the accessory count. Both matters were stood over to 16 July. It was anticipated that the Director of Public Prosecutions would give consideration in the interim as to whether it was proposed to proceed on the manslaughter count. In the event, I was informed on 16 July, that the Crown did not propose to proceed with respect to that matter. 4    The body of the deceased, Gary Henderson, was found on the afternoon of 28 August 1996 lying on a mud bank adjacent to the water’s edge near the Silverwater boat ramp at Lansvale. The deceased was a single man aged about 35 years. He suffered from cerebral palsy. Both his left arm and left leg were wasted. Additionally it appears that he was intellectually disabled. He was a slightly built individual. Dr Ellis, pathologist, examined the body at the site and subsequently conducted a post mortem. The doctor concluded that death was caused as the result of head, chest and abdominal injury, compression of the neck, probable immersion/drowning.5    The police investigations revealed that the deceased had been living in a caravan at the Lansvale Caravan Park with Susan Hall and her de facto partner, Colin Hanslow. Colin Simpson was on friendly terms with both Hall and Hanslow and on occasions he visited them at the caravan park. All three suffered to some degree from intellectual handicap. 6    The caravan appears to have been rented by Susan Hall and Colin Hanslow. The deceased came to stay with them some weeks prior to his death. He had given Ms Hall his bank “Handycard”. It appears that the proceeds of his pension were withdrawn from his account by Ms Hall who used the funds for the purchase of food and other necessities. In this sense Ms Hall assumed some responsibility for the care of the deceased. 7    On or about 19 August 1996 the prisoner, Colin Simpson, inflicted a severe beating on the deceased. This occurred in the caravan. From that time on the evidence suggests that the deceased did not leave the caravan prior to the evening of 26 August when he was transported from there to the vicinity of the boat ramp. At that time the likelihood is that he was dead. The latter conclusion cannot be assumed with confidence since Dr Ellis was not able to exclude drowning as a cause of death. 8    In the period preceding the assault upon the deceased it would seem there had been some tensions in the caravan. The deceased had difficulty in attending to matters of personal hygiene and this became a source of some frustration to Ms Hall and Mr Hanslow. It also appears that the deceased was believed to have given out Ms Hall and Mr Hanslow’s silent telephone number to some unnamed person or persons. Finally there was a suggestion that the deceased was a child molester (there is no evidence to suggest this was the case). A combination of these matters appears to have led Colin Simpson to embark on his assault on the deceased. 9    There is little evidence as to what happened in the period of about a week following that assault prior to the deceased’s death. 10    On the evening of 26 August Susan Hall and Colin Hanslow were observed carrying the body of the deceased from the caravan and placing it in the rear of their panel van. From there the body was transported to the vicinity of the Silverwater boat ramp. 11    The basis upon which the Crown put its case against Susan Hall, and upon which the plea was entered, was that of manslaughter by omission. It is common ground that in the period following the assault upon the deceased by Colin Simpson, Susan Hall ought to have obtained medical assistance for him and that she failed so to do. The Crown case against Colin Hanslow depends wholly upon his actions in assisting in the removal of the deceased from the caravan and placing his body near the Silverwater boat ramp.12    I will deal firstly with the prisoner Susan Hall. On 27 May 1999 when I heard submissions on sentence with respect to both Ms Hall and Colin Simpson, a set of agreed facts was tendered and became Exhibit Q in the proceedings. On that occasion a submission was advanced on the prisoner’s behalf that her culpability with respect to the failure to obtain medical assistance needed to be evaluated in the light of her intellectual handicap. I subsequently sought further submissions from both the Crown and on behalf of the prisoner as to the basis upon which the plea had been entered. The agreed facts, while setting out quite a deal of background material, did not, in terms, identify the facts relied upon as establishing either the legal duty to which it was said Susan Hall was subject nor the particulars of breach of that duty in terms of the failure to provide assistance. 13    It is plain that at common law a person does not incur criminal liability in respect of his or her failure to take action to prevent the occurrence of harm to another: R v Taktak (1988) 34 A Crim R 334. Before a person may be convicted of manslaughter by omission it is necessary to identify a legally recognised duty to act to which the accused was subject. One recognised duty is that of a person who voluntarily assumes the care of another who, by reason of age or incapacity, is unable to care for him or herself. The failure to provide medical assistance and/or food to that person may expose the carer to liability for manslaughter. This is the basis upon which the case against Ms Hall is put. The Crown points to Ms Hall’s acknowledgment, in a statement that she made to police, that she was aware that Gary Henderson suffered from cerebral palsy. Reliance is also placed on the financial arrangements between the deceased and the prisoner involving her assuming the custody of his Handycard and purchasing food and other necessities on his behalf. The Crown points to admissions by Hall as to her knowledge of the infliction of injuries upon the deceased by Simpson during the course of the assault on 19 August. There is evidence from Dr Ellis that the deceased had bed sores. The Crown does not suggest, having regard to Ms Hall’s intellectual limitations, that the appearance of bed sores should have alerted her to the need to turn the deceased in the bed. Rather, the Crown points to the evidence as to the bed sores as showing that in the week following the assault by Colin Simpson the deceased was immobile in bed. Such a view receives support from the evidence of the witness, Vanessa Jett, who called to the caravan on an occasion after the assault. She observed that Gary Henderson was lying inert on his bunk. She spoke with him and observed that he was bruised. 14    Mr Rumore who appeared on behalf of Ms Hall on the last occasion conceded that it was open to me to find that, in the days following the assault by Colin Simpson, the deceased was immobile. He accepted, as must flow from the plea, that despite her intellectual deficit Ms Hall had the capacity and did know that Gary Henderson’s injuries were such that he required medical attention. It is upon this basis that I approach the matter of sentence in the case of the prisoner Susan Hall.15    I have the benefit of a helpful and detailed report by G.D. Fathers, psychologist, who assessed Ms Hall shortly before these proceedings. That report describes her background. The prisoner is an unemployed 37 year old woman in receipt of a disability support pension. She has been a recipient of such a pension since about 1978. Both Ms Hall’s parents are deceased. She gave Mr Fathers an account of growing up in a home characterised by frequent violent episodes by her father. She was aged about 6 or 7 when he died. Her mother died in 1978 when she was about 17. 16    It appears that prior to her mother’s death Ms Hall had been made a State Ward. She had had frequent contact with the Department of Youth and Community Services up until the age of about 21 years. More recently, she appears to have had contact with officers of the Department of Community Services on occasions, although the reasons for that were not clear. 17    The prisoner’s schooling was limited. She attended “Mater Dei” in Camden which catered for the intellectually handicapped and learning disabled. Most of the focus of activities at “Mater Dei” appears to have been of a diversionary nature with an emphasis on practical skills such as craft work, social interaction and the development of personal routine. After leaving “Mater Dei” she lived for a time at a place called “Brushfarm” at Eastwood. Mr Fathers describes this as an institution for people with intellectual impairment and pervasive developmental disorders. The prisoner appears to have left Brushfarm when aged about 17. From there she went to live in a hostel in Wollongong where she remained for several years. That hostel also served as a sheltered workshop and training centre. 18    When she was aged about 20, the prisoner moved to Sydney. Some time following that move she met her de facto husband, Colin Hanslow. She appears to have been in a relationship with Mr Hanslow for most of her adult life. She has no work history apart from the time spent in work preparation centres or sheltered workshops. Mr Fathers summarises the position in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Hall presents as intellectually impaired and therefore not fully able to think and reason. She has a history of living in personally and socially impoverished circumstances, supported by pension assistance. While functional in a personal and social sense, Ms Hall can only manage a limited routine and does need assistance and re-assurance in this. She has no work history and no work task skill set. Her education was very limited and interrupted by her intellectual impairment and other learning disability, her need for institutional care due to family dysfunction and neglect and Ms Hall’s sometimes difficult behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    19    I have also been supplied with a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Lucire. Dr Lucire notes that Ms Hall “is a mentally retarded person and has been so from birth”. She goes on to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “The intelligence tests show a high degree of scatter so there is a lack of evenness in her functioning. Some of the more subtle mental capabilities might be entirely absent.” 
        
       
       
      Dr Lucire also expressed the following opinion: 
       
        
        “It is apparent to me that she knows what has happened is wrong. She now knows that she should have done something to stop it. However it is not possible to know exactly what went through her mind at the time except from her actions.” 
        
       
      
    20    I note this observation since it might be thought to not sit well with the prisoner’s plea. As I have already noted, I stood this matter over to enable the basis of the plea to be clarified and I am satisfied that notwithstanding her limitations the prisoner had assumed responsibility for the care of the deceased and that she failed to obtain assistance when she knew she ought to have done so. In this regard I take into account the contents of the prisoner’s ERISP. 21    On behalf of the prisoner it has been submitted that I might impose a non-custodial sentence. It is put that this unusual course is open having regard to the circumstance that this is a case of manslaughter by omission where the prisoner’s culpability is mitigated by intellectual impairment. I should note that the Crown submitted that in the circumstances of this case a non-custodial sentence was within the range of the proper exercise of my sentencing discretion.22    I am mindful of the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MacDonald (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). In that case the court emphasised the denunciatory role of sentencing in the context of manslaughter. After noting that manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life the court observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system.” 
        
       
      
    23    This is a case where I consider that the prisoner’s intellectual limitations do operate to significantly mitigate her culpability. This leads me to give less weight to considerations of general deterrence than might otherwise be appropriate: R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Anderson [1981] VR 155; R v Letteri (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 March 1992); and R v Wright (unreported, NSWCCA, 28 February 1997).24    I accept that the prisoner pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. This is taken to reflect a degree of contrition. There is nothing to suggest contrition going beyond this but I accept that flows from her intellectual limitations. 25    The prisoner’s criminal record is not an extensive one. It appears that in October of 1981 she was convicted before the Central Court of Petty Sessions of offences of forge, utter and stealing and placed on a recognisance. The only other matter is an entry in February of 1989 when she was convicted before the Katoomba Local Court on a charge of malicious damage and again placed on a recognisance. I do not consider the criminal record stands in the way of extending some leniency to this prisoner. 26    Following her arrest, Ms Hall was in custody for a period of about two months prior to her release on bail. She has been at liberty on bail for a period of almost three years. During that time she has reported daily to police. At times she has been subject to residential requirements as a condition of bail. Most recently she was subject to a condition that she reside at “Samaritan House” an institution operated by the Salvation Army. Captain McGrath gave evidence on 26 May that Ms Hall had been compliant with the house curfew and other of the rules of that establishment. Subsequently, there was an unfortunate development which was not the fault of the prisoner. On 3rd June, Captain McGrath attended court together with the prisoner and other residents of “Samaritan House”. On that occasion, Colin Simpson was sentenced. For the first time Captain McGrath and the other residents of the house became aware of the unpleasant nature of the assault committed by Simpson on the deceased. It appears that after this the residents complained to Captain McGrath that they did not wish to be further associated with the prisoner. In those circumstances, Captain McGrath asked Ms Hall to leave. Major Harmer, the Salvation Army Court Chaplain, contacted Ms Hall’s solicitor who in turn drew the matter to the attention of the court. Major Harmer used his best endeavours to find alternative accommodation for the prisoner. The only accommodation that he was able to arrange was at the Sydney Central Hotel. The prisoner’s bail was varied to permit her to reside at that establishment. When the matter was before me on the last occasion I was advised that the prisoner did not intend to remain resident at the Sydney Central Hotel. Her sole income is the disability pension and the hotel was too costly. The matter was stood over with the prisoner’s bail continued subject to her accepting the reasonable direction of a representative of the St Vincent de Paul Society who indicated a willingness to assist with her care in the interim. 27    I have determined that this case falls into the exceptional category of cases where a non-custodial sentence is appropriate in respect of a conviction for manslaughter. This is not a case where the deceased’s death was brought about by the deliberate act of the prisoner. Her failure to obtain medical assistance was a continuing one and callous however that must be evaluated in the context of her level of intellectual functioning.28    I note that Dr Lucire observed in the course of her report that this prisoner’s capacity to do community service is limited. I have little difficulty in accepting that to be the case. This was not a case where either the defence or the Crown submitted I should give consideration to alternative sentencing options such as community service or periodic detention. It was for this reason that no pre-sentence report was sought. 29    In all the circumstances I consider that an appropriate sentence is a lengthy recognisance conditioned upon acceptance of the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The prisoner does appear capable of complying with whatever reporting conditions that Service deems appropriate. 30    Susan Maria Hall, you are convicted of the manslaughter of Gary Henderson. I defer passing sentence upon you and order your release upon you entering into a recognisance without surety in the amount of $300 to be of good behaviour for a period of five years and to come up for sentence if called upon. It is a condition of this recognisance that you accept the supervision and direction of the Probation and Parole Service. You are to report to the Sydney office of the Probation and Parole Service within 72 hours of your release on this recognisance.31    I turn now to the case of Colin George Hanslow. Mr Hanslow pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to an offence of being an accessory after the fact to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Gary Henderson. The maximum penalty in respect of this offence is one of five years penal servitude. I take into account not only Mr Hanslow’s plea of guilty at the first opportunity but also the circumstance that he entered that plea at a time when the Crown had not determined whether to proceed in relation to the more serious offence of manslaughter. I view the plea as evidencing a real degree of contrition having regard to that circumstance.32    A report from Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, was tendered on the prisoner Colin Hanslow’s behalf. I have found that report most helpful.33    Mr Hanslow, in contrast to his co-accused Colin Simpson and Susan Hall, is not described as suffering from any intellectual deficit. However, I do note that Dr Westmore describes him in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “His speech was slow and I gained the impression that he was of dull intelligence.”  
        
       
      
    34    He is a man of 43 years. He has been engaged in a long-term relationship with his co-accused, Susan Hall. Mr Hanslow described an unhappy childhood associated with periods of time spent in institutions. He has a quite lengthy criminal history commencing when he was aged only ten years. He told Dr Westmore that he had spent time in juvenile facilities in Mittagong, Dharruk and Mt Penang. His schooling was limited. The criminal record reflects his account of a disturbed and unhappy childhood; while still a juvenile there are entries for being under the influence of alcohol on railway property and vagrancy.35    The prisoner’s criminal record continued in his adult life and includes convictions for offences of dishonesty. Most significantly in October 1979 he was charged with an offence of ‘conspiracy to commit armed robbery’ for which he was later convicted by the District Court at Parramatta and sentenced to a term of three years penal servitude with a non parole period of twelve months. The record does not assist the prisoner however I do note that since his release from custody in 1982, following a conviction for the theft of a motor vehicle, his pattern of offending behaviour declined significantly. This period of reduced criminal offending appears to correspond with the formation of his relationship with his co-accused, Susan Hall. 36    I note that this prisoner served twelve months and twenty nine days in custody on remand prior to his release on bail with respect to this matter. Following his release it was a condition of his bail that he report three times weekly to the officer in charge of Mount Druitt Police Station. He has done this without fail for the past two years.37    Mr Giddy who appears for Mr Hanslow has drawn attention to Dr Westmore’s opinion that Mr Hanslow may well have been a somewhat passive person in his relationship with Susan Hall and that he may have been emotionally overwhelmed by Susan Hall and Colin Simpson in combination. Mr Giddy notes, by reference to the evidence given by Raymond Neaves at committal and the observations of the Kanizay family made on the evening of 26 August 1996, that the prisoner presented as a quiet and passive individual somewhat under the sway of his de facto partner. I accept that to be the case. 38    Mr Giddy also places emphasis on the evidence of Raymond Neaves that during Simpson’s assault on the deceased the prisoner called out for him to stop it on more than one occasion. When Vanessa Jett called to the caravan she saw the prisoner give the deceased a cigarette when asked to do so but that he was unwilling to give further cigarettes in the presence of Colin Simpson and Susan Hall. 39    I accept that the prisoner ineffectually sought to have Colin Simpson break off the assault. I also accept that he showed some kindness to the deceased notwithstanding the social pressures on him, having regard to the peculiar dynamics of the group, not to do so. 40    In the light of Mr Hanslow’s plea, and having regard to the circumstance that he has spent over twelve months in custody in relation to this matter and accepting as I do that he endeavoured, at least verbally, to have Colin Simpson desist from his attack on the deceased, I am of the view that this is an appropriate case in which I should impose a non-custodial penalty. 41    I note that Dr Westmore is of the opinion that Mr Hanslow would benefit from psychological counselling which might assist him in understanding the role that his passivity played in the subject events. I propose releasing the prisoner upon recognisance conditioned that he accept the supervision and direction of the Probation and Parole Service. The question of counselling can be addressed by that Service if it is considered appropriate. 42    Colin George Hanslow, you are convicted of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Gary Henderson between 19 August 1996 and 26 August 1996.

     1    
     THE COURT:  
     On 24 December 1998 after a trial conducted in the Supreme Court before Wood CJ at CL and a jury Richard Adam was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on David Carty, an off-duty police officer, on 18 April 1997. On 22 February 1999 Wood CJ at CL sentenced Richard Adam to a sentence of penal servitude for two years eight months, consisting of a minimum term of two years commencing on 24 December 1998 and an additional term of eight months. After being arrested on 19 July 1997, Richard Adam had been released on bail on 21 July 1997 and had remained at liberty until the jury returned its verdict of guilty. Richard Adam (who we will henceforth refer to as “the appellant”) appealed against the conviction and sentence imposed by Wood CJ at CL. The Director of Public Prosecutions brought a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on the appellant. 
      
       
      
     2    
     At the trial the appellant had been indicted on charges of murdering David Carty and of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on David Carty with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The jury found the appellant not guilty of these charges and also declined to find the appellant guilty of the manslaughter of David Carty. 
      
       
      
     3    
     The appellant stood trial with a co-accused, his brother Gilbert Adam. The jury found Gilbert Adam guilty of the murder of David Carty. Wood CJ at CL sentenced Gilbert Adam to a sentence of penal servitude of twenty-eight years, consisting of a minimum term of twenty-one years commencing on 17 July 1997 and an additional term of seven years. Gilbert Adam had been continuously in custody since being arrested on 17 July 1997. Gilbert Adam appealed against his conviction and sentence and the appeals of the appellant and Gilbert Adam were listed for hearing together by the same Bench of this Court. The Court heard the appeals involving Richard Adam first, reserving its decision, and then heard the appeals involving Gilbert Adam. 
      
       
        
       Crown Case 
        
       
      
     4    
     The basic facts according to the Crown case against the appellant can be briefly outlined as follows. 
      
       
      
     5    
     At about midnight on 17 April 1997 a number of police officers, after finishing their shifts, went to the Cambridge Tavern in Fairfield for some drinks. At about the same time a group of young men of Assyrian origin, who included some of the witnesses called by the Crown at the trial, also went to the Tavern. A little later, a separate group of somewhat older Assyrian men, including the appellant and Gilbert Adam, arrived at the Tavern.  
      
       
      
     6    
     At about 2.15 am the last police officers remaining at the Tavern, who included David Carty and a female officer Michelle Auld, left the bar in which they had been drinking and went to their vehicles, which were parked in the car park of the Tavern. Several of the young Assyrians, who included a man named Thaier Sako, approached David Carty, as he was standing alongside his vehicle, and formed a semicircle around him. One of the group pushed Carty and Carty pushed him back. All of the other persons in the group then surged forward. Michelle Auld saw one of the group, who she could not later identify, strike David Carty. She saw a look of horror on David Carty’s face and a large quantity of blood spurt from his chest. This episode during which David Carty was wounded in the chest was referred to at the trial as the first phase of the attack on David Carty. It was the Crown case that the group of Assyrian males around David Carty in the first phase of the attack included Gilbert Adam. However, it was not alleged by the Crown that the group included the appellant.  
      
       
      
     7    
     Michelle Auld, realising that David Carty was in serious trouble, got out of her car and ran into the Tavern. She made an emergency telephone call to the Fairfield Police Station.  
      
       
      
     8    
     Shortly before David Carty was stabbed, Thaier Sako had, somehow or other, been stabbed in the neck. It is not known who stabbed Thaier Sako but it is clear that it was not David Carty. After having been stabbed, Thaier Sako retreated towards the Tavern and collapsed outside the door to one of the bars of the Tavern, bleeding heavily. Some of those inside the Tavern, who included Richard Adam, became aware of the disturbance in the car park and came to believe, wrongly, that it was David Carty who had stabbed Thaier Sako. A number of these people went out into the car park and joined in kicking and punching David Carty. 
      
       
      
     9    
     After making the telephone call to Fairfield Police Station, Michelle Auld ran out of the Tavern into the parking area. She saw David Carty lying on the ground and a number of Assyrian men kicking Carty’s body. Some of the men were also punching Carty. Auld ran to the assistance of Carty and was herself assaulted. The part of the attack on Carty in which after he had been stabbed, a number of persons joined in kicking and punching him, part of which was witnessed by Auld after she had made the telephone call, was described at the trial as the second phase of the attack on David Carty.  
      
       
      
     10    
     Police and ambulance officers began arriving at the Tavern from about 2.30 am. David Carty was still alive, but only just, and he died soon afterwards. The cause of death was a deep stab wound through the sternum, penetrating the front and the back of the aorta. He had also suffered multiple slash wounds to his head and back and multiple abrasions and bruising, which were consistent with him having been kicked.  
      
       
      
     11    
     It was the Crown case that the appellant was one of the group around David Carty in the second phase of the attack. The Crown case on all charges against the appellant was put on two alternative bases, that he was guilty by reason of his own acts in assaulting David Carty during the second phase of the attack or that he was guilty by reason of having acted in concert with others who had assaulted David Carty in the second phase of the attack. The two bases of liability can be conveniently referred to as “direct liability” and “accessorial liability”. 
      
       
      
     12    
     On the charge of murder against the appellant, the trial judge directed the jury that they could not find the appellant guilty of the murder of David Carty, unless inter alia they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that acts during the second phase of the attack, for which the appellant was liable either on the direct basis or on the accessorial basis, had accelerated the death of David Carty by an amount which was more than merely minimal or trivial. According to the medical evidence, David Carty’s death was likely to have occurred within ten minutes of his having suffered the stab wound in the first phase of the attack on him and the chances of saving David Carty by medical treatment were, for all practical purposes, non-existent. In the light of the medical evidence and the direction given by the trial judge, it was not surprising that the jury found the appellant not guilty of the murder of David Carty.  
      
       
      
     13    
     At the trial no witness gave evidence that he saw a person who he identified as the appellant kicking or striking David Carty. However, the Crown sought to rely on a combination of (i) evidence by some witnesses which, it was said, showed, that the appellant had joined a group around David Carty in the second phase of the attack and (ii) evidence by other witnesses which, it was said, showed that all members of the group around David Carty in the second phase of the attack were involved in assaulting him. Apart from this evidence, the Crown also relied on a number of pieces of evidence which, it alleged, showed consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant, including evidence of lies, evidence of flight and evidence of conduct intended to discourage potential witnesses from speaking to the police; evidence of blood stains on the shoes the appellant was wearing on the night of 18 April 1997; and evidence of scratches on the appellant’s neck. It will be necessary to refer to this evidence in much greater detail in dealing with some of the grounds of appeal.  
      
       
      
     14    
     After this brief summary of the Crown case against the appellant at the trial, we can turn to the grounds of appeal against conviction which were relied on by the appellant in written submissions and in oral submissions at the hearing. These grounds of appeal were not the same as the grounds given in the appellant’s notice of appeal but the Crown raised no objection to the grounds in the submissions on behalf of the appellant being argued. 
      
       
       1. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they should not engage in tendency reasoning from evidence that the appellant acted aggressively in the Cambridge Tavern. 
        
       
      
     15    
     The evidence referred to in this ground of appeal was evidence given by the witness Tony Bakos and Dennis Oshana. These two witnesses were members of the group of younger Assyrians who had gone to the Tavern. 
      
     16    
     Tony Bakos gave evidence that in the karaoke bar of the Cambridge Tavern, at some indeterminate time before the first stage of the attack on David Carty, Dennis Oshana said to him, “I don’t know what he’s staring at me for” (referring to the appellant) and that when Tony Bakos looked at the appellant, the appellant was staring at Oshana. Subsequently, Oshana started staring at the appellant. The question asking Bakos whether he looked at the appellant, after hearing what Oshana said, was objected to by counsel for the appellant on the ground of relevance. The Crown Prosecutor submitted, “it is relevant as to attitude and state of mind of Richard” and the question was allowed. 
      
       
      
     17    
     Dennis Oshana gave evidence in chief that in the karaoke bar of the Cambridge Tavern he had had an argument with Gilbert Adam, and not the appellant, who he did not think was in the bar at the time of the argument. Gilbert Adam had stared at him. Oshana said in evidence that he thought he had been stared at, because he had sworn in front of the woman who was running the karaoke bar. (a woman from the Philippines named Marilou Capuyan) 
      
       
      
     18    
     However, in cross-examination by counsel for Gilbert Adam, Oshana said that he had been mistaken in saying that it was Gilbert Adam with whom he had had an argument and who had stared at him. He said it had been the appellant with whom he had had some kind of argument and who had stared at him.  
      
       
      
     19    
     In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence of “a staring argument” between Dennis Oshana and Richard Adam, in the same context as evidence of the appellant Gilbert Adam having jumped over the bar in the karaoke bar, when it closed at about half past one. The Crown Prosecutor made a submission about the appellant and Gilbert Adam “there is aggressiveness, it is not as if they are just peace loving types”. 
      
       
      
     20    
     On the hearing of the appeal it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the evidence by Bakos and Oshana of the appellant Richard Adam staring at Oshana was admissible, on the ground relied on by the Crown Prosecutor at the trial that it was evidence of a state of mind of Richard Adam at a time sufficiently proximate to the time of the alleged offence to be capable of tending to show what was Richard Adam’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offence. It was also submitted that the evidence was admissible under the principle in  
     O’Leary v The King 
      (1946) 73 CLR 566, that the conduct of the appellant Richard Adam formed an integral part of a “transaction” consisting of connected events, including both phases of the attack on David Carty. 
      
       
      
     21    
     On the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant expressly refrained from submitting that the evidence of Bakos and Oshana about the appellant staring was inadmissible. The ground taken and adhered to was, not that the trial judge had erred in admitting the evidence, but that the trial judge had erred in not giving a direction about the evidence.  
      
       
      
     22    
     The principal submissions which were made by counsel for the appellant were that the evidence of Bakos and Oshana was “tendency evidence” falling within Pt36 of the  
     Evidence Act  
     and that 
       
     such evidence was not admissible to prove that Richard Adam had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, because the conditions under s97(1)(b) and s101(2), which would have to be satisfied before the evidence could be used for this purpose, were not satisfied and accordingly a direction that the evidence was not to be used for this purpose should have been given (s95). It was also submitted that the principle of admissibility of evidence stated in  
     O’Leary v The King  
     had been abolished by the  
     Evidence Act 1995 
     .  
      
       
      
     23    
     In  
     O’Leary v The King 
      Dixon J said at 577-8:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Without (the evidence in question) the transaction of which the alleged murder formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. The prisoner’s generally violent and hostile conduct might well serve to explain his mind and attitude, and therefore to implicate him in the resulting homicide”. 
         
        
       
      
     24    
     The principles stated in  
     O’Leary v The King  
     continued to apply at common law (see for example  
     Harriman v The Queen 
      (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 628-630 per McHugh J), although courts sometimes stressed the limits of the principle and the principle was distinguished from the illegitimate so-called principle of “completeness” ( 
     Thompson v The Queen 
      (1968) 117 CLR 313 at 317;  
     Driscoll v The Queen 
      (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 533;  
     R v Murray & Bates 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 6 April 1992). 
      
       
      
     25    
     We do not consider that the principle in  
     O’Leary v The King 
      has been abolished by the  
     Evidence Act.  
     Section 9(1) of the  
     Evidence Act 
      provides that the Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding to which the Act applies, except so far as the Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment. The Act does not expressly provide that the principle is abolished. Nor do we consider that the Act so provides “by necessary intendment”.  
      
       
      
     26    
     A submission was put that evidence which was admissible only under the principle in  
     O’Leary 
      could not satisfy the test of relevance in s55 and hence under s56 would not be admissible. Reference was made to the decision of McLelland CJ in Eq in  
     Telstra Corporation v Australian Media Holdings 
      (1997) 41 NSWLR 346, in which his Honour gave consideration to whether certain provisions in Pt 310 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      relating to client legal privilege were inconsistent with common law principles on which one of the parties sought to rely. However, in our opinion, evidence which properly falls within the principle as stated by Dixon J in  
     O’Leary 
      would be evidence that “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding” and hence would satisfy the test of relevance in s55 of the Act. 
      
       
        
       
      
     27    
     If evidence of the appellant staring at Dennis Oshana was an integral part of a connected series of events happening on the night of 18 April 1997, which included the assaulting of David Carty and which could not be truly understood without reference to the evidence (that is, if the evidence came within the  
     O’Leary 
      principle) or if the evidence of the appellant staring at Dennis Oshana was evidence of conduct by the appellant at a time sufficiently proximate to the time of the alleged assaulting of David Carty to permit an inference to be drawn that the appellant had the same continuing state of mind at the time of the alleged assaulting of David Carty as he had at the time of the staring, then such evidence would not, in our opinion, be tendency evidence within Pt36. 
      
       
      
     28    
     The relevant parts of the Reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which preceded the enactment of the Commonwealth and New South Wales  
     Evidence Acts 
      (see Report No 26 “Evidence” Vol1 especially pars 400-402 and Vol2 especially pars 169-171 and Report No.38 “Evidence” especially pars 175 and 176) indicate that Pt36 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      dealing with “tendency and coincidence” was intended to deal with what was described at common law as “propensity evidence” or “similar fact evidence”. 
      
       
      
     29    
     At par169 of Vol2 of Report No 26 the Commission, after referring to the decision of the Privy Council in  
     Makin v Attorney General for New South Wales 
      (1894) AC 57, quoted a passage in the judgment of Gibbs ACJ (Stephen Jacobs and Aickin JJ concurring) in  
     Markby v The Queen 
      (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 116:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The first principle, which is fundamental, is that evidence of similar facts is not admissible if it shows only that the accused had a propensity or disposition to commit crime, or crime of particular kind, or that he was the sort of person likely to commit the crime charged. The second principle, which is a corollary of the first, is that the evidence is admissible if it is relevant in some other way, that is, if it tends to show that he is guilty of the crime charged for some reason other than that he has committed crimes in the past or has a criminal disposition”. 
         
        
        
       Propensity evidence and similar fact evidence at common law could, of course, include conduct by an accused person which did not amount to a crime. 
        
       
      
     30    
     The reference by the Commission to  
     Makin v The Attorney General 
      and the quotation from the judgment of Gibbs ACJ in  
     Markby 
      and the references in the Reports to evidence of “previous misconduct” or “past misconduct” or “conduct on some other occasion” indicate, in our opinion, that the Commission was addressing evidence of conduct by an accused person “in the past”, being conduct on some other occasion than the occasion on which the conduct charged occurred, tending to show that the accused had a particular propensity or disposition or inclination. Evidence of conduct by an accused person that falls within the  
     O’Leary 
      principle as being part of the same connected series of events or evidence of conduct by an accused person evincing a particular state of mind at a time so proximate to the time of the commission of the alleged offence as to permit an inference that the same state of mind continued up to the time of the offence is not evidence of conduct by an accused person “in the past” or evidence tending to show that he has a particular “disposition” or “propensity” or “inclination” and no direction that the jury should not engage in tendency reasoning is required (although in a particular case a direction of some sort might be required). 
      
       
      
     31    
     In the present case a serious question would arise whether evidence that at some indeterminate time before the assaulting of David Carty the appellant had stared, even if in a hostile manner, at some person other than David Carty inside the Cambridge Tavern, would be admissible on either of the bases advanced by the Crown or whether the Crown was really seeking to use the evidence as evidence of a tendency or disposition or propensity on the part of the appellant. However, during the hearing of the appeal the court’s attention was drawn to a direction the trial judge in fact gave the jury, which was in the following terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “He (Tony Bakos) described some staring between Dennis and Richard, which was calmed down by Thamir. That matter, members of the jury, really is of no moment in this trial. You should not draw any inference from it. Its only relevance, I suggest to you, is it might be important in relation to identification as to who was in the bar, particularly having regard to Dennis Oshana, who I will come to a little later. It would be unfair to assume that there was any form of aggression or aggravation on the part of anybody who stared at Dennis, who, on his own account, had sworn in front of a female and no doubt was properly chipped”. 
         
        
       
      
     32    
     This direction would have been sufficient to prevent the jury engaging in any kind of illegitimate reasoning based on the evidence of staring.  
      
       
      
     33    
     We would reject the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       2. The trial judge erred in his directions regarding alleged evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
        
       
      
     34    
     The ground of appeal actually argued by counsel for the appellant on the appeal was, not that there was any error in the directions given by the trial judge about the evidence relied on by the Crown as being evidence of consciousness of guilt, but that the trial judge had erred in leaving various items of evidence to the jury as being evidence capable of being regarded by them as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
      
     35    
     At the trial the Crown relied on and the trial judge left to the jury four types of evidence as being evidence capable of being regarded by the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. These four types of evidence were:- 
      
       
        
       (i) Evidence of lies 
        
       
      
     36    
     When interviewed by the police on 18 April 1997 and 16 June 1997 the appellant said that he had not seen any person on the ground of the car park of the Cambridge Tavern, apart from one Assyrian (interview of 18 April 1997 questions and answers 94-96; interview of 16 June 1997 question and answer 185) and that he had not gone anywhere near a police officer lying in the car park of the Cambridge Tavern (interview of 18 April 1997 question and answer 192). 
      
       
      
     37    
     It was submitted on the hearing of the appeal that both these assertions by Richard Adam had been left to the jury as being lies capable of showing consciousness of guilt. However, it would seem that the trial judge left to the jury as a matter capable of amounting to a lie told in consciousness of guilt, only the denial by Richard Adam of going anywhere near David Carty (see summing-up p188). 
      
       
        
       (ii) Evidence of Flight 
        
       
      
     38    
     The Crown relied on:- 
      
       
        
       (a) Evidence by Tony Bakos that after the assaulting of David Carty he walked to a service station and at the service station he saw the appellant and his brother, that Gilbert Adam said “let’s go” and that Richard Adam walked back towards the Cambridge Tavern (trial transcript p713-714) and evidence by Dennis Oshana that he had walked away from the car park, that the appellant and Gilbert Adam were walking behind him at a “normal pace”, that he had overheard some conversation between the appellant and Gilbert Adam about a knife and that one out of the appellant and Gilbert Adam, he thought the appellant, had “walked back”. 
        
        
       (b) Evidence by a Mr McQuillan, an agent of the Australian Federal Police, who on the night of 18 April 1997 happened to be at the Fairfield Police Station and who, after Michelle Auld had made her emergency call, accompanied New South Wales police to the Cambridge Tavern. Agent McQuillan gave the following evidence:- 
        
        
         
         “I saw a male person wondering around who told me that his name was Richard. He was definitely Arabic. He had short black hair and was wearing a grey round neck jumper. He was grinning and walking around. Prior to the crime scene tape being put out, I saw that he had driven a motor vehicle into the Tavern car park. He parked his vehicle in the next space to the right of the vehicle where the knife was located”. 
         
        
       
      
     39    
     It was part of the Crown case that Richard Adam had returned to the car park and had moved his vehicle, which was parked in the car park, a short distance within the car park. It seems also to have been part of the Crown case that it should have been inferred that the appellant would have driven out of and away from the car park, if that course had not been prevented by the arrival of police officers. 
      
       
        
       (iii) Evidence of conduct of Richard Adam on 18 April 1997 discouraging potential witnesses from speaking to the police. 
        
       
      
     40    
     A police officer, Acting Inspector Dossantos, gave evidence that he went to the Cambridge Tavern on the night of 18 April 1997. Inspector Dossantos decided that a number of persons in the car park should be placed inside the Tavern, to await the arrival of further detectives who would interview them. 
      
       
      
     41    
     Dossantos gave evidence that he observed a male person push another person in the back violently, forcing the other person against a wall and that he heard the male person say to the other person “you shut up, you understand”. Dossantos did not identify the “aggressor” but said he was “thirty to thirty-five years old, medium build, short brown hair, moustache, wearing a dark coloured jumper, with fresh scratches on the right side of his neck”. This description generally fitted the appellant.  
      
       
      
     42    
     When he was interviewed on 18 April 1997, the appellant admitted that at the Tavern that night a police officer had accused him of “pushing”. The appellant did not admit that he had pushed anyone or that he had told anyone to “shut up”. 
      
       
      
     43    
     The Crown case was that the person who had pushed another person and told him to “shut up” was the appellant and that the appellant had so acted out of consciousness of his own guilt, to discourage the other person from speaking to the police. 
      
       
        
       (iv) Various items of conduct by the appellant after 18 April 1997, which were testified to by a witness Mrs Salwa, who was a cousin of the appellant and his brother. 
        
       
      
     44    
     Mrs Salwa gave evidence that:- 
      
       
       (a) Three days after Gilbert Adam had come alone to Mrs Salwa’s house and had asked Mrs Salwa to hide the pants that he had been wearing on the night of 18 April 1997, Gilbert Adam and the appellant came to Mrs Salwa’s house. The appellant suggested that Gilbert Adam’s pants be burnt at their sister’s house at Bonnyrigg. However, Gilbert Adam said that the pants should be burnt at Mrs Salwa’s house. The pants were burnt at Mrs Salwa’s house and the ashes put down the toilet at her house.  
        
        
       (b) The appellant told Mrs Salwa “don’t say nothing” to the police. He said this “too many times”. The appellant told Salwa “don’t say anything on the telephone because the telephone might be censored”. The appellant told Mrs Salwa that if anyone asked her anything about what had happened at the Tavern, she should say that she did not know anything. 
        
       
      
     45    
     The trial judge dealt with the evidence allegedly showing consciousness of guilt by the appellant in two separate parts of the summing-up. As we have already noted, it was not submitted that the directions his Honour gave were deficient in any respect.  
      
       
      
     46    
     At pp22-25 the trial judge gave general directions about evidence of consciousness of guilt. The trial judge dealt first with lies and then with the other conduct relied on as showing consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
      
     47    
     In relation to lies, the trial judge gave inter alia the following directions:- 
      
       
        
         
         “So the Crown must then, first of all, prove a deliberate lie was told by the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the lie related to a material matter. That is, a matter which is centrally connected with the alleged offence. It has to be something which goes to an important or significant event, not some peripheral matter, but something which is a central event in the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         Third, the Crown must prove that there was no reason for telling the lie, other than a fear or belief that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence. In other words, the Crown must establish that the accused knew that the truth would implicate him in the offence and he told a lie to escape that consequence. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, I point out here again, as a matter of experience of trial judges, that persons sometimes do tell lies, even about the most important or central matters, for reasons other than a fear of that kind or other than an awareness of their own guilt. People sometimes tell lies out of panic, or out of fear of being wrongly accused or suspected of a crime. Sometimes they may tell a lie to protect another person who was guilty of the offence. Sometimes they tell lies to cover up some other misconduct or offence, other than the matter charged”. 
         
        
        
        * * * 
        
        
         
         “It is for the Crown to eliminate any reasonable possibility than the accused in this case told a lie for any reason, other than the fear of the truth. As I pointed out to you previously, it is important always to determine whether the lie was deliberate or not, because unless it is a deliberate lie, it doesn’t even begin to qualify. I will come back to that when I look at the individual lies which the Crown says here add to its case”. 
         
        
       
      
     48    
     In relation to the other conduct relied on by the Crown as showing consciousness of guilt, the trial judge said at p25 of the summing-up:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I began this discussion by saying we would look at conduct as well which might reveal a consciousness of guilt. In this case, as I understand the Crown case, there are three areas of conduct which fall into this category. First of all, the Crown suggests that the accused did leave the scene to avoid, obviously, being detected there and possibly interviewed and arrested. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, it suggests that the accused Gilbert did destroy some material evidence in the form of his clothing, or at least possible evidence in the form of his clothing. 
         
        
        
         
         Third, it suggests that some threats were made by one or other of the accused to potential witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         Those three things, the Crown says, all point towards a fear of the truth and a consciousness of guilt of a similar kind to that which arises concerning lies. 
          
          
         Again, similar considerations apply. Before you take any of these matters into account as showing a consciousness of guilt, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular conduct did occur as the Crown alleged, and you must also be satisfied that the sole reason for it was an awareness of guilt, or a fear of the truth otherwise emerging, and not some other explanation such as panic or fear of being wrongly accused or to protect someone other than himself”. 
         
        
       
      
     49    
     In a later part of the summing-up the trial judge summarised the Crown case against Richard Adam. In this part of the summing-up the trial judge said with respect to the evidence of flight:- 
      
       
        
         
          
         “It (the Crown case against the appellant with respect to his alleged flight) depends upon you accepting Bakos and Oshana that, walking away from the scene, they saw Gilbert and Richard and that Richard walked back. The Crown suggestion being that he was making his way from the scene by way of flight, but then realised he had a problem, in that his car was still there and he had to go back and get it, otherwise there could be some difficulty for him with the police if his car, effectively, was abandoned there. Because no doubt, it being registered in his wife’s name, some questions would be asked which may go back to him” 
         
        
       
       
      
     50    
     A little later in the summing-up the trial judge said with respect to the evidence of lies:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown does rely upon that denial, as I have pointed, of going anywhere near David Carty, both as a lie and as a matter going to his guilt”. 
         
        
       
      
     51    
     Shortly afterwards in the summing-up the trial judge said with respect to the evidence given by Acting Inspector Dossantos:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Another matter which the Crown relied upon in relation to Richard was the evidence of Dossantos that he pushed a man in the hotel and told him to keep quiet. The description Dossantos gave, the Crown suggested, fitted Richard; 30 to 35, medium build, short brown hair, moustache, dark jumper, scratches on his neck. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown invited you to infer that the reason for that was to discourage that witness talking, because of the fear that that witness might implicate him, Richard, in this incident. We need to be cautious about that. First of all you have to be satisfied that Dossantos did identify the right man. You also have to be satisfied that he was protecting himself, not trying to protect someone else, because unless he was protecting himself, then you really can’t infer consciousness of guilt on his part, from it. You also bear in mind although he admitted he was the person to whom police spoke about this act, he did, in fact, deny pushing anybody, so you can’t infer from that actual conversation, or interview, that he actually did push another witness”. 
         
        
       
      
     52    
     As regards Mrs Salwa’s evidence (and brief evidence given by her husband) the trial judge said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Joining in the burning of the clothes and the threats to Salwa and the warning about the phone and the bugging and the instruction not to tell them about anything after the car was examined, are matters the Crown relies upon as indicative of consciousness of guilt on the part of Richard”. 
         
        
       
      
     53    
     The trial judge continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “For all these things I give you the similar caution as I gave a moment ago, that some of these things may be as consistent with trying to protect Gilbert, as himself. You cannot infer consciousness of guilt unless you are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that when he did any of these things, if he did do them, or had any of these conversations, that he was doing so because of the consciousness of his own guilt, as distinct from trying to protect Gilbert. It would not be enough for you to weigh against Richard, if there was a reasonable possibility that what he was doing was protecting Gilbert”. 
         
        
       
      
     54    
     In directing the jury to the effect that before any lie or any other conduct on the part of the appellant could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the lie was told or the conduct was engaged in and would also have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the lie was told or the conduct was engaged in solely out of consciousness of his own guilt and not for any other reason, the trial judge’s directions may have been unduly favourable to the appellant. In the leading High Court decision of  
     Edwards v The Queen 
      (1993) 178 CLR 193 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said at p210:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Although guilt must ultimately be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, an alleged admission constituted by the telling of a lie may be considered together with the other evidence and for that purpose does not have to be proved to any particular standard of proof. It may be considered together with the other evidence which as a whole must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt if the accused is to be convicted. If the lie said to constitute the admission is the only evidence against the accused or is an indispensable link in a chain of evidence necessary to prove guilt, then the lie and its character as an admission against interest must be proved beyond reasonable doubt before the jury may conclude that the accused is guilty. But ordinarily a lie will form part of the body of evidence to be considered by the jury in reaching their conclusion according to the required standard of proof. The jury do not have to conclude that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt in order to accept that a lie told by him exhibits a consciousness of guilt. They may accept that evidence without applying any particular standard of proof and conclude that, when they consider it together with the other evidence, the accused is or is not guilty beyond reasonable doubt”. 
         
        
       
      
     55    
     Since  
     Edwards 
      it has been repeatedly held by this Court that “where lies are used merely as evidencing a consciousness of guilt, as part of the circumstantial evidence case, it is unnecessary to establish either the lie or its character beyond reasonable doubt” ( 
     R v Taylor  
     (unreported 18 April 1995 at p19 per Hunt CJ at CL, citing  
     R v Dellapatrona 
      (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 150;  
     R v Sandford 
      (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 181: 
      R V Small 
      (1994) 33 NSWLR 575 at 596. 
      
       
      
     56    
     In  
     R v Moore 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 21 June 1995) Gleeson CJ said at p16:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Furthermore, the directions which Wood J gave to the jury on this matter went very close indeed to telling the jury that they had to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there had been a lie told from a consciousness of guilt, before they could add this to the circumstantial case against the appellant. The directions contained references to that being the only rational inference available. In this respect, the directions may have been unduly favourable to the appellant”. 
         
        
       
      
     57    
     We are conscious, and his Honour may well have had in mind, that some doubt has been thrown on the proper standard of proof of some items of circumstantial evidence by the recent decisions of the High Court in  
     Gipp v The Queen 
      (1998) 72 ALJR 1012 and  
     Penney v The Queen 
      (1998) 72 ALJR 1316. 
      
       
      
     58    
     The principal submission made by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground of appeal was that the trial judge should not have left any of the various items of evidence to the jury as being capable of constituting evidence of consciousness by the appellant of his guilt, because another explanation of his actions, that he had acted as he had done, out of consciousness of the guilt, not of himself, but of his brother Gilbert, was available and so plausible that it would not have been open to the jury to be satisfied, particularly to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt required by the trial judge’s directions, that the appellant had acted out of the consciousness of his own guilt.  
      
       
      
     59    
     Reference was made in the course of argument to a passage in the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in  
     Edwards 
      at pp212-213, where their Honours said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Whilst in many cases it must be a question for the jury whether a lie was told because the truth was perceived to be inconsistent with innocence or for some other reason, if it was established that there was a deliberate lie in this case about a material matter (and we do not think that it was), the innocent explanation for that lie was so plausible that the lie could not have been probative of guilt. Quite apart from our concerns about the existence of the lie and its materiality, this should have prevented the trial judge from concluding that the telling of the lie was capable of amounting to corroboration of the complainant’s evidence”. 
         
        
       
      
     60    
     It was properly conceded by counsel for the appellant that the mere availability of another explanation for an accused’s conduct will not prevent a trial judge leaving evidence of the conduct to the jury as being evidence capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness of guilt. It was also conceded that the trial judge in the summing-up had strongly directed the jury that they could not use evidence of conduct by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt, unless they were satisfied that the reason for the conduct was an awareness of his own guilt and not some other explanation, in particular a desire to protect some person other than himself, namely his brother Gilbert. 
      
       
      
     61    
     In our opinion, the assertion by Richard Adam to the police in the answer to question 192 of the interview of 18 April 1997 to the effect that he had not gone anywhere near a police officer lying in the car park was capable of constituting evidence of consciousness of guilt and was properly left to the jury. It is significant that in the immediately preceding questions the appellant had been asked about spots of blood which had been found on his shoes, which might be capable of incriminating him personally in the assaulting of David Carty. As we have indicated earlier, the alleged lie that the appellant did not see anyone on the ground in the car park of the Cambridge Tavern, apart from an Assyrian, was not in fact left to the jury as conduct of the appellant capable of amounting to consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
      
     62    
     The evidence relied on by the Crown as being evidence of flight, that the appellant was observed walking away from the car park with his brother “at a normal pace”, being with his brother at the service station and walking back to the car park and moving his car a short distance within the car park was, in our opinion, so deficient in establishing that there was any “flight” at all or that the reason for any flight was consciousness of his own guilt, and not consciousness of his brother’s guilt, that it should not have been left to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
      
     63    
     As regards the evidence by Inspector Dossantos, there is an initial question whether it would be open to the jury to find that the person who pushed another person and told that other person to “shut up” was the appellant. In our opinion, it would have been open to the jury to make such a finding, on the basis of the description of the person given by Dossantos (including the recent facial scratches), which fitted the appellant and the admission by the appellant that a police officer had told him to stop pushing (even if the appellant did not admit that he was pushing). We are also of the opinion that this evidence was properly left to the jury as capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness by Richard Adam of his own guilt. 
      
       
      
     64    
     With regard to the evidence by Mrs Salwa that three days after Gilbert Adam had come alone to Mrs Salwa’s house and asked Mrs Salwa to hide the pants he had been wearing on the night of 18 April 1997, the appellant had come with Gilbert Adam to Mrs Salwa’s house and had participated in the burning of Gilbert Adam’s pants, an explanation for the appellant’s conduct that he was acting to protect his brother was so plausible that it would not have been open to the jury to regard the appellant’s conduct as showing consciousness of his own guilt and accordingly this evidence should not have been left to the jury as capable of showing consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant. On the other hand, the appellant’s conduct in telling Mrs Salwa not to say anything was, in our opinion, capable of constituting conduct engaged in out of consciousness of his own guilt and was properly left to the jury. 
      
       
      
     65    
     We have held that the evidence of “flight” and the evidence of participation by Richard Adam in the burning of his brother’s pants should not have been left to the jury as capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness of guilt. However, we do not consider that there was any miscarriage of justice or any risk of any miscarriage of justice, because these items of evidence were left to the jury. The directions given by the trial judge to the jury, which as we have observed may have been unduly favourable to the appellant, and which the jury must be taken to have followed, were such that there was no real risk of the jury finding that any of these items of evidence showed a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant.  
      
       
      
     66    
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       (3) The trial judge erred in failing to give a direction about the application of the standard of proof in a substantially circumstantial case. 
        
       
      
     67    
     It was submitted that the Crown case against the appellant was a substantially circumstantial case, even if it was not a wholly circumstantial case.  
      
       
      
     68    
     We accept that the Crown case was circumstantial, insofar as it depended on conduct by the appellant allegedly showing consciousness of guilt, blood stains on the appellant’s shoes and scratches on his neck. However, as we have already indicated, while no single witness identified the appellant as having been a person who participated in the second stage of the attack on David Carty, an important part of the Crown case consisted of combining the direct evidence of two classes of witnesses, that is witnesses who gave evidence tending to prove that the appellant was one of the group of persons around David Carty in the second stage of the attack and other witnesses who gave evidence tending to show that all persons in the group around David Carty were participating in the second stage of the attack. The combining of the two sets of direct evidence did not constitute circumstantial evidence. However, even in a case which is not fully circumstantial, some kind of circumstantial evidence direction may be appropriate.  
      
       
      
     69    
     The principal submission made by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground can be summarised as follows. The case against Richard Adam on the charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm was put on the two alternative bases, of direct liability and accessorial liability. It was submitted that the appellant would not have been liable on the accessorial basis, unless he was not merely present when other persons were inflicting grievous bodily harm on David Carty, even if his presence was not “accidental”, but was also intentionally encouraging or assisting the parties assaulting David Carty. Mere presence as a bystander would be insufficient to incur criminal liability. Counsel referred to  
     R v Clarkson 
      (1971) 3 All E R 344 and  
     R v Doorey & Gage 
      (1970) 3 NSWLR 351.  
      
       
      
     70    
     The principle that a person who is present at the commission of a crime is not liable as an accessory, unless he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit the crime, has been recognised in later decisions of this Court (see for example  
     R v Stokes & Difford 
      (1990) 51 A Crim R 25).

     In the present case, the defence case which was put at the trial and which was based on answers given by the appellant when he had been interviewed by the police, was that he had not gone anywhere near David Carty, and had not joined any group of persons around David Carty. However, insofar as the Crown relied on the alternative, accessorial basis of liability, it was submitted that there was a real issue whether, even if the jury were satisfied that the appellant had gone over to David Carty and had joined the group around David Carty, the appellant was any more than a mere bystander who was not intentionally assisting or encouraging those participating in the assaulting of David Carty. The trial judge, it was submitted, was required to put this issue to the jury, even though it was not in accordance, and was indeed inconsistent, with the case which had been put to the jury by counsel for the appellant.  
     Pemble v The Queen  
      (1971) 124 CLR 107 especially at 117-118 per Barwick CJ. 
      
       
      
     72    
     The particular direction, which it was submitted that the trial judge should have given, would have been a direction to the effect that the jury should not find the appellant guilty, unless they were satisfied that there was no reasonable inference or hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the appellant, including that he had merely been a bystander not intentionally assisting or encouraging those assaulting David Carty. It was submitted that no forensic disadvantage would have flowed to the appellant from the giving of such a direction by the trial judge.  
      
       
      
     73    
     As the judgment of Dawson J in  
     Shepherd v The Queen 
      (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 578 makes plain, there is no invariable rule of practice or rule of law that a circumstantial evidence direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence. In the present case, we are satisfied that the directions which were given by the trial judge were sufficient to instruct the jury that on the accessorial basis of liability the jury would have to be satisfied that the appellant was not merely present but was intentionally assisting or encouraging those inflicting grievous bodily harm on David Carty. 
      
       
      
     74    
     At p31 of the summing-up the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “A person will participate in that form of joint criminal enterprise if that person is present at the time when the crime is committed and, with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed, intentionally assists or encourages the other participant to commit the crime. The presence of the person at the time when the crime is being committed, and the readiness to give aid or encouragement is sufficient to amount to participation of the kind required at law”. 
         
        
       
      
     75    
     The trial judge also gave the jury written directions in which he included as an element of the second basis of liability:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Knowing that the others were going to assault David Carty, he assisted or encouraged them in those acts, either by his own actions or words or by displaying a readiness to give aid if required”. 
         
        
       
      
     76    
     At other points in the summing-up the trial judge directed the jury that the Crown had to do more than merely prove that the appellant was present “as a disinterested observer” and that no criminal responsibility attaches to a person “who just happens to be a bystander or a disinterested, impartial onlooker who is simply not part of any arrangement and who simply is not providing encouragement or flagging an intention and willingness to assist”. 
      
       
      
     77    
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       4. The conviction is unreasonable, cannot be supported, unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
       
      
     78    
     This ground of appeal is referred to in the decisions of the High Court in  
      M v The Queen 
      (1994) 181 CLR 487,  
     Jones v The Queen 
      (1997) 191 CLR 439 and  
     Fleming v The Queen 
      (1998) 73 ALJR 1 and is properly described, in the terms of s6(1) of the  
     Criminal Appeal  
     Act, as being that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The principles to be applied in determining an appeal on such a ground, which used to be described as being that the verdict of guilty was unsafe or unsatisfactory, were stated or referred to in  
     M v The Queen 
      at 492-494 by Mason CJ, Deane Dawson and Toohey JJ and in  
     Jones v The Queen 
      at 450-451 by Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. In  
     Jones 
      Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at 450-451:- 
      
       
        
         
         “In  
         M 
         , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said that the test for an unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict was whether the court thought that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was ‘open to the jury’ to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that 
         
        
        
         
          
          ‘in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations’. 
          
         
        
        
         
         The majority judges explained the application of the test as follows:- 
         
        
        
         
          
          ‘In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence’”. 
          
         
        
       
      
     79    
     As we have already stated, the Crown case on all charges against the appellant was put on two alternative bases, namely:- 
      
       
       (i) Direct liability, that is the appellant was guilty by reason of his own acts in assaulting David Carty during the second phase of the attack on David Carty, or 
        
        
       (ii) Accessorial liability, that is that the appellant was guilty by reason of acting in concert with others who were assaulting David Carty in the second phase of the attack. 
        
       
      
     80    
     It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the jury’s verdict that the appellant was guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on David Carty could not be supported on either of these bases. 
      
       
        
       Direct Liability 
        
       
      
     81    
     It was pointed out by counsel for the appellant that at the trial no witness gave evidence that he or she had seen a person, who the witness identified as the appellant, kicking (or otherwise striking) David Carty. 
      
       
      
     82    
     To prove that the appellant had himself kicked (or struck) David Carty during the second phase of the attack on David Carty, the Crown sought to rely on:- 
      
       
        
       (i) A combination of the evidence of a number of witnesses. 
        
        
       (ii) Evidence which allegedly showed consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant. 
        
        
       (iii) Evidence of blood stains on the shoes the appellant had been wearing on the night of 18 April 1997. 
        
        
       (iv) Evidence of scratches on the appellant’s neck on the night of 18 April 1997. 
        
       
      
     83    
     It is necessary for this Court to undertake its own independent examination of all of this evidence and to assess its quality. 
      
       
      
     84    
     In the summing-up the trial judge referred to the combination of the evidence of a number of witnesses on which the Crown sought to rely, in the following terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The case against Richard, in effect, depends upon you accepting that Oshana did see Richard out there in the group, that he saw him moving around and kicking David Carty after he had gone into the hotel to get him and Thamir and had gone outside. It depends upon you accepting Oshana, Auld, Ritzmann and Davies that everyone in that group who were out there in that second phase, if you might call it that, were involved in the action. For example, as Auld put it, that no-one within three to five metres or so, was idly standing by as a passive bystander”. 
         
        
       
      
     85    
     Denis Oshana was an important witness for the Crown. He was the witness on whom the Crown relied, principally if not exclusively, to prove that the appellant was in a group around David Carty in the second phase of the attack on David Carty.  
      
       
      
     86    
     At the trial Denis Oshana gave evidence that in October 1998 (when he gave evidence) he was nineteen years old. On the night of 17 April 1997 he had gone to the Cambridge Tavern with a number of other young Assyrians, including his friend Tony Bakos. After arriving at the Tavern, they had gone into the karaoke bar. In the karaoke bar the staring, to which we have already referred in dealing with the first ground of appeal, occurred. Subsequently, Oshana went outside the Tavern and talked with friends, including Tony Bakos.  
      
       
      
     87    
     While he was outside, Oshana heard an argument taking place in the car park of the Tavern near a utility vehicle (David Carty’s vehicle was a utility). Near the utility Oshana saw Thaier Sako, another young Assyrian named Eddie and Gilbert Adam, all of whom were standing about a metre from David Carty. After watching the argument for no more than a minute, Oshana went inside the Tavern into the karaoke bar. Oshana told Thamir Sako, Thaier Sako’s brother, that his brother was in a fight. The appellant, who was present, said that he did not think it was a big deal. Oshana then told the appellant that his brother also was involved in the fight. Oshana, Thamir Sako, the appellant and others then left the karaoke bar and walked through another bar in the Tavern, which was called the Casino Bar.  
      
       
      
     88    
     When Oshana walked out of the door of the Casino Bar, he saw Thaier Sako walking towards him, holding his neck. Thaier Sako collapsed to the ground about a metre from the door of the Casino Bar. Oshana was asked by the Crown Prosecutor:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Did you see where Richard was when you came out (of the Casino Bar)?” 
         
        
        
       and he replied: 
        
        
         
         “No. I can’t remember” 
         
        
       
      
     89    
     Oshana made a telephone call for an ambulance for Thaier Sako, using a mobile telephone which someone handed to him. Oshana then happened to look away from Thaier Sako and he saw a police officer lying on his back on the ground in the car park. Oshana could not remember how many persons were near the police officer.  
      
       
      
     90    
     The following questions and answers occurred in Oshana’s evidence in chief:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Q…Who else did you recognise, if anyone? 
          
         A. Richard was there at one stage. 
          
          
         Q. Richard? 
          
         A. (Witness nodded). 
          
          
         Q. That is the accused, Richard Adam? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
          
          
         Q. But when you looked over and saw David Carty lying on the ground, moving, was Richard there then? 
          
         A. I can’t remember if he was then or not”. 
         
        
       
      
     91    
     Oshana then said that other persons who he did recognise were near David Carty, including Gilbert Adam. 
      
       
      
     92    
     Oshana’s evidence continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Gibby (Gilbert Adam) was there. Just going to each of these persons, *when you first looked, was Gibby there? 
          
         A. I think so. 
          
          
         Q. How far was he from David Carty when you saw him? 
          
         A. A metre. 
          
          
         Q. A metre? 
          
         A. (Witness nodded). 
          
         
        
        
         
         Q. And Richard, when he was there, you said he was there at some stage? 
          
         A. (Witness nodded). 
         
        
        
         
          
         Q. How far was he from David Carty? 
          
         A. ** Probably about the same, I remember him behind the utility. 
          
          
         Q. He was behind the utility? 
          
         A. Yeah. 
          
          
         Q. When you say ‘behind’, do you mean, the utility was facing which way? 
          
         A. The street, facing KFC. 
          
          
         Q. Where was he in relation to the utility when he was behind, behind what part of the utility? 
          
         A. In the back of it, right near the back. 
          
          
         Q. Right near the back of it? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
          
          
         Q. How far at that stage was he away from David Carty? 
          
         A. About three metres at that stage. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: So you saw him at one stage, one metre away. 
          
          
         OBJECTION (WATERSTREET) 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: That is what he said. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q: And at another stage you saw him three metres away? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: From David Carty. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: My note is: ‘Richard, the same but behind the ute.’ 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Initially. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Earlier. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: Could that just be read? It is not my note. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: That is my understanding. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: It is just a few lines back. Immediately after his answer on Gibby, ‘I think so’ and gave a measurement and asked about Richard and he gave an answer. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I have got it here. 
          
          
         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM * TO ** READ BY HIS HONOUR. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: He says that is three metres. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It is a metre, he said the same. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: Behind the utility. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: The transcript reads ‘probably about the same’. In any event, you better ask him, Mr Crown. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: I will clear it up. 
          
          
         WATERSTREET: I objected to leading. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Ask him again. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Did you see Richard in more than one place near David Carty? 
          
         A. Yes, 
          
          
         Q. What was the first of those places you saw him in? 
          
         A. First next to him. 
          
          
         Q. He was next to him? 
          
         A. (Witness nodded). 
          
          
         Q. What part of him, do you remember? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. How far was he away from him when he was next to him? 
          
         A. About a metre. 
          
          
         Q. And how far was he away from David Carty then? 
          
         A. About three or four metres. 
          
          
         Q. Over what period of time are you describing Richard Adam’s presence near David Carty? 
          
         A. I can’t remember”. 
         
        
       
      
     93    
     A little later Oshana gave the following evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Were they (the men near David Carty) staying in the one position? 
          
         A. No, they were moving around. 
          
          
         Q. Did you see any movement against David Carty? 
          
         A. For a split second, but I don’t know. 
          
          
         Q. What did you see? 
          
         A. Leg movements. 
          
          
         Q. Were those leg movements coming into contact with David Carty? 
          
         A. Probably. 
          
          
         Q. How would you describe the leg movements? 
          
         A. Kicking. 
          
          
         Q. And how - could you describe the force with which you saw the kicking? 
          
         A. With force. 
          
          
         Q. I am sorry? 
          
         A. With force. 
          
          
         Q. As you saw the kicking, did you see who was doing the kicking? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. Who was near David Carty as you saw the kicking going on? 
          
         A. It would have been Eddie. I don’t know if it was Richard or Gibby there. 
          
          
         Q. They were over there? 
          
         A. I don’t know if it was one of them”. 
         
        
       
      
     94    
     Oshana then gave evidence that he remembered a woman (who could only have been Michelle Auld) screaming, about four or five metres away from David Carty. When Oshana looked again, he saw the appellant “helping her up”. 
      
       
      
     95    
     Oshana was asked whether he saw the appellant do anything and the following questions and answers occurred:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you see him moving, walking, doing anything? 
          
         A. Yeah, he walked around a couple of times. 
          
          
         Q. He walked around who? 
          
         A. Not walked around, like, he walked up, next to the other car, the one parked behind the utility. 
          
          
         Q. And then walked back, did he? 
          
         A. Yes, I think it was. 
          
          
         Q. Was he the only one you saw move from his position? 
          
         A. I can’t remember”. 
         
        
       
      
     96    
     Oshana said that other people were present. He was asked:- “Were they closer to David Carty than Eddie, Gibby and Richard or were they further away….? And he replied “closer”. 
      
       
      
     97    
     Oshana was asked:- 
      
       
        
         
         “After Richard picked her up, did you see him again in the car park?” and he replied “I can’t remember”. 
         
        
       
      
     98    
     Oshana’s evidence, accordingly, included evidence that the appellant had gone out into the car park, after he had been told by Oshana that his own brother, Gilbert Adam, was involved in a fight; that at one stage (Oshana did not remember for how long) the appellant was about a metre away from David Carty, that at another stage the appellant was about three metres away from David Carty, that the appellant was not stationary in the car park but moving and that other persons were closer to David Carty than the appellant was. As regards kicking of David Carty, Oshana’s evidence was that he saw kicking for only a split second, that he did not see who was doing the kicking and he did not know if the appellant was there, when the kicking he saw occurred. As regards Oshana’s evidence that he saw the appellant help up a woman, who could only have been Michelle Auld, Michelle Auld had no recollection of this happening and the appellant, when interviewed by the police, denied that it had happened. 
      
       
      
     99    
     So far as can be gathered from reading the transcript of his evidence, the general quality of Oshana’s evidence, as is demonstrated by some of the extracts we have quoted, was not high. 
      
       
      
     100    
     Tony Bakos, a friend of Denis Oshana, who went with Denis Oshana to the Cambridge Tavern on the night of 17 April 1997 and who was in the company of Denis Oshana for most of the night, also gave evidence at the trial. 
      
       
      
     101    
     Bakos gave evidence that he observed at least part of the first phase of the attack on David Carty. Bakos remained in the car park, when Oshana went inside the Tavern to speak to Thamir Sako, after Thaier Sako had been injured. He observed Oshana come out of the Tavern with Thaier Sako, another Assyrian and the appellant. He was asked:- 
      
       
        
         
         “What did he (the appellant) do, when he came out of the hotel?” and he replied:- 
         
        
        
         
         “I can’t remember”. 
         
        
       
      
     102    
     Bakos did give evidence that a policewoman was kicked and fell and “Richard picked her up and he was asking if she was all right.” However, it emerged in cross-examination of Bakos that in giving evidence at the committal proceedings he had said that he had not seen Michelle Auld fall over and when asked whether he had seen the appellant do anything in relation to Michelle Auld, he had replied “No”. 
      
       
      
     103    
     Little reliance could be placed on Tony Bakos’s evidence, as establishing that the appellant was in a group around David Carty in the second phase of the attack.  
      
       
      
     104    
     The trial judge in the passage in the summing-up which we have already quoted nominated Oshana, Auld, Ritzmann and Davies, as being witnesses who had given evidence that everyone in the group near David Carty in the second phase of the attack was “involved in the action”. 
      
       
      
     105    
     It seems to us, from our reading of Oshana’s evidence, that Oshana did not give evidence that everyone in a group near David Carty was involved in the second phase of the attack on David Carty. As we have already remarked, Oshana’s evidence was that he saw kicking for only a split second and he did not see who was doing the kicking. 
      
       
      
     106    
     Nor did the witness Ritzmann give evidence that everyone in a group near David Carty in the second phase of the attack was involved in the attack. Ritzmann was a barman at the Cambridge Tavern, who gave evidence that he had observed parts of both the first phase and the second phase of the attack on David Carty. He had assisted Michelle Auld in making her emergency telephone call, by providing one of the Tavern’s telephones. Ritzmann said that in between the two phases of the attack, he had himself been alone with David Carty, who was not moving and who he thought was already dead. Michelle Auld then came running out of the Tavern and “the same people started again… there would have been six or eight… kicking, jumping, stomping on his head”. Ritzmann did not say that everyone near David Carty joined in assaulting him.  
      
       
      
     107    
     On the appeal, as at the trial, the Crown relied very heavily on parts of the evidence of Michelle Auld as proving that everyone in a group near David Carty in the second phase of the attack was involved in attacking him. 
      
       
      
     108    
     Michelle Auld, reading from a statement she had made, gave the following evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         “As I came out the front door and I ran towards where Dave was between the cars where I saw about 10 young males of Arabic appearance and the person in par 15 moving their legs in a kicking motion towards Dave, who was on the ground. All of the male persons were striking and kicking motion to various parts of Dave’s body. 
         
        
        
         
         I was still running and as I came between the front of my car and the rear of Dave’s ute, I saw that Dave was laying on his back on the bitumen beside his car and I saw about 10 male persons still kicking Dave to various parts of his body and I saw his body moving. I then saw some of these persons commence to punch Dave with closed fists to various parts of his body. 
         
        
        
         
         I just snapped and I saw that Dave was in great danger and I ran to his assistance…” 
         
        
       
      
     109    
     Michelle Auld tried to push some of the young men away from David Carty. She was herself assaulted. She was punched on the left cheek and on the right side of her head. She said that moments after being punched on the head, she heard police cars arriving.  
      
       
      
     110    
     Michelle Auld later gave the following evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I would also like to clarify that all the people in the near vicinity of Dave were those people who were actually attacking Dave. I would estimate there were no people within a radius of about three to five metres who were not involved in the attack on Dave. I did not see any person assist Dave, other than the police or ambulance officers”. 
         
        
       
      
     111    
     Michelle Auld acted resourcefully in making the telephone call and also acted with great courage in attempting to come to the defence of David Carty. However, a number of criticisms can be made of the reliability or probative force of her evidence.  
      
       
        
       (i) It is likely that she was in a highly distressed state, when she re-entered the car park after making the telephone call. Ritzmann described her as “hysterical”, when she came running into the bar to make the telephone call.  
        
        
       (ii) After going out the door into the car park, she would have had only a very limited time for observation, before she herself entered the fray in an attempt to defend David Carty.  
        
        
       (iii) She did not identify the appellant as being a member of the group near David Carty. 
        
        
       (iv) The only person she did identify as being near David Carty was the person referred to in par15 of her statement, who was Thaier Sako. On the Crown case, Thaier Sako could not have been involved in the second phase of the attack on David Carty. 
        
        
       (v) The crucial evidence that there were no people within a radius of three to five metres of David Carty who were not involved in the attack on him was introduced by the words “I would estimate” and it is difficult to be sure what was meant by the assertion that all persons within a radius of three to five metres from David Carty, which would include persons too far away from David Carty to reach him, were “involved” in the attack.  
        
        
       (vi) There was a risk of the witness leaping to a conclusion, especially in the short time available for observation, that all of a number of persons, who were fairly close together and of similar ethnic appearance, were behaving in the same way. 
        
        
       (vii) Michelle Auld’s evidence is almost certainly inaccurate in some important respects. We have already referred to her evidence that Thaier Sako was involved in the second phase of the attack on David Carty. According to Michelle Auld’s evidence, she played no part in the first phase of the attack on David Carty. This evidence was contradicted by evidence from Ritzmann, that, when Michelle Auld ran into the bar wanting to make a telephone call, she had blood on her hands and that after she had used the telephone there was blood on the telephone. Furthermore, at about three o’clock on the morning of 18 April 1997 Michelle Auld had spoken to another police officer, who had made notes in his notebook. Michelle Auld had then told the other police officer:- 
        
        
         
         “About 10 or more males, most or all of Lebanese appearance, all pretty much dressed casually, jeans, jackets T-shirts, as they encircled him, they started throwing punches, all of them, I began to approach him and tried to push them away from Dave. I raced inside to call a Signal 1 soon after being hit. I made a quick call to Fairfield Police, raced outside and I saw Dave on the ground and they were laying the boot into Dave. I tried to pull them away and I was hit in the face and mouth by someone with a blue and white striped T-shirt. Police then arrived and everyone just stood around.” 
         
        
        
       In his final address the Crown Prosecutor conceded to the jury that “you might think she might have been (in the initial fight) and as a result of delayed shock she has forgotten some of it”. 
        
        
       (viii) Michelle Auld’s evidence that police cars arrived, only moments after she was punched in the head, is unlikely to be accurate. Several minutes would have elapsed before the police cars arrived. It is likely that after she was punched in the head she lost consciousness or otherwise suffered a memory loss. In his final address the Crown Prosecutor suggested to the jury that she had been rendered unconscious or dazed by the blow to the head.  
        
        
       (ix) There is a risk that Michelle Auld may have transferred some of her recollection of what happened from the first phase of the attack to the second phase of the attack. According to what she had told the other police officer shortly after the events happened, it was during the first phase of the attack, in which, on the Crown case, Thaier Sako did participate, that ten males were  
       all  
       (our emphasis) engaged in assaulting David Carty. 
        
       
      
     112    
     The witness Mr Davies gave evidence that he was a shift worker, who after finishing work on the night of 17 April had gone with a workmate to the Cambridge Tavern. Mr Davies witnessed events happening in the car park through a window in a bar facing the car park. He saw a person, who on the Crown case would have been David Carty, about twenty yards away from him. That person was being punched and kicked by a group of persons. He saw a person with blood on his shirt being dragged or carried towards the Tavern building. On the Crown case this person would have been Thaier Sako. Another four or five persons, who had been standing outside the door to the bar, ran to where the first person (David Carty) was still being punched and kicked by three or four men. There were then eight persons near the first person. Mr Davies saw kicking movements, which continued for three minutes. Not all of the group near the first person were doing kicking movements at the same time but they all appeared to Mr Davies to be kicking at some stage.  
      
       
      
     113    
     Mr Davies’ evidence would accordingly support a finding that all of a group of about eight persons near David Carty in the second phase of the attack were at some time or other during a period of about three minutes engaged in kicking David Carty. 
      
       
      
     114    
     The difficulty remains of whether the jury could be satisfied that it was at a stage during this period that Mr Davies was observing the group, that Oshana saw the appellant within a metre of David Carty. 
      
       
      
     115    
     A complicating factor was that there was evidence from a number of witnesses suggesting that at least at some times during the assaulting of David Carty there were a large number of persons in the car park. Mr Davies said that during the first phase of the attack there were “twentyish” persons in the group near David Carty. Mr Batterham, Mr Davies’ work mate, said that there was “coming and going” of persons near David Carty. “There were guys running around and that”. Ms Waight, a former nurse, who after hearing screaming went out into the car park to offer her assistance, said that at one stage she saw fifty to sixty people in the car park. Mr Nguyen, a patron at the Tavern, said that after Thaier Sako was injured he saw twenty or thirty men in the car park.  
      
       
      
     116    
     In our opinion, there are substantial weaknesses in the combination of the evidence of a number of witnesses, on which the Crown sought to rely as showing that during the second phase of the attack the appellant was one of a group of persons near David Carty, all of whom were at least some of the time kicking David Carty. 
      
       
      
     117    
     We have already considered the evidence relied on by the Crown as showing consciousness of guilt, in dealing with the second ground of appeal.  
      
       
      
     118    
     We have already expressed the opinion that the evidence relied on by the Crown as being evidence of flight was so deficient in establishing that there was any flight at all or that the reason for any flight was consciousness by the appellant of his own guilt that such evidence should not have been left to the jury as capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness of guilt. We have also expressed the opinion that the evidence of participation by the appellant in the burning of his brother’s pants should not have been left to the jury as capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness of his own guilt.  
      
       
      
     119    
     The other evidence allegedly showing consciousness of guilt was properly left to the jury. However, the extent to which it could properly be used by the jury as tending to establish the guilt of the appellant was diminished by the ready availability of an alternative explanation of his conduct, which was put to the jury a number of times by the trial judge, that the appellant was acting out of a consciousness, not of his own guilt, but of the guilt of his brother or possibly the guilt of other persons of the same ethnic background who had joined in attacking David Carty. 
      
       
      
     120    
     Bloodstains were found on the shoes the appellant had been wearing on the night of 17-18 April 1997. The blood was found on the laces and the lace hole of the right shoe and on the inner side of the sole of the left shoe. The total quantity of blood was very small. There was no evidence of any blood on the appellant’s socks or on any of his other clothing. On both shoes the blood found was mixed, that is of two types. The major part, with a high degree of probability, could have come from David Carty. The minor part, with a high degree of probability, could have come from Thaier Sako. 
      
       
      
     121    
     The Crown submitted that the evidence of blood on the appellant’s shoes could show that he had kicked “a bloodied area of the deceased” or that he was at least standing near David Carty, when David Carty was being kicked and was bleeding. 
      
       
      
     122    
     The probative force of the presence of blood, which was very likely David Carty’s, on the shoes the appellant was wearing was reduced by the circumstances that the quantity of blood was very small and that at both sites the blood was found to be mixed. It would be surprising, if blood from two independent sources, for example directly from David Carty and directly from Thaier Sako, had happened to get on precisely the same, small spots of the appellant’s shoes. An alternative explanation, which has considerable plausibility, would be that the blood of David Carty and the blood of Thaier Sako got on to the appellant’s shoes in the same spots, because those parts of the appellant’s shoes had come in contact with an object on which the blood of David Carty and the blood of Thaier Sako were already mixed. 
      
       
      
     123    
     On the hearing of the appeal the Crown sought to rely on evidence of scratches on the appellant’s neck when he was spoken to by police soon after the incident. However, Ms Capuyan, the manageress of the karaoke bar, gave evidence that she saw scratches on the appellant’s neck before the incident. The trial judge directed the jury that the evidence of scratches was “pretty neutral” and that “there was nothing to show that Richard did not have those scratches before the fight”. 
      
       
      
     124    
     In deciding whether the verdict of guilty cannot be supported, it is necessary to take into account that the appellant did not give evidence. He had of course been interviewed by the police and evidence of these interviews was before the jury. The co-accused Gilbert Adam also did not give evidence. 
      
       
      
     125    
     The trial judge directed the jury that the appellant was entitled to elect to say nothing and to make the Crown prove his guilt. The trial judge told the jury, among other things:- 
      
       
        
         
         “So then, the consequence is that you must not view silence by the accused here, or the fact they elected not to give evidence, as any admission of guilt on their part. There may be many reasons why an accused person does not want to give evidence and the safe course for you is not to speculate what those reasons might be. The situation is that you have the evidence of a number of people, you have the interviews with the accused, but you do not have any evidence from them here. That is a matter you can take into account when you come to consider whether you accept or reject the evidence of the Crown witnesses. The fact is, you have heard from them, you have not heard from the accused; which, I point out to you, is as far as it goes. You cannot infer any concern on the part of the accused, nor can you infer any guilt on their part for not giving evidence here.” 
         
        
       
      
     126    
     In the present case, there was a possible reason for the appellant not giving evidence, that, if he gave evidence, he would be compelled to give evidence incriminating his brother, the co-accused, in the murder of David Carty. 
      
       
      
     127    
     After conducting our own independent examination of the nature and quality of the evidence relied on by the Crown as establishing the direct liability of the appellant, we have concluded that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the appellant. 
      
       
        
       Accessorial Liability 
        
       
      
     128    
     To prove that the appellant, even if not himself kicking David Carty during the second phase of the attack, had been present intentionally assisting or encouraging a person or persons who were kicking David Carty, the Crown relied on the same four classes of evidence as the Crown relied on to prove direct liability. What we have already said about these classes of evidence in considering the direct liability of the appellant is equally applicable to accessorial liability. 
      
       
      
     129    
     It was also submitted on behalf of the appellant that, if the Crown was able to prove that the appellant was present while David Carty was being kicked by others but was unable to prove that the appellant had himself kicked David Carty, then, even if presence coupled with a readiness on the part of the appellant to assist or encourage would be sufficient for criminal liability, it was unclear what conduct the Crown could rely on as showing that the appellant was assisting or encouraging, as distinct from merely being present and not coming to the assistance of David Carty.  
      
       
      
     130    
     In our opinion, the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the appellant on the accessorial liability basis. 
      
       
      
     131    
     The assaulting and murder of David Carty were terrible crimes but the appellant could not be convicted (of any offence), unless the Crown proved his guilt of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. In our opinion, the fourth ground of appeal against conviction should be upheld, the appeal against conviction should be upheld, the conviction should be quashed and a judgment and verdict of acquittal entered. As we have upheld the appeal against conviction, it is unnecessary to deal with either appeal against sentence.

      REGINA v STEPHEN JOSEPH SCOTT 
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant, Mr Stephen Joseph Scott, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the Sydney District Court by his Honour Judge Christie on 12 November 1998.  
    2    Upon the calling of the application on for hearing this morning, by reason of circumstances beyond the control of this Court and beyond the control of the applicant, Mr Scott was not present during the time Mr Skinner of counsel made his oral submissions to us in addition to the thorough written submissions that have been lodged. An opportunity has been forwarded to Mr Skinner now to confer with the applicant and one outstanding matter in relation to the applicant having surrendered his driver's licence has been clarified. 
    3    On 23 July 1998 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge pursuant to section 52A of the Crimes Act, Dangerous Driving Occasioning Grievous Bodily Harm which carries the maximum of seven years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to a total term of four years imprisonment with a minimum term of two years commencing on 12 November 1998. The applicant had also been disqualified consequent upon the surrender of his licence from driving for a period of three years from 15 January 1998.  
    4    The facts of the matter as found by his Honour were:  
     
      
       
       “The appellant was working as a bus driver and had been for some not insignificant period of time and had finished a night shift. During the morning of the day on which his shift finished he took himself to a club at Menai where he remained until about four o’clock. During that period of time he consumed a large number of schooners of Victoria Bitter beer, he thinks somewhere perhaps six to eight. Insofar as he would have an accurate recollection, I would be prepared to accept that that might be fairly close to the mark. 
       
      
      
       
       He left the club obviously heavily under the influence of that beer. He travelled, before he eventually came to grief, as I shall hereafter describe, he travelled a distance along the road, on which the accident actually happened, of very nearly four kilometres and the statements of the various witnesses and the facts sheet submitted by the Crown paint a very disturbing picture of speed and dangerous driving involving, at very high speed, moving in and out of the two lanes of traffic heading in the same direction he was, tailgating other vehicles in an attempt to get around them and urge them out of his way. 
       
      
      
       
       Eventually where the two lanes become one lane he was attempting, it would appear on all the facts, to overtake somebody, thought better of it, came back in and clipped the back of that car which led that car, of course, to go on the wrong side of the road and collide with another car and then another car became involved in the collision also. 
       
      
      
       
       There was an estimate of speed given by one witness who eventually moved over to the left to let this prisoner past him, the estimate he gave was that the prisoner was driving at somewhere between 120 and 160 kilometres an hour as he went past him, that is when this particular driver pulled over to the left hand lane, in an effort to get out of his. 
       
      
      
       
       The facts are so disturbing that one would spend a long time up here to see a worse set of facts. One of the drivers, of course, was 
        (sic) 
        occasioned very serious injury, that is Mr Helmers, who was the driver of the Toyota and he suffered a fractured pelvis, a fractured spine and a punctured lung. 
       
      
      
       
       The breathalyser reading demonstrated 0.160 which, of course, is in the high range and demonstrative of a very significant intake of alcohol”. 
       
      
    5    The following can be noted from his Honour's remarks. His Honour observed the objective circumstances of the offence to be serious and disturbing and save for the intervention of mitigating factors would have, upon conviction, been an offence to which he said he would have applied a sentence of about six years. 
    6    Secondly, his Honour gave the applicant full credit for his plea of guilty reflecting contrition and remorse.  
    7    Thirdly, his Honour gave the applicant credit by way of the allocation of an extended time for the additional term by reason of special circumstances.  
    8    His Honour was cognisant of the applicant's driving record reflecting two charges of negligent driving, failure to stop after an accident, exceeding the speed limit on three occasions, consuming liquor on the road, not making a turn with safety, failing to stop after an accident and including, I happen to note if I have understood it correctly, one offence as a pedestrian in November 1995. 
    9    The applicant complains of the sentence imposed, and the submissions on his behalf have been concerned with the operation of the guideline judgment of this Court in Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. The nub of the complaint is that the circumstances of this case did not warrant in effect the doubling of the minimum total term of two years referred to by the Chief Justice in that guideline judgment for this particular offence. 
    10    It is argued that the fact of the four year sentence must indicate what is said to be a doubling-up of factors taken into account in reaching the guideline threshold of two years. There is, in my view, a risk that such a concept of doubling-up would neither conform with what the Chief Justice says in the passage cited below and could detract from the proper exercise of the still quite independently existing sentencing discretion his Honour the Chief Justice recognised.  
    11    The passage cited from the judgment of Spigelman CJ at 231B by counsel for the applicant is as follows:  
     
      
       
       “The list of mitigating and aggravating factors, conveniently collected by Lord Lane CJ in  
       R v Boswell 
        and quoted above, are reflected in the judgments of this Court to which I have made reference. The presence or absence of these factors — and their degree — will determine the appropriate penalty. A survey of the authorities indicates that the following factors arise: 
       
      
      
       
       (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
        
       (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
        
        
       (iii) Degree of speed. 
        
        
       (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
        
        
       (v) Erratic driving. 
        
        
       (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
        
        
       (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
        
        
       (viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
        
        
       (ix) Escaping police pursuit. 
       
      
      
       
       A number of these factors are reflected in the definition of “circumstances of aggravation” in s52A(7), for purposes of the two higher offences. 
       
      
      
       
       Para(i) and para(ii) focus on the occurrence, whereas para(iii)-para(ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence. 
        
       In my opinion this Court should promulgate the following guidelines: 
       
      
      
       
       1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
       
      
      
       
       2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
       
      
      
       
       I realise that the formulation I propose — does the relevant aggravating factor manifest, in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct — introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Nevertheless the formulation of the issue in such a way will serve the objective of consistency of sentencing with respect to conduct that the community has indicated plainly that it wishes to deter and condemn. 
       
      
      
       
       The period of three or two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence”. 
       
      
    12    The reference to and use of the word ""degree"" at the beginning of the cited passage, and the reference to and the use of the word ""intensity"" at the end of the cited passage are, to my mind, clear pointers to the independent sentencing discretion that still unquestionably is available to sentencing judges in respect of these offences. 
    13    The decision of the court in Jurisic is of course a guideline judgment. One thing it does not do is interfere with the sentencing judge's independent discretion based upon the objective circumstances of each case with which the particular judge is dealing. In the instant application, this observation is reinforced by the concession made for the applicant that the circumstances of this case clearly bring it within the first of the guidelines as laid down in Jurisic, namely, that there are not present such exceptional circumstances as to indicate other than a custodial sentence. It is conceded that the second so-called guideline applies: that there are circumstances of aggravation to a material degree, justifying a total sentence of at least two years. It is further conceded that it is difficult to argue against a finding that the threshold of abandoning responsibility had been reached by the applicant, given the high speed and erratic driving over the distance involved, with what must be remarked as the placing at risk of so many people, and of course the actual grievous bodily harm caused to the victim.  
    14    What are said to be specific errors are referred to in the submissions. There was no material available apparently that the victim suffered a ""fractured spine."" In the end, I am not persuaded that anything turns on that. As I understand it, that expression was in a document tendered before his Honour by consent. In any event, I do not consider the suffering of a fractured pelvis and a punctured lung on the part of the victim relevantly any less grievous bodily harm.  
    15    It is contended that his Honour was in error in holding that the factual situation was significantly worse than that which pertained in the case of Jurisic itself. His Honour was entitled to make a comparison of the objective facts and to come to a judgment about them. I, like counsel for the applicant, might not necessarily agree, but I do not consider that it exposes error. Rather, it reinforces the proper approach by his Honour to the determination of the seriousness of the objective facts of the case before him. I reject the specific submission that too much weight or additional weight was given to the evidence of the applicant's erratic and dangerous driving in the context of the section under which the charge was laid. 
    16    I expressly agree with his Honour's holding that but for the matters that mitigated the objective facts, the view was open that the circumstances would otherwise be considered as not far removed from the worst offence. 
    17    His Honour paid particular regard to the consideration which is of paramount importance in a case in respect of this offence, namely general deterrence. Offences under section 52A are public offences. Everyone has some idea of what they are about. Everyone is involved as a driver, passenger or pedestrian with what goes on on the highways and streets of this State. It is a very public crime. The public are entitled to have sentences imposed that make it perfectly clear that conduct of this kind in an environment in which so many of the public are involved in their daily affairs, will be appropriately punished. 
    18    Having considered over the adjournment and beforehand and during the course of them the submissions made by Mr Skinner for Mr Scott, I am not persuaded that there has been exposed any error at all, in my respectful view, in his Honour's remarks on sentence indicative of any mistake in the approach adopted by him with respect to the objective circumstances of the serious offence and the subjective considerations attending the applicant. 
    19    I propose that leave to appeal be refused. 
    20    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
    21    LEVINE J: The orders will therefore be as I propose.

     FRIDAY 6 AUGUST 1999 
     
     
      
      
      
      REGINA v GLENN GORDON KNOWLES 
      
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant appears in person today, seeking leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Shillington in the District Court on 4 December 1997. The applicant had pleaded guilty to the offence of robbery in company, for which s 97 of the Crimes Act provides a maximum penalty of twenty years penal servitude. There was taken into account on the Form 1 four counts of assault, one count of goods in custody, one count of fail to appear, one count of fail to comply with a bail undertaking and one count of malicious wounding. 
    2    The factual background appears to be that on 12 September 1991, the victim was crossing Anzac Parade at Maroubra. He had on his person his takings as a carpenter, being three and a half thousand dollars in fifty dollar bills. He was approached by two unknown persons, who forced him to the ground and held him while the applicant came and went through his pockets and removed the money. The applicant was later identified and arrested by the police on 15 October 1991 and granted bail on 5 December 1991.  
    3    His trial was not reached on two occasions, namely 19 August 1992 and 17 March 1993, and the applicant was stood over for trial on 25 August 1993, but the victim did not appear. The trial was stood over to 21 February 1994, but there was no appearance by the applicant.  
    4    Between 31 January 1994 and 13 November 1997, the applicant appeared before various courts in Queensland in relation to matters including fraud, possess dangerous drug and receiving. He was arrested in Queensland on 10 November 1997 in relation to this matter, taken into custody and extradited from that State on 18 November 1997. He pleaded guilty before Judge Shillington on 3 December 1997. 
    5    The sentence proceedings were adjourned to the following day by his Honour to clarify a matter that is still agitating this applicant, namely an assertion by him that he had been in custody in Queensland for some period of time since 1992. This application was before this Court on 12 March, on which occasion the applicant was unrepresented and when, as I understand it, Justices Simpson and Smart and the Crown became apprised of the query in the applicant's mind as to his custodial history in the State of Queensland, in the context of what was seen by their Honours as the potential application of certain legal principles that are in cases such as Mill v Regina (1988) 166 CLR 59; Regina v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517; Regina v Larson (1989) 44 A Crim R 121. 
    6    What was then put in train as far as this Court is concerned were inquiries made of the Queensland authorities, resulting in two affidavits being filed by Detective Senior Constable Matt Davey, one on 16 February 1999 and one on 13 May 1999, the last indicating that the earliest record of imprisonment found under the name of the applicant, also known as Brett Garry Edwards, was admission to the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre on 27 November 1996, an entry into bail on 23 April 1997, being remanded into custody on 19 June 1997, and the receipt by him of a three year wholly suspended sentence on 27 July 1997. An earlier letter from the Queensland Corrective Services Commission dated 15 February 1999 attached to the February 1999 affidavit again refers to the service of a period of detention at the Arthur Gorrie Correction Centre, with the following dates being recorded: admission, 27 November 1996; convicted for false pretences and sentenced to ten days; remanded until 24 April 1997 for charges of failing to appear on outstanding charges of false pretences; entered into bail 23 April 1997, remanded into custody for further charges of false pretences 19 June 1997; and on 18 July received a three year wholly suspended sentence for receiving, false pretences, misappropriation with the circumstance of aggravation, and attempted false pretences. Then there is a note that Mr Knowles was subsequently released. There is an apparently reconcilable coincidence between the dates referred to in the two letters from the Department of Corrective Services in Queensland. 
    7    The importance of the clarification of the applicant's custodial history is in the context of the assertion by the applicant that the effect of the sentence by the learned sentencing judge which was a minimum term of six years commencing on 10 November 1997 and an additional term of two years commencing on 10 November 2003, was to provide an overall total sentence of some eleven or so years, as I understand it.  
    8    The reason why the case was adjourned in March 1999 was to enable the applicant properly to explore what their Honours perceived to be a matter requiring investigation and which could conceivably affect the outcome of Mr Knowles' application for leave to appeal. Nothing of that kind has eventuated. A document has been produced to the court today, being a printout from the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services, (Conviction, Sentence and Appeals), that in relation to the relevant period indicates admission to the Metropolitan Remand Centre on 19 November 1997. Prior to that there was a remand on bail on 7 May 1992. In other words, there is a gap of five years roughly, and it is into that gap the applicant has asserted there should be inserted some period of custody in Queensland dating from 1992 but in respect of which there is no evidence before us. 
    9    His Honour's remarks on sentence in the instant application are brief. His Honour quite appropriately expressed some concern at the inclusion in the Form 1 of the charge of malicious wounding, but accepted in the light of certain facts placed before him that it was not inappropriate for that offence to be so included. I would add that the Particulars of Trial for the purposes of this application include in standard form the applicant's antecedents, which I will say are very, very extensive and serious. There is a reference to the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment of three years being suspended for four years in the Brisbane District Court on 18 July 1997, and the only other entry prior to that relevant to the issue in doubt is on 31 January 1994, Southport Magistrate's Court, attempted false pretences, and a fine was imposed. 
    10    His Honour described the offence as a very serious breach of the peace. His Honour had regard to lengthy records in this State and also entries in Queensland, the applicant's then age of thirty-six and the fact that his criminal career was to a great extent concerned with dishonesty. His Honour then dealt with the matter then raised by the applicant in his Court, later in this Court and again today, and pointed to his receiving information on adjourning the sentence that coincides, in reality, with what this Court has received today. His Honour proceeded on the basis that the applicant had been in custody since 10 November, and took into account that the applicant was in custody for some fifty-two days after his initial arrest on 15 October 1991 until 5 December 1991. His Honour quite clearly adopted the appropriate approach to the objective gravity of the offence.  
    11    As the Crown has submitted, in the context of the offence having been committed in 1991 and sentence imposed in 1997, given the history to which I have referred, particularly a failure to appear, any question of delay should not operate in favour of the applicant. Drug dependence at the time is not a mitigating factor in robbery offences. There was a degree of planning and pre-meditation resulting in the ambush of the victim which reflected the utmost gravity of the crime for which the applicant was sentenced. The effect on family members of the prison sentence is not usually taken into account unless there are extraordinary or exceptional circumstances. 
    12    The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Shillington was a sentence of some severity, but one which conformed with the objective seriousness of the offence and one in respect of which his Honour took into account appropriate subjective matters. Any preoccupation his Honour displayed in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence in relation to this particular offender cannot be the subject of criticism. 
    13    I propose that in view of the fact that this matter has twice been before this Court and that an opportunity was afforded to explore the area of uncertainty to which I have referred that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    14    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
    15    LEVINE J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

     DETERMINATION 
      
       
      
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: This is an application under s 13A of the  
     Sentencing Act 
      for redetermination of a life sentence imposed by me after the applicant was convicted by a jury of murder in 1994. As I have formed a firm conclusion as to the outcome of this application, I propose to deal with it forthwith. No doubt I could express myself more fully and felicitously were I to reserve my judgment but for a number of reasons I have elected to take the course of dealing with the matter by giving this ex tempore judgment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant lodged his application some considerable time ago. There seems to me to be no reason to add to his anxiety concerning what the ultimate outcome should be by reserving my decision when I have, as I have said, reached a conclusion about the matter. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The second reason why I think it is appropriate to deal with the matter now is I have been informed that there are relatives of the deceased victim present in Court and I think it is appropriate that they should hear the reasons I express for the course I am going to take. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It scarcely needs any comment from me to observe that an innocent life was taken by this crime. In my remarks on sentence in 1994 I made some observations about what I then called the forensic history of both the applicant and some former co-accused. Those remarks may be taken as incorporated in what I say today. 
      
       
      
     5     
     In broad terms five young men including the applicant invaded, to use a currently popular term, a house across the road from the residence of an acquaintance of theirs which had been the subject of a robbery. Apparently amongst other things items such as a video recorder and television were alleged to have been taken. The residents of the house were a family. In addition, the victim and his partner resided in a caravan at the rear of the house. When the invading group came to the house, the young man who resided in the caravan simply came forward in order to see what the commotion was about. In the course of this, the applicant stabbed him. This fatality was of course totally unnecessary. 
      
       
      
     6     
     In the course of legal proceedings, one of the five invaders was given immunity in order to provide evidence against the others. Without again detailing all the various trials and appeals, the ultimate outcome was that apart from the applicant no person was punished for this crime. In a sense of course the applicant merited punishment because he was the one who produced the knife and caused the fatality. 
      
       
      
     7     
     At the time of sentence I declined to find that there were mitigating circumstances such as would have reduced the culpability of the applicant so as to justify my then imposing upon him a sentence less than the mandatory life term. The mandatory life term however must be viewed in the context of its application up until the passage of the  
     Sentencing Act 
      1989. Prisoners sentenced to life penal servitude were routinely released on ticket of leave in a continuing practice dating virtually from the European settlement of this State in 1788. The nature of the tickets of leave was that such persons were on parole unless a special order was made by the governor terminating the conditional nature of liberty.  
      
       
      
     8     
     The relevance of that history at the moment is that but for the passage of the  
     Sentencing Act 
      the applicant would have reasonably expected to have been considered for release upon ticket of leave at some time after serving a significant portion of his sentence. The  
     Sentencing Act 
      itself reflects this in the sense that it makes available an application such as this after at least eight years' imprisonment has been served. 
      
       
      
     9     
     In the present case, the applicant has been in custody since late in the evening of 28 September 1988. He was first before a court on the following day and pursuant to the order I made in 1994 his sentence dates from then. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The  
     Sentencing Act 
      and the general law require me to take into account a number of matters, particularly subjective matters concerning the applicant. It should be emphasised at the outset that my setting of a minimum term as I have indicated I intend to do does not of itself operate as an order for release of the applicant on the expiry of that period. It will remain ultimately a decision for the parole authorities to determine when within the ambit of the total sentence the applicant can appropriately be released into the community.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Thus I turn to some subjective matters concerning the applicant. His background shares the tragedy of many migrants to this country who came here looking for a new life after the ravages of the Vietnam conflict. Apart from his wife, to whom I will make later reference, he has no really close family ties in this country. His background was that his family were fisherfolk. At the time of the sentencing proceedings in 1994 I was provided with information as to how the applicant first at about the age of fourteen came into contact with intoxicating liquor. It appears that it was the practice of the fishermen when the weather was too rough to put out to sea to tend to their nets and spend their time, perhaps for days on end, drinking fortified liquor such as rice wine. Later when he came to Australia the applicant began to partake of other forms of intoxicating liquor and Dr Barclay, whose assessment I found then and I find now to have been most helpful, said that in general terms the applicant could have been described in 1988 as an alcoholic. No doubt he was considerably affected at the time of committing this crime. 
      
       
      
     12     
     It appears that during his incarceration he has recovered from alcoholism although this has been replaced to an extent by participation in drug ingestion. I infer that he was able to obtain drugs whilst a prisoner. It is notorious that in the prison system in this State drugs are obtained by prisoners. Indeed, frustrated at the apparent lack of listing of his application for redetermination, in February this year the applicant mixed a cocktail of drugs and undertook what I assess to be a suicide attempt. Self-evidently this was unsuccessful but it gives an indication of the feelings of the applicant as at the time. 
      
       
      
     13     
     His prior record, that is to say prior to his arrest on this matter, is by no means admirable. As Mr Thompson for the Crown has reminded me, he had been released on parole but a few days before he committed this terrible crime. 
      
       
      
     14     
     After his arrest he was interviewed by police. His responses were unusual, indeed unique to my experience, in that from time to time one finds persons who are the focus of allegation who deny the matters put to them; one finds people who admit them. In this case, the applicant said he had no memory of the event but in effect if his friends said he had done it, then he accepted he had. He has maintained that posture to the present time. He has said that he has no recollection of this event but he accepts from the evidence of others that he must have done so. Given his consistent and steady adherence to that posture and given the expressions of remorse that he has made, I accept that that is the true situation. 
      
       
      
     15     
     I said that I would turn to the situation concerning the applicant's wife. A young woman, now Olian Le, had been at school with the applicant. She is a native of Cambodia but now an Australian citizen. She came to know of the plight of the applicant serving his sentence through a family contact. There is evidence from her on affidavit. I find that evidence quite impressive. The material set out therein demonstrates a balanced young woman, anxious to set up a regular and lasting relationship with her husband. She did not rush into marriage with the applicant and indeed it was something over three years before she accepted his proposal. She has stated that she only agreed to marriage when she had satisfied herself that he had changed from his past and would be a good husband and had an understanding of the bad things that he had done in the past. This young woman has set up a home just over the Queensland border. She has employment. She supplements her income by some sewing and dressmaking work. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The applicant himself has commendable reports concerning his work history whilst in prison. There are a number of prison offences but I do not regard them as critical in the current circumstances. His work history shows that he has diligently applied himself to work in the textile industry conducted in the gaol and has become an efficient and effective self-taught sewing machine mechanic. That skill will undoubtedly complement his wife's industry and intentions as to occupation. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The applicant was twenty two years of age at the time of the offence. He has now been in custody nearly eleven years. As I am required to do by the  
     Sentencing Act 
     , I take into account the previous practice concerning release on licence and I also take into account my own knowledge of the range of sentence which is generally imposed for offences of murder. No two offences are identical and I do not suggest that there is anything approaching a tariff for offences such as this. It would appear however that the applicant has, after a stormy period whilst in gaol initially and particularly in the period prior to the second trial over which I presided in 1994, set upon a path of genuine attempt at rehabilitation. He should therefore have the opportunity to demonstrate that he can contribute to society as a useful and law abiding citizen. 
      
       
      
     18     
     I am not bound to divide sentence into minimum and additional terms in accordance with s 5(2) of the  
     Sentencing Act  
      when dealing with a matter pursuant to s 13A. I indicated to counsel during exchange that I had in mind setting a longer total term of imprisonment but setting a minimum term which will expire within a foreseeable time, emphasising of course as I have said earlier that it will be for the parole authorities to decide whether or not the applicant is actually ready for release. He is presently still at B classification although he has apparently remained frozen, as it were, in that classification because the current matter has been pending now for over two years. It will be necessary for him to pass through the C classifications and to see whether or not he can be trusted for example upon work release and other leave. 
      
       
      
     19     
     In setting a long additional term, it is not my expectation that the applicant will necessarily require supervision during the whole of the term. Nevertheless, I think it appropriate that such term should be of remaining potential so that in the event that he does not fulfil the promise that he currently gives, he will understand that he may be returned to serve the balance of the total sentence.  
      
       
      
     20     
     Hiep Van Em Le, for the murder of Alan Stanley Ball, in lieu of the sentence of penal servitude for life which I imposed upon you on 14 October 1994, I sentence you to a total term of twenty years' penal servitude, to commence on 29 September 1988. That sentence is to comprise a minimum term of twelve years commencing on 29 September 1988 and to expire on 28 September 2000 AD, together with an additional term of eight years commencing on 29 September 2000. You will first become eligible for parole on 28 September 2000.

     Reasons for judgment 
      
      
      
     1      
     HIS HONOUR 
     : In February 1998 the plaintiff was charged with indecent assault upon his six-year-old daughter and committing an act of indecency with her. It is because of the nature of the charges, and his relationship to the complainant, that I have already ordered that his name not be published. On 6 July 1998 committal proceedings in respect of those charges were listed for hearing, but were terminated in the plaintiff’s favour without any evidence being presented. However, the learned magistrate declined to award him costs, having considered the evidence against him in the light of the restrictions upon an order for costs imposed by s41A(2A) of the  
     Justices Act  
     1902. In this Court, the plaintiff seeks declaratory and other relief in relation to that order. 
      
       
      
     2      
     It is necessary to examine the manner in which the proceedings were terminated, because counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions in this Court submitted that the magistrate had no power to make an order for costs in any event. When the magistrate called the matter on 6 July 1998, the solicitor then appearing for the Director announced that his instructions were to seek leave to withdraw the informations. His Worship asked senior counsel then appearing for the plaintiff (who did not appear in this Court) if he objected to that course. The transcript records that counsel replied, “I’ve no objection to the charges - to the defendant being discharged in each case if your Worship pleases.” His Worship said that he would note that the matters were “withdrawn and dismissed”. Senior counsel applied for costs, to which the solicitor for the Director responded with the argument advanced in this Court. He submitted that there was no power to award costs as the informations had been dismissed following upon their being withdrawn. As he put it, “It wasn’t a question of not offering evidence.” 
      
       
      
     3      
     The matter was stood down to later in the day for further argument, but for some reason that part of the proceedings was not recorded and a transcript of it is not available. However, I have the benefit of evidence on affidavit about what occurred. A number of documents were tendered for the purpose of the argument, including material from the police brief of evidence. The tape recording of the morning’s proceedings was played and it was noted that, when asked if he objected to the withdrawal of the informations, senior counsel for the plaintiff had said that he did not object to his client being discharged. It seems that his Worship interpreted that to mean that he agreed to the plaintiff being discharged under s41 of the 
      Justices Act 
      on the basis that the prosecution offered no evidence. He announced that he would rescind his earlier order that the informations be dismissed, having been withdrawn. The solicitor for the Director then offered no evidence and his Worship ordered that the plaintiff be discharged. On the charge coversheet he crossed out his original notation, “withdrawn, dismissed”, and substituted the words “Def. discharged”. 
      
       
      
     4      
     His Worship gave judgment the following day, and at the beginning of his reasons he noted that there had been “some initial confusion as to the status” of the proceedings but that, upon listening to the tape recording of the exchange the previous morning, the scope of senior counsel’s agreement about the disposition of the matter was “obvious”. That being so, his Worship went on, the solicitor for the Director had “quite properly” offered no evidence and the plaintiff had been discharged. In paragraph two of these reasons I have summarised the transcript of what occurred on the morning of 6 July, and I must say that the position taken by senior counsel for the plaintiff at that time is not entirely clear. Certainly, his Worship could be forgiven for having understood that there was consent to the withdrawal of the informations. However that may be, there was a misunderstanding which, it seems, was resolved in the afternoon.  
      
       
      
     5      
     Nevertheless, the solicitor for the Director offered no evidence only after his Worship announced that he intended to rescind his earlier order. The solicitor submitted that his Worship was  
     functus officio 
      when he made that order and marked the papers accordingly. The same submission was developed by counsel for the Director in this Court, who argued that that was the case even if his Worship had allowed the informations to be withdrawn under a misapprehension that senior counsel for the plaintiff consented to that course. That being so, his Worship had no power later to change the order disposing of the proceedings, or to make an order for costs.  
      
       
      
     6      
     Reliance was placed upon authority that a magistrate is  
     functus officio 
      once he or she has announced conviction and sentence or has dismissed an information unless, for one reason or another, the proceedings were a nullity:  
     R v Essex Justices, Ex parte Final 
      [1962] 3 All ER 924;  
     Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece 
      (1966) 85 WN(NSW) 151 at 158;  
     Thomas v Bell 
      (1989) 42 ACrim R 318 at 320-1. Proceedings might be a nullity if, for example, a defendant were denied natural justice.  
     Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece 
      was such a case. Other cases were summarised by Yeldham J in the passage of his judgment in  
     Thomas v Bell 
      to which I have referred. Counsel for the Director submitted that there was no basis upon which the present proceedings could be held to have been a nullity, so that the magistrate’s order permitting the informations to be withdrawn and dismissing them was valid and final.  
      
       
      
     7      
     It is necessary at this stage to determine the nature of the proceedings before the magistrate. It is clear that they were committal proceedings, not a summary hearing. The charges which the plaintiff faced are included in Table 1 to Part 9A of the  
     Criminal Procedure Act 
      1986. By s33C(1) of that Act they would have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court unless the Director or the plaintiff had elected to have them dealt with on indictment. While there is no evidence before me directly on the point, such an election must have been made by at least one of them. It was common ground before me that the charges were listed for committal proceedings and it was upon that basis that his Worship approached the question of costs. 
      
       
      
     8      
     The position is materially different from that which Studdert J considered in  
     Dargin v Simpson  
     (unreported, 24 September 1990: affirmed by the Court of Appeal, unreported, 7 February 1992). In that case his Honour was dealing with the regime under ss495 and 497 of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1900 whereby certain offences were to be dealt with summarily unless the magistrate declined to do so. There, the question whether a charge should be dealt with on indictment was a matter for the discretion of the court, not the election of the parties, so that Studdert J concluded (at p12) that “proceedings under s495 are not to be characterised  
     ab initio 
      as committal proceedings…”.  
      
       
      
     9      
     The power to award costs of committal proceedings in favour of a defendant derives from s41A of the  
     Justices Act 
     . For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that that power arises when a magistrate makes “an order discharging a defendant as to the information then under inquiry”: s41A(1)(a). Section 41(2) provides that a magistrate must discharge the defendant if he or she is not of the opinion that “the evidence is capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed an indictable offence…”. Alternatively, s41(6) provides that a magistrate must discharge the defendant if he or she is not of the opinion that “there is a reasonable prospect that a jury would convict the defendant of an indictable offence…”. In either event, the defendant is discharged “as to the information then under inquiry”. 
      
       
      
     10      
     If the magistrate were  
     functus officio 
      when he allowed the informations to be withdrawn, there is no doubt that he had no power to award costs. In  
     Reg v Phipps: Ex parte Alton  
     [1964] 2 QB 420, a magistrate had granted leave to an informant to withdraw an information, there being no objection by counsel for the defendant. The matter had been listed for committal proceedings. The question for the Court of Appeal was whether the magistrate had power to award costs to the defendant under either of two statutory provisions conferring such a power upon “examining justices” who had determined “not to commit the accused for trial”. The Court held that the magistrate did not have that power as the information had been withdrawn. As Lord Parker CJ put it (at 426), “I do not think that on March 7, 1962, when the case was called on, the time ever came when the magistrate began to inquire into any offence”. His Lordship added (at 427), “…an application for withdrawal and the consent to the withdrawal is in no sense a part of an inquiry if it be an indictable offence or a summary trial if it be a summary offence”. His Lordship went on (at 428) to observe that a court has a discretion whether to allow an information to be withdrawn, one of the factors relevant to the exercise of that discretion being the defendant’s desire to recover costs. 
      
       
      
     11      
     The Court of Appeal’s decision has been applied in this Court:  
     Lay v Cleary  
     (James J, unreported 23 February 1993) at pp17-19. James J held that a magistrate who permits an information to be withdrawn cannot order the defendant to be discharged under s41 of the  
     Justices Act 
     , as he does not have the information “under inquiry” within the meaning of subs (2) and (6) of that section. Accordingly, there is no power to order costs under s41A. His Honour also concluded, after an examination of authority in this country and in England, that a magistrate who allows an information to be withdrawn in summary proceedings has no power to award costs to the defendant under s81 of the Act. Clearly, the position is otherwise when the prosecution offers no evidence, whether in committal proceedings or at a summary hearing. In that event, a defendant in a summary hearing is entitled to an order dismissing the information under s80 and may apply for costs under s81:  
     Lay v Cleary  
     at pp31-2. Equally, a defendant in committal proceedings is entitled to discharge under s41 and to seek costs under s41A. So much was recognised by Lord Parker CJ in relation to the English procedure in  
     Phipps  
     at 428. 
      
       
      
     12      
     The crucial question remains, then, whether the magistrate in the present case was  
     functus officio 
      when he recorded that the informations had been withdrawn and dismissed. This is not an easy matter to resolve. It is true that, when his Worship expressed his intention to deal with the matter in that way, senior counsel for the plaintiff did not protest that that was not the course to which he had consented. Nevertheless, he had said that he had no objection to the defendant being “discharged” and, no doubt, he was mindful of the significance of that expression in the relevant provisions of the Act. Moreover, he immediately announced his intention to apply for costs and I cannot believe that counsel of his great experience was unaware of the fact that the magistrate had no power to make such an order if the informations were withdrawn. As I have said, there was a misunderstanding and, in the light of what occurred when the matter was resumed in the afternoon, it is clear that his Worship would not have allowed the informations to be withdrawn if he had understood that that course was objected to. 
      
       
      
     13      
     Was the magistrate’s earlier order, then, a nullity? Unsurprisingly, I was not referred to any case directly on point. What concerns me is that his Worship made that order under a misapprehension that it was consented to. No doubt, if he had not been under that misapprehension, he would have invited senior counsel for the plaintiff to put submissions in opposition to the informations being withdrawn. In the light of what happened later, it is likely that he would then have refused leave for them to be withdrawn and have required the solicitor for the Director to elect whether or not to offer evidence. The situation is very different from that with which the Court of Appeal was dealing in  
     Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece  
     (supra). Nevertheless, there is a sense in which it could be said that the plaintiff was denied natural justice at that stage, albeit in circumstances in which no fault could be imputed to the learned magistrate. 
      
       
      
     14      
     Before me, the parties agreed that I should determine this question before hearing argument about the exercise of his Worship’s discretion in refusing the order for costs. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to hold that the magistrate was  
     functus officio 
      when he recorded that the informations had been withdrawn and dismissed and that, accordingly, his later order that the plaintiff be discharged is of no effect. The proceedings in this Court must be determined on their merits. While I have the benefit of written submissions from the parties, they should have the opportunity to develop those in oral argument.

      REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: I have reached the conclusion that on the evidence before me the present application - which is an application by the Crown to take certain evidence by video link - should not be granted. 
    2   The motion seeking an order to allow the taking of audio-visual evidence came before me today, 2 September, notice having been given only as recently as the last day or two of the month of August 1999. Slightly earlier, informal notice had been given, I am advised by the Crown Prosecutor. That informal advice at best would have put the defence on notice that the Crown might be minded to make the application. The defence objects to the proposed course. 
    3   The application has been brought at the death knell of a lengthy process following the accused's apprehension and extradition to Australia in which he arrived on 17 May 1998, since when he has been subject to committal proceedings, arraignment in this court, and detention, bail refused on charges of murder of his wife and two children. 
    4   The murders are said to have occurred some time on or after 17 October 1996 and before 27 August 1997. The accused left Australia for Korea on 29 October 1996. He apparently travelled with Miss Hwang, his girlfriend, who had been his girlfriend between October 1995 and October 1996. 
    5   Miss Hwang is a Korean national ordinarily resident in Korea. It is said that whilst she was present in Australia, she had a liaison with the accused during which she provided a suitcase in which, so it is said, the remains of the victims were found; accompanied him to a place at which that suitcase, presumably containing those remains, was dumped; advertised for sale the property of the deceased or at least property in which the deceased had a matrimonial interest; assisted with the uttering of forged instruments to obtain, by fraud, from bank accounts of the deceased and the deceased's children, monies; and was otherwise involved in conversations with the accused, such that her evidence of them would be highly incriminatory of him. This evidence might be critical, one might think, in the absence of hearing the rest of the evidence against the accused, to the trial. 
    6   With a degree of understatement, the affidavit of the Crown's instructing solicitor refers to her as ""an important witness"" in the Crown case. In that affidavit are chronicled attempts to obtain the testimony of Miss Hwang. It appears that shortly prior to the committal, an investigating officer became aware Miss Hwang was not prepared to travel back to the committal from Korea. The prosecution did hold a statement of hers. It had been served but no other steps were taken at the committal, or subsequent to the committal until this present application to secure her testimony in any form in which it might be provided to a jury. 
    7   The defence contends that, in the absence of consent from the accused, I lack the power to make the order and should not, having regard to the correspondence seeking to persuade her to come to Australia and give evidence, or to provide testimony by audio-visual link, which, it is said, is misleading, in particular in relation to an indemnity that correspondence refers to which seems to suggest she has achieved a wholesale immunity from prosecution when, in fact, the evidence before me suggests that that immunity is so limited as not to protect her from a charge in Australia in the event of direct involvement in the murder. 
    8   Whether it be the case that this correspondence is misleading, and whether it be the case or not that I have power under the Rules and, in particular, Part 36 Rule 2(a)(i) of the Supreme Court Rules (although I need not decide it, I interpolate I would think I do, since the rule is hardly there to provide only for the case of consent, as in such circumstances the evidence might be taken by that means and admitted for that reason), I have come to the firm conclusion, I should nonetheless refuse the application. I consider that, in the absence of evidence persuading me of the willingness of the witness to give evidence by means of audio-visual link and to give evidence truthfully and in accordance with some such sanction as an oath, to which the provisions of Part 7 Chapter 4 of the Crimes Act 1900 might apply, having regard to the disadvantages that might occur to an accused which are set out at some length in the decision of his Honour Justice Badgery-Parker in Regina v. Too (unreported 26 July 1996), even if I had power, the damages of permitting such a witness to testify in these circumstances are too high. 
    9   The Evidence Act, s.21, requires evidence to be given subject to an oath or affirmation. That oath or affirmation is to be understood as an oath or affirmation which might attract the operation of the relevant provisions of Divison 7. True it is that the oath or affirmation might have, in the individual case, powerful spiritual or personal significance. I, however, have no evidence as to that as applying to the potential witness. The Crown concedes that, where she is, no other sanction would attach to the oath. 
    10   I am confined, when attempting to ascertain the testimony of the witness to her two statements of evidence, the second taken through the assistance of an interpreter and produced in transcript form, and to consider the circumstances in which she came to be involved in the events surrounding these killings. It is inevitable that her evidence will be attacked. It is inevitable that criminality, and indeed serious criminality, will have to be canvassed with her. That may extend so far as suggesting to her a direct involvement in these killings. I am cognisant that the community's interests in a trial for a crime so serious as this demand every lawful and proper opportunity be given to the Crown to bring forward all evidence that is relevant, apparently reliable, and might tend to disclose the truth to a jury. I do not, by this judgment, exclude the Crown from putting forward the evidence if it can do so by some technique which will ensure that the evidence meets the requirements to which other evidence is subject to enable it to be properly appreciated by a jury and properly tested in a matter of such significance. 
    11   But, I cannot say, from the evidence before me, that I am satisfied that the witness will give evidence honestly, and will give evidence in such a way as to satisfy these requirements. Indeed the evidence before me rather requires me, even to infer that the video link facilities will provide an adequate technical mode of putting the material before the jury, a matter which would be of some considerable significance if the rules to which I have referred were to be applied. 
    12   The test requires a balancing of the interests to which I have referred - a fair trial for the accused, and a fair trial for the Crown - that is whether the use of the video link evidence in these circumstances would advance the course of justice. 
    13   Accepting the importance of the testimony and the possibility that the testimony may well be unreliable, at least in significant aspects, it does not seem to me that I can, in those circumstances, receive the testimony by a means such that it is given without the sanction of the criminal law of New South Wales and it is conceded both that the legal sanction of the oath would be so limited that it would not apply to the witness unless she were prepared voluntarily to come back within the New South Wales jurisdiction and that there is no equivalent local sanction. 
    14   I give this ruling now, rather than reserving to express the reasons more adequately or to deal more widely with the very wide-ranging arguments that have been presented, since this trial is due to commence before me on Monday and the jury is to be empanelled at least by Wednesday or earlier if it may be. 
    15   Since this is an interlocutory ruling, it will be open to the Crown to renew the application if it can do so at a future time, if it can put forward a mode of obtaining the evidence which will serve the interests of justice. But, in that regard, it should be clear that I will have in mind, should the application be renewed, that apparently a deliberate choice was made, albeit the choice may have been reluctant, not to secure the testimony or to permit the defence to test it at the committal stage, or indeed at any time prior to now. It has been conceded, and very properly by the learned Crown Prosecutor, that, were the testimony to be advanced, then the defence would be entitled, at least on nominated issues, to a preliminary examination of that testimony by way of a pre-trial or mini-trial. In the event the application is to be renewed, then consideration will have to be given as to whether the testimony can be secured with fairness to the accused, having that in mind. 
    16   At present, on the state of the evidence before me, I am not prepared to make the order sought in the motion, and dismiss the motion.

       Judgment 
       
       
      
    2    WINDEYER J:  The appellant Vincent Naudi was indicted on 11 charges before His Honour Judge J.B. Phelan in the District Court Port Macquarie on 18 August 1997. Nine of these charges alleged sexual intercourse with a female person under the authority of the appellant and under the age of sixteen years during the period from 1990 to November 1994. The complainant, the complainant, was born on 1 February 1979. Eight of the charges related to alleged acts of intercourse in 1994. One charge alleged assault in 1994 and the appellant pleaded guilty to that charge. The final charge alleged assault of the complainant occasioning actual bodily harm to her some time between 20 May 1994 and 25 May 1994 at Port Macquarie. 
     
      
    3    The trial began before the jury on 18 August 1997. The appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges except that of assault referred to. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all charges on 22 August 1997. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to (a) a fixed term of six months commencing on the date of sentence on the charge to which there was a plea of guilty (b) to a fixed term of one year on the charge of assault occasioning actually bodily harm; (c) in relation to all charges of sexual intercourse a minimum term of six years commencing on 8 February 1997 and an additional period of two years expiring on 7 February 2005.  
     
      
    4    The appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence. While there is a general appeal against sentence no argument was addressed to the sentences on the assault charges, it not being suggested they were excessive. Both terms have, of course, expired. 
     
      
    5    The Crown case was that the complainant had lived with the accused and his then wife from the age of about ten or eleven after her mother had died in 1990. She moved to Port Macquarie from Sydney there apparently being no one else who was willing to care for her, or at least she having that view. Sharon Lesley Robb, as she is now known, was married to the appellant. She had been a close friend of the complainant's mother. She and the appellant had two children, Jye born in 1987 and Tristan born in 1994. During the time The complainant lived with them they lived, first in two flats in succession in Port Macquarie and finally in a house in Port Macquarie. From time to time Mr. & Mrs. Robb, the parents of Sharon Robb, went to Port Macquarie to help look after the children when their daughter went to Sydney for treatment required as a result of an accident. Mr & Mrs. Robb lived at Sawtell and the appellant and his family, including The complainant, often stayed with them there. 
     
      
    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    6    Ground 10. The learned trial judge erred in comments in respect of the coat hanger incident 
     
      
    7    It is convenient to deal first with the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm as it is separate from all other allegations which relate to sexual misconduct. This was the third charge. There was uncontested evidence that on many occasions the appellant, after arguments with the complainant, told her to pack her bags and leave Port Macquarie and go to Sydney. Sometimes she did leave and go to Sydney and sometimes she stayed. When she did leave, the appellant always asked her to return. On the occasion in question in May 1994 the complainant said that because she would not do what the appellant wanted her to do he required her to leave, that as she was packing her clothes and he was throwing clothes into her bag that he pushed her through a wardrobe and picked up a coat hanger and stabbed on her lower right calf with it. The appellant who gave evidence did not dispute that he had thrown the clothes at her, but said that somehow the coat hanger must have been among the clothes. He said he had no intention whatever of injuring her with it. The appellant complains the judge's summing up was confusing. The relevant part appears on page 15 where the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        But for the Crown to prove its case first of all it must prove that there was a striking or an application of force, that is without consent. 
         
         
        It is not suggested by Mr. Pullinger that there was any consent to the act. That it was intentional, and that it was without lawful excuse. Now a person in the position of authority, and it is not disputed that the accused was here, in effect, the father of the complainant, it is not suggested that in this case that the act as The complainant said took place, he was offering her some parental chastisement. That hasn't been put in this case. It might be an explanation which would mean that it would be done with lawful excuse, but it is not suggested in this case at all. 
        
       
      
    8    Counsel for the appellant submitted that this would indicate a direction or statement to the jury that the act was intentional and without lawful excuse. It is clear that the passage as printed does not give a true picture of the passage as heard by the jury. The only problem is with the punctuation introduced in the transcription The passage would have flowed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        But for the Crown to prove its case first of all it must prove there was a striking or any application of force that is without consent (it is not suggested by Mr. Pullinger there was any consent to the act), that it was intentional, and that it was without lawful excuse. 
        
       
      
    9    If there was any possible doubt it must have been dispelled by the direction on page 16 of the summing up where the learned judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        So the things that have to be proved by the Crown that there was first of all a striking, and application of force, without her consent; It must be proved it was intentional, not accidental and the accused does not deny in this case there was a coat hanger incident. 
        
       
      
    10    The requirement to find intent was reiterated on the next page. 
     
      
    11    The summing up was not unclear as asserted. This ground fails. 
     
      
    Sexual intercourse charges12    These charges relate to a series of incidents as I have said occurring for the most part in 1994. In fact the complainant in evidence said that there was intercourse on many more occasions over a period of years, but said she had been asked to identify particular occasions by means of relating these to particular incidents or events in the home or in the family or to particular outside activities. There was evidence of physical contact such as back scratching and massage, which the trial judge said might be described as introductory acts before the first alleged act, the subject of charge, is said to have taken place. The first charge related to an incident said to have taken place at Sawtell during the school holidays after Christmas 1990 at the home of Mr. & Mrs. Robb senior. The third charge relates to an alleged incident at Port Macquarie when, according to the complainant, late at night the appellant went to her bedroom, got in beside her and lay beside and inserted his penis into her vagina, she having her back to him. The fifth count alleged an incident of fellatio on an occasion when Sharon had taken Jye to a t-ball game and the appellant and the complainant were left in the house alone or perhaps with Tristan. The sixth count alleged an incident early in the morning before the appellant was to go on an early morning fishing expedition, this again taking place in The complainant's room in her bed. The seventh count alleged an incident on a mattress in the front room of the house where, according to the evidence, the appellant often slept. It seems that this was the first occasion it is claimed the appellant had intercourse astride the complainant, on prior occasions, she being in a foetal position which hurt her less. The eighth count alleged an incident of some significance. The complainant said that she had been given a particular nightdress which the appellant had ordered her not to wear considering it was not decent. Nevertheless she said that some time between September and November 1994 he had told her to put it on, that he had jumped into bed beside her and, probably for the first occasion at least other than during a period, had ejaculated inside her, and that she took off the nightdress and put it away, not wanting Sharon to see it. Later the nightdress was subjected to examination and there was evidence of semen having been found on it. There was evidence to which I come later making the jury aware that the appellant had refused to submit to a blood test. The ninth charge related to an alleged occasion when the complainant was accompanying the appellant during his work. The tenth charge was a claim that when she was showering the appellant came into the shower and inserted his penis into her vagina under the shower. The last occasion is alleged to have occurred in the complainant's bedroom in what she said was the usual way. 
     
      
    13    By January 1995 the appellant and his wife had separated. As a result of Family Court proceedings Sharon, the complainant and the children were living in the home at Port Macquarie and the appellant was living elsewhere. There were some arrangements in place for access. On 15 January 1995 when the appellant had come to see his sons there was an argument, between him and the complainant which started over a lawn mower. The argument continued inside the house. There are somewhat different versions of the events but certainly the appellant blamed The complainant for a lot of his problems and asked whether she (the complainant) had told her mother (meaning Sharon) about the incident in the shower. He said the complainant responded by saying something like ""It's alright for me to be quiet for past five years and now you are going turn around and blame it on me"". Sharon said the complainant had said: ""It's alright for you to molest me."" At this stage Sharon had slapped the appellant across the face and said ""I trusted you, I trusted you with my children, what the hell have you been doing"". There was a further argument, Sharon called the police, Constable Durbridge arrived and shortly thereafter asked The complainant about occasions of sexual abuse. This ultimately led to further investigations and the charges against the appellant. 
     
      
    14    The appellant gave evidence at the trial and denied all the matters alleged. On the other hand he admitted that on many occasions he lay beside the complainant in the same bed. There was evidence from Mrs. Robb senior that she had seen him on many occasions in the same bed as the complainant and from Sharon of at least one such occasion. There was evidence from Sharon of the complainant crying out on many occasions at night, of her seeing the appellant coming out of the complainant's room saying he had punished her for telling lies. 
     
      
    15    Ground 1. The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the record of interview in which the appellant exercised the right to silence. 
     
      
    16    The record of interview was not admitted but part of the record of interview with the appellant conducted by Senior Constable Davis was read before the jury. This appears from Appeal Book page 160. This includes material as to living arrangements, employment of the appellant and the relationship between the appellant and the complainant, the latter going to his having authority over her. When evidence was given as to the accused exercising his right to remain silent at the stage when the complainant's allegations commenced to be put to him, which would explain why the interview went no further, the trial judge gave an immediate direction to the jury on the right to silence, repeating it in the summing up on two occasions. That direction was sufficient to overcome what otherwise might have been the possibility of an unfavourable inference being drawn against the appellant. The admitting of the evidence, and the directions given thereafter, were precisely in accord with the decision in R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 115 and R v Matthews (CCA (NSW) 28 May 1996, unreported). This ground fails. 
     
      
    17    Ground 2. The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the fact that the appellant had refused to give a blood sample. 
     
      
    18    Ground 3. The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the complainant's nightie and the biologist's evidence in respect of the semen found on it 
     
      
    19    The appellant argued that the jury could only draw an unfavourable inference from the adducing of this evidence. However, evidence as to the semen on the nightdress was undoubtedly evidence admissible under s55 of the Evidence Act relevant to the eighth charge. The complainant said that she was wearing the nightdress at the time of the alleged event. The question was whether that event took place. The evidence of the semen could rationally affect the probability that the event complained of took place, and some corroboration of it. No objection was taken to the admissibility of this evidence. I would give leave under r4 but find the ground fails. 
     
      
    20    The evidence as to refusal to allow the taking of a blood sample came during the evidence of Detective Sergeant George, who was reading to the court a statement recording a conversation which referred to the nightdress. The following appears at page 175 of the Appeal Book (Transcript p165): 
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: 
         
        Q: Would you continue please paragraph 10? 
         
         
        A: I said, ""Would you agree to having a blood sample taken for the purpose of analysis in regards to the semen found on the young girl's nightie?"" He said: ""I would like to speak to my solicitor first"". I said, ""Alright, I will ring him for you, and you can speak to him about it"". 
        
       
       
        
        I spoke to a Mr. David Chester, solicitor. Then the accused had a conversation with him at the completion of which I said to him, ""Would you now agree to having a blood sample taken""? he said, ""No, I have been told by my solicitor not to"". 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, a few minutes ago I told you that on no account would you draw any adverse inference or conclusion against the accused because he exercised his right to silence. 
        
       
       
        
        Similarly, when he is asked to give a blood sample he has a right to decline to do so and, again, the jury is not permitted to draw any adverse conclusion whatsoever adverse to him 
        
       
       
        
        So the only reason the Crown leads the evidence is to show that he exercised his right to silence, in other words, there is no evidence that he gave an explanation about the matters. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, that the Crown endeavoured to get a blood sample but he exercised his right to decline to give it. So it simply explains why the Crown does not present evidence in those two areas. So it is quite impermissible for you to draw any conclusion from that, any inference or anything of the type. 
        
       
      
    21    Once it is held the evidence about the night dress and the semen was properly admitted then the evidence that the appellant refused to give a blood sample was properly admitted to explain the absence of evidence from the Crown: R v Berrigan (unreported NSWCCA 7 October 1994); R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 115. It should be noted that the trial judge immediately gave an appropriate warning to the jury. He did not do so again during his summing up although he did again refer to the right to remain silent. No complaint or application was made about the summing up. These grounds fail. 
     
      
    22    Ground 4 The learned trial judge erred in advising the jury that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the fourth charge in the indictment.  
     
      
    23    The appellant argues that the jury could well have concluded that because the trial judge at an early stage mentioned that the accused had pleaded guilty to one charge then they should think that he was guilty of the others as well. 
     
      
    24    The jury panel heard the plea; no complaint was made at the time about that. The summing up made it perfectly clear that each charge was to be considered separately. The judge referred to ten separate trials. The jury was told on a number of occasions that the fourth charge did not concern them. It could not be said that there was any possible risk of the jury's mind being contaminated by their having been told of the guilty plea in the way that they were told. In fact counsel for the appellant at the trial led evidence of this plea. This ground fails. 
     
      
    25    Ground 5.The learned trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury about the need for caution in determining to accept the complainant's evidence and the weight to be given to it given the delay in making complaint and lack of satisfactory reason for the absence of complaint. 
     
      
    26    In questioning from the Bench Counsel made it clear that this ground of appeal overlapped with ground 7,namely failure to give a ""Longman direction"". Counsel was specifically asked whether he relied on Kilby v R (1973) 129 CLR 461. His written submissions did not refer to it, but rather relied upon the following passage from Jones v The Queen (1997) 72 ALJR 78 at 82: 
     
      
       
        
        The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than 20 years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. 
        
       
      
    27    Counsel for the appellant said at first that he did rely on Kilby. His was attention drawn to that part of the summing up dealing with the question of complaint which is at page 20 of the summing up as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        But sometimes it may assist a jury to consider whether a complaint has been made and to determine whether it assists in deciding whether to accept the version of the alleged victim. 
        
       
       
      Counsel then said that, having considered that, his submission was that it should have been stronger and in terms of either  
      Jones 
       or  
      Longman 
      . In other words his complaint under this ground was that there was a failure to give a direction along the lines of  
      Jones 
       or  
      Longman v The Queen 
       (1989) 168 CLR 78. This is made apparent from the following which appears on page 11 of the transcript on the hearing of the appeal: 
       
       
        
        SPERLING: J You are saying that the deficiency was in the failure to give a direction along the lines of Jones and Longman? 
        
       
       
        
        CAFFREY: Yes, Your Honour. Especially Jones. To conclude that section,  
        [Appeal Ground 5] 
         the complainant offered no explanation for this delay in making complaint. Obviously we are only talking four years, not 20 as in Jones, but even after one year in which the complainant frequently stayed with other relatives, stayed with other friends, and in different cities even, it would be almost impossible, in my submission, for this appellant to adequately have contested the complainant's evidence and the jury should have been given a warning in that respect because it became then sort of impossible or prejudicially unfair for the then criminal defendant to trace his actions after delay. We must remember his occupation was such he did travel a lot, he was in the business of cleaning offices and business and he travelled a lot so he was away and it would be hard, even after a delay of one year, to trace back and account for his time. 
        
       
      
    28    It is clear, having regard to this exchange, the direction of the trial judge referred to, and the fact that no further direction was sought at the trial, that this matter should properly be considered with ground 7 and I will deal with it again there. 
     
      
    29    Ground 6.The trial judge erred in not fully explaining to the jury why it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    30    This ground also seemed to overlap with ground 7, but so far as it was separate the requirement is of course that the accused have a fair trial, so that notwithstanding s164(3) of the Evidence Act, if it is necessary to do so a warning can be given. 
     
      
    31    The evidence of the complainant was not uncorroborated. There was evidence of the appellant being the habit of moving around the house during the early hours of the morning; of his not normally sleeping with his wife, but sleeping in the lounge room; by his mother-in-law of his walking in and out of the complainant's bedroom and her seeing him lying in the bed beside the complainant; of the appellant's then wife seeing the appellant lying in bed next to the complainant; of the appellant himself admitting that he had been in the same bed as the complainant on a number of occasions; and less significant of the complainant's hymen not being intact. Corroborative evidence does not mean evidence of the actual event the subject of the charge, it means evidence capable of connecting the accused with the events charged. This ground of appeal must fail. 
     
      
    32    Ground 7. The learned trial judge erred in failing to give a 'Longman' direction. 
     
      
    33    As I have said, this ground overlapped with grounds 5 and 6 and should be considered on that basis. The appellant accepted that it was not a requirement that a trial judge give a warning that it is dangerous to convict on uncorroborated evidence, but relied upon the obligation of the judge to give an appropriate warning where the evidence is of a type which is unreliable. This reliance was grounded on s165 of the Evidence Act 1995. To that extent it was incorrectly based as no application was made for such a direction under s165(2). Nevertheless this ground of appeal should be considered on general grounds and as I have said in conjunction with grounds 5 and 6. Counsel for the appellant relied upon the passage in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86 that: 
     
      
       
        
        The general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
      The warning referred to is the warning to which appeal ground 6 is specifically directed. 
       
      
    34    As I have said there was evidence to corroborate the allegations of the complainant. But leaving that aside, the argument of Counsel for the appellant was that a warning should have been given so as to bring to the attention of the jury the fact that as complaint was not made soon after the event, the appellant may have lost the opportunity of examining the circumstances and adducing evidence to throw doubt on the complainant's story or which might confirm the denial of the appellant. Counsel said that after the lapse of four years that opportunity was gone. 
     
      
    35    As I have pointed out eight of the nine charges relating to sexual intercourse alleged incidents said to have occurred in 1994. According to the complainant these were selected so that it would be possible to relate them to particular identifiable occasions. It has not been suggested that the appellant had any difficulty with that or that he could not identify the particular incidents alleged to have occurred. No request was made for such a direction. I do not think that leave under r4 ought to be given but if it were given I consider this ground would fail. The point as to prejudice could only have value so far as the first charge of sexual intercourse is concerned in any event. It follows that ground 5 fails as well. 
     
      
    36    Ground 8. The learned trial judge erred in his over emphasis on the Crown case in summing up to the jury. 
     
      
    37    The judge was obliged to put the matters relating to each of the separate charges to the jury. As the appellant denied all the charges it could not be said that in taking more time over the Crown case there was over-emphasis given to it. A particular complaint was made that the trial judge said ""Each of the allegations that can be proved here tended to take place in Sharon's absence"" indicated that those particular charges had been proved. That is not correct. What the trial judge was directing the jury to was what the Crown had put to them. It is perfectly clear from a reading of the transcript that the judge was at pains to tell the jury that the Crown must establish each charge beyond reasonable doubt. This ground fails. 
     
      
    38    Ground 9. The learned trial judge erred in referring to the fact that the appellant's marriage had broken up. 
     
      
    39    The argument is that this should not have been said because it might have indicated to the jury that the appellant must have been guilty because his wife would not stand by and support him. Counsel for the appellant led evidence as to the breakdown of marriage. The jury in any event knew that the accused and his wife had separated because the argument which led to the complaint and ultimately to the trial, occurred when the appellant was on an access visit to see him children at the home at Port Macquarie. The reference in the summing up occurred in a passage where the judge was directing the jury to their task and pointing out that they were not to be swayed by sympathy towards the complainant or the accused. There is no substance in this ground. 
     
      
    40    Ground 11. A conviction in all these circumstances was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    41    Unless any of the other grounds were made out then it is accepted this ground would fail. 
     
      
    42    Ground 12. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    43    The maximum sentence applicable to each of the charges as to sexual intercourse is ten years. When the conduct of the appellant is taken into account, it is I think correct to say the sentence is towards the top of the range of sentences proper for such conduct, but it could not be said to be outside that range or manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    44    In all the circumstances the appeal should be dismissed. I propose the following orders; 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.

       Judgment 
       
      
    45    SPERLING J: I have read in draft the judgment of Windeyer J in this appeal. I agree with the orders he proposes. My reasons are as follows. 
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    46    I agree that this ground fails. I am, however, uneasy about the authorities which say that evidence of the accused exercising the right to silence when interviewed by the police is admissible. I think there is a serious doubt about the relevance of such evidence. In this case, however, it is unnecessary to form a concluded view on that question. 
     
      
    47    It is not clear from the transcript whether objection was taken at the trial to the tender of the relevant part of the police interview. I am prepared to assume that it was and that leave under r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is accordingly not required. 
     
      
    48    This ground then fails pursuant to the provision to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. There was no substantial miscarriage of justice in view of the prompt and firm direction by the trial judge that no inference adverse to the appellant could be drawn from the appellant having exercising his right to silence. 
     
      
    Grounds 2 and 3 
     
      
    49    For the same reasons, I have difficulty with the notion that refusal to provide blood for a test is relevant evidence, and with the authorities which support that approach. However, if the admission of that evidence was wrong, any prejudice to the appellant was cured by the trial judge's direction that refusal to provide a blood sample was in the same character as refusal to answer police questions, and that no adverse inference could be drawn. 
     
      
    50    The proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies, as in the case of Ground 1 and Ground 2 should also be rejected in the exercise of the court's discretion. 
     
      
    51    Ground 3 should be rejected because the presence of semen on the nightdress was some evidence in support of the complainant's account of the relevant episode. 
     
      
    Ground 4 
     
      
    52    I agree that this ground fails for the reasons given by Windeyer J. 
     
      
    53    Whether the plea should have been entered in the presence of the jury panel, had objection been taken to that course, is academic. Not only did counsel for the appellant not object to that course but he led evidence of the plea in the trial, presumably (and understandably) because he thought capital could be made of it. 
     
      
    54    Leave should not be given pursuant to r 4 to argue this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    Grounds 5 to 12 inclusive 
     
      
    55    I agree that these grounds fail for the reasons given by Windeyer J.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 2 September 199970089/98 - REGINA v David Jason HOOKERJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, David Jason Hooker, was committed to this Court for trial on a large number of counts. The Crown first presented an indictment on 23 June 1999, the prisoner pleaded guilty to certain of the counts and the Crown accepted his pleas in discharge of the indictment. On 27 August 1999 the Crown presented a second indictment which superseded the first and accepted in discharge the pleas the prisoner then entered. In the circumstances it is proper to regard the prisoner as having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The offences of which he now stands convicted are as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        On 9 March 1998 at Marrickville he murdered Duc Hoang Do; 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time and place he robbed Toan Van Doan of certain property and at the same time used corporal violence upon him, occasioning him grievous bodily harm; and 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time and place he robbed Cong Hai Nguyen of certain property and at the same time used corporal violence upon him. 
        
       
      
    2   On 9 March 1998 the prisoner, who was addicted to the use of heroin and other drugs, went with six other young men or youths to a flat in Marrickville. They had bought heroin there before and intended to do so on this occasion. They arrived there some time after 10pm. The prisoner had already consumed drugs on that day. Between about 1pm and 5pm he had taken between seven and nine serepax pills and between 5pm and about 9.30pm had taken heroin. 
     
      
    3   When they arrived at the premises there were two men there, Cong Hai Nguyen and Duc Hoang Do. The young men purchased heroin from Cong Hai Nguyen and sat in the lounge smoking it. In the meantime Cong Hai Nguyen and Duc Hoang Do prepared or ate a meal in the kitchen. 
     
      
    4   One of the visitors suggested that they rob the two men of their money and drugs. Although there was an initial reluctance on the part two or more of them, including the prisoner, they all joined in the attack which followed. Duc Hoang Do walked into the room where they were and was immediately set upon and punched and kicked by a number of people. They left him apparently unconscious and bleeding in the corner of the room. 
     
      
    5   Cong Hai Nguyen entered the room and they attacked him, kicking and punching him in the face and the head. They threatened to kill him and tore his clothes. They stole his wallet but he managed to run out of the flat and escape. 
     
      
    6   The prisoner went into a bedroom looking for money and drugs. As he searched he found a knife under a chair and picked it up. During the assault on Cong Hai Nguyen a third man, Toan Van Doan, had entered the flat, unaware of what was happening. They set upon him as well and threw him into the bedroom where the prisoner was. The prisoner struck him on the head with the knife. While that was going on the others were removing property from the flat and loading it into the car. As the prisoner came out of the bedroom Duc Hoang Do, who was recovering and trying to get off the floor, screamed at the prisoner and threatened him. He was in no position to do him harm, of course, but he threatened to take revenge. At that, the prisoner walked over to him and stabbed him three times in the chest. The knife used was a large, heavy one. 
     
      
    7   The prisoner and the others got away in the car. 
     
      
    8   Duc Hoang Do died of his wounds. He sustained three stab wounds to the chest and blunt force head injuries. The longest wound was 210mm deep and perforated the heart. The lungs, liver and diaphragm were also perforated. 
     
      
    9   Toan Van Doan sustained a serious head injury. He was kept in hospital for the next six days. The repair of the head wound required thirty-four stitches and he had to have an operation to remove a blood clot from the brain. There is no evidence of any continuing disability and it is to be assumed that he has recovered from his injuries. 
     
      
    10   The prisoner was arrested, taken to police premises and formally interviewed. He admitted going to the premises with the other people and gave the police a version of what happened which is substantially the same as the one I have related. He admitted that he remembered hitting the man on the head in the bedroom but said that he had no recollection of stabbing the second man. He admitted that he must have done so, however, because he remembered having the knife and because his colleagues had told him that he had stabbed the man. 
     
      
    11   I accept the opinion of Dr Westmore that the prisoner’s inability to recall exactly what happened is genuine and probably results from the combined effect of the drugs he had taken and the difficulty he has had coming to terms with what he has done. 
     
      
    12   The offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced are very serious indeed. One man was killed, another was badly hurt. Substantial quantities of goods and money were taken under violence and threats of violence. The first count carries a maximum sentence of penal servitude for life, the second twenty-five years’ penal servitude and the third twenty years’ penal servitude. 
     
      
    13   There are important features, however, which mitigate the criminality of the prisoner. I am satisfied that he did not go to the flat with intent to attack or rob. He took no weapon. The attack was suggested by another member of the group and I think that he responded partly because of the pressure of his friends and partly because the effect upon him of the drugs he had consumed made it difficult for him to resist. 
     
      
    14   He admitted his involvement as soon as the police spoke to him. Without his admissions and his pleas of guilty the Crown would have had a weak case. The Crown informed the Court that it was doubtful whether the two surviving victims would have been available to give evidence. 
     
      
    15   The prisoner was born on 6 November 1980. He had a difficult childhood. His father beat him severely over a period of years and the household was unhappy. An uncle sexually abused him. It may have been because of his resentment of his father that he began when he was thirteen years old to commit crime and to experiment with illegal drugs. By the time he was fourteen he had become dependent on heroin. By the age of seventeen he was using more than one gram per day, costing between $500 and $600. Of course, he was committing crimes to raise the money he had to have. He began offending in 1995 and has a record of stealing from the person, stealing motor vehicles, possessing implements, robbery in company and other offences of violence as well as motor vehicle offences. He was given the benefit of community service orders, but reported poorly and breached the conditions of them, and of control orders to which he was later made subject. 
     
      
    16   The prisoner has been in detention since the date of his arrest, namely 8 April 1998. He has no psychiatric illness, is of average intelligence and has the ability of an adult to read and comprehend. 
     
      
    17   He has a girlfriend with whom he was living at the time of his arrest and they have a young child. His family and his girlfriend are supporting him. 
     
      
    18   He feels guilty about putting his family through the ordeal of their suffering. Although his family wanted him to plead not guilty, he wanted to recognise his involvement by pleading guilty. Although he finds it difficult to demonstrate remorse, I think that his action in entering his pleas shows that he is sorry for the pain he has inflicted on others. 
     
      
    19   Notwithstanding the efforts of those who are supervising him, he resists autonomy, thinks little of himself and mistrusts others. According to a psychologist, Mr Harry Smith, who prepared a report for the Court, the prisoner may have trouble sustaining or even beginning a consistent therapeutic relationship. His hypersensitivity, gloomy outlook and self-demeaning comments intensify his anguish about the past, the present and the future. He is in need of long-term therapy. Mr Smith considers that he has not closed the door completely to help, however. 
     
      
    20   In spite of his lack of trust in himself and others, however, reports from the officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice show that the prisoner is taking tentative steps towards rehabilitation. He is well respected by those who have the charge of him. 
     
      
    21   Since his arrest the prisoner has been taking part in a program of study supervised by officials of the Department. He is working towards completing his Year 10 School Certificate, something he was denied when expelled from his last high school. His executive teacher speaks highly of his motivation and efforts to continue his education in custody. He thinks that the prisoner’s attitude during the months after enrolment has improved considerably. He is taking a lot of pride in his work and is one of the best students in the course. He has also completed a number of TAFE outreach courses in conjunction with his Year 10 studies. They concentrate on practical, trade work, something to which the prisoner seems well suited. 
     
      
    22   During recent riots at the Juvenile Justice Centre where he was being held he assisted the authorities to bring a dangerous state of affairs to a safe and satisfactory conclusion. 
     
      
    23   I think that these are signs that the prisoner may gain confidence in himself and others and I accept the opinion of Mr Smith that he should be given the opportunity to continue to take advantage of the juvenile justice system until he is twenty-one years old. 
     
      
    24   It is difficult to come to a conclusion whether the prisoner will offend again after his release into the community. Dr Westmore held out some hope that the violence the prisoner engaged in was perhaps out of character because he told Dr Westmore that he was not normally violent. However, the prisoner had by then been found to have committed two robberies. Dr Westmore thought that the aggression occurred in the context of his antisocial personality traits, resulting from his violent childhood and from his substance abuse. 
     
      
    25   I think that there are modest prospects that the prisoner will not offend again if he takes advantage of the opportunities that will be offered him in the juvenile justice system and, later on, when he is in the adult correctional system and on probation. 
     
      
    26   The prisoner was seventeen years and four months old at the time of these offences. He is therefore entitled to consideration on account of his age. 
     
      
    27   In sentencing young people, the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as in sentencing adults because for young people considerations of rehabilitation have to be given prominence. However, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because the people to be sentenced are in their late teens. When the offence calling for sentence is a grave crime of violence frequently committed by people of such age the need to protect the public against such crimes must be kept in mind. Unfortunately, serious assaults and robberies by groups of teenagers are not uncommon in our society. 
     
      
    28   Of the prisoner’s six companions, only two have been dealt with, and both in the Children’s Court. One, who was ten months younger than the prisoner, pleaded guilty to a single count of robbery in company and was ordered to serve one year’s probation, allowance having been made for five months’ pre-sentence detention. The other, who was four months younger than the prisoner, pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery with corporal violence and was ordered to serve eighteen months, probation and made subject to a conditional control order for nine months. Because of the difference between the criminality of those offenders and that of the prisoner and because they were dealt with under a different sentencing regime and because I know nothing of the backgrounds or any criminal antecedents of those offenders, I find those sentences of no assistance in determining the sentences to be imposed upon the prisoner. 
     
      
    29   The sentence I impose for each offence will take account of the criminal conduct on which the relevant count is based. At the same time, the overall sentence will be proportionate to my assessment of the prisoner’s total criminality. 
     
      
    30   Because all the offences were committed within a single short episode of misconduct, the prisoner is entitled to expect a degree of concurrency. However, because his total criminality exceeds that of the most serious offence, there must also be a degree of accumulation. 
     
      
    31   The fact of accumulation and the special needs of the prisoner for an extended period in the community under supervision in order to promote his rehabilitation produce the need for an additional term for the first count which exceeds one-third of the minimum term. The same need to structure an overall sentence which accords with the totality of the prisoner’s criminality but makes proper provision for his rehabilitation also produces the need to fix an additional term on the second count which exceeds one-third of the minimum term and to impose a fixed term on the third count. 
     
      
    32   For the offence of robbing Cong Hai Nguyen and using corporal violence upon him the prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed term of three years, commencing on 8 April 1998 and expiring on 7 April 2001. 
     
      
    33   For the offence of robbing Toan Van Doan and using corporal violence upon him occasioning him grievous bodily harm the prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude for five years, comprising a minimum term of three years commencing on 8 April 1998 and expiring on 7 April 2001 and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    34   For the offence of the murder of Duc Hoang Do the prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude for thirteen years comprising a minimum term of seven years commencing on 8 April 2001 and expiring on 7 April 2008 and an additional term of six years commencing on 8 April 2008 and expiring on 7 April 2014. 
     
      
    35   The prisoner will be eligible for release on parole on 7 April 2008. 
     
      
    36   I direct that until he is twenty-one years of age the prisoner serve his sentences in a detention centre.

       F A P v REGINA 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   JAMES J: The appellant F A P has appealed against his conviction, after a trial in the District Court in June 1998 before His Honour Judge Gibson of Queens Counsel and a jury, on one count of robbery in circumstances of aggravation committed on Christmas Day 1997 in Forster, the circumstances of aggravation being the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim. His Honour Judge Gibson sentenced the appellant, pursuant to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, to a control order for eighteen and a half months, to date from a date in June 1998. At the time the offence was allegedly committed and at the time he was sentenced, the appellant was a “child” for the purposes of that Act, being seventeen years old. His Honour recommended that, after the appellant had served six months of the control order, the Minister should give consideration to the appellant being released to the Young Offenders Diversionary Programme as conducted by a local Aboriginal Land Council. His Honour had arrived at the period of eighteen and a half months by deducing from a period of twenty-one months, which His Honour considered would otherwise have been an appropriate sentence, a period of two and a half months being equivalent to the time the appellant had spent in custody solely referrable to this matter before he was sentenced. The Court was informed that the appellant was in fact granted bail on 18 October 1998 pending the hearing of this appeal and that he remained at liberty until he was returned to custody a few days ago for a breach of the conditions of his bail. 
     
      
    2   The Crown case at the trial was that the appellant was one of three aboriginal youths, who shortly after 1.30 on the morning of Christmas Day 1997 assaulted and robbed a white youth, aged seventeen at the time of the trial, who was travelling home on his bicycle. At the trial there was no dispute that the victim had been robbed by three aboriginal youths and had sustained actual bodily harm. The only issue at the trial was whether the Crown could establish that the appellant, who was being tried alone, was one of the three offenders. The offender who the Crown alleged was the appellant had not been known to the victim before the offence was committed. 
     
      
    3   Before the trial commenced in the presence of the jury, a voir dire inquiry was held to determine the admissibility of evidence that on 5 January 1998 the victim had made a photographic identification of the appellant at the Forster Police Station in the presence of a police officer named Clarke. At the conclusion of the voir dire inquiry His Honour Judge Gibson held that evidence of the photographic identification was admissible. The correctness of his Honour's decision is challenged in the first ground of appeal against conviction. The trial then proceeded in the presence of the jury. 
     
      
    4   The only witnesses in the Crown case were the victim and Detective Clarke. The victim's evidence can be briefly summarised as follows. At about 1.30 on the morning of Christmas Day 1997 the victim left his brother's home on a bicycle, in order to return to his own home. As he was crossing an intersection in Forster three aboriginal youths came up to him and asked him for a cigarette. The victim recognised only one of the youths. The three youths positioned themselves around the victim's bicycle, so that one was in front of him, one was to his right and one was to his left. On the Crown case the youth on the victim's right was the appellant. One of the youths demanded money and the youth on the victim's right punched the victim a number of times, causing him to fall off his bicycle. After the victim fell to the ground, all three of the youths punched and kicked him. The youth on the victim's left removed the victim's wallet from one of his pockets. The wallet contained some personal papers. Photographs of the victim taken the following day showed marks on his face as a result of the assault. The victim reported the offence to the police. He gave a description of the offender who had been standing on his right, which included that he was fifteen to seventeen years old and that his head looked shaved. 
     
      
    5   On 5 January 1998 the victim attended Forster Police Station. He was shown three manila folders of photographs, each containing three photographs. The victim stated in his evidence in the trial that on 5 January 1998 he identified the middle photograph in the first folder and the top photograph in the second folder as being photographs of the youth who had been standing on his right. Both of these photographs were photographs of the appellant. The victim said that a difference between the appearance of the offender and the appearance of the person shown in these two photographs was that the offender had had a shaved head. 
     
      
    6   The victim maintained in his evidence that he had identified both photographs of the appellant in the folders as being photographs of the offender, notwithstanding that in a statement made on 5 January 1998 after he had looked at the photographs, he had said that he had identified only one photograph, being the photograph in the middle of the first folder. 
     
      
    7   Det Clarke gave evidence at the trial that on 5 January 1998 the victim had identified only the photograph in the middle of the first folder as being a photograph of one of the offenders. At the time of the photographic identification the appellant had had what Det Clarke described as a “number two” cut, that is a crew cut. 
     
      
    8   The appellant gave evidence in his own case. He said that he was living at Bunyah (38 Little Bunyah Street), which is some distance out of Forster, and had spent Christmas Eve 1997 at that address in Bunyah, watching videos. He had stayed up till 10 or 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve. He and a number of other persons living in the house had slept in the same room of the house. He had not got up until midday and had then gone with members of the family to spend Christmas Day at his grandfather's house in Forster. He agreed that his head was well shaved at the time of the trial but said that as at Christmas 1997 his hair was three inches long in parts. He said he had had his head shaved about a week before the trial commenced. 
     
      
    9   The appellant's father’s de facto wife Felicia Marr and her daughter by a previous relationship gave evidence in support of the appellant's alibi to the effect that each had spent the night of Christmas Eve 1997 at the house at Bunyah and that the appellant had been there. 
     
      
    10   The first ground of appeal against conviction was:- 
     
      
       
      That the trial Judge was in error in allowing identification evidence in this case to go to the jury. 
       
      
    11   The identification evidence referred to in the ground of appeal is the evidence of photographic identification of the appellant as being one of the offenders. 
     
      
    12   Earlier in this judgment I referred to the voir dire inquiry conducted into the admissibility of the evidence of photographic identification and the evidence given in the trial itself about the photographic identification. The first ground of appeal challenges the ruling of the trial Judge at the conclusion of the voir dire inquiry that evidence of the photographic identification should be admitted. 
     
      
    13   In the voir dire inquiry two principal submissions were made on behalf of the appellant. The first submission was based on s 115(2) of the Evidence Act. The second submission was based on ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. On the hearing of the appeal the first submission has not been pressed and it is unnecessary to deal with the submission advanced at the trial which was based on s 115(2) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    14   Both ss 135 and 137 require a comparison between the probative value of some piece of evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice if the evidence is admitted. Section 137 provides that in criminal proceedings the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution, if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
     
      
    15   Both in the voir dire inquiry and on this appeal the matters principally sought to be relied on as giving rise to the danger of unfair prejudice were that the evidence was evidence of photographic identification and not evidence of identification at an identification parade and that in an array of only nine photographs two photographs of the appellant had been included. 
     
      
    16   As to the absence of an identification parade, Judge Gibson considered that it would probably have been difficult to arrange an identification parade in which the other participants had heads as shaved, or at least hair as closely cut, as the appellant's was, as at 5 January 1998, and that without such other participants an identification parade would in fact have been less fair to the appellant than photographic identification. I do not consider that His Honour made any error in saying what he did about the absence of an identification parade. The fact that an identification parade was not held is nevertheless still a matter to be taken into account. 
     
      
    17   Judge Gibson was clearly troubled by the small number of photographs and the circumstance that two photographs of the appellant had been included. However, His Honour decided that he should not exclude the evidence under either s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    18   I have myself been troubled by the small number of photographs and the inclusion of two photographs of the appellant. The case is in stark contrast, for example, to the case of R v Batty (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 6 August 1997), to which we were referred in written submissions concerning s 115(2) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    19   In Batty the victim was shown four volumes of photographs, each containing between 100 and 160 photographs of persons. The photograph of Batty which the victim selected was photograph 102 in one of the books. I am not of course suggesting it is necessary to show a prospective witness as many photographs as were shown to the prospective witness in Batty. However, an array of nine photographs, which includes two photographs of the person suspected of committing the crime, provides much less choice than is desirable. 
     
      
    20   During argument on the appeal the Court was referred to the decision of this Court in R v Maklouf (unreported) CCA 23 June 1999. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial Judge had not erred in deciding not to exclude evidence of photographic identification, where 2 photographs of the accused had been included in the collection of photographs shown to a witness. There were, however, differences between Makouf's case and the present case. In Maklouf the witness was shown a total of twenty-six photographs. Most of the photographs were not of individuals but of groups of young men, so that the total number of persons shown was much more than twenty-six. The photographs included a number of persons with ponytails, which was apparently a distinguishing feature of Maklouf. Two photographs of two other young men were also included in the collection. The two photographs of Maklouf included one full face photograph and one photograph in profile, which the Court of Criminal Appeal considered, in the particular circumstances of the case, contributed to the fairness of the photographic identification of Maklouf. 
     
      
    21   However, notwithstanding the comments I have made about the low total number of photographs in the collection and the inclusion in the collection of two photographs of the appellant, it is clear that the trial judge gave careful consideration to the question of whether the identification evidence should be excluded. His Honour expressly took into account the matters relied on by the appellant and I have concluded that I should not find that the exercise of his Honour's discretion miscarried. I am fortified in reaching this conclusion by the following considerations. 
     
      
    22   It is not immediately apparent from an inspection of the photographs that the two photographs, which are in the middle of the first folder and the top of the second folder respectively, are photographs of the same person. In the photograph at the top of the second folder, which, according to the witness’s statement and Detective Clarke’s evidence, the witness did not identify, long strands of the subject's hair obscure some of his forehead and his eyes and those strands of hair in fact reach below eye level. It would also appear that the two photographs were taken under different conditions of lighting, so that the subject of the photograph at the top of the second manila folder appears to have lighter coloured skin than the subject of the photograph in the middle of the first folder. The fact that the victim failed to identify the second photograph of the appellant suggests that the victim was not influenced in the identification he did make of the photograph in the first folder, by the presence of the second photograph of the appellant. 
     
      
    23   I would reject the first ground of appeal. I would however repeat that it is undesirable to present a prospective identification witness with only nine photographs, including two photographs of the same suspect. 
     
      
    24   The second ground of appeal against conviction was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The Court of Criminal Appeal should order a new trial based on fresh evidence in this case. At the time of the trial there was in the possession of the Director of Public Prosecutions a statement from Mr Perry Cunningham which supported the alibi defence run by Mr Pacey. This statement was not provided to the defence until the trial was completed 
        .” 
        
       
      
    25   In July 1998, shortly after the appellant's trial had finished, a solicitor employed by the Director of Public Prosecutions happened to remark to the solicitor who had acted for the appellant at his trial, that a statement had been obtained on 6 January 1998 in an unrelated criminal proceeding from a person named Perry Cunningham. The part of the statement by Perry Cunningham which is sought to be relied on as fresh evidence is to be found in paragraph 5. The particular part of paragraph 5 relied on contains assertions to the effect that on the night of Friday 2 January 1998 Mr Cunningham stayed at a house in Forster and that next door to that house was another house. 
     
      
       
        
        ""where F.S (that is the appellant's father) was living. He has moved out now."" 
        
       
      
    26   It was submitted that this additional evidence supported the appellant's alibi that on the night of Christmas Eve the appellant was at the house in Bunyah, where his father was living, and not in Forster. 
     
      
    27   The principles to be applied in determining whether a criminal conviction should be set aside on the grounds of fresh evidence are well known and need not be repeated here. One requirement which additional evidence must satisfy in order to amount to fresh evidence is that it attains a certain level of cogency. In my opinion, the evidence of Mr Cunningham, even if it was accepted, is so lacking in cogency that there is no significant possibility that if the evidence had been before the jury, the jury would have acquitted the appellant. The evidence from Mr Cunningham amounts to evidence that at some indeterminate time before 2 January 1998 the appellant's father had stopped living at a house in Forster. The issue at the trial was whether the appellant had spent the night of Christmas Eve 1997 in the house at Bunyah. The Crown did not really dispute evidence that the appellant's father and his de facto wife Felicia Marr had been living in the house at Bunyah and were living in the house at Bunyah as at Christmas Eve 1997. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    28   The third ground of appeal in the Notice Of Appeal which was filed was that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In deference to the decision of the High Court in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 73 ALJR 1, the ground of appeal was amended at the hearing of the appeal so as to accord with s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act and assert that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
    29   The principles to be applied in determining an appeal on such a ground were stated by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 440. 
     
      
    30   In my opinion it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the alibi advanced by the appellant should be rejected. Among the reasons which would have supported the rejection of the alibi were:- 
     
      
    31   (1) when the appellant was giving evidence in chief he said, contrary to his alibi, that he had spent the Christmas Eve of 1997 at his grandfather's house at 23 South Street, Forster. Subsequently, in response to leading questions from his counsel, the appellant corrected himself and said that he had spent the night before Christmas at Bunyah but the jury could well have regarded his original evidence as highly significant. 
     
      
    32   (2) the appellant said in his evidence that by Christmas Eve he had been living at Bunyah for two months, yet Felicia Marr said that she and the appellant's father, the appellant and other relatives had moved into the house at Bunyah in December 1997. 
     
      
    33   (3) the appellant said in his evidence that he had slept in until about midday on Christmas Day. Not only is it implausible that the appellant would have slept in until midday on Christmas Day, especially in the light of his account that he had gone to bed on Christmas Eve about 10 or 11 o'clock after spending the evening watching videos but Felicia Marr gave evidence that the appellant had woken up at 10 o'clock on Christmas morning. 
     
      
    34   (4) the appellant said in his evidence that he had slept in the living room with all the other occupants of the house. Felicia Marr said that the appellant had slept in one of the children's bedrooms. 
     
      
    35   (5) when the appellant was charged on 5 January 1998 he gave as his address, not the Bunyah address, but 23 South Street, Forster. The appellant claimed that he did not know the address of the house at Bunyah but the jury could have regarded that evidence as implausible. 
     
      
    36   The jury could well have regarded its rejection of the alibi advanced by the appellant as affecting seriously the general credibility of the appellant. 
     
      
    37   It was submitted on behalf of the appellant in regard to the identification evidence that the victim had no previous knowledge of the appellant, that the offence was committed at night, that the offender purportedly identified was one of three offenders, that the victim would have been able to observe the offenders for only a short time and that the victim's attention would not have been focussed solely on the appellant. 
     
      
    38   On the other hand, there were a number of factors which would have enhanced the reliability of the identification evidence. The offence was committed at a well lit intersection in a country town, the encounter with the offenders lasted several minutes and not just a few seconds, the offender including the offender on the victim's right came very close to the victim, close enough in the case of the offender on the victim's right to restrain the victim's bicycle and to punch the victim. The offender alleged to be the appellant was not disguised and there was no impediment to the victim observing him. 
     
      
    39   I have already in dealing with the first ground of appeal referred in some detail to the photographic identification. I have expressed the opinion that there were some unsatisfactory features of the photographic identification. The inability of the victim to identify the second photograph of the appellant as being a photograph of the offender who was on his right to some extent weakens his evidence of identification. On the other hand, the fact that the victim did not identify the second photograph of the appellant suggests that he was not prompted in making the identification that he did make, by the presence of the second photograph of the appellant in the array of photographs. I have already referred to the fact that the appellant, in the photograph which the victim did not identify, is shown as having long strands of hair which obscure parts of his face.  
     
      
    40   In favour of the reliability of the photographic identification made by the victim is the fact that the identification took place on 5 January 1998, only a few days after the offence was committed. 
     
      
    41   A particularly telling circumstances in the present case is that soon after the offence was committed the victim in his first statement to the police described the offender on his right as having a head which looked shaved. The appellant had a shaved head at the trial. Detective Clarke gave evidence that on 5 January 1998 the appellant had a “number two” cut, that is a very short hair cut, consistent with him having had a shaved head about ten days earlier. It was open to the jury to disbelieve the appellant's evidence that on 5 January 1998 some of his hair was three inches long. 
     
      
    42   I have concluded that it was open to the jury, which had the advantage denied to this Court of seeing and hearing the witnesses, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. The application for leave to appeal against sentence is not pressed. 
     
      
    43   MEAGHER JA: I agree.44   SPERLING J: I agree.45   MEAGHER JA: The orders of the Court are as stated by Justice James.

      REGINA v MARK ANDREW GRECH 
      
    2    CARRUTHERS AJ: Mark Andrew Grech seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Sides QC at the Liverpool District Court on 28 April 1998 following the applicant’s conviction of two offences under s 66F(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 as amended (the Act). In respect of each count, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of three years penal servitude to commence on 28 April 1998 and to expire on 27 April 2001. His Honour imposed an additional term of two years to commence on 28 April 2001 and to expire on 27 April 2003.  
    3    Section 66F is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “66F Sexual intercourse---intellectual disability 
        
        
       (1) In this section: 
        
        
         
       “intellectual disability”  
       means an appreciably below average general intellectual function that results in the person requiring supervision or social habilitation in connection with daily life activities. 
        
        
       (2) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who: 
        
        
        (a) has an intellectual disability; and 
        
        
        (b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person in connection with any facility or programme providing services to persons who have intellectual disabilities, 
        
        
       shall be liable to penal servitude for 10 years. 
        
        
       (3) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who has an intellectual disability, with the intention of taking advantage of the other person’s vulnerability to sexual exploitation, shall be liable to penal servitude for 8 years. 
        
        
       (4) Any person who attempts to commit an offence under this section upon another person who has an intellectual disability shall be liable to the penalty provided for the commission of the offences. 
        
        
       (5) A person does not commit an offence under this section unless the person knows that the person concerned has an intellectual disability. 
        
        
       (6) No prosecution for an offence against this section shall be commenced without the approval of the Attorney General”. 
       
      
    4    The applicant came to trial before Judge Sides on 22 April 1998. He was arraigned on an indictment containing three counts under s 66F(2). The first count was that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant between 1 June 1992 and 31 December 1992. The second count was that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant between 1 June 1995 and 31 December 1995 and the third count was that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant between 1 December 1996 and 31 December 1996. 
    5    On 28 April 1998 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second and third counts. In his remarks on sentence his Honour expressed the view that the jury probably were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the first act of oral intercourse, to which the first count related, occurred in the period pleaded in the indictment. 
    6    Before turning to the factual background of the offences, it is convenient to note that the essence of an offence under s 66F(2) is sexual intercourse by a person in authority with a person with an intellectual disability. Consent is not relevant. It was common ground at the trial that over a protracted period the applicant had consensual sexual intercourse (including anal intercourse) with the complainant. The defence put in issue, however, that the complainant has an intellectual disability within the meaning of s 66F(2). That issue was, of course, resolved against the applicant.  
    7    The complainant, who was born on 10 August 1975, was adopted when he was six months old. He was made a ward of the State in about 1991. From 1991 he lived in a group home operated by the Department of Community Services (DOCS), located at Smithfield in Sydney. The applicant commenced working at the home as a team leader on 11 August 1992. On 11 November 1996 the complainant was placed in a flat owned by the Department of Housing, a few minutes walk from the group home. The same DOCS team, led by the applicant, continued to provide him with support and assistance.  
    8    On 27 December 1996, the complainant’s parents became aware of the sexual relationship between the applicant and the complainant, and informed a DOCS senior officer accordingly. When interviewed by that officer the applicant admitted a sexual relationship with the complainant, saying that it was the reason his marriage had broken up. He also said to the officer: “I can’t explain it. I don’t understand why I care for him, it just happened. I don’t feel the same way for other men. I love the guy.” 
    9    On 14 January 1997 the applicant was interviewed by police officers to whom he admitted that he had a sexual relationship with the complainant who had an intellectual disability which required that some support be provided to him. The applicant was aged 26 and 27 at the time of the two offences in respect of which he was convicted and the complainant was aged 20 and 21 respectively.  
    10    The complainant gave evidence at the trial. He deposed that sexual contact commenced between himself and the applicant when he turned 18. This was in August 1993 and accounts for the acquittal on the first count. The complainant said that their relationship commenced with oral intercourse and an intense and frequent relationship of anal intercourse followed. Intercourse took place at the applicant’s residence which was also at Smithfield. The complainant said that sexual intercourse did not take place at the group home but he and the applicant (who were in love with each other) would kiss and hug each other at the home, in the room which was occupied by the complainant. The complainant said, in evidence, that he had seen the applicant in the last few weeks prior to the commencement of the trial at the applicant’s home. He said that he wanted to continue his relationship with the applicant and that he continued to love him.  
    11    As part of the Crown case the ERISP video of the police interview of 14 January 1997 was tendered and played to the jury. In that interview the applicant admitted that he had an almost daily sexual relationship with the complainant over the previous 18 months. However, the applicant asserted that the complainant had initiated the sexual contact. The applicant said that he first had anal sex with the complainant in about mid 1992 at the group home at Smithfield where the complainant resided because he had “a mild intellectual disability.” He told the police that the complainant needed “support... to access the community to keep him sort of active so he doesn’t become too isolated.” 
    12    As to his relationship with the complainant, the applicant said “I knew what was happening basically was wrong but I just, I dunno, I just couldn’t stop it because I cared so much for Matthew.” He explained that by “wrong”, he meant that it was against Departmental guidelines. He said that after the complainant moved out of the group home into the flat, he stayed at the applicant’s house “just about every night.” This was not permitted by DOCS policy.  
    13    As I have indicated the issue of “intellectual disability” was resolved against the applicant and no challenge was made in this Court to that finding. Indeed, there was ample lay and expert evidence before the jury to establish this element of the Crown case. It is, however, important to refer to certain aspects of the lay and expert evidence relating to this issue.  
    14    The complainant’s father deposed that when the complainant was aged 1½ he was diagnosed by a paediatrician as having some autistic symptoms. The complainant’s parents were referred to the Autistic Association, which commenced a programme of exercises and “behavioural patterns” initially at the centre, and later at their home. Until the age of four or five, the complainant’s behaviour was of concern, including head banging to the point of smashing windows and holes in gyprock walls. From the age of five, the complainant attended the Autistic Association, progressing to five days per week. Extreme behaviour continued throughout his childhood and he remained a person prone to emotional, irrational outbursts. In his sub-teenage years, the complainant received the services of various specialists and therapists. There was evidence of self-mutilation when he was 13. The complainant was taken into a DOCS facility at Lidcombe as a result of continually running away in the latter half of 1990, and he was then transferred to the group home at Smithfield to which reference has already been made. Whilst at Smithfield, the complainant would spend alternate weekends at home. He received a disability pension and worked in a sheltered workshop.  
    15    At the time of trial the complainant was living in a one bedroom flat at Chatswood and receiving domestic help on two days per week. The complainant’s father characterised the assistance which the complainant received twice per week as “assistance” rather than supervision.  
    16    Dr Chris Weaver, a medical practitioner specialising in child psychiatry gave evidence that he first saw the complainant in March 1990, when he was 14. Thereafter, he saw the complainant regularly and, indeed, on some occasions he was accompanied by the applicant. Dr Weaver confirmed a longstanding diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. He had not seen the complainant for four to five years prior to the trial. 
    17    Professor Susan Hayes has a forensic practice as a psychologist dealing with persons with mental abnormalities in the criminal justice system. She administered a battery of psychometric tests to the complainant. She concluded that in terms of the classification of intellectual disability preferred by psychologists (borderline, mild, moderate, severe, profound) the complainant was borderline. She expressed the view that the complainant came within the definition of “intellectual disability” set out in s 66F(1), although that definition did not entirely accord with the psychological definition of that condition. She expressed the view that the complainant was functioning at an age equivalent of around about 10 years in communication skills, around 7 years 11 months in socialisation, and as a teenager around about 13 years and 9 months in terms of his daily living skills. It was this latter aspect which would appear to be particularly relevant to the definition of intellectual disability within the meaning of the statutory definition.  
    18    Mr Anthony Rochester, a psychologist employed by DOCS, took a history from the complainant on 26 February 1997. He described that during that interview he observed “rote” behaviour which he thought was consistent with an autistic disorder. He did not, however, consider that the complainant had autism.  
    19    It is convenient now to turn to certain aspects of his Honour’s remarks on sentence. His Honour adverted to the fact that during the whole period of sexual relationship between the complainant and the applicant, the latter was in a position of influence and authority and indeed “power” in relation to the complainant. Having referred to the fact that the acts of intercourse were consensual, his Honour said  
     
      
       
       “the prisoner in his interview sought to create the impression that it was the complainant who initiated the sexual contact…. The prisoner was in a position of power and in a position to know and understand whether or not that consent was, in fact, understood and genuine. It is not without significance that these were not the complainant’s first sexual encounters. There were apparently encounters when he had run away from home and living in the Kings Cross area and there were other encounters with another person employed at the group home in 1992 that has led to that individual being imprisoned for two years and eight months for a number of offences under s.78K of the  
       Crimes Act 
       . The prisoner was aware of those latter offences as it would appear that he gave the complainant some assistance in the preparation of an application for victims compensation. The prior sexual experience of the complainant was clearly gained in exploitative situations. The fact that he may have initiated sexual contact with this prisoner is therefore, in my view, of little moment.  
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner was well aware that his relationship and more importantly the sexual relationship that he developed was wrong. He did nothing to bring it to an end. He did not confide in anyone and he did not seek counselling and indeed he brought his own marriage, as I understand it, to an end because of the relationship he had with the complainant. He clearly had insight in the sense that he knew what he was doing was wrong and he knew it was wrong because he was in a position of trust.” 
       
      
    20    His Honour went on to state that the relationship continued until it was brought to the attention of the authorities who intervened. The applicant immediately resigned from DOCS, and at the time of trial was employed as a meter reader for AGL. His Honour noted that the applicant had fully co-operated with the authorities although it would have been very easy for him to deny the acts of intercourse and in view of the complainants level of intellectual functioning and the way in which he presented in the witness box and gave his evidence, it would have been very difficult for the Crown to have proved the acts of intercourse which were the subject of the charges, but for those admissions.  
    21    His Honour referred to the fact that the complainant and the applicant still, at the time of trial, expressed strong mutual feelings of affection. His Honour expressed some doubt as to the weight one could place on the expressed feelings of affection by the applicant towards the complainant in light of the evidence of the complainant’s autism and his level of intellectual functioning. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, his Honour did not consider that he could give that feeling, even if he was satisfied that it was genuine and mutual, any considerable weight in the sentencing proceedings. His Honour said, 
     
      
       
       “It would be appropriate to deal with it in the same way as the relationship between a prisoner facing sentence and members of his family, spouse and other loved ones. In that context, which is the usual way that the Court deals with such matters, it has no mitigating effect unless there are quite exceptional circumstances of hardship. In my view the mere fact that there is an ongoing and warm and loving relationship mutually shared between these two does not fall into that category. There is no evidence of any harm that would be done to the complainant if he no longer had access to the prisoner because the prisoner was serving a custodial sentence.” 
       
      
    22    His Honour did not have the benefit (nor does this Court) of any reported case law dealing with the application and construction of s 66F(2). His Honour did, however, refer to two decisions which should be noted. The first reference was to the decision of this Court in Parsons (unreported 17 December 1990) which dealt with an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in relation to an offence under s 66F(3). It will, of course, immediately be noticed that the elements of the offence under s 66F(3) are quite different to those under s 66F(2). The former offence carries a maximum penalty of eight years. When referring to Parsons, Judge Sides noted that at first instance an overall sentence of 5 years and 4 months was imposed with a minimum of 4 years and an additional term of 1 year and 4 months. His Honour then said 
     
      
       
        “The appellate Court intervened in that case to the extent that the minimum term was reduced to 3 years, but the overall sentence of 5 years and 4 months remained with the consequence that the additional term was 2 years and 4 months.” 
       
      
    23    Although the matter was not drawn to the attention of Judge Sides, it has been drawn to the attention of this Court that his Honour erred in his statement of the reduced sentence. In fact this Court reduced Parsons’ sentence to an overall sentence of 4 years with a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 1 year. His Honour then referred to the unreported decision of this Court in Moore (12 April 1994) which extensively reviewed the appropriate sentences to be imposed for aggravated intercourse without consent where the circumstances of aggravation are constituted by the age of the complainant. His Honour referred to the fact that in Moore a sentence of 12 years with a minimum term of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years was reduced to a 6 year minimum term and a 3 year additional term. Moore’s case was concerned (inter alia) with an offence under s.61J(1) which, as his Honour noted, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years, and the Crown bears the onus of establishing there was an absence of consent by the complainant.  
    24    Specifically his Honour took into account the relevant subjective matters raised on behalf of the applicant. His Honour referred to his age and the fact that he will find it difficult to obtain employment in the future, further there is a possibility that his custodial sentence may be served in a protective environment as a result of the nature of the offences. His Honour then pointed out, however, that, on the other hand, general deterrence loomed large as offences of this type are difficult to detect because of the reluctance of complainants with intellectual disability to complain. As his Honour said: “they of all people are very easy to exploit.”  
    25    His Honour also took into account, particularly on the issue of personal deterrence, that the applicant allowed the relationship with the complainant to continue for some eighteen months when, all along, he knew it was wrong. If it had been a couple of isolated incidents over a short period of time the criminality presented would have been entirely different from the criminality that presents in this instance.  
    26    His Honour felt unable, in the circumstances, to make any positive finding so far as the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were concerned. He expressed the view that the applicant was entitled to claim good character, in the absence of prior convictions, but that must be seen, however, in the context of offences committed over a period of time and in breach of trust, not only of the complainant, but indeed of his employer which is, in effect, the community.  
    27    Not without some hesitation, it might be thought, his Honour concluded that there were special circumstances based upon the fact that this was a breach of trust over a period of time by an offender without prior convictions and this was the applicant’s first experience of custody.  
    28    The fundamental submission on behalf of the applicant to this Court was structured as follows: it was submitted that there was a failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to take into account properly, the evidence of the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the complainant together with the lack of evidence of psychological or other injury suffered by the complainant and his borderline degree of intellectual disability. Further, there was the alleged failure of his Honour to give weight to the fact that there was no significant age disparity between the two persons. The applicant contended that the sexual contact with the complainant was essentially in the context of a mutual loving relationship. So intense, indeed, that the applicant brought his marriage to an end as a result of the relationship. It was submitted that this feature rendered the applicant less criminally culpable than if he had been motivated by more exploitative motives such as pure sexual gratification. It was argued that the applicant’s motivation for committing these offences, was not sexual exploitation of a vulnerable person but a reflection of the applicant’s deep affection for that person. 
    29    It was submitted that although unlike s 66F(3) sexual exploitation is not specified as an element under s 66F(2), nevertheless, the intent of the offence is to protect persons with intellectual disabilities from sexual exploitation by persons in authority over them. Such, it was submitted, was the intention of parliament when introducing the regime of offences contained in s.66F. Reference was made here to the Legislative Assembly Hansard for 29 October 1987 at page 15466. Thus it was submitted that a sexual relationship which is caught by s 66F(2) and is characterised purely by sexual gratification, warrants heavier punishment than one characterised by a mutual loving relationship. Further, it was submitted that as a matter of public policy, the sentence imposed for a s 66F(2) offence should take into account the degree of physical or psychological injury which resulted from the sexual relationship. In the present case there was no evidence of such injury. The degree of intellectual disability is also, it was submitted, a relevant matter, the intent of the legislature being to protect persons who are perceived to be easily malleable by virtue of their intellectual disability. Comparison could be made here, it was argued, with patients in an institution with a moderate, severe or profound degree of disability who are less capable of complaining of unwanted advances than someone in the position of the complainant. 
    30    As I see the position, these submissions call for the following response. Firstly, in his judgment on sentence, his Honour expressed “clear reservation about the complainant’s assertion that he harboured strong feelings of affection towards the applicant, in light of all the evidence that has been given in the course of this trial, particularly the evidence of the complainant’s autism and level of intellectual functioning.” 
    31    However, even if one were to accept that this was a genuine mutual loving relationship, I am quite unable to conclude that it should serve to reduce the criminality of the applicant as assessed by his Honour.  
    32    It is important to note that the legislature did not encumber s 66F(2) with qualifications. The elements of the offence are simple and this Court should not read into the offence elements which are not stated therein. Section 66F(2) is clearly intended to prohibit absolutely, persons with authority (as defined) having sexual intercourse with intellectually disabled persons over whom they have authority. The policy behind such a prohibition is too obvious to require comment.  
    33    The relationship between a person in authority and an intellectually disabled person can be a sensitive one and involves, to use a well-known phrase of George Bernard Shaw, “fatal propinquity”. It is a situation in which strong emotional relationships are quite capable of developing between carer and intellectually disabled person, whether they are of the same gender or not. It is essential, therefore, that persons in authority exercise the utmost care to avoid such situations developing, and immediately there are indications of such a situation arising, the obligation is on the person in authority to remove himself or herself from the relationship or, at the very least, immediately to seek expert counselling. 
    34    Neither of these courses was adopted in the subject case and, intolerably, the relationship developed into one of a continuing and prolonged violation of the provisions of s 66F(2). The applicant knew not only that he was in breach of his position of trust, but that he was in breach of the criminal law, and he was also aware that the complainant had previously been the victim of sexual exploitation and as a consequence a prior carer was serving a lengthy custodial sentence. The fact that the relationship may have developed, as the applicant contends, into a mutual loving relationship could fairly be described as an aggravating feature of the case rather than a mitigating factor. 
    35    As to the point made by counsel for the applicant that there was no evidence of any psychological or other harm to the complainant, it is merely necessary to note that no evidence in the trial was directed to such a matter. Such is the usual position in trials of this nature. Indeed, I would imagine this question would be a complex and difficult one to resolve at a psychiatric or psychological level, bearing in mind the history of the complainant and his obviously fragile emotional condition.  
    36    As to the argument directed to the asserted borderline level of the complainant’s intellectual disability, one need only to refer to the evidence of Professor Hayes that the complainant is functioning at an age equivalent of around 10 years in communication skill and around seven years and 11 months in socialisation skills. He could hardly be considered capable of protecting his own interests in the circumstances which arose in his relationship with the applicant. 
    37    For sentencing purposes the deterrent element necessarily looms very large with regard to s 66F(2) offences. It is the mark of a civilised society that those who are incapable fully of protecting their own interests, should be protected from exploitation by those in whom society vests the responsibility of caring for them. Carers who breach this trust must expect condign punishment. The instant case was one of a gross and prolonged breach of trust deserving of condign punishment.  
    38    One final matter needs to be addressed. It involves the reference by his Honour during the course of his remarks on sentence to the decisions of this Court in Parsons and Moore. As has already been pointed out, his Honour incorrectly stated the adjusted sentence in Parsons’ case. Counsel for the appellant submitted that a misunderstanding by his Honour of the additional term and total sentence, distorted the subject sentence adversely to the applicant’s interests and being of such magnitude that appellate intervention is warranted. It was further submitted that neither Parsons nor Moore were cases which could in any realistic sense be used by way of comparison so far as determining an appropriate sentencing range for the subject matter. With that latter submission I agree. However, I am completely unpersuaded that his Honour’s reference to these cases, including in one respect an erroneous reference, could have, in the circumstances, led his Honour into error insofar as the imposition of the sentences is concerned. Having carefully balanced the objective and subjective considerations I am firmly of the view that the sentences imposed by his Honour, both from the point of view of the minimum term and also the additional term, were well within the sentencing discretion available to him. In the circumstances I would, however, propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     REGINA v Benjamin PERA 
      
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
     1   MEAGHER JA: In this matter his Honour Kellerman DCJ, of senior counsel, in the course of hearing a case, made some evidentiary rulings under ss 114 and 115 of the Evidence Act, the total effect of which will be to preclude the Crown from further proceeding in the case, or at least to prevent it from proceeding further in the case with any hope of success. For those reasons the Crown has put on an appeal under s 5(F) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is, in my view, entitled to do that.2   We are not concerned whether that appeal is likely to be successful or not. The Crown has a right to lodge such an appeal, unlike the accused. The District Court Judge concerned has indicated an intention to proceed with the case before him now, notwithstanding the existence of the Crown's appeal. This seems a somewhat unusual position to take and it is perhaps due to the fact that his Honour did not appreciate that the Crown had a statutory right to appeal. In any event, that is the attitude his Honour did take. The appeal which the Crown has commenced will obviously become nugatory, unless his Honour's decision to proceed with the case is stayed.3   We have been the beneficiaries of some very interesting argument from counsel on both sides, but fortunately we do not have to decide any issue other than the issues which I have outlined. In my view, therefore, the Crown is entitled to the orders which it seeks and in my view orders 1, 2 and 3, as set out in the notice of motion dated 3 September 1999, should be made.4   JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding judge and with the orders proposed by his Honour.5   SPERLING J: For myself, I would find it unnecessary to decide whether, in every case, a trial judge would err in the exercise of his discretion, in failing to adjourn the criminal trial, by reason only of the circumstance that the Crown had instituted an appeal pursuant to s 5(F). In the present case, I would be satisfied that the Crown has at least an arguable case on appeal to test the merit of the trial judge's determination as to the admissibility of the evidence. That being a factor in the present case, it would be my view that this Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, grant the stay that is sought in order to preserve to the Crown the opportunity of appealing against the determination which would otherwise be lost. For those reasons, I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge.6   MEAGHER JA: The orders of the Court therefore are the orders which I have suggested.

     The respondent pleaded guilty to five charges involving the sexual abuse of his eight year old granddaughter. Sentence was deferred, and the trial Judge ordered the respondent’s release on recognizance. The trial Judge’s reasons for this decision included the age of the respondent, the absence of a criminal record, the spontaneous nature of the offences, the contrition of the respondent, and the wishes of the victim’s immediate family that the respondent not go to prison. The Crown appealed, on the basis that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and failed to take into account the objective criminality of these offences.

     , allowing the appeal: (1) The exercise of the trial Judge’s sentencing discretion had miscarried. The nature of the respondent’s offences were such that they should attract a full-time custodial sentence.

      REGINA v GEORGE CHARLES RAPLEY 
      
      
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HANDLEY JA: This is a Crown appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against a sentence imposed by Solomon DCJ on the respondent. The respondent had pleaded guilty in December 1998 to five charges involving the sexual abuse of his granddaughter who was under the age of 10. There were two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act, which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. There were also three counts of aggravated indecent assault against a person under 10, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.2    The first three counts charged offences on 22 August 1998 and the other two charged offences between February and August 1998.3    The learned sentencing Judge, for reasons which he gave on 26 February this year, deferred passing sentence and ordered the respondent's release upon his entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 5 years, subject to the conditions he identified.4    The respondent was in his early 60s at the time of the offences and his granddaughter was aged eight. On 22 August, the respondent was at the home of his son, the father of the victim. The respondent and the victim were in a bedroom and sexual conduct was in progress when the victim's father walked in and saw what was happening. The respondent admitted his guilt and consequently confessed to additional offences against the victim which had occurred during the previous six months.5    The Crown submits that the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing Judge was manifestly inadequate and failed to properly reflect the objective criminality of these offences.6    The Judge recognised this aspect of the case in his remarks on sentence when he said: 
     
      
       
        
       ""The offences are abhorrent and repugnant. A child was sexually abused by her grandfather. There was a gross breach of trust. This community will not tolerate behaviour of this kind. The seriousness of the offences is reflected in the sentences as contained in the  
       Crimes Act 
       "". 
       
      
    7    However, the Judge went on to find that this was a most unusual case. He enumerated the various matters which led him to this conclusion. He said that the accused had made a full disclosure to his family after he was caught in the act and this had had drastic repercussions on the wider family; the accused's wife had left him shortly afterwards, and he had become estranged from the rest of his family.8    He found that the prisoner was contrite. He thought that this was manifest in the pleas of guilty, in his undertaking treatment under the care of Professor McConachie, and rehabilitation with the Child Abuse Prevention Service.9    The Judge noted that there appeared to have been no great harm suffered by the victim; but he added that one does not know what the ongoing psychological results of these offences may be for the young girl. He said that a factor which weighed heavily with him was the attitude of the victim's father who said that he did not wish the prisoner to be sent to prison for various reasons, which he mentioned.10    In conclusion, the Judge said that he would not impose a custodial sentence having regard to the age of the prisoner; the absence of a criminal record; the spontaneous nature of the offences; the absence of any planning, the probability that the offences would be detected; and the minimal chance of re-offending.11    With respect to the Judge, it appears to me that his Honour has seriously misconceived the nature of the facts in this case. The full disclosure made to the family, and in due course to the police, and the plea of guilty, in my judgment, are not factors of any significant weight, in view of the fact that the respondent had been caught in the act.12    I fail to see how, in these circumstances, a plea of guilty, even at an early stage, can be any evidence of contrition; and, in any event, the contents of the prisoner's record of interview failed to demonstrate any significant degree of contrition. Indeed his statements include elements of self-justification and an attempt to pass some of the responsibility on to the victim.13    While it is a significant fact that the victim’s father gave evidence that he did not wish the prisoner to go to gaol, his most compelling reason, in the view of the sentencing judge, was: 
     
      
       
        
       ""He does not wish his daughter to have the guilt of having her grandfather sent to gaol"". 
       
      
    14    I fail to see, with all respect, how that can be a factor of any weight in the sentencing exercise in this case. The guilt here is that of the respondent and it would be totally inappropriate for the victim to have any guilt whatever. I would hope and expect that the family would recognise that the victim was not responsible for what happened to her grandfather and should have no guilt about it whatever. The Judge’s reference to that reason, with respect, seems to turn the sentencing process on its head.15    Other matters referred to by the Judge, such as the age of the prisoner, the absence of a criminal record, and the fact that the offences occurred spontaneously and without planning, are common features of many of the cases where young children are subject to sexual abuse by adult members of their family. If those factors, individually or collectively, are thought to warrant a sentencing decision which does not involve a period of full time custody, the protection which the Crimes Act intends to confer on members of families and the punishment which is intended, as a general rule, to be imposed on the perpetrators, will stand for nothing.16    Many of the cases to which we have been referred include fact situations where the age of the prisoner is of the order here, and it is typical of these cases that the prisoner has no criminal record. However, it seems to me that the fact that the offences occurred spontaneously, if it be the fact, is of little weight in sentencing for these offences, but I cannot agree that there was no planning by the respondent. The offences occurred over a period of six months and the respondent did his best to ensure that he would not be detected. It is also a common feature in these cases that there will be little or no risk of re-offending. 
    17    It seems to me, with respect, that by and large all the matters which the learned sentencing Judge took into account are individually and collectively of little weight in supporting a decision that the prisoner should not be given a full time custodial sentence.18    This court has said in Allpass (1993) 72 ACrimR 561 and King (unrep 2 April 1997) that offences of this nature will normally attract custodial sentences. This simply reflects the objective seriousness of the offences according to ordinary standards of human conduct which is reflected in the penalties provided for in the Crimes Act.19    The age of the perpetrator was said to be no licence to commit offences of this kind in R v DCM (unrep 26 October 1993). Likewise it was said in the same case that previous good character was of little weight. In Allpass (ibid) the Court said that the absence of a risk of re-offending was not a matter of great significance because, as it said: 
     
      
       
        
       ""This does not answer the obvious need for general deterrence in relation to crimes of this nature"". 
       
      
      
       
      
    20    The most recent decision in King, already referred to, strongly emphasised the need for adequate sentencing in this area.21    In my judgment the objective seriousness of the offences, and the errors of fact and principle that I have referred to, establish that the Judge’s exercise of his sentencing discretion miscarried. This Court must therefore re-exercise the sentencing discretion, bearing in mind the restraints which authority require this Court to exercise when re-sentencing on a Crown appeal.22    In my judgment the appropriate sentence is of 2 years on the offences under s 66A, minimum terms of 18 months to be served concurrently with additional terms of 6 months and fixed terms of 12 months on the charges under s 61M(2) to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the sentences under s 66A.23    I would therefore propose that the appeal be allowed, the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing Judge quashed, and that the sentence stated be substituted.24    GROVE J: I agree with Handley JA.25    HIDDEN J: I agree that the appeal must be allowed. I agree that on the major matters a sentence of 2 years penal servitude is appropriate. For my part, I would have divided that into a minimum term of 12 months and an additional term of 12 months in recognition of the respondent's continuing need for treatment and counselling.26    I would also add this. In my view, no criticism whatsoever attaches to the stance adopted by the victim's father. While I agree with the learned presiding Judge that that stance could not properly influence the sentencing outcome, it is an attitude which was humane, responsible and, in all the circumstances, entirely understandable.27    HANDLEY JA: I will ask Mr Justice Grove to pronounce the formal orders of the court.28    GROVE J: The orders of the court are as follows. The appeal is allowed, the orders made in the District Court are quashed, and in lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced as follows. 
    29    On each of counts 1 and 4, charging sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years, the respondent is sentenced to 2 years penal servitude to be served concurrently. Those sentences to consist of minimum terms of 18 months commencing today, 14 September 1999, and to expire on 13 March 2001, together with additional terms of six months commencing on 14 March 2001. 
    30    On each of counts 2, 3 and 5 charging aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 10 years, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for fixed terms of 12 months to be served currently with each other, and in relevant part concurrently with the minimum terms imposed in respect of counts 1 and 4 to commence today, 14 September 1999, and to expire on 13 September 2000. It is specified that fixed terms are imposed in respect of these counts because of the concurrency just mentioned. It is ordered that the respondent be released on parole on 13 March 2001 and, whilst on parole, he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The respondent is to be taken into custody forthwith.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    HANDLEY JA: I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    2    GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction following a trial at East Maitland before Nader ADCJ and a jury. The appellant was indicted upon eight counts, two of which alleged indecent assault on a person under the age of sixteen years; one, sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of sixteen years and five, sexual intercourse without consent. The offences were alleged to have occurred between March 1983 and April 1988.  
     
      
       
      
    3    The victim in each case was a girl born in 1970. The appellant was the husband of her mother's sister and was referred to therefore as her uncle. They were part of a family of travelling show people who had a home base in the East Maitland area. A large part of the year was occupied by the family moving with a fleet of vehicles which delivered fairground rides and the like on what might be described as a show circuit.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The appellant was convicted by the jury on seven of the eight counts. There was a distinction in the tenor of the evidence relating to consent in relation to the fifth count upon which the verdict of not guilty was found. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The ground of appeal as originally filed was limited to the single assertion that in summation to the jury the trial Judge failed to put adequately or fairly the defence case. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The appellant has sought to add to those grounds but it is convenient to deal with the original ground filed.  
     
      
       
      
    7    The complainant had given evidence of sexual interferences with her by the appellant commencing from an occasion when she was aged seven. This first event was said to have occurred whilst on show tour in a town called Yea in Victoria. The complainant described the appellant putting her through the hole in the wall of a grandstand and then placing a box against the hole so no one could see them. She testified that she was indecently assaulted and that at a point of time while the appellant's erect penis was exposed, his wife (the complainant's aunt) removed the barrier and loudly remonstrated with the appellant and afterwards she turned upon the complainant who remembered her calling her ""a little whore"" and saying to her, ""Don't you know that you will get pregnant, don't you know that's dirty"". This event, of course, was said to have occurred outside of the State of New South Wales and was not the subject of any count. The material was admitted as relationship evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    8    The event relating to the first count was located at the complainant's grandmother's house in the East Maitland area when the appellant entered her bedroom. They were disturbed by the arrival of the complainant's brother who knocked on the door whereupon the complainant told the appellant to hide under the bed. 
     
      
       
      
    9    It is not necessary to detail the events giving rise to all of the counts. It should be noted that counsel appearing at trial was permitted to cross examine the complainant (pursuant to the Crimes Act s 409B(3)(a)) about an incident referred to in her statement to the police that was not raised in her evidence in chief. She had stated that in late July or early August 1984 on tour in the Northern Territory the appellant had driven a particular truck which was towing what was called the octopus ride while the complainant and the appellant's son, Donald junior rode in the carriages of the octopus. The complaint had stated that the appellant handed over the driving to his stepson Arthur and climbed into the octopus ride where he made a sexual proposition to her and threatened to throw her off the side of the truck if she did not comply. She stated that the appellant's son was asleep in an octopus carriage. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The appellant gave evidence at trial and denied any sexual impropriety at all towards the complainant. The appellant's wife testified that she was familiar with the grandstand at Yea Showground in Victoria and was unaware of the existence of any hole in it. She testified that she had never seen any sexual activity concerning the appellant and the complainant and she expressly denied the happenings at Yea Showground in which she was said to have in part participated. Some evidence of the complainant had also involved the showing to her by the appellant of pornographic videos and the appellant's wife asserted that so far as she was aware the appellant did not own any such items and that she had never seen any in and about the places that they occupied.  
     
      
       
      
    11    The appellant's stepson Arthur Townsend gave evidence that there was never an occasion in which he was travelling in a truck with the appellant conveying the octopus ride and when the complainant and her brother were travelling in the carriages. He denied changing driving position with his father so that his father could climb on to the back.  
     
      
       
      
    12    The appellant's son Donald testified that he had never travelled in a carriage of the octopus ride with the complainant and he also denied witnessing other events of which the complainant had spoken as occurring in his presence. He also said that he had never seen his father with a pornographic video nor any sexual activity between him and the complainant.  
     
      
       
      
    13    As asserted by the Crown Prosecutor in submissions in this court it might be said that the defence case was patently clear and very simple in that the appellant denied all of the complainant's allegations and in regard to some of the incidents making up the allegations he was supported in his denial by witnesses. 
     
      
       
      
    14    In the course of his charge to the jury the learned Judge made no reference to the ambit of the defendant's case nor, it should be said in specific terms did he seek to summarise the prosecution case but in elaborating upon written directions as to the elements of the various counts which he had supplied to the jury his Honour summarised from time to time the essence of the Crown allegations in respect of them.  
     
      
       
      
    15    In assessing the adequacy of the content of a charge to the jury regard needs to be paid to s 405AA of the Crimes Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""405AA.  
         Summary By Judge 
          (1) A Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court need not summarise, at the end of a criminal trial before a jury, the evidence given in the trial if the Judge is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, the summary is not necessary. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to the contrary.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge's summing up function other than the summary of evidence in a trial.  
         
        
        
         
         (4) This section extends to trial commenced, but not concluded, before the commencement of this section. "" 
         
        
       
      
    16    In R v Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim r 459 that the statutory provision was the subject of some reference. Part of what I said in a judgment in that case was recapitulated in the Crown's submissions but the extract should be seen in its context: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Subsection (3) preserves other obligations of the Judge and the provision does not detract from the duty to communicate to the jury of what the respective cases being presented on behalf of the Crown and accused consist, and how it is that cases are claimed to be supported (or not) by the evidence. The Judge is not required to restate every argument put on behalf of an accused but he must ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence:  
         Domican v The Queen 
          (1992) 173 CLR 555. "" 
         
        
       
      
    17     In the same case Hunt CJ at CL wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""I wish to add to what Grove J has said concerning s 405AA of the Crimes Act 1900. The section was inserted in the Crimes Act late in 1990, by Act 74 of that year, following repeated criticisms by this court of trial Judges who apparently believed that they were obliged to read out to the jury the evidence which had been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, the cross examination and then the re examination of each witness before turning to the next witness and so on, and who also apparently believed that by doing so they had presented to the jury the issues of fact which they had to determine.  
         
        
       
       
         
        
         
         Subsection (1) of s 405AA relieved trial Judges of any such perceived obligation to summarise all of the evidence. In truth, there never was such an obligation. The obligation has always been, and remains, that to which I have already referred, to present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine, and to do so with such reference to the facts of the case as is necessary to assist them in that task. In  
         Regina v Zorad 
         , decided earlier in 1990, this court said: 'A summing up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law maybe applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resume of the evidence which relates to each of those ingredients and a brief outline of the argument which have been put in relation to that evidence'. 
         
        
        
         
         A respectable body of long stand authority was cited for that proposition. It is a proposition which has been restated many times since.  
         
        
        
         
         The obligation asserted by that long standing authority was maintained by subsection (3) of s 405AA. The trial Judge must still present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine."" 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      
    18    Nothing further need really be said other than that in the present case beyond defining the essential ingredients of the charges in the various counts and reference to the way in which the Crown sought to make them out there was no compliance with the requirements of which the above extracts from Piazza are but exemplars of what has been stated and restated many times. In that circumstance I am of the opinion that, regrettable though it is, a new trial is inevitable. 
     
      
       
      
    19    The additional grounds now sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellant do not involve assertions which, even if sustained, would lead to judgment of acquittal.  
     
      
       
      
    20    Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be allowed, the convictions and sentences quashed and a new trial be ordered upon those counts in respect of which convictions were entered. 
     
      
       
      
    21    HANDLEY JA: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    22    HIDDEN J: I agree.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    HANDLEY JA: The Court is in a position to give judgment immediately, and I will ask Grove J to so give it. 
     
      
       
      
    2    GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by Herron DCJ in the Sydney District Court. The respondent was born on 24 February 1982 and was at the time of the offences and remains at present a juvenile, hence the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act apply to him and to these proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The respondent pleaded guilty to offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and common assault; those offences carrying prescribed maximum penalties of seven years penal servitude and two years imprisonment respectively. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The learned sentencing Judge ordered that the respondent, in respect of the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, be released on probation for two years upon specified conditions; and in respect of the offence of assault, sentenced to 250 hours community service. 
     
      
       
      
    5    It might be observed in passing that those sentences were suggested by the authors of the requisite report of the Juvenile Justice Service except that their recommendation was that the penalties be imposed in juxtaposition, as it were, to the ultimate impositions by his Honour. Nothing turns upon that in the outcome that, in my opinion, this appeal should reach. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The Crown did not rely upon any specific error in finding by the learned sentencing Judge. Attention was drawn to an observation in his remarks on sentence concerning the applicability of s 33 of the statute that I have mentioned. It was necessary for his Honour to consider whether or not the respondent then before him be dealt with according to law or in accordance with the specific statute. His Honour did not make any express finding in that regard but as the penalties which he imposed did not involve a custody of the respondent, again nothing turns upon this. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The offences occurred upon the eve of the respondent's 16th birthday. At about 5.45pm on Monday, 23 February, two young men, Shailendra Naidu and Van Quoc Tran, were in the foyer section of Sydenham railway station where they were approached by the respondent and another man named Kama. Kama was described in police facts as the physically larger of the two offenders. He was said to have punched the victim Naidu to the ground and repeatedly kicked at his body. The respondent was seen to kick at the victim and the man Tran attempted to intervene, obviously to assist Naidu. The respondent pushed him away and threatened him, thus preventing any assistance being given to Naidu. 
     
      
       
      
    8    Kama then continued his assault which included jumping upon the head of the victim. This caused a fracture and brain damage, and the consequences of that battery were serious indeed. The whole of the events occurred in broad daylight in the location that I have mentioned. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The respondent and his companion were within the view and range of security cameras at the railway station. A witness, Mr Hilton, was standing at a nearby newspaper booth and observed all that occurred. His description of the activity of the man Kama is chilling. However, it should be observed that in relation to the respondent, he (Mr Hilton) told police later that the respondent did not take part in the attack; meaning, that he did not assault Mr Naidu but he did threaten to assault a young Asian man that is to say Mr Tran whom he described as trying desperately and repeatedly to get between the victim and the assailant. He heard the respondent say to Mr Tran ""Do you want some of this yourself?"". 
     
      
       
      
    10    In dealing with the matter, the learned Judge observed the appalling circumstances of the attack, particularly upon the victim Naidu, but remarked that he took into account, from a practical point of view, the part which the respondent played. In so doing, it has not been expressly contended by the Crown that his Honour fell into error. 
     
      
       
      
    11    In broad terms, the Crown has made three submissions: First, that his Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the need for general and specific deterrence; second, that in imposing such lenient penalties, his Honour should be assessed as having overlooked that punishment was fundamental to the need for correction; and, third, that his Honour appeared to have placed an overemphasis upon the rehabilitation of the respondent. 
     
      
       
      
    12    As I have remarked, the respondent was and is a juvenile. The learned Crown Prosecutor appearing in this court pointed out correctly that one of the witnesses assessed the age of the respondent to be approximately 20 years. That observation may well contain the essence of one of the problems in dealing with this respondent; namely that he was in calendar years and of presumed maturity, a youth of 15, whereas his body was one that gave the outward appearance of being 20. 
     
      
       
      
    13    The need for general and specific deterrence remains in every case whether a court deals with a juvenile or an adult. However, there is abundant authority to the effect that considerations of general deterrence play a subordinate role to the needs of rehabilitation when dealing with young offenders. 
     
      
       
      
    14    The respondent was not a person in his late teens, but one who was nearer to his early teens. 
     
      
       
      
    15    The punishment imposed by his Honour was the maximum available in accordance with the categories of punishment which he had selected. Short of committal of the respondent to a detention centre, he could not have imposed a severer penalty. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The Crown Prosecutor is correct in her observations that this was an appalling incident and involved the respondent in conduct which deserves marked condemnation. However, the issue for this court is essentially whether it can be shown by the Crown that the imposition by his Honour was outside of the range of the sound exercise of discretion. In my view, this has not been shown. 
     
      
       
      
    17    The learned judge was entitled to take into account, as obviously he did, the optimistic predictions of the assessors from the Department of Juvenile Justice. It can be observed that their interviews took place some 12 months after the offence. By that time, they felt that maturity had been gained; and it was said in their report that a degree of peer pressure, which may have been present in leading the respondent to the offence, was now a matter that the respondent possessed sufficient skills to deny. 
     
      
       
      
    18    Whether this will be so in something only the future can tell. The respondent had no prior convictions. Since imposition, evidence has been tendered to the Court to show that he has served 136 hours of the community service imposed upon him. It was stated by counsel on his behalf that this was substantially done in attending to the painting of the Bidura Children's Court. 
     
      
       
      
    19    On an overview of all of the material that was available to his Honour and in the absence of demonstration of any relevant error on his part, I come to the conclusion, as I have indicated, that the sentences imposed were within the range of a sound exercise of discretion. Accordingly, I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    20    HANDLEY JA: I agree. I, too, have been impressed with the content of the background report, and particularly with the statements in it that the respondent was living at home, had been living at home with his parents for some time, that he had either been in employment or had been pursuing further studies; the absence of any evidence of other criminal activity since this awful attack on a physically disadvantaged citizens, disadvantaged in terms of height, weight and body build, at Sydenham railway station on 21 February 1998. Not without some doubt, but, nevertheless sufficiently, I agree with the reasons expressed by Grove J for dismissing this appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    21    HIDDEN J: I also agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed.

      1   WOOD CJ AT CL: We grant leave to appeal. The appeal is, however, dismissed.2   The Court is of the unanimous decision it does not raise any question of general principle. Pursuant to s 21A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court's reasons in short form are as follows. 
    3   The applicant stood for sentence in respect of four counts of break, enter and steal on the indictment with a further fifteen offences of the same nature to be taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act, along with two counts of receiving, and one each of possession of property stolen outside the State, goods in custody, and possession of cannabis. 
    4   Before their arrest the applicant and a co-offender embarked on a series of offences, breaking and entering domestic or commercial premises and stealing goods which they subsequently disposed of to known receivers. The value of the property stolen was $59,000, of which property the value of $17,500 was recovered. 
    5   The maximum sentence applicable to each offence of break, enter and steal was penal servitude for fourteen years. 
    6   On the first count, taking into account the Form 1 offences, the applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for four years, made up of a minimum term of two years and three months, and an additional term of one year and nine months. On the remaining counts the applicant was sentenced to fixed terms of penal servitude to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in relation to the first count. 
    7   The applicant, who appeared unrepresented, argued that insufficient weight had been given to: 
     
      
       
       (i) his youth (he was 21 at the time of the offence); 
        
        
       (ii) his prior good record (he had in fact appeared in theChildren's Court in relation to offences of dishonesty including one count of break, enter and steal, and drug charges; 
        
        
       (iii) his co-operation with police once apprehended; 
        
        
       (iv) his own attempts at rehabilitation, particularly by attending drug and alcohol courses; and 
        
        
       (v) the impact of his incarceration on his two year old daughter who was in his care. 
       
      
      
       
        
       
      
    8   All these matters were given appropriate weight by the sentencing judge and the last of the those matters is not to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing save in the presence of exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    9   The level of the applicant's criminality was very high, having regard to the number of offences committed over a short time, the degree of planning that accompanied them, and the value of the property involved. 
    10   In the circumstances the sentence imposed was not shown to be excessive. 
    11   The appeal accordingly is dismissed.

     REGINA v LANCE WILLIAM SZETO  
      
       
      
     JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant pleaded guilty a charge that between 10 February 1996 and 12 August 1996 he dishonestly obtained by deception a quantity of Digital brand laptops, monitors, keyboards and accessories, with a manufacturer’s value of $318,910.73. 
    2   The offence charged related to thirty-three instances of fraudulent orders placed by him, over a six months period, through the computer system of his employer, Digital Engineering Corporation. In committing the offence he took advantage of his position as an Accounts Manager with that company. His duties involved the receiving of orders from customers and placing those orders onto the computer. False invoices were prepared that were directed to the primary customers. 
    3   False credit notes were issued when those customers complained that they had not purchased the goods. 
    4   The applicant sold all of the equipment obtained by means of his deception. Upon his admission, the funds received, which approximated 70 per cent of the retail value of the equipment of $762,175, was spent on living the high life. This apparently included paying off his credit card and also paying off a Lotus motor-vehicle which he had acquired. 
    5   One reason offered for his criminality was that he was dissatisfied, or disgruntled with his employer; otherwise the applicant sought to place the blame upon the person who acquired the equipment from him. The case was not one in which the applicant had any pressing financial needs, or similar reason, for offending. 
    6   The applicant had not given any retribution by the time he appeared for sentence, even though he had expressed an intention to do so and had obtained fresh employment in a highly paid position. 
    7   He did, however, plead guilty from the outset and he had no prior convictions. His employment prior to the offence was continuous and he was well versed in computer skills, including computer programming. He also had a certificate in management skills. He did not drink alcohol, although he had previously abused drugs recreationally. He said that he given up that practice in 1997. He was supported by his friends and family and he was of good general character with favourable rehabilitation prospects.  
    8   The offence which was prosecuted was a single charge under s 178BA of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 5 years. 
    9   The applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 3 years and to an additional term of 1 year. 
    10   Two grounds of appeal were addressed.  
     
      
     Ground (1): sentence is manifestly excessive.  
      
    11   It was submitted that, as the sentence imposed represented 80 per cent of the maximum available, it must be assumed, in view of the favourable subjective circumstances, including the plea of guilty, that his Honour had placed the case in the worst category, and had commenced the sentence at, or near, the maximum. 
    12   It was further submitted that, by comparison with the twenty-five or so cases contained in the schedule which is attached to this judgment, involving offences of fraud by employees or by persons in trust which have been reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal since 1991, involving amounts in excess of $200,000, the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
    13   The submission in that regard has, in my view, been made good, by comparison with those decisions, taking into account, the circumstance that, for some of the appellants, the offence charged was one which carried a higher maximum penalty, and that additionally, in all of those cases, the Crown had charged multiple offences rather than a single offence.  
    14   The case is one, however, which fell into a very serious category of wrongdoing. The dishonest conduct continued over a significant period and involved a very serious breach of trust. It was calculated and premeditated. A significant amount of money was obtained and thrown away on the personal gratification of the applicant. Moreover, his remorse is not evident in so far as he sought to blame the person to whom he sold the goods, or his employer, and also in so far as he has not attempted to give retribution. 
    15   The need for general and specific deterrence in offences in this type has been recognised by this court on more than one occasion, see, for example, McKechnie (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 1 October 1987, unreported) Glenister (1980) 2 NSWLR 597, Newey (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 23 August 1999, unreported), and Pantano (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 11 September 1990, unreported. 
    16   In that last mentioned case I observed: 
     
      
       
       ""The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    17   I would intervene upon the basis that, by comparison with the cases cited, the sentence appears to have been well above that which has normally been imposed. That circumstance is also demonstrated by reference to the Sentencing Statistics, even taking into account that their value is limited to providing some general guidance, because of the enormous variations in objective and subjective circumstances that arise. It follows that it will be necessary to resentence the applicant.  
     
      
     Ground 2: Special Circumstances 
      
    18   Before doing so, I wish to refer to the second ground of the appeal, concerning his Honour's finding that there were no special circumstances established. These were said to relate to the plea of guilty, the fact that the applicant was a first offender and otherwise of good character, and the fact that he has demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation in so far as he has given up recreational drug abuse, and has obtained further employment. 
    19   Two matters should not be overlooked in relation to this aspect of the appeal. First, it is the presence of subjective circumstances of this very kind that facilitates or provides the occasion for serious white-collared crime. Secondly, subjective circumstances of this kind have not normally been regarded as constituting special circumstances for the reasons identified by Justice Hunt CJ at CL in Phelan 66 A Crim R 446, where his Honour said at page 449: 
     
      
       
       ""'Special' does not necessarily mean 'unusual', but it does mean something more than merely a subjective feature of the case. What does constitute a matter as a special circumstance within the meaning of s 5(2) is its production of the need or the desirability for the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole. That need or desirability may arise from the prospect of particular difficulties in adjustment after long periods in custody, or from the greater prospect of rehabilitation if supervised whilst on parole than from a longer period of incarceration."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    20   The present case is one in which his Honour had express regard to each of the circumstances identified, I am not satisfied, even taking into account the further material provided today, concerning the progress of the applicant within the prison system, that special circumstance have been established. 
    21   I would propose that the sentence be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 2 years and 3 months to commence from 18 June 1998 and to expire on 17 September 2000. I would also propose that there be an additional term of 9 months to date from the expiration of the minimum term. It would be a consequence of that order that the applicant be released on parole at the end of the minimum term. 
    22   SIMPSON: I agree.23   WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders of the Court will be as I proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: We grant leave to appeal. The appeal is, however, dismissed. It does not raise any question of principle. Pursuant to S21A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court’s reasons in short form are: 
    2   The applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 18 months, and to an additional term of 2 years, in respect of an offence of armed robbery contrary to S97(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the prescribed maximum penalty is penal servitude for twenty years. 
    3   The offence involved the robbery of $600 from a newsagency, in the course of which the attendant was threatened with a knife. The offence was committed by reason of the addiction of the applicant to heroin. 
    4   The sole point of the appeal relates to the circumstance that a sentence was directed to commence at the expiration of a minimum term of 12 months, for two counts of break and enter inter a building with intent to commit a felony, and of a fixed term for 6 months for the offence of having in custody an offensive implement in a public place. 
    5   It was submitted that since the applicant had been arrested on 7 January, 1998, had pleaded guilty on 19 August 1998, and had been sentenced on 23 October 1998, he should have been given the benefit of, at least, portion of the time served in custody, even though during the entirety of that period he was serving sentences for the other matters which have just been mentioned. 
    6   We observe that each sentence had less than one month to run when the applicant was in fact sentenced. He had an extensive criminal record disclosing a continuous defiance for the law dating back to 1994. His record included multiple offences of stealing, assault, resist police, break enter and steal, drug related offences, and similar forms of criminality. 
    7   It was entirely appropriate for his Honour to accumulate the sentences upon the existing sentences, and to extend the additional term in the way that he did, taking into account the special circumstances found relating to the applicant’s need to have a lengthy period of supervised rehabilitation, and also the fact of accumulation. 
    8   Even allowing for the plea of guilty, the sentence was lenient, when considered in the light of the guideline judgment of this court in Henry (1999) NSW CCA 107, and the aggravating circumstances involved in the use of a knife, Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. 
    9   No error or principle has been identified, and the sentence could not, on any view, be regarded as manifestly excessive.

    THE SUPREME COURT REVISEDOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONAT GRAFTONGRAHAM BARR JWednesday, 15 September 199970080/98 - REGINA v Helga DAWNEYJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: On 13 September 1999 the prisoner Helga Dawney was called for trial for the murder on or about 25 August 1998 of her daughter Tenika Kristi Dawney. She pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown accepted her plea in discharge of the indictment on the basis that if the matter had gone to trial the prisoner would have established the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, that is, that her capacity to understand events or judge whether her actions were right or wrong or to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    2   Since that was the first occasion on which the Crown had been prepared to accept such a plea in discharge of the indictment, the prisoner is to be taken as having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. 
     
      
    3   The prisoner was born on 11 June 1969, the youngest of ten children of her mother. She grew up in a violent household. Her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and children and behaved inappropriately with firearms. The prisoner was sexually assaulted by a brother when she was eight or nine years old. She was an anxious child. Her memories of home until she was thirteen or fourteen years of age are vague and unhappy. At that age she had a fight with her mother and ran away to live with one of her sisters. 
     
      
    4   She did not succeed at school and did not get on well with other pupils. She left unqualified part way through year nine. She did various jobs, none of them for any length of time. 
     
      
    5   She had a number of sexual relations with men, the first at fourteen years of age. When she was nineteen years old she lost a baby. She married at 23, but the marriage failed after two and a half years, apparently because the prisoner was unable then to have children. 
     
      
    6   Two weeks after the marriage ended she was raped by a man she had known for a number of years. 
     
      
    7   Some months later she was stabbed by yet another man. 
     
      
    8   During 1993 and again early in 1994 she had a relationship with Kenneth Robson, a man she had known since she was young. During the second period of the relationship Tenika Dawney was conceived. The relationship ended before the child was born on 22 September 1994. 
     
      
    9   The prisoner told Mr Robson that she was pregnant with his child, but he did not believe her. Even after the child was born, he did not accept that he was the father. He moved away from the area in the course of his work and did not return until 1997. 
     
      
    10   The prisoner was having a good deal of difficulty managing the child. She was easily irritated when the child cried and the child did not thrive. Officers of the Department of Community Services began to be concerned about her welfare and were instrumental in having the child fostered, first by a sister of the prisoner and her husband and then by others. Under the supervision of officers of the Department the child underwent an operation to correct a turning eye. 
     
      
    11   The prisoner did not always appreciate that others were acting in the child’s best interests. She frequently attributed base motives to them and was abusive towards them. 
     
      
    12   In January 1996 the child was returned to the prisoner from Departmental care on condition that she underwent psychiatric assessment. Accordingly, she was seen by Dr Diana Hamilton. The prisoner told Dr Hamilton that allegations that she had neglected the child were without foundation, that officers of the Department were proceeding on baseless accusations and that neighbours, who had apparently complained about her conduct, were “morons”. She described as manipulative the sister who had for a time fostered the child. 
     
      
    13   Dr Hamilton noted that the mood of the prisoner was irritable, angry and labile. She had limited frustration tolerance, was difficult to interview and generally unco-operative. She appeared of average intelligence. There was no evidence of psychosis and Dr Hamilton thought that she was not suffering from any psychiatric disorder. She considered the prisoner a particularly immature and vulnerable woman who had limited skills coping and in dealing with the stressors of parenthood. Dr Hamilton noted the difficult history of the prisoner and her overt hostility towards officers of the Department. She considered that there was a risk that the prisoner could place the child at further risk from future episodes of neglect. 
     
      
    14   Dr Hamilton thought that formal psychiatric treatment would not benefit the prisoner, but recommended regular counselling from a social worker or a psychologist to help her deal with motherhood and to help her cope with her problems. 
     
      
    15   In November 1997 the prisoner caused an order to be served on Mr Robson requiring him to undergo a blood test. He complied and when he learned the results he accepted that he was the child’s father. He attempted to gain access to the child but was unsuccessful, so he commenced court proceedings. Although orders were made in the Local Court, Mr Robson never did gain access to the child. 
     
      
    16   During 1998 the prisoner enrolled the child in a child care centre at Bilambil Heights. Staff of the centre would collect the child from the prisoner and return her at the end of the day. The child was made available only irregularly. Staff noticed that the child looked and smelt unwashed and had sores on her body. They had to wash her. They thought that she was not being properly looked after. 
     
      
    17   In the meantime, Mr Robson had commenced proceedings in the Family Court of Australia in Brisbane, apparently seeking a graduated series of orders leading towards an order that the child reside with him. 
     
      
    18   As she prepared for the Family Court proceedings, the prisoner asked the Acting Manager of the Department at Tweed Heads to write a report for the court as to the unsuitability of Mr Robson to have contact with the child. She said that Mr Robson was dangerous, possessed guns and dealt in drugs. She said that she would kill him. It is unnecessary for me to decide whether any of those claims was true and sufficient to say that the prisoner appears to have believed that what she was saying was true. 
     
      
    19   One day in May 1998 the prisoner told one of the staff of the child care centre, who was collecting her from the prisoner, that she could cope no longer with the court proceedings and that Mr Robson would have the child within a couple of weeks. She instructed the staff member not to return the child to her at the end of the day but to leave her at the police station. She told another staff member that she had already informed the Department about this and that she wanted the child away from her father so that he could not destroy her as he had destroyed the prisoner. She said that she already had one dead child and that this child might be better off dead as well. She said that she was going to commit suicide. 
     
      
    20   That was one of many occasions on which the prisoner threatened to harm herself or the child. 
     
      
    21   About one week before her daughter’s death, the prisoner told a departmental officer that she could not cope and needed respite care for up to a week. As well as caring for her child, the prisoner was then engaged in a business making lead lights and was breeding fish. She was also studying to become a chef and had to put in a greater effort because she had missed some of her studies. 
     
      
    22   On 25 August 1998 a hearing was set down in the Family Court of Australia, Brisbane. The prisoner was then four months pregnant to another man. She attended with the child and her mother, Mrs Grahame. They travelled to Brisbane together on a coach. At court, the Registrar stated an intention to make an order for supervised access and asked Mrs Grahame whether she would be the supervisor. She agreed. Orders were made for Mr Robson to have access under Mrs Grahame’s supervision for the next three Saturdays. The prisoner was very angry with her mother for having agreed to supervise access and very upset about the orders. She refused to return home with her mother and she and the child took a separate bus home. 
     
      
    23   She returned to the house in Tweed Heads where she and the child were living. On the same night she was harbouring an unreasonable but real fear that Mr Robson was stalking her and trying to injure her, her property or her child. She telephoned the Federal Police to ask for help. She telephoned the local police emergency service to ask for help. 
     
      
    24   Between 8pm and midnight she smothered the child in her bed. She spoke to nobody about the matter until she told her mother, some time after 7pm on the following evening, what she had done. In due course her mother told the police and they attended the house and found the dead child. They also found a crucifix and a rosary, which had been placed in the child’s hand, and a note, which was in the following terms - 
     
      
       
        
        FROM the bottom of my heart Tenika I will always love & protect you from you Drugo bastard Father, he wanted you dead & I don’t know how to protect you but god will protect us both, I wish it was different but this the way it has to be. Lots of Love Always & 4 Eva in my heart Love you! your mum. 
        
       
      
    25   On the reverse of the note were written these words - 
     
      
       
        
        REST IN PEACE I LOVE YOU XXXX 
        
       
      
    26   The prisoner was arrested two days later. She had superficial slash marks on her wrists. She was taken to the police station and underwent a formal interview. 
     
      
    27   During the interview the prisoner told the police that she was under too much pressure from what Mr Robson and the court were doing and “lost it”. She said that she accidentally strangled the child with her left hand, when she was in bed screaming. She said that Mr Robson had told lies to the court and was a drug addict. She said that there was no way she would ever give her child to him. She said that regardless of whether the child was alive or dead, there was no way that he was going to have access. 
     
      
    28   She said that after she had killed the child she walked around in a daze and was bleeding from the wrists that she had slashed at about the same time. She intended to die because she had had enough. She wrote the note that she left with the body after she realised what she had done. She was not affected by drugs at the time. 
     
      
    29   She denied any threats to take her own or the child’s life. She denied threatening to kill Mr Robson. She said that he had wanted the child dead as soon as he found out the results of the blood test and had gone to the police station to get his guns. She said that there was no way that he would ever get a chance of hurting the child. She said that she had “snapped” at the time of killing the child because of the child’s father, the family court orders and what the Department and others had done with their lies, pushing their way into the lives of herself and the child, and taking the child from her. She said again that Mr Robson would never see the child again because of what he had done to the prisoner and referred to her having walked out on her husband, having been raped and having been treated badly by Mr Robson. She referred to him in extraordinarily derogative terms. 
     
      
    30   By her plea of guilty, the prisoner has retreated from her claim that she accidentally caused the death of the child. There is no doubt that she intended to kill her. 
     
      
    31   Since the prisoner has been in custody awaiting trial she has been examined by a number of psychiatrists who have provided reports for the Court. Each of the psychiatrists reported difficulty obtaining a consistent and clear account from the prisoner and remarked on the vituperative nature of her complaints about others. She appeared to them to be unable to attribute a decent motive to anyone else and to perceive any shortcoming in herself. 
     
      
    32   The first psychiatrist to see her was Dr Westmore. He interviewed her on 17 April and 11 August 1999. During their interviews the prisoner repeated her complaints about Mr Robson, said that he stalked her when she was eight weeks pregnant and implied that he had cut up her clothesline, broken into the laundry and thrown things at her house. 
     
      
    33   She denied having ever been aggressive to or neglectful of the child. 
     
      
    34   She told Dr Westmore that she was depressed and around the time that her daughter died and was lucky to get one or two hours sleep per night. She said that the child was constantly wetting the bed at the time. She was studying and trying to work and to cope with court cases as well. She was also pregnant. 
     
      
    35   Dr Westmore asked the prisoner about comments she had previously made to Associate Professor Hayes about hearing voices. She confirmed that she did hear a voice and presumed that it was God. She denied receiving messages from the television or radio. 
     
      
    36   Dr Westmore thought that she was intense, anxious and despondent. The detailed and complex way in which she spoke revealed a preoccupation with an extensive range of difficulties. There were strong themes of persecution in her thought content. 
     
      
    37   However, Dr Westmore did not think that she was suffering from hallucinations and concluded that she suffered from a personality disorder with paranoid and possibly borderline features. He pointed to the history of unstable interpersonal relationships, the history of being the victim of sexual abuse within and outside the family and to the violent abuse from her father. 
     
      
    38   Dr Westmore thought that there was no clear, consistent evidence of a diagnosable mental illness, for example schizophrenia, or a major affective disorder, but thought that the prisoner’s resources were overwhelmed with the extended and extensive range of stressors she was exposed to during the time leading up to the death of the child. 
     
      
    39   Dr Westmore’s opinion was that the prisoner was at the time suffering an abnormality of mind, namely a depressive illness. The abnormality of mind arose from the depressive condition and would have substantially impaired her capacity to control herself at the time of the homicide. He thought that the underlying condition was likely to have been long term. 
     
      
    40   Dr William Lucas saw the prisoner on 10 May, 3 June and 29 July 1999. It was necessary to have three interviews because the prisoner was talkative, difficult to hold to the subject at hand and repeatedly returned to things, not always relevant, that she preferred to talk about. 
     
      
    41   Dr Lucas observed that the prisoner had a number of beliefs of an unusual nature about extrasensory perception, precognition, “visions” and voices. He thought, however, that they were probably not psychotic phenomena but overvalued and unusual ideas consistent with a severe personality disorder. 
     
      
    42   He thought that the prisoner’s personality disorder had mixed features, borderline and schizotypal traits being prominent. He thought that at the time she killed her daughter, the prisoner was subject to severe stressors, including fears which to others may have seemed unrealistic but which because of the prisoner’s personality were very real to her. They obviously influenced her conduct. For example, she telephoned the Federal Police and the local police on the night after she returned from the Family Court. He thought that there were good grounds to consider that due to her personality disorder and depression, the prisoner’s capacity to understand events, judge whether her actions were right or wrong or control herself were to varying degrees impaired. In his opinion the impairment was substantial. He thought that the underlying condition, namely the severe personality disorder, was not of a transient kind. 
     
      
    43   Dr Rosalie Wilcox saw the prisoner on 2 and 16 August 1999. Like the other psychiatrists, Dr Wilcox thought that the various odd beliefs the prisoner had were more overvalued ideas than true delusions. She thought that there was no schizophrenia. 
     
      
    44   Dr Wilcox concluded that at the time of the death of the child the prisoner was not suffering from a mental illness, though she expressed a number of bizarre beliefs. She thought that the prisoner was depressed at the relevant time and that her depression was secondary to her persecutory ideation. She thought that the prisoner had a personality disorder that had prominent schizotypal and some borderline traits. The schizotypal features which were noted included the expression of odd beliefs, such as extrasensory perception, her unusual perceptual experiences, the presence of speech that was vague, circumstantial and overelaborate, her suspiciousness and paranoid ideation and her occasional inappropriate affect. The borderline traits which were observed included her pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, her inappropriate intense anger and her affective instability, due to a marked reactivity of mood. 
     
      
    45   Based upon her assessment of the prisoner and her reading of the extensive documentation provided, Dr Wilcox concluded that the prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind, namely a severe personality disorder. Dr Wilcox also thought that the prisoner’s depressed mood would have altered her perception of her situation by causing her to see it as more hopeless than it really was. 
     
      
    46   She concluded that when she took her daughter’s life the prisoner was quite overwhelmed and did not have the personal resources to deal with her situation in a rational manner. As a result, her capacity to understand events and judge whether her actions were right or wrong was impaired to some degree, but her ability to control herself was substantially impaired. 
     
      
    47   Dr Delaforce wrote a report, which was tendered in evidence. He also gave oral evidence, which I found most helpful. He saw the prisoner on 3 September 1999. He had had the benefit of reading the reports of the other psychiatrists. He also administered tests to the prisoner. He thought that there were no psychotic features present. The results of the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition placed her into the severest range of major depression. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III showed an exaggeration of her emotional problems as a consequence of her tendency to self-deprecation. The paranoia, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress, major depression and delusional disorder scales were elevated. 
     
      
    48   Dr Delaforce diagnosed moderate chronic major depressive disorder which, he stated, was consistent with the prisoner’s results in the two tests he had administered. He did not substantiate a diagnosis of any of the specific personality disorders, but identified significant paranoid, borderline and schizotypal personality traits. 
     
      
    49   He thought that at the time of the child’s death the prisoner had experienced a severe level of stressors for a number of months and during her lifetime overall. They included her difficulties managing her daughter, for example, when she would not settle during the night and when she repeatedly wet the bed, the continued conflicts with Mr Robson, including the Family Court proceedings, her fears of being stalked and her attempts to catch up with her studies. She had attempted to get help from others. For example, she had told the departmental worker as late as one week prior to the death that she could not cope and needed respite care. She made it clear to others, too, for example the employees of the child care centre, that she could not cope. She wanted her daughter put in a safe place to protect her from what she perceived as the danger presented by Mr Robson’s imminent access to her. 
     
      
    50   On 25 August 1998 stress was heightened because of the orders made in the Family Court. The prisoner had a serious argument with her mother. Subsequently, fearing that she was again being stalked and that she or her daughter might be killed or kidnapped, she again sought help by telephoning the Federal Police and the New South Wales police. 
     
      
    51   Dr Delaforce thought that there were two categories of motive in child homicide which were relevant, namely killings in retaliation and altruistic killings. Although he thought that one aspect of the prisoner’s personality traits was her tendency to seek revenge, he did not regard revenge against Mr Robson as the significant aspect of the homicide. He thought the altruistic aspect more important. 
     
      
    52   In the altruistic homicide of a child, the parent perceives the killing to be in the child’s best interest, that is, that the best solution at the time is to kill the child. Although this was not an obvious case, such as where a child suffers a severe and painful medical condition or a terminal illness, nevertheless the altruistic aspect applied because of the prisoner’s fears, which he thought genuine, for the welfare of the child should Mr Robson have contact with her. Such a type of altruistic killing, he said, is more common in women and is often associated with a depressive disorder, which can severely change a person’s thinking and behaviour. 
     
      
    53   Dr Delaforce concluded that when she killed her daughter, the prisoner had an abnormality of mind arising from underlying conditions, namely the major depressive disorder and the personality disorder. Those conditions had both been present virtually throughout the adult life of the prisoner and were therefore not transitory. As a result of the abnormality of mind arising from those underlying conditions, there was a substantial impairment in her capacity to understand events, or judge whether her actions were right or wrong, or to control herself. Dr Delaforce thought that she probably had a sincere and genuine belief that her daughter would be better off dead rather than have contact visits with her father. 
     
      
    54   When an offender is being sentenced who was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, considerations of general deterrence and retribution may be less weighty than in the ordinary case. R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ at 71. See also the references at that page to R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86 and R v Letteri Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March 1992, unreported per Badgery-Parker J. But it all depends on the circumstances of the individual case. The existence of a causal relationship between a mental disorder and the commission of an offence does not automatically mean that an offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces an automatically greater sentence. For example, the existence of a causal connection between a mental disorder and an offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. R v Engert at 71. 
     
      
    55   The abnormality of mind which affected the prisoner substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her act but did not negate responsibility. The reduction in her capacity for self-control or to judge whether her action was right or wrong reduced her responsibility but did not excuse her act. 
     
      
    56   Any sentence to be imposed must recognise the objective seriousness of the offence, notwithstanding the substantial impairment of that capacity, and in particular that what was here involved was the felonious taking of human life with intent to kill. 
     
      
    57   In February 1999 the prisoner gave birth to a daughter who is now being cared for by relatives. She told Dr Delaforce that she continued her determination to fight to overcome men abusing women and children. She said that since the birth of her daughter she was not sure whether to accept her daughter being cared for by her relatives or to fight to get her back. If she decided to fight to get her back, she said, “The law will not stop me getting my daughter back”. 
     
      
    58   She also said that she continued to have people protecting her, whom she would not name, so that Mr Robson might be “marked for death” if the news media reported unfavourably about her during her forthcoming murder trial. 
     
      
    59   These two threats were matters of considerable concern to Dr Delaforce, who thinks that as things stand it would be dangerous for the prisoner to be released from prison. That risk arises because the prisoner might try to get her daughter back, with consequent danger to the daughter and those having the care of her, and might try to exact revenge on Mr Robson. 
     
      
    60   Dr Delaforce also stressed that the legal circumstances surrounding the care of the new daughter need to be settled. It would be dangerous, I infer, to release the prisoner into an environment in which she could become bound up in a fight for control of the child. 
     
      
    61   Therapy, Dr Delaforce said, is necessary because the prisoner is a very angry woman. Her anger derives from all the stresses of her life, the most important being the spontaneous termination of her pregnancy in 1988, the break up of her marriage, the rape and the stabbing. Those were circumstances she complained about over and over again. She is chronically and severely depressed and must be allowed to work through her anger and desperation so as to be able to accept her losses and, when she is released from prison, accept as settled the circumstances in which her daughter is cared for. 
     
      
    62   Shortly before he gave his evidence, Dr Delaforce had had a telephone conversation with the psychologist at the prison where the prisoner is now kept, Miss Straede. He had some knowledge of the work being done by Miss Straede before he spoke to her. He reported in very favourable terms about the results of her work and commended her for the progress she had achieved so far in modifying the prisoner’s attitudes. He observed that she was the first therapist the prisoner had learned to trust. However, he observed that there was much more that needed to be done before safety could be achieved. 
     
      
    63   Dr Delaforce was unable to say how long that might take but that, given the continuation of the work of Miss Straede and the co-operation of the prisoner, a lot of therapy within one year could make a lot of difference. If there were less therapy or less effective therapy, of course, longer would be required. 
     
      
    64   It is not clear how long Miss Straede has been the prisoner’s therapist. However, she is willing to continue in this role and the signs seem encouraging. 
     
      
    65   I do not understand Dr Delaforce to be suggesting that a single year will be enough to achieve the fundamental change in the prisoner that will be necessary before she can safely be allowed into the community again. Although I accept the importance of more recent events in shaping the attitude of the prisoner, for example the four events on which Dr Delaforce places emphasis, I do not think that they are the only events that have affected her. I think that the important events of her unhappy and violent childhood, for example the misbehaviour of her father and her brother, contributed to her personality disorder, particularly her persecutory ideation, and to her major depressive disorder. In view of her entrenched attitude, as revealed by such vehement complaints to so many people on so many occasions it is obvious that a substantially greater time than one year will be needed. 
     
      
    66   The minimum term of the sentence I impose must take account of that consideration. 
     
      
    67   At a number of points in their reports the psychiatrists remarked upon the inappropriate affect of the prisoner, showing great anger and concern for some matters and apparent unconcern for others chief among which was the death of her child. That might give rise to the impression that the prisoner has no regrets for what she has done. Dr Delaforce thinks that she is remorseful for having taken the life of her daughter. He thinks her genuine in speaking of the pain she suffers, knowing that she has killed her friend. I accept this evidence. 
     
      
    68   The prisoner is therefore entitled to the full benefit of her early plea of guilty, not only because it has spared the community the time of a trial but because it is evidence of her remorse. 
     
      
    69   The prisoner has no other convictions. 
     
      
    70   After she is released at the expiration of her minimum term of imprisonment, the prisoner will need an extended period on parole in order to assist her rehabilitation and to put into effect in the community the attitudes which will by then have been established during psychological therapy. 
     
      
    71   The minimum and additional terms of the sentence I impose will take account of that need and the need to ensure that the prisoner will not be released into the community until she has ceased to be a danger. 
     
      
    72   I direct that a copy of this judgment, of the report of Dr Delaforce of 8 September 1999, and of a transcript of the evidence he gave on 14 September 1999 be sent to the Parole Board so as to give the Board an opportunity, when considering whether the prisoner should be released on parole, to review the progress that has been made towards a solution to the problem of her dangerousness. 
     
      
    73   Helga Dawney, I sentence you to penal servitude for eight years. The sentence will comprise a minimum term of five years, commencing on 28 August 1998 and expiring on 27 August 2003 and an additional term of three years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 27 August 2003.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
      (Judgment to cross-examine Mina Park under s.38 of  
       
      the Evidence Act - see p. 485 of the transcript) 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: I am not prepared to grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine the witness on any of the three bases sought. For the purposes of these findings, I do not need to examine further the meaning of the term ""unfavourable"" and the concept underlying it, since the Crown has linked his argument to the difference between what the witness said in the ERISP and what she now says. 
    2   Firstly as to that under s.38(1)(a), I do not consider leave appropriate because the only unfavourability that is suggested is the distinction between what the witness now says and what she said in the electronically recorded interview and the disparity between the two accounts, insofar as there is one, is insufficient to justify taking that course. 
    3   As to the s.38(1)(c) basis, I am of the view that the prior account is not so materially different from the present as to warrant taking the course sought and that is really a finding very much the same as the s.38(1)(a) finding. 
    4   As to s.38(1)(b), I have been invited by Mr. Temby and the Crown to have regard not only to the written material comprising the statements and the electronically recorded interview transcript, but also to the demeanour of the witness and the way in which she gave her evidence in the witness box. 
    5   I am of the view that the witness was patently a person of whom I conclude, that on numerous occasions throughout her testimony, she was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence frankly and fully. She was certainly making an attempt to give evidence, but evidence as limited as possible on particular subject matter, that being matter, such that one could reasonably conclude about which she might reasonably be supposed to have knowledge. In my view, she sought so to qualify and limit what she had said as to deprive it of any real value. 
    6   However, bearing in mind the limited difference between the version given to the police in the ERISP, and for which the Crown now contends, and that which she actually did give at the end of the day, and that her reluctance to make a genuine attempt to give evidence fully and frankly, was evidenced clearly to the jury in her demeanour and the way in which she answered questions on numerous topics, I do not consider, in the exercise of my discretion, I should grant leave to cross-examine on that basis either.

   DECISION : 
   Leave to appeal granted. Appeal allowed, and in lieu of sentence imposed, the applicant be sentenced, to take into account the matters on the Form 1, to a minimum term of penal servitude for one and a half years from 15 September 1998 and to expire on 15 March 2000, and to an additional term of one year to commence on 15 March 2000 and expire on 14 March 20101. In those circumstances, it is necessary in addition to make an order that he should be rleased on parole at the expiry of the minimum term.

     REGINA v JOHN WILLIAM CROMBIE 
      
       
      
     JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant was originally committed for trial in respect of an offence charged under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, that being an offence of supplying drugs on an on-going basis, in this instance on three or more separate occasions between 8 September 1998 and 15 September 1998.  
    2   On arrest he was also charged, presumably in the alternative, with an offence of supply under s 25 (1) of the Act between those dates, and with three separate offences of supply, presumably as back up charges for individual acts of supply on 12 September 1998, 14 September 1998 and 15 September 1998. It was these acts of supply that provided the basis for the on-going supply charge as well as for the alternative supply charge. 
     
      
    3   The applicant was arrested in the course of a police operation using an undercover officer. That officer approached the applicant, initially on 12 September 1998, in Allsop Park Nimbin, a known venue for drug supply. On that occasion he purchased a single $50 street deal. When the applicant was asked whether he was normally in this location he replied, ""Mate, I am here everyday, rain, hail or shine."" The undercover operative returned on 14 September 1998 when a further purchase of one $50 deal was made, and on 15 September when two $50 street deals were effected. 
     
      
    4   The undercover operative noticed, at the time of the second of these deals, that the applicant had in his possession seven or so packages of what appeared to be heroin. At the time of his arrest he was found to be in possession of four packets of white powder. In his ERISP when asked how often he sold heroin, the applicant replied, ""Not very often, only when I needed some money for myself, mainly for food."" 
    5   When the applicant appeared for arraignment at the District Court, at Lismore, the Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment based not upon s 25A of the Act, but one containing a single charge of supply contrary to s 25 (1), being that related to the street deal effected on 15 September 1998. The other two single instances of supply were included on the Form 1.  
    6   In taking this course the Crown Prosecutor explained that he had taken the view, upon the facts of the case, that it was not ""an appropriate vehicle to test the parameters"" of s 25A, and that prosecution of the applicant upon that basis ""didn't appeal"" to him. The logic behind that conclusion entirely escapes me, since it is precisely to deal with this kind of conduct that s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act was enacted. However, an indictment was presented, and a plea was accepted on the basis mentioned, and the applicant was entitled to be sentenced accordingly. 
    7   The consequences of the decision to proceed under s 25 (1), rather than s 25A, and the election to proceed upon indictment in the District Court, rather than to proceed summarily in the Local Court, were matters of some practical significance.  
    8   The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25A is penal servitude for 20 years, or 2,500 penalty units, or both. An offence under this section can only be prosecuted on indictment. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25 (1), if dealt with in the District Court upon indictment, is penal servitude for 15 years, or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both. However, if dealt with summarily in the Local Court, as is permissible if the quantity of drugs involved is not more than a “small quantity”, (1 gram in the case of heroin), then the maximum available penalty is imprisonment for 2 years, or a fine of 50 penalty units, or both pursuant to s 30 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
    9   In the result, the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of two years, to date from the time that he was taken into custody for the offence, and to an additional term of one and a half years. 
    10   In relation to the proportion between the minimum and additional terms, his Honour found that there were special circumstances, relating to the fact that this was the first sentence imposed upon the prisoner who was then aged thirty-nine years, to the assessment that he had above average prospects of rehabilitation, and to the conclusion that he needed extensive supervision post release because of his history of drug abuse.  
    11   His Honour found, as a matter of fact, that the applicant was an active street dealer, albeit an addict dealer. He had a prior record for offences for dishonesty and for drug related matters, as well as possession of house breaking implements but had not been sentenced to imprisonment for any of those matters. He was subject to a recognizance to be of good behaviour for the last mentioned offence, as well as for two counts of using false instrument, at the time of the supply offence. 
    12   The appeal was pursued on the basis that the sentence was manifestly excessive, having regard to the circumstance that offences of supply, of the kind here involved, are prima facie to be dealt with in the Local Court, that is in the absence of an affirmative election by the prosecuting authority to proceed in the District Court: s 33A Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
    13   Although not questioning that an election had been made, or that his Honour had jurisdiction to deal with the matter upon indictment, it was submitted that the case was one which, being suitable for summary disposition, resulted in a sentence which failed to take into account that circumstance. As the sentencing order was framed, the sentence imposed was close to double the maximum available in the Local Court, while the minimum term equated to the maximum fixed term that could be imposed in that court.  
    14   It was common ground, as the sentencing statistics bear out, that, had the matter been dealt with in the Local Court, then it is likely that it would have attracted a significantly lesser sentence than that which was imposed by his Honour. 
    15   This Court has acknowledged that the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge, see Dalton-Morgan, Court of Criminal Appeal 14 December 1989, Jason Clyde Smith, Court of Criminal Appeal 11 September 1991, and Shepherd (1991) New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 162.  
    16   None of those decisions go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Moreover, where it appears that in the circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal. 
    17   In this case, the relevant circumstance was not overlooked by his Honour, as appears from the fact that, in the course of the reasons for sentence, he noted the submission that had been advanced, but observed in effect, that the sale of drugs to strangers involved a more serious form of criminality than that which existed in the case of supply by an addict to a friend or associate. In other words, his Honour was making the point, correctly in my view, that a commercial supply was a more serious form of criminality. 
    18   As I have observed, the applicant was sentenced upon the basis that he was an active street dealer, and upon the basis that the offence of supplying heroin was a serious crime. Neither finding could be open to question. 
    19   The applicant’s objective criminality was also entitled to be regarded as increased by the circumstance that he had been subject to a recognizance, at the time of his arrest, and by the fact that the three occasions of supply occurred within a short period of time. His Honour noted the prevalence of the offence, particularly in the Nimbin area, and the need to discourage the trade in hard drugs within that area. 
    20   Although not referred to, the classic statement of Wells J, in Le Cerf (1975) 8 ALR 349, at 359, concerning the significance of the role of middlemen and underlings in the perpetuation of the drug trade, was apposite to the present case. Absent the existence of street dealers the trade would not exist to the extent that it does. This is not to suggest that the applicant should have been sentenced for offences other than that before the court. It serves merely to underline that an offence of supply of heroin by a person who, on his own admission, was a regular, albeit not a big, dealer cannot be dismissed as trivial. 
    21   His Honour did not overlook any of the relevant subjective circumstances, each of which was expressly referred to. On that account, no error in principle was identified. Moreover, his Honour found that there were special circumstances justifying a departure from the usual ratio between the minimum and additional terms. Again in that regard, no error of sentencing principle has been identified. 
    22   The appeal comes down to a single point, in my view, as to whether sufficient allowance was made for the circumstance identified, namely, that the case could properly have been prosecuted in the Local Court, and also, the circumstance that the Crown Prosecutor conceded that to be so, but in the exercise of his discretion had decided to proceed with a lesser charge of supply in the District Court. If that circumstance is properly to be given weight in this case, particularly against the circumstance that the applicant, who had reached the age of thirty-nine, and was making some attempt to rehabilitate himself, was facing a first term of imprisonment, then it appears to me that the sentence has been shown to be manifestly excessive. 
    23   I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed and that, in lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant be sentenced, to take into account the matters on the Form 1, to a minimum term of penal servitude for one and a half years to commence from 15 September 1998 and to expire on 15 March 2000 and to an additional term of one year to commence on 15 March 2000 and to expire on 14 March 2001. In those circumstances, it will be necessary in addition to make an order that he should be released on parole at the expiry of the minimum term. 
    24   SIMPSON J: I agree. 
    25   WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders of the Court will be as I proposed.

      L00013/97 - R v Norman Howard WILSON 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR. This is an application by Norman Howard Wilson pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1987 for re-determination of the life sentence imposed on him by Finlay J on 29 June 1990 following his conviction on 21 May 1990 for the murder of his 18 year old son, Dean Edward Wilson, at Nullamanna, near Inverell, on 1 September 1989. The Crown does not oppose the application. 
    2    The applicant was born on 20 September 1944 and at the time of the offence was aged 44 years and living in Inverell. He and his wife Janelle had five children and his wife had another child from a previous relationship. The deceased was the second youngest of the applicant's children. 
    3    On 19 June 1989 some three months before the offence, Mrs Wilson left the family home, apparently as a result of continuing marital discord, the cause of which she attributed to the applicant, and moved to Victoria leaving the applicant, his son Dean, then aged 18 and their daughter Melissa, then aged 14, living together at Inverell.4    On 3 August 1989, Craig Wilson, another son, purchased a .22 magnum bolt action rifle from an Inverell sports store and a couple of weeks later had a discussion about the rifle with his father at Craig's home in Bennett Street, Inverell. 
    5    Late in August, Dean was successful in his application to join the New South Wales Police Service which, according to the applicant's wife and several of his children, displeased the applicant; but the applicant claims he was in fact pleased and had encouraged his son in his application. 
    6    On Wednesday 30 August 1989 the applicant stole Craig's rifle from where it was kept in the spare bedroom of the Bennett Street house. Late in the afternoon of the next day, the day before the murder, he placed the rifle in his car. The evidence at the trial did not disclose when the rifle was loaded. 
    7    At 10 am on 1 September 1989, the applicant, by a ruse, induced his son Dean, to accompany him on a drive to a dirt track off the Nullamanna Road, some 13 kilometres from Inverell. During the drive the two men argued, apparently about Mrs Wilson leaving home. The applicant told his son to get out of the car and leave. After his son left the car the applicant also got out carrying Craig's rifle. With the men standing some four to five feet apart the applicant shot Dean, the bullet penetrating his upper left arm. However, the gunshot wound was not fatal and the applicant thereupon killed his son with sustained acts of violence including smashing his head with a rock. The applicant stated in his record of interview: 
     
      
       
       ""I just went bang and when I seen blood I just went mad, I couldn't stop. I just kept going and hitting him, hitting him with anything I could get my hands on, with the rifle a rock, anything"". 
       
      
     
     
     He then dragged the body some ten metres off the roadway and covered it with vegetation. 
      
    8    The applicant claimed that on his return journey to Inverell he threw Dean's shoes and Craig's rifle out of the right hand side of the vehicle. He later disposed of the bloodstained clothing he had been wearing during the offence at the dump and that afternoon went shopping at Inverell with his daughter Melissa. 
    9    He reported Dean missing to Inverell police the next day, and two days later checked with police as to whether there was any information regarding his son's whereabouts. On Wednesday 6 September, police searched the applicant's Inverell residence. After the search, the applicant accompanied police to Inverell Police Station. The applicant appeared to break down and agreed to take police to the location of his son's body, which he did, and pointed out Dean's body which was under a mound of branches, leaves and grass. 
    10    The deceased, who was lying on his back, had sustained injures to his face and head, and in the crook of his right elbow between his arm and body was a large blood stained basalt rock. 
    11    Whilst at the scene, the applicant admitted to the detectives that he had killed Dean by shooting him with a .22 rifle. He then went on to say, ""I should have shot myself instead, I was going to and that's when he grabbed the gun. He tried to stop me but the gun went off."" 
    12    On the return journey to Inverell the applicant indicated to detectives the places where he claimed to have thrown the rifle and Dean's shoes from the car. 
    13    At the police station the applicant took part in a signed record of interview which contained admissions to the above effect. 
    14    The next day he agreed to accompany detectives on a tour of the area where he said he had disposed of the rifle, shoes and other items, but only one of the shoes was found and the rifle has never been located. 
    15    The post-mortem examination disclosed a bullet in the muscle above the left elbow and a number of compound comminuted fractures of the skull which the pathologist, Dr Hall, deposed at the trial were consistent with having been inflicted with at least four or five major blows with the very heavy basalt rock found at the murder scene. His opinion was the cause of death was massive brain injury associated with multiple compound fractures to the skull. 
    16    A motive for the crime has never been established, although the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had been significantly depressed by his wife leaving him. 
    17    Four days before the trial was due to commence Detective Ferguson received a copy of an affidavit sworn by the applicant, and dated the previous day, in which he nominated three other persons as being responsible for Dean's murder and stated that his oldest son Craig was in some way involved in the offence. He subsequently took part in a further record of interview, denying that he was responsible in any way for his son's death, and at the trial gave sworn evidence consistent with the affidavit and such further record of interview. This version was obviously false and by its verdict of guilty the jury clearly rejected it. 
    18    In proceedings before me, the applicant claimed that although he now accepts that he was responsible for his son's death and that the original version he gave the police must have been correct, he says he has no recollection of the events and he accepts responsibility on the basis of what he has read. If this is so, and was so, the second version shortly before and at his trial, must have been false because he had no memory of the event. If, on the other hand, at the time, he did in fact remember what had happened, the second version was also false. He is not, of course, to be punished for telling lies, but the fact that he initially furnished two different versions created a number of difficulties for the sentencing judge and for the psychiatrist who examined him prior to the trial and sentencing. 
    19    Dr Lucire examined the applicant before the trial on behalf of the Crown and expressed the opinion that on the information available there was no evidence of any mental illness but considerable evidence of former sociopathic traits and she went on: 
     
      
       
       ""As the information he gives me is not reliable, I am unable to form an opinion regarding, for example, the role of alcohol in his marital break down and the role alcohol might have played in the involvement in the act to which he confessed. As I am still unsure of his alcohol use history, I cannot also say whether alcohol played a part in his delaying reporting of the homicide.  
       
      
      
       
       My impression is he is a simple man with a family and employment back ground where a great deal of heavy drinking occurs with resultant changes in temperament and personality, and that he is not telling me the whole truth. Indeed, I suspect if his wife complained, she might have had something to complain about.  
       
      
      
       
       The case should be based purely on its legal merits. There is no psychiatric defence here."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    20    Dr Greenway had examined the applicant, prior to the trial, on instructions from his solicitors. His opinion was: 
     
      
       
       ""At the moment Mr Wilson does not appear to be suffering from any psychiatric disorder. It does appear likely that he was significantly depressed following his wife's leaving. He gives two entirely different accounts of his son's death at least one of these is untrue. It is impossible to know from Mr Wilson's evidence alone which one that is."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    21    Following his conviction but before sentencing, reports were obtained from Mr Wayne Reid, psychologist, and Dr Jolly, psychiatrist. Mr Reid said: 
     
      
       
       ""I do not feel there is sufficient evidence to suggest an acquired organic disorder, based on the information gained from my neuropsychological assessment. It is however my clinical opinion, based on Mr Wilson's complaints of auditory hallucinations, and his presenting symptoms of severe depression, that he does have a significant psychiatric disorder (? a psychosis) that requires further investigation."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    22    Dr Jolly said there was evidence of an alcohol induced amnesia, and raised the possibility that the applicant was suffering from a condition called alcoholic hallucinosis, a condition similar to delirium tremens. He was also of the opinion that he suffered a form of depressive illness which flowed on primarily from his wife's leaving him and said he was clinically depressed before the subject incident, and it was severe depression, a major psychiatric illness. At the time the applicant had made at least two serious attempts at suicide. 
    23    At the time he stood for sentence, s 19 of the Crimes Act 1900 provided that a life sentence was mandatory ""unless it appears to the judge that the person's culpability for the crime is significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances whether disclosed by the evidence in the trial or otherwise."" The provision had been considered in R v Burke [1983] NSWLR 92 and R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466, and in effect it was held that the proviso referred to culpability or blame worthiness relating to the offence itself, and not to subjective features such as might have been relevant on sentencing for any other offence. 
    24    Finlay J, whilst accepting that the prisoner was depressed following his wife's leaving, and indeed had what may be called a significant depression in this regard, was far from satisfied that the crime was significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances, and accordingly the proviso was not applied, and he sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for life. 
    25    Doctor Jolly has furnished a further report for the purpose of these proceedings and given oral evidence before me in which he elaborated on that report. In effect he is of the same opinion now as he was then, namely, that the applicant, at the time of committing the offence, was suffering a major depressive illness and possibly had alcoholic hallucinosis. It was submitted, therefore, that I should find to that effect, thereby mitigating the objective seriousness of the crime and resulting in a reduced sentence by way of minimum and additional terms than would otherwise have been the case. 
    26    Section 13A (10A) provides that on the re-determination of a life sentence the Court must have regard to, and give substantial weight to, the observations and comments of the original sentencing court, or to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to such matters, state its reasons for doing so. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I am not bound by the findings of the sentencing judge if there are good reasons for departing from them: R v Cox (CCA - Unreported - 19 June 1997). 
    27    Apart from the fact that Dr Lucire, after sentence was passed, considered alcoholic hallucinosis as a possibility, but did not do so beforehand, there really is no relevant fresh evidence on the issue. Diminished responsibility was not raised as a defence at the trial; and in the light of the evidence then available could not have been raised. It is not open to me, on these resentencing proceedings, to make a finding based on Dr Jolly's evidence that the applicant's responsibility was diminished to a significant degree and sentence him on that basis, as that would amount to sentencing him for manslaughter and not for murder. Doctor Jolly really only reaffirms the opinion he had at the time, that he was clinically depressed as a result of his wife's leaving. Finlay J accepted that he was significantly depressed at the time as a result of his wife's leaving, and so do I; but such evidence as there is on the subject shows that his wife left because of his excessive drinking and violence towards her over a lengthy period. As that was what caused her to leave, which in turn led to his depression, it does not reduce his culpability for the murder of his son. 
    28    The applicant is now 55 years old and is in poor health. He had a stroke a number of years ago which disabled the right side of his body from which he has almost completely recovered, but currently he is suffering from emphysema which he says, and I accept, affects him very badly. He has trouble sleeping and has to sit bolt upright to sleep. He cannot walk far, has difficulty breathing and has sprays to assist his breathing. 
    29    He was born and grew up in Inverell. His father was a pound keeper and he is the youngest son having five brothers and one sister. His mother died when he was about 4 or 5 years old. At the age of 11 or 12 he was badly burnt whilst filling a cigarette lighter which resulted in hospitalisation for some 18 months and his schooling was thereby interrupted, leaving him with significant scars about which he was quite sensitive. At the time of his arrest, he did have low literacy skills but he has improved these whilst in custody.  
    30    His prior criminal record shows a number of stealing, break and enter, and such like offences dating back to when he was a juvenile which I would not regard as significant in the context of this offence. He also had a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1974 which may be taken as indicative of his drinking, but standing by itself does not show much. Of more concern are convictions in Inverell in 1966 for possession of a firearm and discharging a firearm near a public street. The evidence discloses that the firearm was discharged not only near a public street but in close proximity to his wife at a time when he was affected by alcohol to a significant degree. 
    31    Upon sentence his Honour directed that the applicant be returned to the prison hospital where he was being kept at the time because of his suicide tendencies. In December 1990 he was transferred to Lithgow Correctional Centre with an A2 classification. On 4 March 1996 he was transferred to Bathurst Correctional Centre where he remains with a B classification. He has no misconduct whatsoever recorded on his prison file and has been a model prisoner, consistently receiving good reports and has excellent work records. He has completed a number of courses whilst in custody. He has had psychological counselling on a more or less regular basis and has attended a number of D and A courses. 
    32    I do not intend to go through the various reports from the Serious Offenders Review Board except to say that they are all good reports and clearly the description of the applicant as a model prisoner is justified. 
    33    The Serious Offenders Review Council also reports that if the sentence is redetermined it will develop a plan for his management during the remainder of any minimum term, and hopefully he will be progressively reduced in security during his imprisonment in preparation for his eventual return to the community. 
    34    One matter that has been of concern is that in 1991, shortly after his conviction, he wrote a letter to his wife blaming her and his stepdaughter, Sheryn, for his problem and stating that he hoped all the hate was out of his system before he got out and went on:  
     
      
       
       ""Maybe one day you and her will pay for what you have done to me."" 
       
      
      
     There was also evidence of reports by police of other threats that they had heard around the town of Inverell. This latter evidence was objected to and I rejected it as the sources of the rumours were not identified. 
      
    35    He now says that whatever his feelings were then he does not bear any ill will towards his former wife or children. He has had no contact with them since he has been in gaol and does not intend to seek them out if and when released. 
    36    He also conceded in evidence that he had been violent towards his ex-wife during the course of the marriage. He said he does not know where his ex-wife and the children live, but he feels sorry for the hurt he has caused them and he has no intention of having anything to do with them. He maintains contact with one brother and a sister. He further stated he did not think there would be a chance in the world that he would ever reoffend, and no way he would ever touch alcohol again. 
    37    Dr Jolly in his report expressed the view that the applicant seems to now accept full and proper responsibility for his actions and he carries a classical burden of guilt as well as having major health problems. He did not regard him as a threat or risk to members of his family. He reaffirmed this view in his oral evidence and said that he did not consider the applicant was likely to offend again and gave as his reasons for that opinion: (a) that he now genuinely believes that he did kill his son; (b) his physical health is such that he cannot move quickly and people with emphysema, are not generally aggressive, and; (c) there is nothing in his conduct which would indicate a tendency to that sort of conduct. 
    38    I accept Dr Jolly's opinion in that regard and am satisfied that there is only a very slight risk of him reoffending, and virtually no risk of him reoffending if he can keep away from the alcohol. He is determined to keep away from alcohol, but that may be easier said than done when he is ultimately released into the community. 
    39    He is aged 55, been in custody for ten years and in view of his condition is unlikely to be able to work when he is released. In my view, the fact that the victim was his son aggravated the offence, particularly as no motive has ever been disclosed, and the applicant still says he does not know why he did it. On the other hand, his age, ill health and his excellent record whilst in custody are subjective features in his favour, and I have taken them all into account. 
    40    Norman Howard Wilson, for the murder of your son Dean Edward Wilson I re-sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term of 15 years which shall be deemed to have commenced on 6 September 1989. I fix an additional term of 5 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 5 September 2004.

      REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On application for discharge of jury or adjournment of trial 
       
      - see p.473 of the transcript) 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: This application has been extremely finely balanced, but I have come to a firm view as to its fate. I am minded to grant the adjournment insofar as it should be necessary, but to have in mind that it will be necessary to minimise the effects on the trial that will thereby be created, lest there should be, in the future, a necessity for a discharge to ensure fair treatment for the accused. 
    2   This is a trial of an accused on three counts of murder; that is, the murder of his wife and two children. The offence alleged against him is one of considerable heinousness. Both parties are of the view that the testimony of a witness, So Young Hwang, who on the Crown case was, during the relevant period, the accused's mistress, who left Australia with him and who had contact with the accused's wife shortly prior to that woman's disappearance, is desirable at the trial. 
    3   I had already ruled that her testimony could not, appropriately, be given by audiovisual link, bearing in mind that she would have been giving evidence from South Korea and she would not have been under a sanction, at least the legal effects of a sanction, arising as would have been the case had she been giving evidence here as a consequence of taking the oath and the application of the relevant portion of the Crimes Act. I did that because it seemed to me that there would be, and indeed this has been confirmed, a substantial challenge to aspects of her evidence and that that challenge would not be limited to ordinary attacks upon credibility, but might well include a challenge upon the basis of her involvement in serious criminality and possible criminality of the order of that charged against the accused, at least in some degree of complicity. 
    4   Further, the witness having an immunity, may have an end of her own to serve and there may be other matters which go to unreliability, such that had she been giving evidence by video link, it is possible a jury might not have been able to appreciate the matters notwithstanding an appropriate direction under s.165 of the Evidence Act. 
    5   The witness' evidence I need not recount for the purposes of this application and, indeed, it has hardly been referred to by either party. But, that evidence is certainly most important to the Crown case. Whilst it is not direct evidence of the commission by the accused of the offence charged, it does go to prove important circumstances which, should the evidence be given and accepted, would, when taken in conjunction with other circumstances otherwise proved, considerably strengthen the Crown case. 
    6   On the other hand, it may well be that the defence would have available from this witness evidence which would tend to displace the hypothesis that the accused committed the crime. She is peculiarly close to the action, to use the vernacular. 
    7   In the interests of justice, particularly considering an offence as serious as this, and a circumstantial case, I would not see it as appropriate, if it could be done while ensuring a fair trial, that her evidence would be effectively excluded. 
    8   Mr. Temby, however, who appears for the accused, has pointed out that this trial is already fragmented. He has not resiled from what was put earlier, that the testimony was desired, but has adopted a position that, on balance, the fragmentation that has occurred and will occur to the trial by reason of meeting the convenience of the witness when coming to Australia, she not being capable of being compelled to come or to come any earlier than she has indicated, is such that there would remain a real question of the jury being unable to appreciate, at the end of the trial, the significance of matters which have been given earlier and properly to appreciate and apply their recollections by that time. 
    9   It is true the trial will be fragmented. It may be that events may occur in the future of the trial which might occasion a further application and which application, bearing in mind the increasing frailty of this trial as a consequence of the fragmentation I have referred to, might have to be acceded to. I know not. But, the Crown has pointed out that that fragmentation does not mean that the jury cannot properly appreciate what has gone on, that much of the evidence is uncontroversial, that of that portion of the evidence where credibility is particularly at issue, that is the testimony of Mr. Paul Lowe and Mina Park, steps may be able to be taken to minimise the damage. 
    10   I interpolate that this application has been made midway through the hearing of an application by the Crown at what would otherwise be the close of Mrs. Park's evidence in chief for leave to cross-examine pursuant to s.38 of the Evidence Act. That application may need some time yet by way of hearing before I can conclude it. 
    11   The proceedings, as I have said, are fragmented. The issues, however, are of great and dramatic importance. In the upshot, taking into account the undertakings offered by the Crown, they being, firstly, an undertaking to meet the loses that might be occasioned by costs thrown away to enable the accused to retain his existing representation, at the rate of remuneration or at least at a reasonable rate of remuneration if that rate is not reasonable, and to assist with such Commonwealth departments as might be necessary to obtain relevant documentation, it seems to me that the matter has come down then really to the issue of whether the jury can or cannot continue with the trial in such a fashion as to be able to afford both parties justice. 
    12   On what I have seen so far, and on what I have heard in this application, I am not of the view that the trial, as it stands, would be unfair. Whether that view will change can only depend upon what happens from here on in. 
    13   For the moment, the Crown is prepared to undertake steps to seek to minimise such prejudice to the accused as might arise through isolation of the relevant witness from other evidence and to seek to space the evidence in some such fashion that, as the Crown referred to it, a buffer be created around that witness. 
    14   There may be other steps the Crown might take. There may be other steps the defence might seek that the Crown takes. I know not. But, the evidence is evidence which seems to me on balance in the interests of justice should not be excluded by what amounts to a listing arrangement, what seems to have been some degree of ineptitude in the prosecuting authorities securing the testimony at an earlier date and some unwillingness of the witness occasioned possibly by influence from her family or, alternatively, by other causes, which are not made clear. These matters should not, even taken in conjunction, result in the exclusion of what seems to be vital evidence. 
    15   The steps that the Crown might take to minimise prejudice are essentially a matter for the Crown in the running of its case. But it will, in the running of its case, need to have regard to the fact that if prejudice is occasioned, or the jury seems unable to follow and perform the function fairly that it is required to perform, it runs the risk of a future application of a different kind being successful.********

     REGINA v Bruce CLAXTON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: On 18 August 1998 the appellant, Bruce Allan Claxton, was indicted before his Honour Judge Mitchelmore on two alternative counts. The first was that between 18 and 19 September 1997, at Lawson, he stole a 1997 model Builtwell Stanza brand horse float, the property of Shauna Bottrell. The alternative charge was that between 18 and 27 September 1997, at Castle Hill, he received and had a 1997 model Builtwell Stanza brand horse float, the property of Shauna Bottrell before then stolen, the stealing of which amounted to a felony and: 
     
      
       
        
        ""he, the said Bruce Allan Claxton, at the time when he received the said property, knowing the same to have been stolen."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      The offence charged in the second count was an offence under s188 of the 
        
      Crimes Act 
      .  
      The appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. 
       
      
    2    On 20 August 1998 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second. On 4 December 1998 the appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of one year commencing on 3 October 1998 and expiring on 2 October 1999, and an additional term of one year commencing on 3 October 1999. The appellant appeals against his conviction. 
     
      
    3    The Crown case, in summary, was that during the night of 18/19 September 1997, a Builtwell Stanza brand horse float, the property of Ms Bottrell, was stolen from outside her residence at Lawson. A witness, Belinda Zaiter, gave evidence that on 27 September she noticed a ""For Sale"" sign for a horse float at Woodville Avenue, Granville. She bought the horse float from the appellant for $2,350 and paid a deposit of $300 to him. The appellant told her that the float was his and had been sitting on his property for 20 years. When Ms Zaiter showed surprise, he said that he had rebuilt it. 
     
      
    4    The appellant gave her a receipt showing the letters and numbers HF2745 which were the same as those appearing on the front bars of the horse float. The horse float did not have any registration plate or registration document accompanying it. Ms Zaiter said that the appellant told her that it was his float, that he had recently divorced from his wife, that he had lived on a farm up at Mudgee and that she got the four wheel drive, he basically got the horse float and a ""bombie"" old car and he bought the float down here to Sydney to try and sell it. 
     
      
       
        
        ""He told me that the float had been sitting on his property for 20 years. When I showed surprise at that he told me he had rebuilt it all, had stripped it back, sandblasted it and rebuilt it. Hence that's why it looked in such good condition."" 
        
       
      
    5    When Ms Zaiter later looked more closely she noticed stickers that had been put near the tail-light, obstructing other stickers already there. That and other matters she noticed, including the very good condition of the float, which she said smelt like it was a new float, led her to contact the manufacturer and Ms Bottrell and report the matter to the police. 
     
      
    6    Ms Bottrell gave evidence that she had purchased a float from Bolger Four Wheel Drive Centre for $5,000. It was placed in front of her house. She last saw it at about 7.30pm on 18 September 1997. Ms Bottrell received a telephone call from Ms Zaiter and went to have a look at the float that Ms Zaiter had. She recognised it as hers because the ""Bolger Four Wheel Drive"" stickers, which were underneath the tail-lights on either side of the rear, were still there. She also noticed that the left and front chest bars had been torn due to an occasion when she was transporting her own horse. Three hardboard cleat boards on the back of the coach box had been put there by her brother-in-law and those were still there. They did not come with the float when she purchased it. 
     
      
    7    The Crown case was that the modifications were consistent with disguising the identity of the float by those modifications. Reference is made to the stickers put over the existing stickers and to repainting. 
     
      
    8    On 4 October 1997 the appellant presented himself at the Ermington Police Station where he was interviewed and the interview was recorded. He gave his address as 20 Hillview Place, Glendenning. At all times he maintained he had bought the float from another person. He told police he had a receipt for the float which he had recently purchased at Castle Hill. He showed police the receipt he had obtained from the person who sold it to him. That receipt stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I, Patrick Johnson, do hereby sell one double horse float for the sum of $1500 in full."" 
        
       
      
    9    The paper was dated 22 September 1997 and bore a car registration number. The appellant admitted selling the float to Ms Zaiter and denied knowledge of the theft or alteration of the float. At the time he sold the float there was no suggestion that he gave any false name or false address. 
     
      
    10    At the trial, the appellant did not give or call any evidence on his behalf. The amended grounds of appeal now relied on are: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. His Honour erred in law in directing the jury there was no doubt that someone stole the horse float; 
        
       
       
        
         2. His Honour misdirected the jury as to the elements of the offence of receiving; 
         
          
         
        3. There has been a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s6 of the 
          
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         (1912)."" 
        
       
      
    11    His Honour's summing-up began on 19 August 1998 and continued on 20 August 1998. Early on the first day of the summing-up his Honour isolated areas in which he said there was no dispute. These included: 
     
      
       
        
         ""It is not in dispute that someone stole Shauna Bottrell's horse float. There is no dispute that during the same month, a little later in that month, the accused endeavoured to sell the horse float to Mrs Zaiter. There does not seem any dispute that certain alterations had been made to the horse float."" 
        
       
      
    12    A little later in that part of the summing-up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""But other than the areas where there is no dispute I will be endeavouring to express no opinion on the facts at all. If you suspect I hold an opinion or if indeed express an opinion let me make clear to you that you are obliged to disregard that opinion unless it accords with your own independent assessment of the facts."" 
        
       
      
    13    On the second day of the summing-up at the start, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There seems no doubt someone stole Shauna Bottrell's horse float. Someone cut the chain secured to the telegraph pole. It was removed from outside her home without her consent. That occurred on 18 September last year and later in September the accused sold the trailer to Mrs Zaiter. There is no dispute about those two matters."" 
        
       
      
    14    At the conclusion of the summing-up on matters arising, Mr Hancock, who appeared for the appellant at the trial, said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The only thing, your Honour perhaps would be that, in terms of the property of Ms Bottrell that was stolen and the Crown has led evidence of was in possession of the accused's person - that evidence, your Honour, I think it's a matter for the jury to conclude whether they are satisfied the Crown has satisfied them--"" 
        
       
       
      At that point Mr Hancock was apparently stopped by his Honour saying: 
       
        
        ""Right, yes, no, I agree with that. Bring back the jury. If you decide between the two of you to write out those--"" 
        
       
       
      Then there was an interruption. Later in the presence of the jury his Honour said: 
       
        
        ""Members of the jury I wanted to add to my summing-up. You have got to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused either stole or guiltily received a 1997 model Builtwell horse float, the property of Shauna Bottrell.  
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Bottrell told you that the float was stolen on or about 18 or 19 September 1997. She told you of many indicia which indicated to her the stolen float was the one that the accused sold to Belinda Zaiter. The photos are before you, there are details. For example it was said that the dividers of the float were covered in black padded vinyl. There were teeth marks in the padding; there was an air-vent; one of the kickboards had scrapemarks. 
        
       
       
        
        As I understand it, it was not suggested by Mr Hancock that the accused sold a float other than Ms Bottrell's stolen float. 
        
       
       
        
        But I tell you once more you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused stole or intentionally and guiltily received the 1997 Builtwell float, the property of Shauna Bottrell as alleged in both counts one and count two of the indictment. You must be satisfied of the matter to the requisite degree I have set out to you earlier in the summing-up."" 
        
       
      
    15     On the first day of the summing-up his Honour said about count two: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Count two in the indictment alleges that between 18 and 27 September 1997 at Castle Hill, the accused did receive a 1997 model Builtwell horse float the property of Shauna Bottrell before then stolen and he the said Bruce Claxton the accused in this trial at the time he received the property knew that the horse float was stolen."" 
        
       
      
    16    Later on the same day his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the alternative your task is to decide whether the Crown have proven to the extent to which I will shortly refer that between 18 and 27 September at Castle Hill the accused received a Builtwell horse float the property of Shauna Bottrell before then stolen and that the accused at the time he received the property knew that it was stolen."" 
        
       
       
      These were the only directions given on that day about the elements of the offence charged in the second count. 
       
      
    17    On the second day at an early stage in the resumption of the summing-up, his Honour said, after referring to the essential elements of larceny: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I set out in a little more detail the essential ingredients of the charge of receiving stolen property.  
        
       
       
        
        The elements of the offence are that the property was stolen, that the accused received it or disposed of it and that at the time the accused received or disposed of the property he knew it to be stolen.  
        
       
       
        
        So that the first element is that the property has got to be stolen property. There is no doubt someone stole the horse float. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly the accused has got to be in possession of the property. There is no doubt he was in possession of the property. Indeed he endeavoured to sell the property. So neither of those two ingredients will trouble you to a great extent. It is clear the float was stolen. It is clear the accused had it in his possession. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt that at the time when the accused received or disposed of the property he knew the horse float was stolen. 
        
       
       
        
        The receipt of stolen goods in the circumstances where the person receiving them does not know the goods were stolen does not constitute the crime of receiving. If it did many people who receive stolen goods quite innocently could find themselves charged with this offence of receiving. It is an essential feature of the offence that a person receiving the goods knew that they were stolen."" 
        
       
      
    18    I should say immediately that the Crown concedes that the references by his Honour to the accused's knowledge at the time of disposal of the property, was an error. 
     
      
    19    A little further on in the summing-up his Honour directed the jury about recent possession. In respect of that he referred to the jury being entitled to draw against the accused ""an inference either that he stole it or that he received it knowing it was stolen"". 
     
      
    20    Some way further on in the summing-up his Honour referred to the Crown case and said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown states clearly the accused either stole the horse float or possessed it and tried to sell it knowing it was stolen. The Crown say the accused possessed a recently stolen horse float."" 
        
       
      
    21    Again it is conceded that what his Honour there said, in referring to knowledge at the time of sale, was an error and presumably did not reflect the Crown case. However, no objection was taken to this by the Crown. 
     
      
    22    Later in the summing-up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""And the Crown listed for you a set of, a series of sets of circumstances that the Crown say indicate that the accused either stole the float or received it knowing it was hot or stolen."" 
        
       
      
    23    Referring to Mr Hancock's submissions, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Hancock says in relation to count two the receiving charge the Crown have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused received the horse float, he knew it was stolen."" 
        
       
      
    24    On two later occasions, one of which I have already quoted, his Honour referred to ""guiltily received"". Counsel for the appellant sought no redirection in respect of the errors to which I have referred, and which were conceded by the Crown. 
     
      
    25    Section 188 of the Crimes Act deals with separate offences of receiving or disposing of or attempting to dispose of property, the stealing whereof amounted to felony, knowing the same to have been stolen. In the present case the charge was as I have set it out, receiving property knowing the same to have been stolen, which undoubtedly means, as was conceded, knowing the same to have been stolen at the time of receipt. The appellant was charged with receiving, not disposing of stolen property. Accordingly, the critical time of knowledge was the time when the appellant received the goods. 
     
      
    26    In Andrews v The Queen (1968) 43 ALJR 57 at 62 the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is not pedantry to insist that an accused be tried for the crime for which he is charged. The function of the proviso to s6 of the 
          
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 is not to provide a Court of Criminal Appeal with a refuge from the performance of the exacting duty, imposed in the interests of the due administration of the law, of close analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence led to support the essential ingredients of the precise charges laid, and of the manner in which a presiding judge has instructed the jury, as he should, in the elements of the offence and the relevance of the evidence thereto."" 
        
       
      
    27    In the present case, as I have said, the error is one that, quite properly, the Crown conceded. That error is the point raised in the second ground of appeal. The Crown has submitted that there was overwhelming evidence in the case that the horse float was stolen from Ms Bottrell and was shortly after, in a disguised condition, found in the possession of the appellant. 
     
      
    28    The Crown submitted that the jury were entitled to, and plainly did, accept Ms Zaiter's evidence of the attempted sale and the appellant's claim to Ms Zaiter that he had had the float for 20 years. It is pointed out that the receipt which was produced at the interview and became an exhibit was questionable, and the author of it was not called. 
     
      
    29    It is submitted on behalf of the Crown that there was no reasonable inference consistent with the appellant's innocence. On the other hand Mr Nicholson QC, who appeared for the appellant, stressed that it was left open to the jury to convict on the basis that, while satisfied that the goods were acquired innocently by the appellant, they were also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time that he sold them to Ms Zaiter, he knew they were stolen. This, it was said, would explain or might be thought to explain, the goods being handed over to Ms Zaiter, a person unknown to the appellant, for $300, a proportion of the purchase price. 
     
      
    30    In the summing-up, although his Honour later correctly described the essential time of knowledge, in at least three places where he was telling the jury what the essential elements of the offence were, his Honour erred. 
     
      
    31    The Crown submitted that in this case there has been no miscarriage of justice and relied upon the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In this case it is, I think, important to be particularly mindful of the passage that I have quoted from the decision of the High Court in Andrews' case. To my mind the error here was central to the offence charged in the second count. It is not, I think, an error that can be put aside or ignored because of the strength of the Crown case, or because, later, his Honour correctly stated the elements of the offence. His Honour at no stage acknowledged his earlier mistake and drew attention to it and corrected it to the jury. 
     
      
    32    In all the circumstances I think this is an error which requires this Court to allow the appeal and set aside the conviction. That being so, it is not necessary for me to deal with the first and third grounds that were raised by the appellant as separate matters, though the matters that are there relied upon, to some extent, fortify the conclusion on the second ground. 
     
      
    33    The question arises as to whether this is an appropriate case in which a new trial should be ordered. In that regard, I note that the full-time minimum sentence imposed upon the appellant has almost been served. Accordingly, in my view, it is not appropriate for a new trial to be ordered. 
     
      
    34    The orders that I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal be allowed; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The conviction of the appellant be quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered. 
        
       
        
      
    35    GROVE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Sheller JA for the reasons which he has given.36     HIDDEN J: I also agree.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
     1    GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction after trial before Viney DCJ and a jury at Sydney District Court. The appellant was convicted of supplying a trafficable quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf weighing approximately 3.15 kilos. The deeming provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 operate to make the appellant liable for supply when in possession of such a quantity.  
     
      
       
      
    2    The appellant arrived in Sydney on a flight from Adelaide on 5 February 1998. A ""sniffer"" dog had drawn attention to a particular suitcase and the appellant was observed to collect it from the luggage carousel. Upon leaving the terminal he was detained by police officers and taken to an office where he was asked to open the suitcase. The activity was filmed on video tape.  
     
      
       
      
    3    On opening the bag the appellant noticed some newspapers and he thereon claimed that the luggage piece had been the subject of tampering in that he was aware that its contents should have been just two quilts and two pillows. These items had been taken by him to Adelaide on a previous trip when relatives had gathered for his mother's funeral. 
     
      
       
      
    4    Upon the luggage being opened, three cream coloured PVC pipes were located at the bottom of the bag which contained the drug abovementioned. 
     
      
       
      
    5    Part of the conversation between Constable Salter, who was operating the video tape, and the appellant consisted of her asking: ""Sir, who packed the bag today?"" and the appellant replying: ""I packed the bag yesterday"".  
     
      
       
      
    6    At trial the appellant gave evidence that he had collected the bag from his sister who was the occupant of their mother's former home. Because he was visiting a friend at a different location, he had arranged by telephone for his sister to leave the bag for him, already packed, on the front porch. His sister gave evidence confirming the arrangement and its being carried out. It was suggested that a de facto partner of his sister may have been responsible for placing the drug in the luggage. There was considerable animosity between him and the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The appellant testified that he did make the reply to Constable Salter's question above recited but asserted that he had told her a lie. He explained that his reason for this was that police had told him of their suspicion concerning the presence of illegal drugs and he became worried that his sister may become implicated in some way unless he assumed responsibility for packing the bag. He did not consider his sister was likely to be implicated but suspected her partner might have been. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The appellant relies upon a single ground of appeal, namely, that ""the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the issue of lies"". It was argued in the appeal that his Honour erred in failing to give the jury an authoritative reminder that innocent people sometimes panic and tell lies to protect themselves or others when unexpectedly confronted by police and, second, to admonish the jury that they ought not infer a consciousness of guilt from the mere fact that the appellant had told lies to police. 
     
      
       
      
    9    Despite a submission at trial which I will mention later, it was not part of the Crown case to rely upon the telling of a lie by the appellant as manifesting a consciousness of guilt. It was the appellant's case that he had lied to Constable Salter when he told her that he had packed the suitcase and the truth was that he had not. 
     
      
       
      
    10    In charging the jury his Honour was faced with the situation that, as a matter or logic, it was plain that either the appellant (as he claimed) had lied to police at the airport when he said he had packed the bag and was truthful in his evidence or, he had been truthful when he spoke to police and therefore was not telling the truth in his evidence. Of course, when a jury convicts an accused who has testified in denial of a Crown case, there is an inevitable implication that the denial was a lie. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The necessity for trial judges to exercise particular care concerning directions to juries about reliance upon the telling of lies as evidencing a consciousness of guilt or in corroboration of other Crown evidence is a topic which has been frequently canvassed in this Court. The situation that arose in this case when the appellant claimed to lie was relatively uncommon and his Honour was alert to invite counsel to make any relevant submission concerning the situation. He raised with counsel specifically the inappropriateness of the usual direction about lies being told because of consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
       
      
    12    His Honour mentioned the logical situation that if what was said to Constable Salter was not a lie then it appeared to be an admission of packing the bag. Counsel appearing for the appellant at trial (who did not appear in the appeal) made this contribution: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It's difficult, your Honour. I respectfully submit, however, your Honour, I don't think that it could be construed as an admission and I would ask your Honour not to deal with it that way."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       His Honour did not include an invitation to the jury to consider what was said as an admission. 
        
       
      
    13    The Crown Prosecutor had submitted that ""It certainly goes to consciousness of guilt the fact that he said those words"". Fortunately, if I may respectfully say, his Honour did not act upon the Crown Prosecutor's submission. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Counsel for the Crown on the appeal (who did not prosecute at trial) extracted from the transcript of the summing up a series of cautions which the learned trial judge did give. These included an express warning that even if the jury did not believe the version of the accused it did not automatically mean that he was guilty; a warning that the jury needed to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the facts upon which the Crown relied; a direction that even if they were convinced of all those facts it was necessary to consider whether there might not be some sort of innocent explanation or a reasonably possible alternative explanation other than that the accused was guilty and, in a passage immediately following the raising of the matter of directions about lies (which, of course, occurred in the absence of the jury) a direction that the jury would have to reject entirely the explanation of the appellant and reject the possibility that someone other than him was responsible for the drugs being in the suitcase before they could convict. 
     
      
       
      
    15    Later in the summary of the respective arguments the learned trial judge repeated submissions of counsel that the intent to avoid implicating his sister was, as the appellant claimed, a reasonable explanation for telling the lie and that it was something he had said spontaneously seeking to avoid possibly implicating her.  
     
      
       
      
    16    As I have stated in this case the telling of a lie was not relied upon by the Crown as manifesting a consciousness of guilt, nevertheless his Honour made it clear to the jury that they could not infer guilt from disbelief of the appellant. As his Honour observed, this was not a case which lent itself to the commonly given direction concerning the use of lies. His obligation was to ensure that the jury properly understood the available and permissible significance of any lie told in the case in hand: R v Preval (1984) 3 NSWLR 647. In my opinion his Honour fulfilled his duty. 
     
      
       
      
    17    As is perceptible from the circumstances that I have mentioned concerning the invitation by his Honour to counsel at trial, leave is required pursuant to r4 to argue the proposed ground of appeal. In my view the ground is, in any event, unsubstantiated and it matters not whether as a matter of formality leave is refused or the appeal is simply dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    18    The appellant was sentenced to a total term of 27 months imprisonment divided into minimum and additional terms of 9 and 18 months respectively. No application for leave to appeal against sentence has been advanced. 
     
      
       
      
    19    I propose the appeal be dismissed and the conviction and sentence confirmed. We have been informed that the appellant has been released to bail pending the appeal and will be returned to custody but, for the removal of any doubt, it should be specified having regard to provisions in the Sentencing Act that any time spent since conviction is to count. 
     
      
       
      
    20    SULLY J: I entirely agree. 
     
      
       
      
    21    GREG JAMES J: As do I. 
     
      
       
      
    22    GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I propose. The appellant will need to surrender to custody.

     Regina v Neville Andrew LEES 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was indicted before Badgery-Parker J on 1 September 1997, on a count of murder. He was convicted following trial, and sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for thirteen years and six months, and to an additional term of penal servitude for four years and six months. He now appeals against that conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    2   The victim Michael Grant, was in very poor health before his death, having been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Over the last four months of his life he received treatment for bouts of manic depression, and for pain associated with his damaged liver. Valium was prescribed along with codeine phosphate. He also had an addiction to drugs and alcohol. To assist with his deteriorating financial situation, he arranged for the appellant to move into his unit with him. This occurred about a month before the events which brought the appellant before the Court. 
    3   On the night of the victim’s death, neighbours heard the sounds of a struggle from his unit, including rhythmic banging, expletives, yelling and the smashing of glass. Emergency services were called. When police arrived, they observed the appellant standing over the victim attempting to pour water onto him. No pulse was found and the victim was pronounced dead by ambulance officers when they arrived. 
    4   Blood was found to be splashed around various parts of the unit. A blood-smeared and smashed vanity mirror was observed in the bathroom. The towel rack, which was smeared in blood over its whole length, was found to have been pulled from the wall. An 80cm. stick was also found on the bedroom floor. The appellant was seen to have injuries to the knuckles of both hands. 
    5   The victim suffered extensive injuries to his head, neck, arms, hands and lower back. The more serious injuries included subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages, multiple abrasions and lacerations to the face, nasal fractures, and a fracture of one rib. He also suffered multiple bruising, some of which was of a tramline pattern, consistent with blows having been inflicted by a rod or piece of wood. 
    6   In an ERISP the appellant said that the fight occurred after he was struck in the mouth by the victim, following complaints concerning the rent that he owed. 
    7   It was the appellant’s case that, before the fight, the victim had consumed a quantity of Valium and codeine, and was affected adversely by those substances. He had consumed some Valium himself. Dr.Bradhurst, who conducted the post mortem, gave evidence confirmatory of the presence, in the victim’s blood, of substantial levels of codeine and morphine, along with therapeutic levels of Valium, and some levels of alcohol and of cannabinoids. Professor Starmer said that, at the highest, the effect of the drugs found in the appellant’s blood following arrest, would have been a ‘dulling’ of his cognitive functions. 
    8   The appellant gave evidence that, following the victim’s complaint about the unpaid rent, and the blow to his jaw, there was an exchange of punches. He recalled that, prior to the punch, there was some mention made of his father, who had hanged himself some years earlier on Christmas Day, and who had been found by him in this state, to his very considerable distress. The victim, he said, had often tried to counsel him about this matter, which had deeply affected him. He said that he still harboured a lot of anger towards his father, and was sick of people raising the issue with him. 
    9   The appellant admitted to losing control and to using extreme force in his response to the victim. He added that the victim was always hassling him or ‘dribbling in his ear’ about rent money and other things, or pressing him for money to buy beer, for marijuana and for prescription pills. 
     
      
     Ground 1 Provocation 
      
    10   The substantial issue in the trial was that of provocation. The question that arose, on appeal, was whether his Honour had erred, in so far as he informed the jury that ‘words alone which do not amount to a gross insult are not capable of giving rise to’ provocation. 
    11   This direction needs to be understood in the light of the summing up as a whole. In explaining provocation his Honour correctly outlined the law, when observing: 
     
      
       
       “The law defines an act as an act done under provocation so as to reduce murder to manslaughter if three conditions exist. First, that the act is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused. Secondly, that that loss of self-control was brought about by some conduct of the deceased. That does not mean wrongful conduct of the deceased and it does not mean conduct of the deceased intended to bring about a loss of self-control. It is simply whether the loss of self-control resulted from some conduct of the deceased. Thirdly, that that conduct was of such a nature that it could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have an intention to kill or inflict serious injury.” 
       
      
    12   After giving this explanation, his Honour instructed the jury: 
     
      
       
       “Because in law the act is only an act done under provocation if all three of those conditions exist that I outlined to you, the  
       Crown may discharge its onus 
        of proof and exclude provocation from the case  
       by proving that any one of the three conditions did not exist 
       . The Crown  
       does not have to exclude 
        all three. 
       
      
      
       
       So the Crown  
       will eliminate the possibility 
        of provocation if it proves any one or more or all of the following propositions. First, the Crown might prove that the act of the accused which caused death did not result from a loss of self-control on the part of the accused. Second, and alternatively, the Crown might prove that there was no provocative act or conduct on the part of the deceased which caused the accused to lose self-control. Thirdly, and again alternatively, the Crown might prove that the act or conduct of the deceased which is said to have caused the accused to lose self-control was not such as could have caused an ordinary person in his position to lose self-control to the extent of forming an intention to do really serious injury to the deceased.” 
       
      
    13   The first element his Honour explained had, for all practical purposes, been conceded by the Crown, with the consequence that he did not take up any time dealing with it. 
    14   Dealing with the second element, his Honour gave the following direction, which included the passage relied upon by the appellant: 
     
      
       
       “The second condition upon which it may be found that the act causing death was done under provocation is that the loss of self-control on the part of the accused was caused by conduct of the deceased. The conduct of the deceased that may be considered as provocation may consist of acts alone, or acts in association with words, or words alone,  
       but if words alone are relied upon as constituting provocation, those words must amount to a gross insult 
       . Words alone which do not amount to a gross insult are not capable of giving rise to this issue of provocation. If words are relied on, not alone but together with actions, they need not be of that kind, they need not amount to a gross insult, and what has to be regarded in that event is the whole of the course of conduct of the deceased including both his words and his actions, whether or not those words amounted to a gross insult. 
       
      
    15   It may be assumed that in giving this direction his Honour had in mind s23(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under the provocation where: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased  
         (including grossly insulting words or gestures) 
          towards or affecting the accused; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time.” 
       
      
    16   The question whether words or gestures need to be grossly insulting before they can amount to provocation, within s23(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, so as to reduce murder to manslaughter, seems not to have been directly the subject of decision, since the amendment of this provision in 1982. 
    17   It has always been accepted that physical acts can qualify as provocation. Initially, however, there was some scepticism that mere words could do so. In Holmes v DPP (1946) AC 588, a case decided under the common law, Viscount Simon rejected the proposition that a sudden confession of adultery could constitute provocation of the sort which might reduce murder to manslaughter, disapproving of the dictum to the contrary of Blackburn J, in Rothwell (1871) 12 Cox C.C. 145 at 147.  
    18   In the circumstances of that appeal, his Lordship noted (at 599) that the expression “provocation by mere words” could have more than one meaning. First “it may mean provocation by insulting or abusive language, calculated to arouse the hearer’s resentment”. Secondly, the phrase “may be used, not as an expression of abuse, but as a means of conveying information of a fact or of what is alleged to be a fact”. 
    19   His Lordship went on to say (at 600): 
     
      
       
       “It is not necessary in this appeal to decide whether there are any conceivable circumstances accompanying the use of words without actual violence, which would justify the leaving to a jury of the issue of manslaughter as against murder. It is enough to say that the duty of the judge at the trial, in relevant cases, is to tell the jury that a confession of adultery without more is never sufficient to reduce an offence which would otherwise be murder to manslaughter, and that in no case could words alone,  
       save in circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character 
       , so reduce the crime. When words alone are relied upon in extenuation, the duty rests on the judge to consider whether they are of this  
       violently provocative character 
       , and if he is satisfied that they cannot reasonably be so regarded, to direct the jury accordingly.” 
       
      
      
    20   In Moffa (1977) 138 CLR 601, Gibbs J said in relation to the common law, at 616: 
     
      
       
       “In  
       Holmes v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        the House of Lords authoritatively expounded the rules of the common law on the question whether provocation can be constituted by ‘mere words’. At the time when that case was decided it was already settled that insulting or abusive language (not being menace of immediate bodily harm) could not reduce murder to manslaughter. The law was not so clear as to whether words used as a means of conveying information might constitute provocation. As to this, their Lordships held that a confession of adultery - even a sudden confession - without more is never sufficient to reduce to manslaughter an offence which would otherwise be murder. This rule has been affected by statute in some places but it is still the rule of the common law.” 
       
      
    21   Barwick CJ accepted the correctness of this statement, observing at 605: 
     
      
       
       “I feel bound to agree with my brother Gibbs’ conclusion that if nothing more had been established by the applicant by way of provocation than mere words and if those words were not, to use the language of Viscount Simon in  
       Holmes v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        of a violently provocative character, the onus upon the Crown of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the killing of the deceased’s wife was unprovoked did not specifically arise.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    22   To similar effect was the observation of Stephen J at 619: 
     
      
       
       “In answering this question one bears in mind that no mere confession of adultery, however sudden, suffices ( 
       Holmes v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        40) Words alone, whether in themselves insulting or obscene or which recount a necessarily provocative event or fact, would, as Viscount Simon there said, have to involve ‘circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character’ if they were to reduce murder to manslaughter’.” 
       
      
    23   Mason J left the gate open for a somewhat wider application of the rule, in the following passage, at 620-621: 
     
      
       
       “There is no absolute rule against words founding a case of provocation. The existence of such an absolute rule would draw an arbitrary distinction between words and conduct which is insupportable in logic. No doubt provocative acts justifying the reduction of murder to manslaughter are more readily imagined and more frequently encountered than provocative words which justify the same result. Violent acts, rather than violent words, are more likely to induce an ordinary person to lose his self-control. And a case of provocation by words may be more easily invented than a case of provocation by conduct, particular when the victim was the wife of the accused. There is, therefore, an element of public policy as well as common sense in requiring the close scrutiny of claims of provocation founded in words, rather than conduct. 
       
      
      
       
       The observations of Blackburn J and Viscount Simon to which I have referred are salutary warnings against a too ready acceptance of claims of provocation based on words alone. They emphasise the necessity for compliance with the demanding requirements which underlie the concept of provocation.” 
       
      
      
    24   The common law rule was altered by s23(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provided that where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appeared that the act causing death was induced by the use of grossly insulting language or gestures on the part of the deceased, the jury might consider the provocation offered, as in the case of provocation by a blow. 
    25   In Withers (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 382, a sentence appeal, Street CJ, with whom James and Campbell JJ agreed, stated (at 392-393) that: 
     
      
       
       “The effect of that section is, as is pointed out by the authors of Hamilton and Addison on Criminal Law and Procedure, to place killing upon provocation arising from grossly insulting language or gestures on the part of the person killed in the same position as killing upon provocation arising from a blow.” 
       
      
    26   The matter was further reviewed in Tsigos (1964-5) NSWR 1597 where Walsh J (with whom Moffit J agreed on this point) noted at 1611 that: 
     
      
       
       “The historical development of the principle that provocation might extenuate a homicide so as to make it manslaughter was discussed in the judgments of Dixon CJ and Windeyer J, in  
       Parker v R 
        [1963] ALR 524 at 552; [1963] 37 ALJR 3 at p20. Windeyer J referred to two rules which became established. One was that, when a husband discovered his wife actually in the act of adultery and killed her, this was manslaughter. “At the other end of the scale stood pronouncements that reproaches, however, grievous, and insulting words and gestures, however offensive, would not count as provocation if they were unaccompanied by any assault or blow”. Windeyer J went on to say that, perhaps, this latter rule was not always quite so strict, but that it was only in exceptional cases, if at all, that mere words could count even as slight provocation. At [1963] ALR at 554, 37 ALJR at p 22, Windeyer J stated:  
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘It is obvious that the purpose and effect of what is now subsection (1) was to abrogate the common law rule that insulting words or gestures alone cannot amount to a provocation sufficient to reduce a killing from murder to manslaughter.’” 
         
        
       
      
      
     His Honour went on to observe: 
      
      
       
       “This statement does not solve the question of the meaning which has to be given to the expression ‘grossly insulting language’. It is arguable that this expression was chosen with the intention that, whilst the scope of the doctrine of provocation was to be enlarged, this was only to be to the extent that it would now include abusive or offensive language containing a personal insult or affront. If this was the intention, it means that provocation could consist of mere words, in the first of the senses to which Viscount Simon referred, in  
       Holmes v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        [1946] 2 All ER 124; [1946] AC 588, but not in the second of the senses to which he referred. Upon this view statements concerning past acts of adultery or future intended acts of adultery would not, as such, be brought by this enactment within the scope of provocation, although no doubt these might be made in such a manner or combined in such a way with derogatory references to the hearer, that the statements considered as a whole could be regarded as amounting to grossly insulting language. I think there is much to be said for this view of the effect of s.23(1). But no such limitation upon its effect was recognised in the judgment of this Court in  
       R v Withers 
        (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 382.” 
       
      
      
    27   The correctness of the assumption in Withers, that by reason of the statutory alteration of the common law, the trial Judge had been correct in leaving, as provocation, statements by the wife of the accused that she would not return home and “was going to have a good time”, was left for another day. 
    28   That the enactment of a statutory provision, governing the law of provocation, should be seen as involving a deliberate departure from the long prevalent common law approach that the kind of conduct which could as a matter of law, constitute provocation reducing murder to manslaughter, was somewhat confined, and did not include a case of mere words, is supported by the observations of the High Court, to that effect, in Stingel (1990) 171 CLR 312 at 323. 
    29   The question which arises in the current case is to be determined in the light of the further amendment to s23 effected in 1982, the purpose of which was to ensure that conduct may be provocative, in the legal sense, whether it occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time; and also to make it clear that any conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused, may be the basis of the defence: Hansard Legislative Assembly 11 March 1982, pp 2482 to 2486.  
    30   It is now accepted, it would seem, whether the law as to provocation is governed by the common law or by statute or code, that words, particularly those of “an appropriately violent character” can qualify as provocation in law: Dutton (1979) 21 SASR 356; Romano (1984) 36 SASR 282; Allwood (1975) 18 A Crim R 120. 
    31   The expression “conduct” where used in s 23(2)(a), is itself sufficiently wide to include words, as well as physical acts (which gestures in substance are), directed towards or affecting the accused. So much is indicated by the words in parentheses in the section, which are words of inclusion rather than of addition. The legislative intention in this regard, it may be assumed, was to preserve the availability of the defence, provided under the repealed provision, for those cases where the conduct of the deceased comprised insulting words or gestures, that might properly be categorised as gross, rather than matters of mere insult. 
    32   It does not necessarily follow from the words in parenthesis, that the category of words or gestures, that can qualify as conduct for the purpose of S23(2)(a), is to be confined to matters of insult. In most cases, the relevant words or gestures will be of that genus. I am not, however, persuaded that the relevant conduct, so far as words or gestures are concerned, should necessarily be confined to words or gestures that assume the description of an insult. Where they are of that character, and they stand alone, then it is reasonable to expect that they should answer the description of being gross, since their potential effect is to reduce murder from manslaughter. 
    33   It is not, however, difficult to imagine words or gestures which are violent, threatening, or otherwise distressing which do not answer the description of an insult, yet which can be highly inflammatory. It is difficult to accept that the Legislature intended, when amending the  
    34   Section in 1982, to exclude them from the range of “conduct” that is capable of constituting provocation. For example, it has been held that words amounting to a threat to “cry rape” unless the appellant paid over some money, can qualify as provocation: Webb (1976) 16 SASR 309. Moreover, there is abundant authority for the view that particular acts or words which, if viewed in isolation, are insignificant or colourless, may nevertheless constitute provocation when viewed cumulatively with other words, or with other conduct. R (1981) 28 SASR 321 at 326 per King CJ; Stingel (1990) 171 CLR 312 at 325 and Hutton (1986) 20 A Crim R 315 at 317 and 328. 
    35   The modern development of the law in relation to provocation by words is usefully encapsulated in the judgment of Ormiston JA, in Tuncay [1998] 2VR 19, at 21: 
     
      
       
       “It should be observed that the proposition about ‘mere words’ derives from a period in the law when issues as to what constitutes provocation were treated as questions of law to be resolved by the judge and before any direction akin to that now given to juries (although expressed differently) was first introduced in England in the early nineteenth century: cf  
       R v Morly 
        (1666) Kel.53; 84 ER 1079. There at Kel. 55; ER.1080 the judges assembled resolved that ‘no words, be they what they will, are in law such a provocation, as if a man kill another for words only will diminish the offence of killing a man from murder to manslaughter”: see also  
       R v Mawgridge 
        (1707) Kel 119 at 130-1; 84 ER 1107 at 1112. In my opinion, to the extent that these propositions were subsequently adopted, they should be treated as merely reflecting what the reasonable or, now, “ordinary” person would have been treated by a jury as concluding if provocation confined to words had been allowed to go to the jury. The difficulties inherent in taking that view in the twentieth century and the qualifications put on the broad proposition may be seen in  
       Holmes v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        and  
       Moffa 
        : cf.  
       Laws of Australia ‘Criminal Offices (Title 10) 
        para. 92. The general principles as to provocation having now been restated in  
       Stingel 
        and  
       Masciantonio 
       , the question may now be left to the jury as the constitutional tribunal of fact to decide what is the ordinary person’s response to the use of allegedly provocative words, whatever be their form and context, but subject to the power of the trial judge to take away from the jury any claim of provocation which could in no circumstances properly lead to a verdict of manslaughter.” 
       
      
    36   It follows, in my view, that a direction suggesting that words alone are not capable of giving rise to an issue of provocation unless they amount to a gross insult, would be incorrect if it was understood as excluding all other kinds of verbal communication.  
    37   It is not the case, in my view, that provocation is confined, in the case of words, to matters of insult strictly understood. Other kinds of words may qualify as provocative conduct, such as words of threatened violence, blackmail, extortion and so on. They are equally capable of provoking strong feelings, and they may or may not be accompanied by physical acts. They do, however, need to be of a sufficient violent, offensive, or otherwise aggravating character to be capable of satisfying the third element of provocation outlined above. Mere words of abuse or insult would not normally qualify.  
    38   The question of law whether there is material in the evidence capable of constituting provocation remains one for the Judge.  
    39   The test for the trial Judge, as framed in Stingel at 334 and cited with approval in Masciantonio (1985) 183 CLR 58 at 67 to 68, is: 
     
      
       
       “whether, on the version of events most favourable to the accused which is suggested by material in the evidence, a jury acting reasonably might fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was unprovoked in the relevant sense”. 
       
      
    40   If the evidence is capable of meeting the test stated, the defence is to be left to the jury Stingel at 333. 
    41   To the extent that the direction might have indicated that words cannot qualify as provocation unless they constitute a gross insult, it accordingly went too far. That, however, is not the end of the matter, since that direction needs to be understood in the full context of the summing up. 
    42   In this regard it is critical to note that, at no point in the summing up, did his Honour take away from the jury the remark concerning the suicide of the appellant’s father as being incapable of constituting provocation, or suggest that the jury exclude it from their consideration if they thought that it did not involve a gross insult. At the highest, the appellant submitted that by inference, the jury were directed that unless they reached the conclusion that those words were grossly insulting, then they were to leave this conversation out of consideration. This had an added significance, so it was submitted, if they were satisfied that the victim had not struck the appellant, since that would leave the spoken words as the only conduct on the part of the victim that preceded the incident. 
    43   This possibility was not, however, canvassed by his Honour. On the contrary, the jury were consistently instructed that they could take into account the remark concerning the appellant’s father when considering the issue of provocation, that is unless the Crown left them satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no such remark was made. 
    44   So it was that his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       There is material before you, if you accept it, which establishes some conduct on the part of the deceased during the course of that night, and perhaps some words uttered by the deceased, which are the matters giving rise to the possibility that this was a killing done under provocation, the  
       possibility which the Crown must exclude beyond reasonable doubt 
       . Those include the assertion made by the accused on at least two or three occasions that the deceased hit the accused, and also the faint suggestion by the accused in the course of his electronically recorded interview, considerably expanded of course in his evidence to you, that the  
       deceased had made a comment about the circumstances in which the father of the accused had met his death 
       ; and also … you need to consider the evidence of Michael Grant’s behaviour, no doubt irritating and no doubt sometimes quite unpleasant, of repetitive nagging, for example, about the rent or repetitive comment on matters which the accused regarded as no part of Michael Grant’s concern, which is what I take the accused to mean during his repeated references to the deceased “dribbling” in his ear. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       In reaching conclusions as to the effect of Michael Grant’s conduct on the accused that night and as to the capacity of that conduct to cause an ordinary person to lose self-control, you must, as Mr. Zahra very properly said, look at all of the relevant conduct together, not each part of it in isolation because that would be unreal. However, before you get to the stage of looking at all of the conduct together, you must look at the evidence to see whether there really is a reasonable possibility that the particular conduct of the deceased took place, whether the Crown  
       has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt 
        that no such thing occurred. For that it is necessary to look at each aspect of the deceased’s conduct on which the accused relies separately from the others.” 
       
      
    45   After summarising the evidence in relation to so much of the conduct of the victim as was said to be provocative, involving the punch which the appellant said initiated the fight, his Honour returned to the suicide remark. This was introduced by the observation: 
     
      
       
       “The second element of conduct on the part of Michael Grant which is relied on as provocation is to be found in the accused’s evidence about his reaction to mention of his father’s death. The Crown says, in effect, that a consideration of the evidence would lead you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that nothing which may have been said by the deceased about the accused’s father, if indeed anything was said, had any role in producing the accused’s loss of self-control, particularly in light of the way the topic came up. The Crown submitted that you would be satisfied that nothing at all was said by the deceased on that topic that evening. You may, no doubt, and you probably would, accept that the accused was terribly distressed and traumatised at the time of his father’s death. There is no dispute about that. The evidence of his mother about that was not challenged, nor was his own evidence; there is corroboration of it in the records of Trigg House (Exhibit 2) and it is indeed precisely what you might expect. To what extent it was still a problem for him at the time of the killing is a matter for you, and indeed it is a matter for you what was the relevance of that emotional sensitivity to the events with which you are concerned.” 
       
      
    46   These passages make it crystal clear that one of the matters left to the jury as potentially constituting provocative conduct included the remarks concerning the suicide of the appellant’s father. The issue that was left in relation to it was whether there was any such conversation, and if so whether it had any role in producing a loss of self control. No issue arose as to whether it should be ignored because it might not qualify as grossly insulting. Moreover, these passages made it clear that the alleged blow, and all of the matters discussed, whether they related to rent, or to the appellant’s father, or to any other matter about which the appellant considered the victim to have been “dribbling in his ear”, were to be considered together, and not in isolation.  
    47   Had there been any doubt about that, then it would have been entirely put to rest by the direction later given: 
     
      
       
       “I remind you that in order to determine whether any particular piece of conduct on which the accused relies may have occurred on that night, or whether the Crown has  
       satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt  
        that it did not, it is proper for you to look at the evidence on each of those particular matters directly apart from any other issue, but when you come to resolve the issue whether any conduct on the part of the deceased which occurred that night in fact caused the accused to lose control or may have done so, you should not consider each of the events of that night in isolation, you have to consider together all of the conduct of the deceased as the evidence shows it to you. An event which of itself does not appear to be likely to have caused such loss of control may in fact have done so if it was the culminating event in a sequence of provocative behaviour. If you are of the view that it is reasonably possible that the deceased did say some such things as the accused indicates in the recorded interview, you should not reject the possibility that that in fact provoked his violence without considering everything else that you find may have occurred.” 
       
      
    48   Additionally, in directing the jury as to the way that they should deal with provocation, his Honour explained that the first step was to identify the conduct which they were “prepared to recognise as having possibly occurred and provoked a loss of self control on the part of the appellant”. Among the possible items identified, his Honour noted, was the “remark made by the deceased about the circumstance of (the) death (of the appellant’s father)”. 
    49   Correctly, his Honour explained that, “having identified the provocative conduct which the evidence suggests may have occurred, and which the Crown has failed to prove did not occur,” the jury had then to consider “how seriously that conduct may have been perceived by the accused himself”, taking into account “what you know of (him), his personality, his condition at the time, and matters in his background which may have given the so called provocative conduct some particular significance to him.” 
    50   In dealing with the remark concerning the suicide, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “You may think that nothing of that kind arises in relation to any physical assault on him by the deceased, if there was such a thing, nor indeed in relation to his reaction to the nagging or niggling by the deceased, but it may be of particular relevance in relation to the trauma of his father’s death in the circumstances in which it occurred. His emotional reaction to it, if that appears to you to be the case, the persistence of that emotional reaction or sensitivity right up to the date of the killing, you have to take into account, in determining how seriously the accused may have perceived anything in the nature of provocation, arising from something said by the deceased about his father’s death.” 
       
      
    51   His Honour followed this with an entirely conventional, and appropriate direction, concerning the possible reaction of the ordinary person in the position of the appellant, to whatever provocative conduct there may have been. 
    52   On the second day of the summing up his Honour took the jury through the written directions that were provided that day. Nothing was said, in this exercise, that in any way differed from the directions given the preceding day. Nor was anything different said in the supplementary directions which His Honour gave, after the jury had retired, which were the subject of the third ground of appeal. 
    53   When the summing up is read as a whole it is clear that his Honour left the case to the jury as one which was not dependent on words alone. Moreover, there is no room, in my view, for the inference that the jury was left with an understanding that they were to leave aside the remarks about the appellant’s father, or indeed any of the other words spoken by him, if that was all that had been said or done, upon the basis that they were not grossly insulting. 
    54   Although no objection was taken to the directions at the trial by experienced Counsel appearing for the appellant, I would grant leave under R4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. However, having regard to the manner in which the summing up was framed, I am satisfied that no miscarriage of justice occurred. The case is suitable for an application of the proviso to S6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912. 
     
      
     Ground 2 - onus of proof 
      
    55   It was conceded by Senior Counsel for the appellant that, if the directions on provocation were to be understood in the context of the general directions as to onus of proof, then this ground could not be made out, since his Honour’s directions in that regard were clear and unequivocal.  
    56   In my view, this ground of appeal need not be decided upon such a narrow basis, since his Honour clearly went to great pains to point out to the jury where the onus lay in relation to provocation, and did so in terms that were entirely correct. For example, his Honour observed, early in the summing up: 
     
      
       
       “… the accused is not to be convicted of murder unless the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the act that caused death was not an act done under provocation, that is to say, the Crown  
       must exclude any reasonable possibility that the act that caused death was done under provocation 
       .” 
       
      
      
    57   This direction was repeated when his Honour came to outline the law in relation to provocation, in the course of which he observed: 
     
      
       
       “I told you earlier that the  
       onus rests upon the Crown to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that the act 
        of the accused which caused the death of Michael Grant  
       was not an act done under provocation 
       ”. 
       
      
      
     His Honour continued: 
      
      
       
       “This is not a case where the accused has actually in terms said to you, or to anybody else so far as the evidence shows, that he was provoked. Let me therefore emphasise to you that it does not rest upon the accused to prove that he was provoked. Whatever he may or may not have said, once there is evidence before the court that suggests a possibility that the accused’s act may have been done under provocation, the Crown is called upon to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was not. That is the situation here.  
       The Crown must exclude any reasonable possibility that the accused’s act may have been done under provocation 
       .” 
       
      
    58   In giving the more detailed directions extracted earlier in relation to the first ground, his Honour repeated in the italicised passages, more than once, the need for the Crown to exclude beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that the killing was done under provocation. 
    59   In making reference, in various passages in the summing up, to the “reasonable possibility” of provocative conduct existing, his Honour did no more than advert to the evidentiary obligation that rested upon the appellant to raise provocation as an issue in the trial: Johnson (1976) 136 CLR 619 at 641. Once raised, then it rested upon the Crown to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the appellant acted under provocation: Tumanako (1992) 64 A Crim R 149. This his Honour clearly explained in a way which was above reproach. 
     
      
     Ground 3. Further Directions 
      
    60   The jury retired to consider their verdict on the second day of the summing up, after his Honour had taken them through the written directions. Later that day his Honour answered several jury questions, after which the proceedings were, at their request, adjourned for the day. After considering the matter overnight, his Honour indicated to Counsel that he intended to give the jury some further short directions, because he was concerned that the questions, that had been asked the preceding day, “suggested that they may be taking less than a sensible and direct route,” and they may “benefit from some further assistance”. Mr. Zahra, Counsel for the accused objected to this occurring in the absence of any request for assistance, or of any indication that the jury were deadlocked. The Crown Prosecutor, however, supported the proposal. 
    61   As a result, over the objection of Mr. Zarah, his Honour gave a further direction, which began with the observation: 
     
      
       
       “I apologise for breaking in on your deliberations so early, but I did get the impression yesterday afternoon that you might be having some difficulty and it occurs to me that I may be able to be of further assistance to you. 
       
      
      
       
       I know from my experience as a judge that it is very easy in the course of consideration of a problem to reach a stage where you become bogged down in matters of detail and tend to lose sight of the broader picture. It is, of course, not part of my function to tell you how to decide any issue in the case and I carefully refrain from doing that. I may perhaps assist you by suggesting an approach which you might take at this time.” 
       
      
      
     His Honour dealt first with the issue of intent, identifying the critical aspects of the evidence upon which the jury might concentrate. He continued: 
      
      
       
       “If you find that that approach simplifies your dealing with the question of intent, you may take a similar, if I can call it such, minimalist approach to the question of provocation, if you come to that question. 
       
      
      
       
       There are three aspects of the conduct of the deceased that the accused has relied on. First, his persistent talking about things generally in a manner which could be described as nagging and you may think there is no real issue that that occurred. Secondly, his supposed hitting of the accused; and thirdly, his supposed reference to the circumstances of the death of the accused’s father. 
       
      
      
       
       No provocative conduct is of any significance at all if you come to the conclusion that it was of such a nature that it could not have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to lose self-control to the extent of forming an intention to do grievous bodily harm. So a practical approach to your task at this stage may be to assume, for the moment, in favour of the accused, all of the provocative conduct on which the accused relies, bearing in mind that you have to look at it as having that degree of seriousness which the accused would have attached to it, and consider first the question whether, if all of that conduct is assumed to have occurred, it is or is not such as could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the required extent. 
       
      
      
       
       If you conclude that it was not, if you conclude that it could not have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control, then you would no longer need to consider in detail whether either of the items of conduct which the Crown disputes actually occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       Only if you find provocative conduct  
       consisting of all three types of conduct 
        could have caused an ordinary person to lose control would you have to go further and consider whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that any of those three kinds of conduct did not occur. If so, you would then have to consider whether whatever is left is such as to cause an ordinary person to lose control.” 
       
      
      
     His Honour concluded:  
      
      
       
       “Members of the jury, that is not offered in any way as suggesting how you should decide any issue. I am only seeking to suggest to you lines of approach which may simplify your task. I do not want you to think from anything that I have just said that you are under any pressure of time. You are entitled to take as long as you may need and I and counsel will remain available to assist you for as long as necessary”. 
       
      
      
       
      
     These directions commenced at 10.29am. and the jury retired again at 10.35am. They returned a verdict of guilty of murder that day at 2.43pm. 
      
    62   It was submitted that, by offering this ‘minimalist’ approach, his Honour risked being understood as delivering an exhortation or encouragement of the kind that would have offended against the principle established in Black (1993) 69 A Crim R 248, or alternatively was pushing the prosecution case at the expense of the defence case. 
    63   I am not persuaded that this was so. Having regard to the several requests made the previous day, including a request for some further explanation in relation to provocation, there was no reason in principle why his Honour should not have given such additional directions as he considered might assist the jury. There was no objection by Counsel as to the terms in which these directions were given and there was no error in them. They served to focus upon the most obvious issues, but left open the remaining matters that the jury had to consider, in relation particularly to provocation, before returning a verdict. 
    64   Moreover, the closing words made it plain that they were free to take whatever time they needed, and were not under pressure to return a verdict. As such, the approach taken did not offend against Black. 
    65   This ground is not, in my view, made out. 
     
      
     Grounds 4 and 5 
      
    66   These grounds were abandoned. 
     
      
     Ground 6 - verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory 
      
    67   This ground was pursued upon the basis of the cumulative effect of grounds 1 to 3. In view of the fact that none of those grounds has been made good, this ground must also fail. 
     
      
     SENTENCE 
      
    68   This aspect of the appeal was confined to the finding by his Honour that there were no special circumstances, justifying a variation of the usual ratio between the minimum and additional terms. It may be observed that trial counsel conceded that there were no such circumstances. Mr. Nicholson SC has argued that, notwithstanding that concession, his Honour should have found special circumstances in the light of the youth of the applicant, his deprived background, which saw him driven by the brutality of his father to seek refuge in a hostel at the age of sixteen years, the trauma of his father’s suicide, his severe emotional reaction to that event, his history of drug and alcohol abuse, his relatively insignificant criminal antecedents and his offer of a plea of guilty to manslaughter. 
    69   His Honour carefully took into account all of these matters, in assessing the length of the overall sentence. Additionally, he took into account a report of a psychiatric examination by Dr. Westmore, and the appellant’s co-operation with various programmes, while in custody, designed to moderate his anger and propensity to verbal abuse and to physical violence. 
    70   Together, these considerations were regarded as favourable subjective circumstances, operating in mitigation of the extremely serious objective circumstances of the offence, which his Honour, a very experienced Judge, described as “one of the most hideous crimes of murder that I have encountered”. 
    71   His Honour noted that the additional term, which would follow from an application of the formula in S5(2) of the Sentencing act, would “amply provide for the reasonable needs of supervision to facilitate the prisoner’s rehabilitation should he be released from custody at the expiration of the minimum term”. Although that approach assumed release at the end of the minimum term, a matter as to which there could be no certainty, I am not persuaded that, in all the circumstances of the case, his Honour erred in the exercise of his sentencing discretion, or that the sentence, as a whole, was manifestly excessive.  
    72   The reason for finding special circumstances is the need for a longer additional term than usual, not the need or desirability for a shorter than usual minimum term: Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446. Moreover, even if special circumstances had been found, it does not necessarily follow that there needs to be a readjustment of the proportion between the minimum and additional terms requiring a reduction of the minimum term. The fallacy in this regard was identified in Bloomfield (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 15 July 1998). 
    73   In this case it appears to me that the proper course was to give the appellant the benefit of the subjective circumstances in the way that his Honour did. Upon this basis, the overall term was in my view entirely within a legitimate exercise of his sentencing discretion. I am unpersuaded that there was any occasion to further adjust the proportion in which the overall term should be made up. 
    74   Although I would grant leave, I would also dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
    75   Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
     1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
      
     2. Application to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed. 
      
      
     3. Conviction and sentence below confirmed. 
      
    76   NEWMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Wood CJ at CL and I agree with both the reasons and the orders he proposes. 
    77   FOSTER AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Wood CJ at CL and I agree with both the reasons and the orders he proposes.

     JUDGMENT - On application for a permanent stay of proceedings 
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR : 
       
      Irena Hatfield (the accused) has been committed for trial on a charge of murder. The victim was her husband Christopher who died of gunshot wounds received on the night of 19-20 April 1985. An inquest into his death was held at Glebe Coroner’s Court on 17 June 1986. The charge against the accused was preferred on 13 June 1997.  
      
       
      
     2     
     The accused seeks an order for permanent stay of proceedings. In March 1999, 8th November next was scheduled as the commencing date of the trial and I was allocated as trial judge. Mr Barker QC who appeared with Mr Stanton for the accused and Mr Ellis for the Crown indicated at the beginning of this application that they were agreed that that hearing date should be vacated. I declined to make any order to that effect and indicated that the question of it should await the outcome of the present matter. I record that I deal exclusively with the application and I am not as trial judge, making pre trial rulings. 
      
       
      
     3     
     To give context to the application, some circumstances and anticipated ingredients of the Crown case need to be sketched. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Shortly after midnight on 19-20 April the accused telephoned police and reported that she had just tried to awaken her husband whom she then observed had been shot. She thought he was dead. Police and ambulance were despatched to the matrimonial home at 47 Chester Avenue, Maroubra. Inspection revealed the body lying on a lounge covered by a blanket to the chest. A small hole was visible in the blanket surrounded by apparent bloodstains. Three wounds were visible on the head of the deceased.  
      
       
      
     5     
     Investigation demonstrated that the deceased had been shot with .22 calibre ammunition. One projectile had entered the chest area. Wounds had been sustained to the head. Later weighing of fragments led to an estimate that four projectiles had entered the head even though observations had noted three wounds. Four cartridge cases were located in the lounge room. No weapon was found in the vicinity. In due course police took possession of the clothing of the deceased and also that worn by the accused at the time of their arrival. 
      
       
      
     6     
     On the morning of 20 April 1985 a recreational diver entered the water near a boat ramp at Long Bay. He noticed a rifle floating stock upwards and a metal object later found to be a silencer lying on the seabed nearby. He attended to his own business of collecting fish for a couple of hours and then retrieved the rifle and silencer which he delivered to Maroubra Police. Later police divers searched the area and a magazine was recovered. The rifle was a .22 calibre Brno brand weapon. It required a bolt for operation but none was located. At the hearing of this application the Crown accepted that it cannot prove that the Brno rifle was the weapon used to kill Christoper Hatfield. At the highest, it can adduce evidence that examination of material recovered at the scene and at post mortem had been subjected to comparison and nothing was found which was inconsistent with the Brno rifle having being the murder weapon. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Items submitted by police for examination included a glass found in the lounge room and the accused’s dressing gown. A forensic biologist (Ms Clancy) certified that human blood was detected on the glass and that presumptive tests for blood on undefined areas of the dressing gown had given a positive result. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In a statement dated 19 December 1997 Det Senior Constable Allison asserted: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. A number of inquiries have been made in an effort to locate the following exhibits: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Brno brand .22 calibre firearm, silencer and magazine. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Clothing worn by the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Clothing worn by the deceased. 
         
        
        
        4. None of these exhibits have been found and I am unaware of their present location. 
        
        
        5. I spoke to a number of Police Officers who were involved in the original investigation. They could not assist in anyway whatsoever regarding those exhibit’s whereabouts.  
        
        
        6. The rifle, silencer, magazine and white T-shirt (worn by the deceased) were tendered at the Coronial Inquest into Christopher HATFIELD’s death conducted at Glebe Coroners Court on 17 June, 1986. 
        
        
        7. I am aware that clothing worn by the accused was conveyed to the Division of Forensic Medicine Glebe by Constable L. BRIDGE on 24 May 1985.”

     I understand it to be common ground that the glass examined by Ms Clancy is also missing but that the magazine retrieved from the sea has been located. It has been kept with projectile fragments and cartridge cases which remain available. The holed woollen blanket which had partly covered the deceased should also be included in the schedule of missing items.

     Some cards recording movements of police exhibits were produced at the committal hearing. They were retrieved from the Ballistics Unit. One of them (which is undated) appears to show relevant items of clothing and the rifle being received by a Detective Long from Detective Ransome. Detective Ransome is a ballistics officer and currently remains a member of the Police Service. Detective Long is no longer in that service. Detective Ransome testified at committal that the last record he believed he had would relate to producing the items to the Coroner. He acknowledged that the usual practice was for the Coroner’s exhibits to be returned to the officer in charge of the investigation and that in this case it would be either Detective Long or Detective Ralston. He had not spoken to Detective Ralston about the matter.

     The accused was interviewed by police in 1985 and (as she continued to do in later interviews) asserted her innocence. The arrest in 1997 followed renewed inquiries provoked by reports to police by one Atticus Busby that in conversation with her she had allegedly confessed her guilt. Certain material was gathered by the use of listening devices. At times there was a relationship between the accused and Mr Busby. Whilst they have since expressed different perceptions of the nature of that relationship it did involve sexual intimacy. At the committal hearing there was also called a witness named Lourdes Pereira. She and the accused had encountered each other in 1991 or 1992 at Elcho Island in the Northern Territory. Ms Pereira was secretary of the Galiwinku Aboriginal Council and the accused was engaged in setting up and running an art centre. Ms Pereira gave evidence of an alleged confession to her by the accused.  
      
       
      
     12     
     Mr Barker expressly acknowledged that it was not being asserted that there was no prima facie case. He submitted that the strength and weaknesses of the prosecution case were immaterial for the purposes of the application for a stay unless I took a view that there was so overwhelmingly strong a prosecution case that nothing the defence could do could possibly be effective. I do not take such a view. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The essence of Mr Barker’s submission was that a fair trial cannot be had because the accused has been denied a real chance of establishing her innocence by reason of the loss of physical exhibits and some records of counselling sessions involving Mr Busby to which I will make later reference.  
      
       
      
     14     
     In support of the application the accused relied upon affidavits exhibiting reports from Mr Barber, a forensic ballistics examiner; Dr Ellis a pathologist; Mr Ross, a forensic scientist with special expertise in gunshot residue detection and an affidavit by her solicitor exhibiting the police brief served at the committal proceedings and certain transcript of those proceedings including transcript of evidence concerning the non production of the counselling records.  
      
       
      
     15     
     Substantial parts of the expert reports relate to theories pertinent to the discharge of a firearm. As I have said, the Crown is not in a position to allege that the Brno rifle was the murder weapon although I do not overlook Mr Barker’s contention that its absence prevents it being proved that it was not. The prosecution case (so far as material presently before me shows) is centrally dependent upon the alleged confessions. The defence is not obliged to determine or disclose at this stage whether evidence about the finding of the Brno rifle is objected to or whether it is desired to have it admitted. It is conceivable that the defence may wish to demonstrate handicaps arising from its loss along the lines discussed by the experts in their respective reports. It lies within the power of a trial judge to maintain fairness at trial not only by directions to the jury but by exclusion of evidence sought to be tendered by the Crown.  
      
       
      
     16     
     It should be mentioned that there is inconsistency between witnesses concerning some observations at the scene. Dr Kariks who performed the post mortem noted that “the bullet wounds in the right fronto-temporal area were surrounded by gun powder spray measuring 5.5cm x 4 cm in area”. Detective Ransome said he saw no such gun powder spray. That contradiction would not be removed by the presence of the missing exhibits. Detective Ransome did claim to see marks which could have been gun shot residue on the blanket. It is now missing but it was not, as I understand it, subjected to appropriate tests then nor, of course, can it now be so subjected.  
      
       
      
     17     
     It is also the case that the clothing of the accused was neither tested for gunshot residue at the time nor can it be now.  
      
       
      
     18     
     The absence of fairness in these regards is said to be perceived in the prevention of the accused from proving that the killer must have fired the weapon from close range (or contact) and that predictably gunshot residue and/or blood spray would have been deposited on the person of the killer and his or her clothes. Providing the clothing had been appropriately packaged and stored there should be, according to Mr Ross little disturbance of gunshot residue or blood. The accused is therefore prevented from positively proving that there was none on her clothing.  
      
       
      
     19     
     I comment in passing that, given the production at the inquest where the items were last reported it would seem unlikely that Mr Ross’s pre-condition of appropriate packaging and storage would be met in any event. The complaint is that there is no positive proof of the absence of gunshot residue or blood spray. There is in fact no suggestion in the Crown case to the contrary. 
      
       
      
     20     
     The absence of ability to offer positive proof is said to work unfairness against the accused in a particular respect because she must face opinion evidence from Detective Ransome based upon proximity tests done with the Brno rifle and a “foreign” bolt that the muzzle must have been in excess of three, or two to three feet away from the point of contact of the projectile with the body. Again if it be demonstrated that the admission of such evidence from Detective Ransome was unfairly prejudicial there is jurisdiction to cure the matter. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Support for the proposition that the accused could positively prove her innocence was sought to be drawn from the opinion of Mr Barber but in my view the submission seeks to attribute to the potential scientific evidence a capacity which it does not possess. The presence of the physical exhibits may have enabled demonstration but only in the negative sense that the accused cannot be shown to have used the Brno rifle and that there was no evidence of a scientific nature that she discharged that or any other weapon at the relevant time. Mr Barber’s own outline recognizes that this cannot be conclusive. 
      
       
      
     22     
     It suffices to observe the considerable qualifications which he stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is acknowledged that blood groups and DNA in blood will deteriorate with time, however, visual detection of blood on cloth will still be possible. 
         
        
        
         
         Gunshot Residues 
         
        
        
         
         Gunshot residues, on the other hand do not have the adhesive properties of (wet) blood. Thus, gunshot residue particles which deposit on clothing as a result of the discharge of a firearm will move and/or be dislodged from their original location as a result of activity and time after shooting. Testing of garments to establish how long gunshot residues persist on clothing has indicated that, in general, it may be found on the clothing of someone who has fired a gun as much as eight hours after shooting. These findings are subject to many variables, in particular to the nature of the activity after shooting. 
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     washing the clothing will probably remove all trace of gunshot residues; whilst 
      
       
      
     ·  
     removing the clothing soon after shooting and leaving it on the floor is likely to preserve gunshot residues on the clothing. 
      
       
        
         
         Occasionally, gunshot residues are preserved on a garment through adhesion to blood which has been deposited on the clothing. 
         
        
        
         
         Although the detection of gunshot residues on a garment indicates that the wearer may have discharged a firearm (or had in some way come into contact with a firearm or other gunshot residue contaminated object) a nil finding does not exclude the wearer from having fired a gun. A nil finding will result where: 
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     the person did not discharge the firearm or was not near a firearm when it was discharged; 
      
       
      
     ·  
     gunshot residues were on the garment but have not been detected; 
      
       
      
     ·  
     gunshot residues were on the garment immediately after the shooting but have been lost in the time between discharge and sampling; and 
      
       
      
     ·  
     the firearm ejected the residues in such a way that none deposited on the clothing of the shooter.” 
      
       
      
     23     
     I did not understand it to be alleged that the loss of a blood stained glass from the room where the shooting took place presented the accused with any particular obstacle but the circumstance was raised as part of the general complaint that the accused was unable to survey the prosecution case as a properly complete entity. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The statement by Ms Clancy that the garment tested presumptively for blood is not relied upon by the accused as potentially inhibitive of proof of her innocence. Insofar as evidence along the lines of her statement would be unfairly prejudicial I repeat that appropriate remedy lies within the jurisdiction of a trial judge. 
      
       
      
     25     
     The other category of missing evidence related to records of consultation by Atticus Busby with a counsellor at the Southern Cross University where Mr Busby was enrolled. He gave evidence that he first consulted this counsellor (Shumyam Peinecke) on the day after the accused allegedly told him about the murder. He was asked at the committal proceedings whether he commenced counselling at the suggestion of the accused and said “it was a mixture of things. I commenced counselling because of what Irena had told me. She had been suggesting counselling for some time.”  
      
       
      
     26     
     There is detail of how the records of such counselling sessions were supposed to be kept in the copy affidavit of Annie Burrett (Exhibit A). What are missing are the notes relating to the first thirteen of a longer series of consultations with Mr Busby. Mr Peinecke has no explanation for the absence of these records other than suggesting that he might inadvertently have included them with other material which was destined for destruction. Mr Peinecke was called in relation to the non compliance with a subpoena to produce this material. He testified that he engaged in something in the order of one thousand consultations a year with students and that he had no independent recollection of the content of the discussions with Mr Busby pertaining to which the notes were missing. Mr Busby acknowledged that he had written a letter seeking that the subpoena to produce those records be challenged and he admitted that he opposed the production of them. This has apparently heightened the suspicions of the accused and her representatives concerning what the records might reveal. 
      
       
      
     27     
     It was submitted that it was obvious that what Mr Busby said (to Mr Peinecke) may bear directly upon his real view of conversations with the accused (assuming it is different from his testimony); whether he is confused as to occasion and whether he has now attributed significance to anything the accused has said which he did not previously. Of course it can be guessed that such matters may have been discussed but I do not agree that it is obvious that they were.  
      
       
      
     28     
     It was claimed that the defence cannot “test the issue”. Even if the records were available the Crown would not be expected to seek to call Mr Peinecke in the trial to say what Mr Busby told him. Mr Busby is an essential Crown witness and what is desired in truth is the opportunity to inspect records (and provoke a revival of memory on the part of Mr Peinecke) for the purpose of cross examination (and, if necessary, contradiction) of Mr Busby directed to the credibility of his allegation that the accused had confessed to him or had seriously confessed to him. I am unpersuaded that the absence of these records which may or may not provide a resource for challenge to Mr Busby has the effect of making if unfair that the accused should stand trial at all. 
      
       
      
     29     
     There was no debate about the applicable law and Mr Barker accepted that it was necessary that it be demonstrated on the part of the accused that this was an exceptional case. There is ample authority:  
     Barton v The Queen 
      1980 147 CLR 75;  
     Jago v District Court of New South Wales 
      1989 168 CLR 23;  
     R v Glennon 
      1992 173 CLR 592.  
      
       
      
     30     
     It has been said that the power to order a permanent stay should be exercised sparingly and that the circumstances will usually have to be extreme for relief to be given. In  
     R v Tolmie  
     unreported CCA 7 December 1994 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… to justify such a stay, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing which the trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial could relieve the applicant against its unfair consequences.” 
         
        
       
      
     31     
     “What a judge can do” is not limited to jury direction but includes the exercise of discretion to exclude evidence. See now s137 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
      
     32     
     Counsel drew attention to cl 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.” 
         
        
       
      
     33     
     I agree with the contention that the rights of a citizen protected by the common law are no less than those proclaimed in that clause, however this exotic reference was given to found an invitation to consider two decisions of the Canadian Supreme Court relating to the Charter right and missing prosecution evidence: one case where a tape was simply lost:  
     R v La 
      [1997] 2 SCR 680; the other, where material had been deliberately destroyed by a third party:  
     R v Carosella 
      [1997] 1 SCR 80. In  
     La 
      the majority held that what was expressed as a duty to disclose (which seems to comprehend production as well as revelation) was not breached if there was a reasonable explanation by the prosecution for the loss. By analogy Mr Barker has argued that there is no reasonable explanation in the present case, it being no more than mere assertion that the material last seen at the inquest cannot be located and that the counselling records must have been misfiled and/or possibly destroyed. In  
     La 
      the majority stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “Here, the Crown’s explanation was satisfactory. The tape recording was not made in the course of the criminal investigation and the police officer did not fail to take reasonable steps to preserve the tape. 
         
        
        
         
         No abuse of process occurred. Conduct amounting to abuse of process includes the deliberate destruction of material by the police or other officers of the Crown for the purpose of defeating the Crown’s obligation to disclose and, even absent proof of improper motive, an unacceptable degree of negligent conduct.” 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     In that case, so far as I can deduce from the published judgments, the explanation did not establish how the particular tape came to be missing although a system obviously failed and one could readily postulate that the officer who lost the tape was negligent. That would not seem to have elevated the negligence into the “unacceptable” category. In my view the same can be said here. In respect of both the physical evidence items and the counselling records, it could be readily postulated that the respective keepers did not meet the standards requisite for a person exercising due care in discharging a responsibility but there is no aspect that I would assess as elevating the circumstances into the range of unacceptable negligence. 
      
       
      
     35     
     The information concerning the missing physical items was for present purposes derived from the statements in the police brief. No objection was taken to this nor was there complaint that the prosecution was deliberately delaying cross examination of, for example, Detective Allison. Mr Barker did submit that, although he said in written submission that they were lost, it was “putting the case too favourably for the Crown. The police say they cannot produce them. How this has come about, we don’t know because nobody has offered an explanation.” He adverted to the signature receipt by former Detective Long and the absence of any statement from Detective Ralston. The concept of loss frequently inheres the absence of knowledge of precisely what has happened. If such knowledge were possessed materials could, unless destroyed , probably be retrieved. The statement of Detective Allison shows the negative result of his inquiries and I do not think that I should apply a presumption of mala fides in the circumstances. If it is being speculated that there may have been some sinister reason for the absence of the police exhibits then the matter can be tested at trial, if necessary on voir dire or  
     Basha 
      inquiry. The evidence does not persuade me that the loss of the physical exhibits was other than accidental and, although I infer that this was the result of neglect, I do not assess the occurrence as manifesting such a degree of negligence that trial should be prevented as inevitably unfair.  
      
       
      
     36     
     Carosella  
     was a case where a sexual assault crisis centre followed a policy of deliberately shredding files with police involvement before being served (with order for production) in criminal proceedings. However the majority noted that: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was abundant evidence before the trial judge to enable him to conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that the information contained in the notes that were destroyed was logically probative to an issue at the trial as to the credibility of the complainant.” 
         
        
       
      
     37     
     I perceive no such abundant evidence of likely probative material in the present case. Even assuming that the trigger for Mr Busby’s attendance was shock at the alleged revelation of murder it is entirely speculative whether the counsellor was told any detail which might be probative in the sense that it would touch upon Mr Busby’s evidence or its credibility. I note some general observations in the minority judgment in that case - which I do not perceive to be different from the view in principle of the majority although in the application of principle the court divided five to four. The minority judgment contained: 
      
       
        
         
         “While the production of every relevant piece of evidence might be an ideal goal from the accused’s point of view, it is inaccurate to elevate this objective to a right, the non-performance of which leads instantaneously to an unfair trial. Where evidence is unavailable, the accused must demonstrate that a fair trial, and not a perfect one, cannot be had as a result of the loss. He must establish a real likelihood of prejudice to his defence; it is not enough to speculate that there is the potential for harm. Materials can be easily lost and setting too low a threshold for finding a breach of the right to full answer and defence would bring the justice system to a halt. While it is true that, with regard to certain rights, a court can infer the necessary degree of prejudice, this is not uniformly so.”  
         
        
        
       The “necessary degree of prejudice” is incapacity for a fair trial to be held. 
        
       
      
     38     
     It is not without interest that those remarks have the colour of those of Gleeson CJ in  
     R v McCarthy 
      unreported CCA 12 August 1994: 
      
       
        
         
         “Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents. If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed.” 
         
        
       
      
     39     
     I should record that counsel also relied upon approach and application to the question of staying proceedings manifest in a series of cases at first instance in South Australia:  
     Crawford v Bitar 
      7 August 1987;  
     Duncombe-Wall v Police 
      2 July 1998;  
     Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency v Bourke 
      16 April 1999.  
      
       
      
     40     
     Mention was made of the evidence concerning the movement of the body and the absence of precise observations by crime scene specialists concerning matters such as the pattern of spent shell ejection and the directions in which they lay. If these be deficiencies they are not situations which could ever be altered and it remains speculative whether such knowledge would be probative of anything. 
      
       
      
     41     
     In summary the following observations can be made. The clothing of the deceased (including his blanket) and the clothing of the accused might demonstrate that although muzzle and target were close at the time of discharge and therefore gunshot residue would be expected on the person and clothes of the firer, scientific testing demonstrated no such residue on the clothing of the accused. Testing is not conclusive and it is not part of the Crown case that there was such residue. The Brno rifle offers something of a distraction. I recognize the importance to investigators of the circumstances and time of its finding but, in the event it cannot be proved that it was the murder weapon. It is complained that the accused cannot prove that it was not the murder weapon. If she did, the consequence would be rejection of evidence concerning it. The identical consequence is within the jurisdiction of a trial judge to grant. 
      
       
      
     42     
     The presumptive test result on the nightgown is, I suggest, highly vulnerable to rejection if objection is taken. The potential probative value of the bloodstained glass is obscure. 
      
       
      
     43     
     It is not necessary to recapitulate my view about the missing counselling records. 
      
       
      
     44     
     It should be remarked that the jurisdiction to stay must necessarily be exercised with foresight and it is requisite to foresee that a fair trial cannot be had. This is quite different from appellate review where assessment is made whether anything has happened to render a trial that has taken place unfair. The protections inherent in the latter process are not lost and remain constant. 
      
       
      
     45     
     It is self evidently a matter for regret that the physical exhibits and the records are not available and nothing I have said should be taken as treating the matter as insignificant. I am, however, unpersuaded to the conclusion that the circumstances, singly or in combination, are such that it can be determined that a fair trial cannot be had. 
      
       
      
     46     
     The application for permanent stay of proceedings is refused.

     JUDGMENT 
      
     (On application to discharge the jury) 
    1   HIS HONOUR: In this matter I have delivered a number of judgments referring to the unfortunately fractured nature of these proceedings. A witness whose statement had been served prior to committal, who was not called at committal and in respect of whom appropriate steps were not taken to secure the witness' presence or testimony prior, has been brought to Australia. The Crown had made application prior to trial to take the witness' evidence by video link. I ruled against that application because of the crucial nature of the witness' evidence and because a real question arose as to whether the witness would be under any such sanction as was the equivalent of the New South Wales oath, having regard to the requirements of the Evidence Act and of the relevant part of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      
    2   Subsequently, on the witness' arrival, a further statement has been obtained indicating that the witness can give evidence which certainly focuses most powerfully on matters which, while they may have fallen within the general ambit of what the witness earlier had been thought to be able to say, now are put specifically in a way which most powerfully impacts upon the case. 
     
      
       
      
    3   The case remains a circumstantial case. However, the testimony that the witness apparently can give is such as immeasurably to strengthen the Crown case. The defence, confronted with this information, has sought an opportunity to make enquiries to see if avenues might exist for evidence that might rebut such portions of the new material as are capable of being put to the test of independent testimony. The Crown has argued that no adjournment should be granted, although the Crown Prosecutor recognised that at least some opportunity for inquiries might be appropriate, and that a pre-trial examination of the witness commonly referred to as a Basha enquiry should commence immediately. 
     
      
       
      
    4   The Crown had long conceded that if the witness were to give evidence in person such an inquiry would have to be undertaken. 
     
      
       
      
    5   It is clear that there are substantial avenues for cross-examination of the witness. The witness gives evidence under an immunity, apparently protecting the witness from prosecution for crimes in connection with the three murders with which the accused stands charged. 
     
      
       
      
    6   The witness gives evidence, having come here, by way of an arrangement under a mutual assistance agreement, having the benefit of certain statutory immunities provided for in the Federal legislation and by agreement with the Republic of Korea. 
     
      
       
      
    7   In the Crown case there are at least the bases for allegations that might be put to the witness of an involvement in forging and uttering, obtaining property by deception and possibly accessory after the fact to or accessory to three murders. 
     
      
       
      
    8   There has been immense difficulty in the Crown securing the attendance of the witness in Australia. In that respect documentation has been produced on subpoena both from the Federal Attorney General Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. With that in mind the Crown has sought that the enquiry examining the witness' evidence should proceed and, consistently until now, throughout the trial has sought and obtained adjournments on the basis that the trial could still proceed in front of the jury that is empanelled notwithstanding the spasmodic nature of the proceedings before them. My own observations of the jury have been such as to indicate to me that they retain a vivid interest in the proceedings and a willingness to continue to serve notwithstanding that the case has grown highly confusing so far as individual items of evidence can be said to relate to the case as a whole and to others. Partly this is a consequence of the Crown Prosecutor having had to open the case in the general and restricted way that he did in consequence of his not being aware of whether or not this particular witness would come to Australia. Now, however, the Crown has taken the view that it supports the application for discharge which has been made during the trial again and again by the defence. 
     
      
       
      
    9   There remains, however, a problem. It is submitted by the defence that in the event that I discharge the jury it is possible that some restriction may exist in law on whether or not the evidence of the witness might be taken on some appropriate application and in particular it is submitted that the Basha enquiry procedure does not exist for this purpose. Nonetheless, recognising this, it is the Crown submission in support of what has been put by the defence that the jury should be discharged and that there is no good reason including any problem that might be associated with a Basha enquiry for maintaining the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    10   It would not be appropriate, in my view, notwithstanding that the jury has been excused for the day, by reason of the prospect of the Basha enquiry and the various arguments that have gone on, for me to maintain this jury solely for the purpose of hearing an argument about whether or not things that would be done after their discharge may or may not have particular legal foundation. 
     
      
       
      
    11   With those considerations in mind I discharge the jury.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
     HIS HONOUR 
     :  
      
       
        
       ( 
       NOTE 
       : During the trial in this matter, I made an order that there be no identification of the Prisoner other than by the pseudonym “K” in any report of the proceedings and later a further order that there be no publication of (the names of) the persons named in the departmental file (of the Department of Community Services). It is appropriate to limit that order to persons (other than the deceased) to whose care the Prisoner was entrusted over the years, and to add the qualification “otherwise than by their initials”. I now so order. Consistently with that order, I intend to refer to such persons by their initials.  
        
        
       In large part these Reasons were prepared prior to any decision being made as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. It is convenient to continue to refer to K as “the Prisoner”, notwithstanding the order made prior to the publication of these Reasons.) 
        
       
      
     1     
     A decision as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case was difficult. The circumstances presented starkly the competing requirements of deterrence and retribution on the one hand, and rehabilitation and allowance for the subjective considerations of the Prisoner on the other. Ultimately I decided he should be placed on recognisance. These are the reasons for that decision. 
      
      
     2     
     On 17 May last an indictment charging the Prisoner with the murder of Geoffrey Boyson on or about 24 October 1996 was presented. The Prisoner pleaded not guilty. On 8 June a jury found him guilty of manslaughter. 
      
      
     3     
     In substance the issues in the trial were the partial legal defences of provocation and diminished responsibility, doctrines which have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. The onus of negativing the former beyond reasonable doubt lay on the Crown. The onus of establishing the latter, albeit only on the balance of probabilities, lay on the Prisoner. The jury’s verdict does not disclose which of these issues was resolved in favour of the Prisoner or, indeed, whether both were. Indeed, these are matters I must decide -  
     R v Isaacs 
      (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 - recognising where the onus of proof of each lies and what the standard of proof of each is. 
      
      
     4     
     I acknowledge also that quite separately from these matters, before I can use any matter against the Prisoner I must be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. In the resolution of these matters and those referred to in the preceding paragraph issues, it may be necessary for me to reach conclusions on incidental issues that arise. Except where those conclusions are essential to a finding which must be made beyond reasonable doubt, it is not necessary that those incidental issues are determined to that standard. Having stated this will be my approach, I shall not encumber these Reasons with frequent references to the standard or onus of proof. 
      
      
     5     
     The Prisoner was born on 2 January 1980. He became a ward of the State. He and the deceased had become acquainted at Central Railway Station. The Prisoner is recorded as lodging with the deceased in November 1995. During 1996 the Prisoner expressed a wish to live with the deceased and took up residence there in or about late August 1996. Representatives of the Department of Community Services visited and interviewed the deceased and had a police record check carried out on him and the Department formally recognised the deceased as the Prisoner’s carer on 23 October 1996. I use the term “carer” advisedly. That is the term on a document signed by the Manager of the Bowral branch of the Department of Community Services. I am satisfied that in so doing officers of the Department felt that their hand was very largely forced by the Prisoner who had absconded on a number of occasions from where he should have been and, despite agreeing not to go to Mr Boyson’s to live until all Departmental inquiries and processes were concluded, took himself there at the time I have indicated. 
      
      
     6     
     According to Dr Wong, a psychiatrist who interviewed the Prisoner for the purposes of the trial, the Prisoner told him that:-  
      
      
       
        
         
         “He had been with Geoff, the deceased, for about 2 months. He spent most of that period on the street, using drugs and doing crime and spent very little time with Geoff. He used Geoff’s place for drugs and was there only when they used drugs together… Geoff brought back drugs which he had confiscated from residents at the place he worked. They gave each other drugs. He said that was the basis of their relationship. He was adamant that he would not have gone to Geoff if he were not allowed to use drugs. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Their relationship deteriorated after Geoff raped him, “maybe a week, maybe two weeks” before he was killed. He raped him when Tomi was using drugs and could not do anything about it. However, he did not want to tell me more about the incident. 
          
          
         The next time he went back to Geoff was on the day when the killing took place. He did not have any food or clothing and wanted to go back to get his belongings before he moved to Wollongong. … When he went back, Geoff was using drugs and both of them used drugs together. Geoff was rubbing his crutch and leg and said he was turning him on. Tomi did not want the same thing (rape) to happen again and wanted him to leave him alone. He told Geoff he was getting something to eat and went into the kitchen. He sat there for 10 minutes, thinking of what to do. He just wanted Geoff to leave him alone. He got a knife from a knife holder next to the microwave…. He wanted to scare him so that he would let him leave and “the thing” would not happen again. As he went out Geoff was just standing up and waiting for him. He then came towards Tomi who stabbed him, just to scare him, he could not remember where he stabbed him.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     7     
     Although there were differences Dr Canaris, another psychiatrist, was given a not dissimilar story. 
      
      
     8     
     The deceased had homosexual, if not paedophiliac tendencies. Although the documents themselves were not in evidence, there were found in his apartment what would seem to have been classified advertisements for two magazines - “Outrage” and “Campaign”. Copies of those magazines were tendered and they clearly are directed to the homosexual members of the community. Also found was an index to advertisements in more common womens’ magazines. The advertisements so indexed were of young children or babies, naked or semi-naked. Although there are aspects of the evidence which must cause one to consider the possibility that the Prisoner has or had similar tendencies, I am satisfied that he does and did not. This conclusion is supported by, inter alia, what the Prisoner has said after the deceased’s death, by evidence from a Mr W with whom the Prisoner resided for a period, and by the absence from the numerous professional assessments of the Prisoner of any finding to the effect that he had.  
      
      
     9     
     In regarding Mr W’s evidence as supporting the conclusion expressed in the last paragraph, I do not ignore evidence Mr W gave as to the desire and, at times, practice of the Prisoner to sleep in Mr W’s bed. However I regard those matters as an indication of the Prisoner’s need for affection rather than anything more. 
      
      
     10     
     I am satisfied that a week or two or thereabouts before 24 October 1996, the deceased anally raped the Prisoner while the latter was intoxicated on alcohol and/or drugs. Some time thereafter the Prisoner was at a squat in Parramatta with an acquaintance, Mr Stone. The Prisoner looked down in the dumps. Mr Stone tried to find out what was wrong and conversation which, despite Mr Stone’s expressed doubts, I am satisfied occurred with the Prisoner along the following lines ensued:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         PRISONER “What would you do if someone raped you?” 
          
         MR STONE “In what way?” 
          
         PRISONER “Rooted you and stuff like that?” 
          
         MR STONE “I’d kill ‘em” 
         
        
       
      
      
     11     
     On 24 October the Prisoner returned to Mr Boyson’s unit. He said to the two psychiatrists that this was to collect some of his belongings that were stored there. There seem to have been such but be that as it may and despite what happened, I am not prepared to infer that the Prisoner went to the deceased’s unit with any intention of harming the deceased. 
      
      
     12     
     Precisely what happened at the unit is not clear. Apart from the objective signs present when the police arrived 2 days later, one is largely dependent on what the Prisoner has said, either in cryptic accounts given within a few days of the deceased’s death or to the psychiatrists on and after 30 April 1999 against the background of his trial. I am however satisfied that the Prisoner’s account, which I find was given to Mrs Whitton on 28 October 1996, is substantially accurate so far as it goes.  
      
      
       
        
         
         “Well, a while back Geoff got me stoned on drink and drugs and fucked me up the arse twice. Last Thursday, after I had drunk a half bottle of scotch, Geoff kept touching me on the leg and saying ‘You’re making me horny’ so I got up and went to the kitchen and cut his throat and stabbed him a few times.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     13     
     That he drank some whisky was also stated by the Prisoner to Drs Wong and Canaris. To the latter, the Prisoner said that he got really smashed. To Dr Wong the Prisoner said that the two were using drugs. 
      
      
     14     
     These references to what the Prisoner told Dr Wong and Dr Canaris make it appropriate at this time to say something about the reliability of such statements. Although venturing on matters logically dealt with below, it is appropriate to record that both psychiatrists formed the opinion that the Prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind. To the doctors the Prisoner indicated inability to remember in some areas and in a number of respects there are differences in the detail of the history the doctors were given. In the result, I am not persuaded that all the Prisoner told the doctors should be accepted, particularly where his account to one doctor is the only evidence on the topic.  
      
      
     15     
     Of the matters just mentioned, I am satisfied that the Prisoner would have had drugs if they were available but, in light of the fact that it he seems not to have mentioned taking drugs that day to Dr Canaris, I am not be prepared to find either that they were or were not. In light of the mention to Mrs Whitton of half a bottle of whisky, I find that the Prisoner consumed a significant quantity while in the deceased’s company. However he told Dr Wong that he could finish 2 to 3 bottles a day and I am not satisfied that he was “smashed”. Obviously that is not a finding that he was not. The probabilities are that the whisky was supplied by the deceased. 
      
      
     16     
     Dr Wong understood that the rubbing or touching by the deceased was of himself although according to what the Prisoner told Dr Canaris it was of the Prisoner. I doubt that it matters. I am satisfied that the deceased attempted to seduce the Prisoner. 
      
      
     17     
     When found, the deceased’s body was nude and there is no suggestion it was not in this condition when the deceased was attacked. There is no evidence of when the deceased undressed, and some suggestion that he commonly adopted this attitude of nudity in his apartment. Nor was there any explanation given why, in light of the previous incident, the Prisoner participated in drinking or drug taking while at the deceased’s unit. That said, explanation may exist in the Prisoner’s lifestyle detailed above, or in his statements to Dr Wong that he drank heavily and could finish 2 to 3 bottles of vodka or whisky in a day. 
      
      
     18     
     The Prisoner went to the kitchen, took hold of a kitchen knife and attacked the deceased. The Prisoner inflicted a 135 mm cut to the deceased’s throat, one stab wound to the head, penetrating the skull though not the underlying membrane, and four stab wounds to the upper right part of the deceased’s back. These wounds varied in depth between 90 and 180 mm and three of them penetrated bones. All four penetrated one of the deceased’s lungs and caused his death from loss of blood. The nature and location of the wounds lead to the conclusion that at the time they were inflicted the Prisoner had lost self-control.  
      
      
     19     
     From the injuries to the deceased, the fact his body was found in the kitchen and the distribution of blood in the unit, I would infer the attack occurred, at least in part, in the lounge room or thereabouts.  
      
      
     20     
     According to what the Prisoner told Dr Wong he unsuccessfully searched the unit for a key, took some clothes and the remains of a bottle of whisky he and the deceased had been drinking and left the unit by climbing over the balcony. I accept that this is what occurred. 
      
      
     21     
     At 9.32 pm on 24 October 1996, the Prisoner made a call to 000 from a public telephone close to the deceased’s premises. In it he said something to the following effect:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Hello (would I get) I’d like to report a murder at erm 11/3, London Street, Enmore. Anonymous caller. A murder someone’s been stabbed.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     22     
     At some time between about 1.00 am and 8.20 am on 25 October, the Prisoner left a message on the deceased’s answering machine. The message was:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Yeah, Geoff. Its me, Tomi. I’ll be back home in a week. O.K. Bye.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     23     
     In the period between the deceased’s death and the evening of 26 October, the Prisoner again joined Mr Stone at the squat at Parramatta. On this occasion conversation to the following effect occurred:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         Q What did he say to you? 
          
         A That he killed someone because he got raped. 
          
         Q What were the words he said to you? 
          
         A He said “I done it.” 
          
         Q Were they the first words he uttered?: “I done it? 
          
         A Yeah. 
          
         Q What did you say in response to that? 
          
         A “Done what?” 
          
         Q What did he say? 
          
         A “Killed the bloke I was living with because he raped me.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     24     
     At about 7.25 pm on 26 October 1996 the Prisoner made another call from a public phone again some few blocks from the deceased’s premises. In it the Prisoner said:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Hello. There’s been a murder at 11/3 London Street, Enmore. They’ve killed a person, erm, I dunno. I done it.” 
         
        
       
       
      
     25     
     At about 7.30 pm on that day the Prisoner arrived at the block in which the deceased’s unit was situate. In consequence of concerns held by people who worked with the deceased, the police were already there. In response to inquiry the Prisoner informed the police that he lived at unit 11 with Geoffrey Boyson. In the course of further questioning the Prisoner said that he had been camping for a week and had just got back. After a little time he went with police to the police station. Because of his age it was necessary for there to be present at any questioning an adult not connected with the police force. When the officer in charge of the investigation, a Detective Jackson, approached the Prisoner to tell him that arrangements in that regard had been made the Prisoner said “I stabbed him”. Detective Jackson said “What?” and the Prisoner said:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “ I stabbed him. I stabbed him ‘cause he was fucking me up the arse.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     26     
     On 28 October at the Bidura Children’s Court the Prisoner made the statement to Mrs Whitton which I have recounted above. 
      
       
      
     27     
     I turn to the issue of provocation. 
      
      
     PROVOCATION 
      
      
     28     
     Pursuant to s23of the Crimes Act 1900, an act is done under provocation where:- 
      
      
     (a)  
     the act is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and 
      
     (b)  
     that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person, not intoxicated, in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased. 
      
      
     29     
     It was submitted on behalf of both the Crown and the Prisoner that I should find that the Crown had not disproved that the Prisoner’s offence was committed in such circumstances. I so find. Indeed I am satisfied that the circumstances of the Prisoner’s offence fulfil the criteria stated. 
      
      
     30     
     So far as paragraph (a) is concerned, I need add nothing to what I have said above. I should say more concerning the matters encompassed in paragraph (b). Any rape, be it of a man or a woman, is a gross violation of the victim. Although it is no longer a crime, anal intercourse is to many members of the community both revolting and degrading. It is even more so when it is inflicted without free and willing consent. In my view anal rape could well, in some circumstances, induce an ordinary person, not intoxicated, to so far lose self-control as to form an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the rapist.  
      
      
     31     
     Here of course, there was an appreciable passage of time - a week or two or thereabouts - between the rape and the deceased’s death - time enough, it may be argued, for anyone’s emotions to cool down. However one must also take into account the fact that the deceased displayed an indication of repeating his actions - conduct calculated to rekindle any adverse reaction in a victim. Furthermore, regard must be had to “the position of the accused”. To put the provocation into perspective, to appreciate its content, extent and gravity, one must consider the position of the accused, including his “age, sex, ... personal attributes, personal relationships and past history” -  
     Masciantonio v R 
      (1995) 183 CLR 58 at 67. 
      
      
     32     
     “The position of the accused” is in this case, a matter of some significance. I will detail it more when I come to deal with his circumstances rather than the circumstances of the offence. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that he has had an exceedingly emotionally deprived background, in his early years was let down badly by those whose obligation was to care for him and, at the time of the offence had and had had so little in terms of personal relationships or achievements that to be anally raped was likely to be especially degrading and provocative. The prospect of being subjected to, or even a fitting candidate for, a second instance of anal intercourse may well not have been less so.  
      
      
     33     
     The need of the Prisoner for his belongings provides a sufficient explanation for his return to the deceased’s unit. Not as readily explicable is his participating in drinking and, possibly drug taking while he was there. But that said, regard must be had to his past and these matters do not incline me to the view that the Crown has excluded the defence of provocation. 
      
      
     34     
     Given that these reasons are concerned with the question of sentence and not guilt, it is appropriate that I say something about the weight I am disposed to give to the topic of provocation. The myriad of circumstances to be considered in any case of provocation mean that it is difficult to compare quantitatively one case with another. However it is appropriate to say that, while I do not regard this case as in a worst category so far as the victim’s conduct is concerned, I put it high on that scale and, when one has regard to the position of the Prisoner faced with that provocation, one where the provocation was very high. Furthermore, his history summarised in some detail below, makes his loss of self control much more easily understood and more excusable than in the case of the vast majority of the community who have far greater reserves of emotional stability to draw upon. 
      
      
     DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY 
      
      
     35     
     It was submitted on behalf of the Prisoner that I should also find that Diminished Responsibility, as that concept was expressed in s23A of the Crimes Act in October 1996, has been established on the balance of probabilities. The Crown opposed such a finding. So far as is relevant, at the time s23A provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death charged the person was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent cause of induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts or omissions, he shall not be convicted of murder” (but of manslaughter). 
         
        
       
      
      
     36     
     Both Dr Wong and Dr Canaris formed the opinion that at the time of his offence the Prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind which answered the description within that provision although they differed in their description of what it was. There is little which would justify rejection of the common view of these psychiatrists and indeed the Crown did not suggest that there is any. The sole aspect of the doctrine with which the Crown took issue was whether the Prisoner’s abnormality of mind substantially impaired the Prisoner’s mental responsibility for the acts causing death. 
      
      
     37     
     That is an issue on which medical evidence is not decisive. Indeed it has been said that “expert medical evidence is not really of great assistance in determining” it -  
     Trotter 
      (1993) 68 A Crim R 536. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, it seems to me necessary to pay significant regard to the medical evidence, although I confess at the outset to having difficulty in accepting some of it. That difficulty does not arise through any preference for either Dr Wong or Dr Canaris as witnesses but rather from the content of what they said. 
      
      
     38     
     Dr Canaris thought that Prisoner’s abnormality of mind substantially impaired the Prisoner’s mental responsibility for the acts causing death. However, the weight I am disposed to give to this opinion is reduced by at least four matters in his own evidence. Firstly, I am disinclined to accept his diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, principally for the reasons advanced by Dr Wong in answer to some questions by myself and in particular the reason that there is no evidence that the Prisoner, prior to killing Mr Boyson, commonly re-experienced any traumatic event. Secondly, having examined all of the DOCS file at length, I am unpersuaded that in his past the Prisoner suffered anything like the amount of sexual abuse to which Dr Canaris seems to refer. I remain unpersuaded that he suffered any, a conclusion which echoes what the Prisoner told Dr Wong although I have arrived at it by a different route. 
      
       
      
     39     
     In that regard, it is proper to recognise that there are a significant number of references to sexual abuse within the documents in the Department of Community Services (DOCS) file. However a close and chronological examination of them provides a good illustration of what happens to an account when it passes through a number of hands. References to primary material tells a story different from later versions. (Although I do not rely on the fact - because I have no need to do so and because there is something to be said for the view that the mind may bury traumatic events - I note that the Prisoner told Ms Jones of the Department of Juvenile Justice that he had no memory of sexual abuse.) 
      
       
      
     40     
     Thirdly, in response to some questions from me, Dr Canaris indicated that if conversation to the effect of that deposed to by Mr Stone had occurred, he would have some doubt as to the significance of the defence of diminished responsibility “not because of the conversation per se as such, but because I am now offered a history very inconsistent with the history that the defence case has which makes me wonder whether I can believe what he is telling me. You know, I have to then ask myself: well, is he telling me about a pack of lies about his mental condition.” 
      
      
     41     
     Fourthly, a little later Dr Canaris indicated, in effect, that if the events leading up to the killing of the deceased included the suggestion by Mr Stone to the Prisoner of killing the deceased, that suggestion may have influenced the Prisoner towards forming an intention to kill and that possibility reduced his confidence in any diagnosis of operative diminished responsibility. In so expressing Dr Canaris’ conclusion, I have departed from the terms of statements to the effect “I would find it an uphill battle to come up with diminished responsibility” but because of the less than perfect clarity in the questions and answers on this topic I think what I have said more accurately expresses the tenor of Dr Canaris’ evidence. Dr Canaris did agree that any judgment of the impact of Mr Stone’s statement to the effect “I would kill him” on the Prisoner depends to a significant degree on what view one forms as to the details of the events that follow. He went on to say that the impact on the Prisoner depended also on his state of mind at the time of asking “what would you do if someone were raping you” and what he was actually thinking at the time of the killing. On that latter topic, the only express evidence is what the Prisoner told the two psychiatrists and Mrs Whitton. 
      
      
     42     
     Dr Wong was of the view that the Prisoner’s abnormality of mind did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for the acts causing death. He expressed his conclusion in these terms:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “… If Tomi’s version is accurate, his ability to exercise control over his physical acts at the time of the alleged killing did not appear to be impaired. According to him, he sat in the kitchen for 10 minutes pondering what to do before he committed the stabbing. Admittedly, the deceased had 6 stab wounds whereas Tomi did not suffer any significant injury and told the police the deceased did not fight back. However, I do not feel we can conclude from this that the attack was one committed under impaired control. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         I have some difficulty in convincing myself that the version of events given by Tomi is a reliable one… However, on the basis of such information as is available to me, I have no reason to believe that his ability to exercise control over his physical act was significantly impaired at the time. He did not appear to be unduly prone to impulsive behaviour. Even when he was very keen to live with Geoff, he was prepared to wait until the necessary arrangements were made.” 
         
        
       
      
     43     
     The statement in the last sentence is wrong. Although the Prisoner said that he was prepared to wait, a consideration of the Department of Community Services File relating to the Prisoner shows that he did not. The file also refers to incidents which to my mind do indicate impulsive behaviour, although whether such incidents were sufficient in number or degree to indicate that the Prisoner was unduly prone in that regard is not a matter which was canvassed or on which I find it necessary to reach a conclusion.  
      
       
      
     44     
     In light of the Prisoner’s statement to Dr Wong of spending some 10 minutes in the kitchen contemplating his course of action and his failure to give evidence disavowing or explaining that, I must, I think, proceed on the assumption that some such event may have occurred. I say that notwithstanding I share Dr Wong’s reservations concerning this matter and I certainly do not regard the 10 minute estimate, given some years after the event as in any way reliable. However, Dr Wong does not address the difference between the Prisoner’s actions or thought in the kitchen when his control may not have been impaired and his actions in stabbing the deceased, when, judged by the injuries, in my opinion self control was impaired. This omission makes me unwilling to simply accept Dr Wong’s conclusion.  
      
       
      
     45     
     I am thrown back, it seems, largely onto my own judgment on the issue. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the Prisoner’s abnormality of mind did substantially impair his mental responsibility for the acts causing death. My reasons are as follows. Firstly, the Prisoner did have an abnormality of mind. Dr Wong described it as “gross psychiatric disturbance”. Dr Canaris described the Prisoner as “a profoundly disturbed individual (who had suffered) an innumerable series of severe psychological traumas”. The Prisoner’s history and other psychiatric and psychological assessments to which I refer below satisfy me that these are not overstatements. Secondly, that history and those assessments indicate that the Prisoner was very ill equipped to cope with stress which impacted on him personally. It is inescapable that this deficiency was part of his abnormality of mind. Thirdly, even if his relationship with Mr Boyson was primarily dictated by a common interest in drugs and the freedom which Mr Boyson afforded the Prisoner, as the latter seemed to indicate to Dr Wong, I have no doubt that Mr Boyson’s actions were but another of the many and gross disappointments by which the Prisoner’s life to that time had been dominated. Fourthly, it was against this background that the Prisoner did lose self control. 
      
       
      
     46     
     In this concomitance of circumstances it seems to me probable that not only did the Prisoner’s abnormality of mind contribute to the acts causing death but did so to such an extent as to substantially impair his mental responsibility for the acts causing death. 
      
       
      
     47     
     It may not be inappropriate to observe that to some degree, and despite my reservations, this chain of reasoning bears some similarity with that of Dr Canaris where he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I also believe that your client could avail himself of the defence of diminished responsibility. Even if your client may have seemed cool, calm and collected on the day in question and over the next few days, the anger he would have experienced would have been far in excess of anything which the putative normal person could expect to control. Furthermore, as a profoundly damaged individual, he would have been far less equipped to contain such anger that an ordinary person who had hitherto led an ordinary life. His capacity to judge his situation correctly and to control his impulse to kill would have been substantially impaired. Unlike an ordinary person, his personal boundaries would have been grossly disrupted by the cumulative impact of childhood sexual and physical abuse, gross emotional deprivation, institutional abuse and life on the streets.” 
         
        
       
      
     48     
     In coming to the view I have, I do not forget that the Prisoner carries the onus on the issue of diminished responsibility, that he did not give evidence during the trial or on sentence, his statements to the effect that he approached the deceased with a conscious plan of action in mind - “to scare him” - that he had been drinking and perhaps drug taking, and seems to have exhibited some thought in and about leaving the deceased’s unit. Nevertheless, my conclusion on this topic is as I have indicated. 
      
       
      
     49     
     So far as the Prisoner’s actions in and about leaving the unit are concerned, the Crown placed reliance on the Prisoner’s actions after stabbing the deceased in, inter alia, collecting some of his clothing, the bottle whisky and a bag and in then climbing down a series of balconies from the deceased’s unit to the ground. These actions demonstrated, so it was said, possession of the Prisoner’s faculties. The latter proposition may be accepted, although questions arise whether they were in a fully normal state and whether the killing of the deceased may not have had the effect of sobering the Prisoner up to some extent. And it must also be borne in mind that the Prisoner left his wallet and watch in the deceased’s bathroom - an action or omission calculated to identify him and indicative of some degree of haste, thoughtlessness or panic. I do not find in the Prisoner’s actions at the unit after the deceased’s death any guide to the issues which I have to decide. 
      
     Subjective Circumstances 
      
      
     50     
     I turn to the subjective circumstances of the Prisoner. His history prior to going to live with the deceased is the subject of extensive record in files of the Department of Community Services. It makes appalling reading but bears detailed reference. 
      
      
     51     
     The Prisoner was born on 2 January 1980. His mother was an alcoholic and had been one while carrying the Prisoner and his sister Suzie born in May 1978. Departmental records show that on a number of occasions during 1980 when officers of the Department visited the home, they found it littered with rubbish, food scraps, beer and other alcoholic drink bottles, cigarette butts, unwashed plates and cutlery and clothes. 
      
      
     52     
     In June 1980 the Prisoner was hospitalised for severe nappy rash after his mother was found unconscious outside a local hotel. A Dr Waterlow recorded that between the Prisoner’s birth and 18 June 1980 the Prisoner presented as generally unkempt, not well cared for and a very unhappy baby whose mental age was beginning to lag. When admitted to hospital at that time he lay miserably in his cot and did not interact with staff. Tests carried out showed there was then considerable delay in his personal, social and language development. His development advanced whilst in hospital but following discharge he showed signs of regression. 
      
      
     53     
     In August 1980 the Prisoner’s mother left the children with her parents and disappeared. In that month the two children were placed in an institution when their mother and grandmother were found in a drunken disorderly state. After 3 weeks in the institution a marked improvement was observed in the case of both children. In September 1980 it was recorded that Suzie suffered from late development in consequence of the drinking habits of her mother during pregnancy, was exceptionally small, was unable to speak and uttered only single syllables. The Prisoner’s development was noted also to be slowing. On 24 November 1980 the Prisoner was recorded as being considerably behind developmentally. 
      
      
     54     
     The Prisoner was made a ward of the State on 11 November 1980. On 8 December 1980 he and his sister were placed with foster parents. The considerable criticism of these persons in the Departmental files to which it will be necessary to refer, and the absence of any opportunity to respond to that criticism are among the reasons it is appropriate to refer to these persons as Mr and Mrs B. 
      
      
     55     
     Apart from some emotional instability during the settling in period the Prisoner apparently settled down well initially and showed considerable improvement in his developmental level. However in March 1981 he began to suffer convulsions intermittently. Later Dilantin was recommended, and in October 1983 it was noted that he had been free from seizures for the last few months. In May 1981 he was recorded as having temper tantrums and breath holding attacks. 
      
      
     56     
     In 1984 and 1985, the Prisoner was seen by a Mr Robertson, a psychologist. He recorded a good relationship and communication between the Prisoner and Mr and Mrs B and that the Prisoner appeared to be stopping a habit of putting things in his mouth. In July 1985 Mr Robertson recorded that he had seen both children fairly regularly and the initial improvement appears to have remained. Because Mr and Mrs B were concerned about unusual behaviour of both children - Suzie’s overt sexual behaviour and the Prisoner’s propensity towards eating almost anything - Mr Robertson recommended thorough psychiatric and neurological assessment. 
      
      
     57     
     In June 1985 the Prisoner’s kindergarten teacher for the year recorded his eating of glue, plasticine dirt, plant, blue tack, pencils and crayons without any apparent fear of harming himself and as an almost self punitive attention getting device. He was often disruptive to class routine due, she felt, to a very limited concentration span and thereby alienated himself from others. She recorded the depositing of urine and faeces in wash bowls and that he didn’t seem to register shame or fear of reprimand. Asked why, he would reply, “I don’t know.” then a strange smirk would appear on his face. He had been reprimanded for injuring other children with sticks and throwing stones and again showed no shame, fear of reprimand or awareness of the wrongness of his actions. 
      
      
     58     
     In August 1985 the Prisoner was the subject of assessment and a detailed report from a paediatric neurologist at the Westmead Neurological Centre. The history recorded, given by Mr and Mrs B, included the statement that a major problem was the Prisoner’s self destructiveness. He would hang upside down on a monkey bar and fall directly on his head, bites his fingers, gouge his eyes and had been seen to rub his feet into glass on the floor: He constantly talked about death and tried to kill or hurt small animals and insects: He ate inappropriate things including cockroaches: He was constantly disruptive in class with hyperactive behaviour and poor concentration: He attempted to attract attention by putting his head in the toilet bowl and urinating on the floor: He was not very affectionate and indifferent to praise or physical or verbal punishment: Convulsions were generally but not always provoked.  
      
      
     59     
     There were no focal signs on neurological examination. The final paragraph of the report reads:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “In summary, Suzie and Tomi are both extremely disturbed children who came from a very deprived background. Their behaviour is typical of that classically described in children with this degree of deprivation including excessive eating of normal and abnormal things as well as the lack of affect and any sense of guilt or responsibility. I should think that the prognosis for the children from a psychological point of view is very dismal indeed. Unfortunately, the foster parents have been trying to tell the Youth and Community Services for many years how disturbed these children are and have gotten very far (sic). I certainly do not think there is any evidence that there a neurological disease (sic) except for the brain damage and clumsiness which are the result of the alcohol exposure during pregnancy.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     60     
     Departmental reports of October 1985 record the making of a decision to remove the children on the recommendation of a social worker and Dr Dudley of the Department of Psychiatry of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, and that Mrs B said that she could not cope with Suzie for another 3 months. By November Mrs B is recorded as saying that if alternative placement was not arranged within 3 days, Suzie would be left at the office of the Department of Community Services. On 14 November 1985 Suzie was brought to the office and then taken to Minali, which was apparently a departmental home. 
      
      
     61     
     An assessment of 1 November 1985 by Dr Dudley refers to Suzie having foetal alcohol syndrome but both children having “gross behavioural, emotional, educational and cognitive problems … explicable on the basis of the grossest abuse and disruption of attachment in their early years”. The Prisoner’s problems, I infer as described by the Bs, are noted as encopresis (depositing faeces in abnormal places), pica (eating of non-nutritive substances), self injuring and dangerous behaviour, destructive behaviour, some precocious sexual interest, and lying. The report continues “The Bs have attempted to restore the deficiency with little support” and that further neuro-psychological assessment is needed as is residential help, and that this was being sought for Suzie at Bernardo’s and for Tomi at Arndell (I infer, another departmental institution). 
      
      
     62     
     In December 1985 a report of a clinical psychologist. Mr Said, recorded:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Tomi’s general intellectual ability is clearly in the average range and his ability to learn, retain and recall auditory verbal material is also normal. However on the McCarthy memory and motor scales (which measure attention and immediate recall) Tomi scored below the normal range and these scores indicate problems with attention, concentration and co-ordination. There is no indication that these problems are caused by organic impairment and they are most likely caused by disruptive early development and current emotional problems.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     63     
     The Prisoner and his sister were the subject of a report by Mr Defina, another psychologist, sometime after 3 March 1986. This document refers to reports on file indicating Mrs B had unrealistic expectations and her management of children was incompetently inappropriate and the behaviour of the children deteriorated. On testing Tomi was well behaved but clumsy and possibly coached. He displayed attachment to Mr B. Tomi perceived Mrs B as being ambivalent towards him. One test indicated Tomi had a pre-occupation with being punished often over trivial incidents. He saw himself as being isolated within a fairly hostile environment. “Taking (other tests) into account, it would appear that Tomi feels quite insecure in this present placement. The weight of evidence suggests that this is due to an unsatisfactory, punishing relationship between himself and the Bs rather than to any fears he may have of being removed from their care.” 
      
      
     64     
     Tomi’s general intellectual abilities were diagnosed as in the average range but he displayed poor concentration and co-ordination. The report continued:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Tomi is now nearly 6 and has been in the care of the Bs for more than 5 years. The weight of psychological research demonstrates clearly that early trauma, on its own, does not lead to irreversible damage. It is only when that trauma is just the first link in a whole chain of unfortunate experiences, or when the child is subjected to some continuing pathological influence that remains throughout a large part of childhood, that more permanent effects are likely to emerge. Clearly, then, if Tomi had been receiving appropriate, quality care, his condition should have improved rather than deteriorated as it has. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … There were implications of possible sexual abuse. I believe the assessment by Arndell (apparently another departmental home) also raised this possibility. I stress that the evidence for possible sexual abuse is implicit only and does not constitute grounds for believing or assuming that it has occurred. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It appears that Tomi’s present condition is likely to have had its roots in early trauma, but that the effects of that trauma have been maintained and probably exacerbated by the care he has received since being placed with the Bs. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … Reports on file indicate that Mrs B acted in a manner contrary to that required by the therapists. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … The overwhelming need in this case is for Tomi to undergo therapy. … It is more important to maintain the relationship between Suzie and Tomi than the relationship between Tomi and the Bs. … I see no alternative in this case than to remove Tomi from his present placement.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     65     
     On 4 March 1986 the Prisoner was removed from the Bs and taken to Minali. By June 1986 he was residing at the Bernardo’s Lindfield unit for severely emotionally disturbed children. There his conduct seems to have improved although in April 1987 it was recorded that his “behaviours are still inconsistent and do not appear to follow a significantly predictable pattern” and “When Tomi first entered the unit he was very closed and hostile towards physical affection. … He will now allow people to give him a cuddle.” In that month he and his sister were then placed with another foster carer, Miss W. 
      
      
     66     
     A report of 10 June 1987 indicates that this placement seems to have then been progressing well although much work remained to be done. A note of 4 April 1987 and an undated application to the Director General of Health and Community Services for approval to continue paying a triple boarding out allowance but which bears a supporting recommendation dated 21 March 1988 says, “the two children are very difficult management problems who require intensive and continuous care which is far beyond that required for a ward in normal circumstances”. The departmental files seem to contain little by way of records in this June 1987 to February 1988 period. Minutes of a case conference on 15/3/88 seem to be missing although a note on the submission to which I have referred records that at the case conference, restoration in March/April was still the confirmed case plan. 
      
      
     67     
     The Departmental records indicate that by 1986 the Prisoner’s natural mother was leading a much more stable life and in February 1986 was coping admirably with 3 other children. Restoration to the natural mother was recommended if that was in the interests of the Prisoner and Suzie. This aim seems to have played a large part in Departmental thinking from that time onwards and on 18 March 1988 restoration occurred. This was despite the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph, despite the enormous increase in pressure 5 children rather than 3 would impose, and a case conference note on 3 March 1986 that the Prisoner’s mother appeared to be avoiding much of the responsibility which caused the Prisoner and Suzie to become wards and for the lack of contact which followed. It is however appropriate to record also that on 21 August, the District Officer observed that the mother was increasingly taking responsibility for these events. 
      
       
      
     68     
     Both children were discharged from the Minister’s guardianship in November 1988. However by March 1990, the Prisoner’s conduct had deteriorated sufficiently for him to be referred by a local doctor to the Fairfield Community Health Centre. By November the natural mother and her husband were unable to cope and in December it was recorded that the Prisoner was very emotionally disturbed, running away and placing himself in danger and sniffing turpentine or some other substance. His behaviour at school led to him being suspended. On 14 December 1990 he was again placed at Minali. 
      
      
     69     
     Another psychologist, Barbara Kennett, examined him in January 1991. She reported:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “(Tests) indicated that Tomi has a poor self image … . 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         He did not have his dependency needs met when younger and this means that he is unable to trust adults. He views the world as a rather threatening place and certainly nothing in his history has assisted in disabusing him of this fear. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Much of his behaviour is attention seeking which he learned during his first six years of life. When Tomi feels secure and is not pressured into showing emotional responses his behaviour falls within the normal range. This has been seen several times, when he was with the (W)s’ (sic) and again at Minali. However, when placed under any stress he responds with the earlier noted aberrant behaviours. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Tomi lacks the personal resources to deal with emotional pressures.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     70     
     The minutes of a departmental case conference of 11 February 1991 record that Tomi’s parents - (This probably means his mother and her husband - not the Prisoner’s father.) - were agreeable to wardship and were unable to care for him. It is also noted that the “any move for Tomi to other alternative care should be his first and last placement due to his fragile emotional state and vulnerability …” 
      
      
     71     
     On 23 April 1991 the Prisoner was again declared a ward under the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987. On 29 April he was transferred to Renwick, a departmental institution at Mittagong. While there he absconded on a number of occasions in the company of other boys, on one occasion being found at Kings Cross. In December he was informed by his step-father that he could not go home even for a visit and his natural mother refused to have him home for Christmas. In a report of 11 March 1992, Dr Moore, a psychiatrist, was to refer to this incident as one which was “following his ultimate rejection in the Christmas holiday period”. On 16 December 1991 he was involved with the theft of a bag on a beach and on 18 December he burnt his arm badly with a cigarette lighter.  
      
      
     72     
     In January 1992 the Prisoner was involved in two offences of breaking entering and stealing and one car theft. A file note records that he was angry, hurt and disappointed that, despite some promises by his mother, he could not go home - a circumstance for which he blamed his step-father. Tomi requested the phone number of his natural father who he believed could care for him. (The pathos in this request becomes apparent when it is recognised that there seems to have been no contact between the two for many years.) 
      
      
     73     
     The note records:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Cottage staff report Tomi’s behaviour continues to deteriorate and he is now openly defiant, verbally abusive and sullen when checked. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … Intense therapy is vital, but ineffective until a permanent placement is found. …Stability, security and a clear map of his future is essential to him at this point of time.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     74     
     I have referred briefly to a report of 11 March 1992 by Dr Marilyn Moore. The report bears further attention. In it Dr Moore records:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “… He was uncertain why he had come to see me and seemed indifferent about it. He showed no spontaneity or interest in anything. He replied woodenly and with little reflection, to questions. As the interview progressed he smiled occasionally. He showed no anxiety, indeed he appeared to be affectively constricted. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         He told me that nothing makes him happy or sad “I’ve been through so much that I don’t know who I feel any more.” He used to get angry with his step-father but he doesn’t now - “I don’t care any more”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … Tomi maintained he would not remember any one special from any of his placements. He does not care for any one in particular at Renwick. Concentration and attention were sustained throughout the interview. Tomi seemed to be of average intelligence. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Tomi had been severely emotionally deprived for much of his life. … His view of his mother seems ambivalent with a tendency to idealise her in her absence, tempered by the realism of being with her. Contact with her has been erratic and unpredictable so that Tomi does not trust others. I do not think that Tomi has an internal concept of a family. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Apart from his brief burst of self-destructiveness and antisocial activity following his mother’s latest unexpected rejection of him, Tomi has showed least emotional disturbance when placed in an environment where there are no emotional expectations placed on him e.g. at Minali and Renwick. His behaviour has settled again at Renwick. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Given his history, I do not believe that he would do well in a normal family setting where there would be emotional expectations of him. He would be very reluctant to trust and would be likely to display some anxious needy behaviours again, (such as pica or stealing). The possible advantage of gaining some family life needs to be weighed up against the stresses for him of such a placement which might well end in yet another rejection for him (because his needy behaviours are aberrant). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         He does not seem to be clinically depressed, rather he has an “empty” quality about him. He is likely to develop a personality disorder, possibly of an avoidant type.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     75     
     File notes of 1 and 19 June 1992 written by the department’s District Officer record that “Tomi appears to be more confused and distressed about his current situation and his mother’s refusal of contact than ever. He seems fearful of his future, which at this stage is still uncertain.” and that “Tomi’s sense of loss and grief re his family are, at times, quite overwhelming for the child, and he needs to be encouraged to vent his anger and despair. Within the last week we have been advised that Turner Cottage (where the Prisoner was living) is to close in the next few weeks and Tomi has been quite devastated by this news and insists he must stay with his house master … and the other Turner boys - ‘quite interesting for a child who lacks attachment/significant others’ (sic).” 
      
      
     76     
     Throughout 1992 up until September there were numerous instances of absconding and other significant misconduct, including stealing. On at least 2 occasions he went to his natural mother. She instigated his return and reports indicate that he was somewhat traumatised by what seemed to be double messages from her. In October Jackie Cope, a psychologist reported, inter alia, that 
      
      
       
        
         
         “In the absence of his father Tomi seems to have idealised his image of his father. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         “Tomi appears so desperate to have someone to care for him that he fantasises about attaching to a variety of Aboriginal or “Street People”. …  
         
        
        
         
         “Tomi is desperately searching for parents who will care for him.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     77     
     In December 1992, apparently at the instigation of the department, the Prisoner commenced to spend weekends with Mr W who lived in the highlands south of Sydney. On 13 January 1993 he was discharged from Renwick into Mr W’s care. Although as might be expected there were some difficulties, things seem to have gone fairly well during 1993. However a report on file dated 1 July 1994 reads:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Tomi became very aggressive. (Mr) W distressed - Tomi threw tools from roof - wants to move as sick of chooks and (mr W) - (Mr W) constantly touched Tomi - unable to detach himself emotionally - he should give Tomi space.”  
         
        
       
      
      
     78     
     Later that month the Prisoner received a letter from his mother which concluded “Lots of Love” and he absconded, though not necessarily in that order. A report of 22 July 1994 records that he had been indulging in bouts of attention seeking behaviour at intervals of approximately 3 months since his placement, that this behaviour had recently escalated and included setting fires, destruction of property, some violence and stealing. On 26 July he was involved with others in throwing rocks at glass doors and windows belonging to the St Vincent de Paul society, causing $2,000 worth of damage. On 6 August he was reported to be sniffing again. On 9 August he was asked to leave a recreation room at Minali. He declined, kicked a plate glass door, then picked up a concrete slab and threw it through another plate glass door. He was again charged. He absconded but after a few days gave himself up to police. 
      
      
     79     
     In early August 1994 Barbara Kennett prepared another psychological report. In it she records that that during the Prisoner’s second visit to Mr W in 1992, the Prisoner had asked Mr W if he would adopt him. She also records that after the period with Mr W, Tomi settled into Minali and staff reported that he was generally co-operative and pleasant though reserved. He showed little affect until a letter from his natural mother around 24 July when he became very upset and angry asking “what right has she to get to walk back into my life after ignoring me for years?”. He was still very angry on 26 July 1994 when he damaged property of the St Vincent de Paul Society, tried to set fire to some toilets and damaged two cars. Other observations made in the report were:- 
      
      
       
        
         
         “As with his previous testing Tomi related easily to the examiner on a very superficial level. However it was difficult to establish any real rapport with Tomi as his general affect is flat and passive. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “Tomi had very good attentional skills and his approach to tasks is considered and methodical. He requires no encouragement to continue when items become difficult as he is self motivated to persist. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “…. Tomi retains his fantasy of a perfect family life and still wishes to be part of that family with both a mother and a father. But as has been seen from his last foster placement, Tomi cannot handle the closeness associated with family life. … 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         “Despite Mr W’s personal efforts to provide Tomi with a safe, warm home life without emotional strings attached, by definition the expectation was there that Tomi would respond appropriately. Tomi realised he wasn’t able to respond even though he hasn’t acknowledged this fact and thus wanted the pressure removed by leaving the placement 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “… (Tomi) has made considerable personal gains over the past couple of years but he is still immature. He continues to have that “empty quality” about him that years of neglect and abuse have effected. This cannot be “made right” by emotional input from others as Tomi is unable to respect or respond appropriately. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         “As much as Tomi wants to be placed with other foster parents, this would not be in his best interests, as the anxious, needy behaviours which can display (sic) would surface as soon as he was placed under any emotional stress.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     80     
     On 29 August 1994, one may infer in consequence of one of the malicious damage incidents to which I have referred, the Prisoner was placed on probation for 9 months on condition he be of good behaviour. On 14 September he was again formally made a ward. His behaviour over the next 9 months or so seems to have deteriorated significantly. There are reports of him absconding, becoming intoxicated on drink and drugs, inhaling lighter fluid, self-mutilating and stealing cars or from them. He was picked up by Flemington Police at the home of a paedophile. He made contact with two other adults who indicated some interest in adopting or caring for him. One of these also seems to have been a paedophile. A report of 23 June 1995 records that the Prisoner said that he would like to live with his sister and his second choice was to live on the streets. One of 16 July 1995 records a chance meeting between a youth worker and the Prisoner who said he was stealing car radios and swapping them for marijuana. 
      
      
     81     
     In late August 1995, the Prisoner arrived at Mr W’s home and asked for another chance to live with him and go to school. Mr W indicated that he was happy to give the Prisoner a second chance if he was sincere. The department approved. A detailed school report of 11 October 1995 records 50 out of the 56 classifications given as satisfactory or good or excellent. However by that time there were again indications that the placement was breaking down. The Prisoner had said that he only returned to Mr W so he would not get locked up and felt Mr W’s place restrictive and did not wish to stay. Somewhat inconsistently, according to notes of 26 October 1995, the Prisoner was sleeping in Mr W’s bed again despite efforts by Mr W to get him back to his own bed. (Professor Hayes, called during the proceedings on sentence, clearly had serious reservations as to the adequacy of Mr W’s responses to the Prisoner.)  
      
      
     82     
     A file note of 22 November 1995 records that the Prisoner had been lodging of late with the deceased. The Prisoner was advised that the Marrickville Community Services Centre would facilitate the Prisoner’s placement with the deceased after the Prisoner’s 16th birthday if that remained his wish. A later note of 17 January 1996 records that “it was pointed out to Tomi the last time he was on the run and spent time with Geoff, this person who allegedly is responsible, failed to notify the Department, allowed Tomi to roam the streets day and night”. 
      
       
      
     83     
     On 22 November 1995 the Prisoner returned to Mr W’s and seems to have continued there until Anzac day in 1996. He visited the deceased in Sydney, failed to return and disappeared until 8 June when he called Mr W asking if he could return. On 11 June he arrived saying he was back to stay. However by 24 June Mr W demanded that he leave and arrangements were made for the Prisoner to stay at the department’s Bowral refuge pending completion of inquires into Mr Boyson’s fitness. 
      
       
      
     84     
     In early August 1996 the Prisoner collapsed and was taken to hospital with alcohol intoxication. On 22 August he absconded and went to Mr Boyson’s unit. He said he intended to stay there. On 1 October 1996 the Prisoner and the deceased collected the Prisoner’s belongings from Bowral. 
      
       
      
     85     
     The above summary of information contained in the departmental files is by no means comprehensive. There are, for example, reports which show the Prisoner at times having tried hard with school work, possessing good verbal and social skills, could be clear and assertive and had performed reasonably well. There were notes that his positive points were the enjoyment of gross motor skills and challenges, liked to be doing things and enjoyed positive reinforcement and praise. At times his behaviour was excellent. Other records show that he had been disruptive far more often than I have indicated. At times he was noted as aggressive although there does not seem to be any record of significant violence beyond that to which I have referred. He displayed an unusual attitude of not caring for toys or clothes. However the summary I have given is enough for present purposes. 
      
      
     86     
     Additional material is to be found in the reports of Drs Wong and Canaris. It is sufficient if I quote parts of Dr Wong’s assessment- 
      
       
        
         
         “He has marked emotional coldness, lack of empathy and shallow affect. This is an observation which has been referred to, in one way or another, by almost all the professionals who interviewed him. … At no time was I able to detect any of the warmth and empathy that I would normally expect in interactions with a fellow human being. I consider this abnormal, even after making due allowance for the fact that he is amidst his trial for murder… 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Probably as a result of his emotional callousness he had a lot of difficulties whenever emotional demands of any kind were put on him. This is another recurrent theme that emerges on reading the various reports on him… 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In summary, Tomi has gross emotional coldness, shallow affect and lack of empathy, a persistent failure to conform to social norms, a reckless disregard for the safety of others and lack of remorse. Taken together, this is indicative of gross psychiatric disturbance. … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Tomi had suffered gross neglect, both emotional and physical, in the first year of his life … While emotional deprivation and/or sexual abuse may certainly predispose to the development of personality disorders or other psychiatric abnormalities in later years, this is not invariable and a person might emerge relatively unscathed. I therefore base my diagnosis on the abnormalities he manifested around the time of the alleged offence, rather than on the presence of events which may predispose to the development of such abnormalities.” 
         
        
       
       
      
     REMORSE 
      
       
      
     87     
     I am satisfied that the Prisoner has experienced genuine and significant remorse for what he has done. The timing and terms of his second 000 phone call, combined with the fact that he then turned up at the block in which the deceased’s unit was situate some 5 minutes later seem to me to argue compellingly in this direction. His early statement to police officers that he had stabbed the deceased argues in the same direction. 
      
       
      
     88     
     In arriving at the conclusion I have, I am not unmindful that the Prisoner left a message on the deceased’s answering machine which was clearly directed to providing evidence of an alibi and told a similar story of having been on a camping trip when first questioned. I accept also that at least in part, the idea of turning himself in was put in the Prisoner’s mind by Mr Stone and that the Prisoner is reported to have said on at least one occasion that to return to Mr Boyson’s unit he must have forgotten Mr Boysen’s death. Although it is consistent with what Ms Jones wrote in her Department of Juvenile Justice report, I acknowledge that my conclusion is inconsistent with the view of Dr Wong at, for example page 445 of the transcript. 
      
       
      
     89     
     And I do not suggest that the Prisoner’s remorse is, or has always been unqualified. He has expressed a view to the effect that he eliminated a “faggot” and may well regard or have regarded the deceased as in part the author of his own misfortune. Evidence of those who have discussed with the Prisoner the events of 24 October 1996 suggest that he may not yet have mentally faced up to the full circumstances of what occurred. However the actions of the Prisoner to which I have referred in paragraph 86 speak loudly. 
      
      
     MISCONDUCT SUBSEQUENT TO ARREST 
      
       
      
     90     
     After his arrest on 26 October 1996, the Prisoner seems to have been in custody till granted bail by Bruce J on 18 November 1996. Conditions of the bail were that the Prisoner was to reside at Mark David Farm at Sutton Forest, not leave the farm except in the company of an employee of that institution, not use illegal drugs or alcohol and report to police. 
      
       
      
     91     
     On 18 August 1997, the Prisoner threw a piece of fencing wire onto power lines to arc them out. One wire broke, starting a fire. The Prisoner absconded but was found 1km up the road. 
      
       
      
     92     
     In July and again on 25 August, the Prisoner’s natural father visited him. The visits are recorded as having gone well and that on the second occasion his father quietly chastised the Prisoner for starting the fire. On 29 September his father, step-mother and 2 step siblings visited again as arranged. The Prisoner disappeared when he saw the car coming and did not return until after the family had left. 
      
       
      
     93     
     In October 1997, the Prisoner went to a fuel bowser, emptied fuel onto the ground and lit it. It would seem that because the bowser was locked, he was able to obtain only a small quantity. His co-ordinator is recorded as believing the Prisoner engaged in these actions because he was being moved to another unit for a 2 week drug & alcohol program. 
      
       
      
     94     
     Reports in January 1998 were generally favourable. One recorded that the Prisoner’s “at risk” behaviour such as fire lighting seems to have abated. 
      
       
      
     95     
     Putting aside the matters I have mentioned some of which may fall into this category, there have been two occasions when the Prisoner has breached his bail conditions. One involved a failure to report on one occasion but there is nothing to suggest that this incident is presently significant. The other was when he was allowed by a youth worker associated with Mark David Farm to be unsupervised within ready distance of a liquor outlet. The Prisoner purchased alcohol and drank a significant quantity. There is some evidence that there was another breach also involving alcohol although, in light of Father Rileys’ evidence, I remain unpersuaded of 3 breaches. 
      
       
      
     96     
     The incident mentioned was reported and the Prisoner arrested and detained at Kariong for some little time. On 20 May 1998 bail was again granted by this Court. Apart from the fact that the institution involved was to be the John Miller Farm, the conditions were, so far as is presently relevant, the same as had been imposed by Bruce J.  
      
       
      
     ANTECEDENTS 
      
       
      
     97     
     According to the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice put before me, the Prisoner had the following history of offending:-

     98     
     The only conviction recorded in the report of the Prisoner’s antecedents which was tendered is one which occurred on 27 June 1997 for an offence of breaking entering and stealing on 14 October 1996. The Prisoner was placed on 12 months probation. I infer that this is the fourth of the offences referred to in the Juvenile Justice report. The effect of s15 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act is that I should not take this offence or any of the other convictions to which I have referred into account. Given firstly the difference in nature of the offence for which the Prisoner now stands for sentence and these other matters and secondly, the general history and circumstances of the Prisoner otherwise, including his history since October 1996, I would not in any event have regarded these convictions as having any impact of present significance. 
      
      
     OTHER MATTERS 
      
       
      
     99     
     During the course of proceedings on sentence a report as required by s25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act was tendered and evidence given by one of its authors, Ms Jones. Later, the co-author, Ms Duncan gave evidence. In the report, it was said that the Prisoner’s attitude and beliefs were not characteristic of an individual who possessed anti-social beliefs to a significant degree, that he demonstrated a level of insight into his offending behaviour and was responsive to treatment and intervention; he appeared to have a high degree of impulse control in relation to anger and stress. Nevertheless, it was suggested that, if the Prisoner were not sent into custody he participate in a Violent Offenders’ Program, one Ms Jones described as a program for serious and repeat offenders. Although I do not need to, and in consequence, do not rely on the fact, the authors of the report suggested that the Court consider imposing a community based order. 
      
       
      
     100     
     On behalf of the Prisoner evidence was called from Professor Hayes, the head of the Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine at the University of Sydney, and from persons associated with Youth off the Streets Inc, the organisation which conducts the homes at which the Prisoner has been residing since his arrest. Though there were some minor differences, I accept generally what these witnesses have said. 
      
       
      
     101     
     Professor Hayes observed that the Prisoner’s presentation was in marked contrast to how his appearance as recorded by Drs Canaris and Wong and that he smiled and laughed and made eye contact appropriately through his interview with her and appeared enthusiastic when he spoke of his present and future life. Professor Hayes also said that the Prisoner’s profile on a Personality Assessment Inventory test indicated that he was not suffering from any psychiatric symptoms, albeit she added that there were grounds for thinking that the Prisoner was dealing with past traumas by a process of denial. 
      
       
      
     102     
     Some of these matters made me wonder whether the Prisoner had been putting on an act for the benefit of Drs Wong and Canaris and indeed during the course of the trial when the Prisoner had sat for almost all of its 12 or so days with head bowed looking at the floor and exhibited little, if any, emotion. The view that the Prisoner was not suffering from any psychiatric symptoms also provides ground for wondering about the accuracy of the opinion of the doctors that at the time of Mr Boyson’s death, the Prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind. 
      
       
      
     103     
     Although it was tendered after counsel had made their submissions on the issue of diminished responsibility, Professor Hayes’ report and her evidence are matters I have taken into account on that issue. However at the end of the day I reached the conclusion expressed above. The Prisoner’s affect of which Drs Canaris and Wong spoke was noted sufficiently often in the past by authors of documents in the DOCS file that I do infer it was genuine and one must recognise that there have been changes in the Prisoner’s circumstances over time. Professor Hayes observed that from what the Prisoner had said, his time with Youth off the Streets has been the most stable and happy environment that he has ever been in throughout his entire life and he is learning to trust people. Other evidence, some of which I refer to below, shows that he has participated in programs calculated to overcome a number of his problems and that there have been significant changes in him since he was taken in by that organisation. One must recognise that of the 2¾ years the Prisoner has been with YOTS prior to his interview with Professor Hayes, 2½ years occurred prior to his interviews with Drs Canaris and Wong although neither must one forget that, although he still faced the prospect of going to jail at the time of seeing Professor Hayes, he had by then been acquitted of murder. 
      
       
      
     104     
     Furthermore, in the period between seeing the doctors and Professor Hayes, the Prisoner had also been interviewed on 5 occasions for a total of some 9 hours by Ms Jones, who noted that the Prisoner had become noticeably more relaxed and talkative and made more eye contact as time progressed, and had been intensively counselled by a Dr Brentrow for periods totalling some 23½ hours over some 4 or 5 days. One hesitates to conclude that after a lifetime of experiences such as the Prisoner had had, counselling over but a few days could make much difference but in this case the evidence of Father Riley suggests it did.  
      
       
      
     105     
     Although the topic is of more significance later, it may be appropriate to divert and say something about YOTS and Father Riley. YOTS operates a number of residential premises ranging from highly structured environments to independent houses. These residential premises include farms such as those where the Prisoner resided pending trial. It has about 110 beds for residential placements. The farms incorporate or have access to a school run by the organisation and which is accredited and educates persons within the organisation’s care up to the Higher School Certificate standard.  
      
       
      
     106     
     YOTS also operates on the streets of, and has crisis centres in, inner Sydney. It operates drug and alcohol programmes. In Father Riley’s words, given in the course of an application for bail, but to which the parties agreed I could have regard :- 
      
       
        
         
         Its “profile would be we would take kids who no one else will be involved with, who are basically on the streets, or kids who are in custody for welfare issues, or kids in custody who have no other options for them, so, in terms of maybe eligible for bail but there is no one there to take them out. So we are involved with the chronically homeless or hard core street kids.” 
         
        
       
      
     107     
     At least in part it tries to model itself on a family, and its approach is “getting close to kids”. Though it has a cut-off (entrance) age of 18, the organisation only moves people out when they are ready or breach some of the rules, e.g. fail a urinalysis. It remains involved with, at least some, persons who have left its programmes or who are in independent living. 
      
       
      
     108     
     Father Riley is the Director and Chief Executive Officer of YOTS. He is a qualified teacher, is a Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Arts majoring in sociology, and has Diplomas in Psychology, Abuse Counselling, Residential Care and Teaching. He said that he has not previously been involved in the supervision of persons subject to recognisances but it is clear that he has been involved with persons on bail. He said, and I accept, that it is his invariable rule to report persons released into his care who breach their bail conditions and I have no doubt that Father Riley would, as he said, report the Prisoner if the latter breached the terms of any recognisance to which he was subject. 
      
       
      
     109     
     Among the programmes employed by YOTS is one referred to as Positive Peer Culture, a programme designed to induce young people to address and help each other with issues that concern them and to identify strengths they have and can use in that regard. A leading proponent and perhaps developer of this program is Dr Brentrow who comes from the United States. He has been an adviser to YOTS for some 2 years and during the period the Prisoner was on bail awaiting sentence was in Australia giving in-service training to YOTS staff. Father Riley induced Dr Brentrow to consult with the Prisoner. 
      
       
      
     110     
     During an application for bail on 8 June 1999 following the Prisoner’s conviction, Father Riley said that the Prisoner had significant problems in the Positive Peer Culture program and that, while there has been some improvement, he still had difficulty in articulating his emotions. It was subsequent to this that the counselling with Dr Brentrow occurred. According to Father Riley’s evidence on 13 August, during the last consultation “we were dealing with a very different type of person that was portrayed in (the) court room” and that the Prisoner had changed dramatically. Father Riley did not suggest, and nor do I, that all of the Prisoner’s emotional or behavioural or lifestyle problems were behind him. As did others, Father Riley said that the Prisoner still needed a supported and structured environment. However the matters to which I have referred are enough to persuade me that Dr Hayes’ assessment of the Prisoner does not invalidate what Drs Wong and Canaris had said bearing on the topic of diminished responsibility at the time of Mr Boyson’s death. It may be noted that Professor Hayes was of the view that the Prisoner had not been “putting it on” for Drs Canaris and Wong. 
      
       
      
     111     
     Other matters relevant to the sentence to be imposed include the following. The Prisoner has been assessed as of average intellectual ability although Mr Sims, one of his teachers, describes the Prisoner as above average. Since he has been at YOTS he has applied himself to study and achieved his school certificate. He is studying for his Higher School Certificate this year. His school reports consistently describe his behaviour as very good and his class activity as good or very good. He commenced an entry course at Wollongong University in 1998 although he withdrew due to the workload and his perception that there were too many drugs readily available there. The Prisoner has identified careers in which he is interested. 
      
       
      
     112     
     The Prisoner has participated in drug and alcohol counselling. Father Riley said that the Prisoner had not reacted angrily or violently while at YOTS although Mr Sims refers to one incident of what he described as legitimate anger. Father Riley said that the Prisoner had developed greatly over the 2½ years with YOTS and while he had particularly major issues to deal with emotionally, there was significant hope for rehabilitation and indeed the Prisoner had come a long way already in that respect. Father Riley said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “We have had other kids with very serious charges in our programs who have not held together nearly as effectively as Tomi has and that, from my point of view, is a real credit; that he is able to deal with the incredible stress and pressure that he has had to deal with in such a mature way. I know it has been hard for him.” 
         
        
       
      
     113     
     Father Riley gave some further evidence on this topic at T89 on 13 August 1999 which it is unnecessary to repeat but which I found impressive, as indeed I found him. 
      
       
      
     114     
     Professor Hayes opined:- 
      
       
        
         
         “He continues to be, I think, a very traumatised young man and I think that he is probably denying, to some extent, his own distress and problems, but I’m not sure that they can be addressed at the moment until there has been a settling and trust-creating process, and I don’t think, also, that those disturbances would necessarily result in violent behaviour in the future.” 
         
        
       
      
     115     
     Professor Hayes also said that all the factors which would predict violence in the future are in favour of the likelihood that there will be no violent incidents in the future. 
      
       
      
     116     
     Another factor which argues against a custodial sentence is the evidence which has been given as to the undesirable features of detention centres. 
      
       
      
     117     
     Professor Hayes gave evidence that the environment of the Juvenile Justice Detention Centres of Kariong and Minda was violent in the sense that in-mates tended to prey on one another, that at Kariong (and I would infer at other detention centres also) there was a “tough environment pecking order, where the crime and what has been committed is often the topic of conversation.” She said drugs were available in both institutions and the opportunity to engage in therapeutic programs is much more limited than in the environment where the Prisoner has been pending trial.  
      
       
      
     118     
     On the occasion when the Prisoner sought bail pending the sentencing hearing, I asked Father Riley whether he saw any likelihood of damage if between then and sentence the Prisoner was kept in a detention centre. Father Riley answered firmly in the affirmative. Inter alia he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I do get kids out of these detention centres time and time again, fixing up what happens to them in those facilities is major and the ones that have been institutionalised - and I can think of two in the last week - for periods of even 18 months in a juvenile detention centre - the damage that has happened to them and the hardness - I wonder, with these two I have got last week, whether I still have hope with them. They are 17. They are so institutionalised I do not know if we can break through that. 
         
        
        
         
         Tomi is not institutionalised at this point, I don’t believe.”  
         
        
       
      
      
     THE PRINCIPLES 
      
       
      
     119     
     The approach and the considerations which a Court must take into account in a case such as this are well know. The appropriate starting point is the recognition that the offence has involved the felonious taking of a human life -  
     R v Blacklidge 
      (unreported, CCA, 12 December 1995) - a matter of the utmost seriousness. The subjective features of an offender must not be allowed undue weight -  
     R v Geddes 
      (1936) SR (NSW) 554 at 556. In that regard I should acknowledge that I am conscious that, in these Reasons, attention to those subjective circumstances has occupied far more space than the objective circumstances of the offence. That is largely a reflection of the fact that the circumstances of the offence are essentially simple while the subjective circumstances cover the full period of the Prisoner’s life. It is not an indication of an inadequate recognition of what happened to Mr Boyson. 
      
       
      
     120     
     On the other hand, the circumstances of both offences of manslaughter and offenders convicted of that charge vary enormously, and this Court has recognised that not in all cases is a custodial sentence required. Examples of cases of manslaughter where custodial sentences have not been imposed include  
     R v Thiel  
     (unreported, Finlay J, 27 September 1990), R 
      v Gardner  
     (unreported, Wood J, 27 March 1992,  
     R v Gilham 
      (unreported, Abadee J, 7 April 1995),  
     R v Platts  
     (unreported, Newman J, 7 June 1996), and  
     R v Kennedy  
     (unreported, Greg James J, 30 June 1998). Nevertheless, it must be recognised that the circumstances of those cases might fairly be described as exceptional or extreme. 
      
       
      
     121     
     In my view, the same may be said of the circumstances of this case. In that regard, I do not find it necessary to rely on the factors of diminished responsibility and provocation, although I do regard both of those factors as arguing with significant weight for a sentence towards the lower end of the range. The provocation, as I have said, was very high and a case where the offender was suffering from an abnormality of mind is not one where the element of deterrence has the same weight as in other circumstances -  
     R v Scognamiglio 
      (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 85-6,  
     R v Bus and AS 
      (unreported, CCA, 3 November 1995). 
      
       
      
     122     
     Furthermore allowance must be made for the offender’s youth.  
     R v GDP 
      (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 and the prospects of rehabilitation which, for reasons indicated below, are attendant upon a non-custodial sentence. The circumstances of the offence in this case are not ones where the considerations of youth may or should, be or be almost, disregarded - c.f.  
     R v Gordon 
      (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 469,  
     R v MacIntyre  
     (1988) 38 A Crim R 130 at 139. However, in light of the matters to which I am about to refer, I do not need to consider whether, in their absence, a custodial sentence would have been required. 
      
       
      
     123     
     What makes this case one which may fairly be described as exceptional or extreme is the Prisoner’s upbringing. It may be summarised as follows. 
      
       
      
     124     
     Developmentally delayed in his first year of life due to the lack of care by his alcoholic mother he was removed from her. Exhibiting “gross behavioural, emotional, educational and cognitive problems” by the time he was nearly 6 - caused or contributed to by inadequacies in the persons with whom he was fostered - he was removed from them. After 2 years in Bernardos and in another foster care, both of which placements seem to have progressed well in the circumstances - he and his sister were again moved - back to his mother. Although by then she had apparently overcome her alcoholism, given that history and the “very difficult management problems” which the Prisoner and his sister were, not surprisingly his mother could not cope and in December 1990 he was once again removed. 
      
       
      
     125     
     Nearly 11, and diagnosed as unable to trust adults, viewing the world as a rather threatening place and lacking the personal resources to deal with emotional pressures, there cannot have been much, if any, time since he was born that he had the benefit of love, self esteem, or self-confidence. Institutionalised during 1991 he was rejected again by his mother at Christmas time of that year. His subsequent placement with Mr W may have been of a steadying nature, but a consideration of what happened after December 1991 leads to the conclusion that the die was cast. Certainly, the Prisoner’s history reminds one of the maxim, attributed to the Jesuits, to the effect, “Give me a child till the age of seven, and I will give you the man”. 
      
       
      
     126     
     Although the Prisoner’s past does not entitle him to ignore or disobey the laws essential to the operation of a civilised society, his upbringing was so different from the norm that it seems to me it would be wrong simply to judge his actions by the standards one would apply to a person who had enjoyed a normal, loving and reasonably emotionally stable upbringing. In my view the circumstances of the case are such that, notwithstanding the Prisoner’s offence was manslaughter, (and alcohol a possibly drugs were involved) a custodial sentence should not be imposed. 
      
       
      
     127     
     In reaching this conclusion I have not ignored the possibility that the Prisoner’s past may render him more likely than others to again indulge in anti-social and criminal behaviour. However, on this topic, the Prisoner has the advantage of the good reports as to his behaviour while he has been with YOTS and the favourable opinion of Professor Hayes which I accept. Furthermore, the course I propose to adopt is calculated to provide the Prisoner with continued guidance and instruction for some time to come. It is also unlikely that the strain which the Prisoner must have experienced in awaiting for some 2½ years his trial for murder will not have had a salutary effect on him. 
      
       
      
     128     
     I have not found it necessary to take into account the conditions described as operating at the detention centres to which I have referred, beyond recognising that such centres could not provide the environment for rehabilitation which I am satisfied exists with Youth of the Streets. At the same time I cannot but record my dismay that, despite the clear advantage to the community of rehabilitation of young offenders, the Courts of this State are required to send such persons to institutions which the evidence in this case (and in other cases I have heard) shows, are likely to make such young offenders worse. That such institutions cannot be kept drug free or virtually so, is a damning indictment of those responsible for their administration. 
      
       
      
     129     
     Having, on 13 August 1999, arrived at the conclusion that I should not impose a custodial sentence, I sought further assistance from the Crown, the Department of Juvenile Justice and Father Riley as to the course which should be followed. While not resiling from his primary submission that a custodial sentence was required, the learned Crown Prosecutor did not contend that a properly structured recognisance under Section 558 of the Crimes Act was not the next most appropriate course. He did, however, submit that the conditions of any such recognisance should refer to and involve the Prisoner’s supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice rather than, as I had suggested, Father Riley. 
      
       
      
     130     
     In that regard he pointed out that the Department was constituted by Parliament for the very purpose and represented a permanent institution with officers dedicated to, and likely to be experienced in, the tasks. He pointed out that by contrast YOTS was but a voluntary organisation and Father Riley had not undertaken such a role before. 
      
       
      
     131     
     Although I do not judge the Department of Juvenile Justice or its present or future staff by the Department of Community Services or those officers within it who have had responsibility prior to this for the Prisoner, the performance by the Department of Community Services in looking after the Prisoner’s interests is sufficient to greatly weaken, if not remove, any presumption that a Department of State is better than a voluntary organisation. Although it is not my primary function to sit in judgment upon the Department of Community Services, it is I think not inappropriate to record that that Department’s performance so far as the Prisoner is concerned seems to me to have been appalling. Having taken control of the Prisoner, for 5 years after he was first made a ward the Department failed to ensure that he and his sister were being properly looked after and not emotionally abused. Then, to return the Prisoner and his sister to his natural mother, when she presumably still had the emotional or physiological inadequacies which had led her to becoming an alcoholic in the first place, at a time when the children were still regarded as “very difficult management problems who require intensive and continuous care which is far beyond that required for a ward in normal circumstances” is impossible to understand given the risks which yet a further rejection would involve. Despite some 16 assessments of the Prisoner by psychologists and psychiatrists between 1982 and 1996 and a file of paper some 13 cm thick, the Department never overcame the problems to which they had contributed. Although the circumstances have been different it is appropriate to observe that Father Riley and his organisation has achieved more in 2½ years than the Department did in 15. 
      
       
      
     132     
     Furthermore, although the Department of Juvenile Justice may be permanent, its employees are not. Amanda Jones, the officer who interviewed the Prisoner for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings had left the Department before those proceedings were concluded. She had been with the Department but 2½ years and her co-signatory, Ms Duncan, 5½ years. Both were young and although the likelihood is that some other person would supervise the Prisoner if the Department was the supervising body, these facts demonstrate that such a person may not have anywhere near the experience and expertise one may infer Father Riley has. And there is some evidence to suggest that the Department has, by no means, adequate resources. Although Ms Duncan said that there was a Juvenile Justice officer in Bowral who could travel quite regularly to monitor the Prisoner’s progress, Father Riley’s evidence, which I accept, was that when the Prisoner was required to be interviewed for the purposes of placing the Juvenile Justice report before me, the Department’s resources were not such as enable its officer even to travel to the Prisoner. YOTS had to transport the Prisoner 4 times to the Department. Of some relevance also is that, according to Amanda Jones’ report, the Prisoner did not respond well to supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice in 1995 and, although the period of his absence is unknown to me, the Department did not know of his whereabouts. 
      
       
      
     133     
     In any event, I am satisfied that the supervision of the Prisoner by Father Riley or other officers of his organisation is likely to be at least as thorough, and for some years substantially more constant, than supervision by the Department. I am also satisfied that the rehabilitation available to the Prisoner at or through YOTS is at least the equal of that which the Department can provide. I do not regard participation in a specific Violent Offender’s Program as required. Given what YOTS has achieved it, or more specifically Father Riley, should continue to supervise the Prisoner. 
      
       
      
     134     
     The Crown prosecutor also submitted that any recognisance should be for a period of 5 years. In light of the fact that the Prisoner has already been subject to significant restrictions on his liberty for over 2½ years now, I do not regard so long a period as required. I propose to limit the period of the recognisance to 4 years. The other provisions of the recognisance were not the subject of contention. As imposed on 15 September 1999, it was in the following terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “(K) for the offence of manslaughter, of which you have been convicted, I defer passing sentence and order your release upon your entering into a recognisance, without surety, in the amount of $500, for a period of four years, such recognisance to include the following conditions:- 
         
        
        
         
         1. that you be of good behaviour; 
         
        
        
         
         2. that you not partake of illegal drugs; 
         
        
        
         
         3. that you not partake of alcohol for a period of twelve months. 
         
        
        
         
         4. that you reside only at such places as may be approved of by Father Riley or other the Director for the time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc; 
         
        
        
         
         5. that you participate in such educational, vocational, drug and alcohol, and other programs as may be directed by Father Riley or other the Director for the time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc; 
         
        
        
         
         6. that you undertake such employment and only such employment as may be approved of by Father Riley or other the dire tor for the time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc; 
         
        
        
         
         7. that you obey all reasonable directions of Father Riley or other the Director for the time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc, including directions concerning the ingestion of alcohol at the expiration of the twelve months referred to in condition 3.”

     REGINA v William Vincenzo FAVERO 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   SULLY J:: Before the Court is an application brought pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act by Mr William Vincenzo Favero as applicant. 
    2   The point of the application, put simply, is to obtain for Mr Favero leave to withdraw two pleas of guilty that he has entered in the District Court. 
    3   The material facts can be stated shortly and as follows: on 31 March 1998 the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Police officers attended the scene of the accident and conducted the normal enquiries. The enquiries disclosed that the applicant was in possession of a significant quantity of amphetamine. 
    4   In an item which has been described as a ""bum bag"" he had a small amount of amphetamine in the order of some half dozen or so grams. A search of the boot of the vehicle which the applicant had been driving disclosed a canvas sporting-type bag within which were a number of containers each of which held a quantity of what proved upon analysis to be amphetamine, the total quantity thus found in the applicant's possession being, broadly speaking, in the order of some six kilograms. 
    5   The applicant was invited to account for his possession of that material. So far as concerns the material in the bum bag, he asserted that it was for his own use and for no other purpose. So far as concerns the very large quantity of the material in the boot of the car, the applicant gave to the police, eventually, a rather rambling explanation which involved the proposition that he had been maintaining custody of the material on behalf of somebody else unidentified except by the rather indistinct description of ""Sam"" who was said to come from Lebanon. 
    6   The thrust of what the applicant said eventually to the police was to the effect that he had been apprehensive that if he left the large quantity of amphetamine in his premises unattended somebody might steal it, thus causing him to have not inconsiderable difficulties with ""Sam"" from Lebanon. And so, it was said by the applicant, he had loaded the material into his motor vehicle in order to ensure that he could keep his eye on it constantly until such time as he could hand it over to ""Sam"" from Lebanon. Quite where, when and in what particular circumstances that transaction was to come to fruition, various accounts given by the applicant as events developed never quite explained. 
    7   In due course the applicant was charged with two contraventions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Put very simply, he was charged upon both such matters with a supply of a prohibited drug. In due course he was committed for trial on what is conventionally prescribed as a paper committal; and in due course he appeared in the District Court, and before Karpin DCJ, represented by Mr Thomas of counsel. 
    8   In what appears to have been a fairly abbreviated, not to say peremptory, proceeding pleas were taken from the applicant; and by his then counsel he pleaded guilty to both charges. Subsequently his legal representation changed, and he received advice, the thrust of which was that on the known facts there were at least arguable defences available to him in respect of both of the charges upon which he had been committed for sentence following his pleas of guilty. 
    9   Fortified by that advice, the applicant moved in the District Court, and before Nield DCJ, for leave, in effect, to vacate his pleas of guilty and to have his matters remitted for trial before a Judge and jury in the District Court. In a judgment delivered on 1 March last Nield DCJ refused those applications. 
    10   The reasons published by his Honour are lengthy and detailed. They make various findings of fact of which it is sufficient for present purposes to say that in my opinion they were findings entirely open to his Honour upon the evidence before him. 
    11   Many of the practical problems with which his Honour had to grapple in connection with the application before him, and indeed the matter with which this Court has thus far had to grapple in connection with the present application, arise by reason of the nature of the representation available to the applicant at the time he entered his pleas of guilty before Karpin DCJ.  
    12   In that connection Nield DCJ made these observations in a context in which his Honour had indicated a disposition to accept certain evidence given by Mr Thomas, the applicant's counsel, at the time his pleas were entered. 
     
      
       
       ""However, although I accept Mr Thomas' evidence I do not approve of his conferring with the applicant without a witness being present or of his failing to obtain written confirmation of instructions given to him by the applicant. As I said during submissions this case is a glaring example of why a barrister should not accept instructions directly from a client notwithstanding what the Bar Association rules provide but why a barrister should not confer with a client without an instructing solicitor or the solicitor's clerk being present and why a barrister should obtain written confirmation of a client's instructions before putting the instructions into effect."" 
       
      
    13   There was a time when best professional practice would have been understood instinctively by those engaged in the profession of the law to proscribe the kind of direct dealing between the barrister and his client which is so significant a feature by the relevant course of events in the present case. 
    14   The changes that have been made to that long-standing, well-tried, and tested, definition of professional practice cannot of course be ignored. They have professional, and to some extent legislative, sanction. I think the Court would be lacking in the proper performance of its own duty if it did not say, and say plainly, that those departures from prior practice are a sorry interference with proper standards of professional practice, and ought to receive absolutely no encouragement from any Court. For myself, I agree entirely with the substance of the strictures forming part of Nield DCJ's judgment and which I have earlier quoted. 
    15   One result of that course of professional representation of the present applicant is that a state of affairs has resulted of which, as it seems to me, it cannot be gainsaid that, whatever took place in detail in the exchanges held between the applicant and his then counsel, the applicant had not had any, or any competent, advice that laid out before him, in a way that permitted the taking of proper relevant instructions, the nature and scope of the defences that might be lawfully available to him in connection with charges of the kind that had been preferred against him. 
    16   What has resulted in the present case seems to be the kind of situation with which this Court had to deal in the matter of Todd Ronald Ganderton, unreported CCA, 17 September 1998. In that matter the majority opinion of the Court, - and in a context substantially the same as that with which the Court is now dealing, - saw as being particularly significant the absence of advice about defences lawfully available. The majority opinion referred to and followed principles enunciated by the Court in Davies, CCA unreported, 16 December 1993. In particular the Court in Ganderton adopted the following statement taken from the judgment in Davies: 
     
      
       
       ""If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial."" 
       
      
    17   In developing that principle in its application to the given facts of Ganderton the majority opinion has these further observations to make: 
     
      
       
       ""Belief by the accused that he is guilty of the offence charged may arise from a mistaken or possibly mistaken understanding of the facts, as in  
       Davies 
       . It may also arise from a failure on the part of the accused's legal representative to inform the accused accurately of the elements of the offence, so that the accused incorrectly believes that the facts as alleged and admitted constitute the offence charged.  
       Liberti 
        ... was such a case. 
       
      
      
       
       It makes no difference in principle that the omission of the legal representative was - as in the present case - to inform the accused of the existence of a possible defence in the strict sense of a defence which the accused has to establish. 
        
        
       If it had been appreciated that the appellant had or might have a defence under s 52A(8), (this being the relevant source of what was alleged in  
       Ganderton 
        to be an arguable defence available to the applicant in that case), a report from an expert would have been obtained and the charge would have been defended. The appellant would have had an arguable case for acquittal. 
       
      
      
       
       There was, in these circumstances, no 'genuine consciousness of guilt' when the appellant pleaded guilty to the charges, and there was an 'issuable question of guilt' to be tried. There was, accordingly, a miscarriage of justice, and there must be a new trial."" 
       
      
    18   That expression of opinion concluded with an averment by the majority of the Court that the reasoning thus exposed, and the conclusion thus reached, had observed what their Honours described as ""caution bordering on circumspection"" of the kind appropriate in such a case; and, of course, it clearly is appropriate. 
    19   I have sought to keep in mind in connection with the present application, somewhat different as it is of course on its own particular facts, the need to observe precisely caution bordering on circumspection in reaching the conclusion that I have reached. I must say frankly that I reached it without any satisfaction at all, in that it seems to me to be ridiculous that a person who is found in open possession of six kilograms of prohibited drugs can in effect meet that situation, straightforward as it is, by a series of forensic stratagems that lead to the kind of situation with which this Court is now called upon to deal. 
    20   However, that is a view which I hold because of the imperative need, as I see it, for the Court of Criminal Appeal, and indeed all Courts, never to give encouragement to the development and expansion of what an English Judge, in admittedly a different situation, many years ago described as ""veils of ingenious suggestion"". 
    21   Be that as it may, the applicant is entitled to have his present application dealt with strictly according to law. Approached in that way, and however reluctant one might be to endorse the conclusion to which a proper application of the law leads, I think that a proper application of the law leads to the necessary success of the present application. 
    22   I propose the following orders: 
     
     1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
      
     2. That orders made by Nield DCJ on 1 March 1999 refusing leave to withdraw the applicant's pleas of guilty and dismissing his notice of motion seeking such leave be vacated. 
      
     3. Leave be granted to the applicant to withdraw his pleas of guilty entered on 22 May 1998 in the District Court. 
      
     4. That the matter be remitted to the District Court of New South Wales for trial according to law. 
      
    23   HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Sully J for the reasons which his Honour has given. 
    24   GREG JAMES J: I too agree with the orders proposed and what has fallen from the judge presiding. The test adopted by the learned trial judge for the purpose of ascertaining whether it was proper that he might exercise his discretion to permit the applicant to withdraw his plea was expressed by him as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""I am satisfied that he knew of the facts alleged against him by the Crown before he entered his guilty pleas and his guilty pleas were entered intentionally and deliberately."" 
       
      
    25   That test does not precisely accord with the test enunciated in Davies, CCA unreported 16.12.93, Ganderton, CCA unreported 17.9.98 and Liberti, (1991) 55 A Crim R 125. 
    26   In Liberti Kirby P referred to the circumspection with which an appellate court would approach an application to withdraw a plea of guilty or to go behind it. I have had regard to that circumspection when considering this application. 
    27   His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""An accused person will not always know the legal consequences of the facts to which he pleads guilty. He or she is normally entitled, where represented, to look to the lawyers to explain those facts for their legal significance."" 
       
      
    28   In this matter I am of the view on his Honour's findings that this court could have no confidence that such has occurred and indeed in relation to the defences one could have every confidence it did not so occur. 
    29   His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       ""Ultimately the accused is entitled to look to the court before which he or she comes to offer protection from a conviction which is not in law sustained by the facts."" 
       
      
    30   That court can only perform that role when it is in its fact-finding mode. In those circumstances in my view this court should step in and return the applicant to a court of trial which can find the facts appropriately. I agree with the orders proposed.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 60592/97 MASON P JAMES J DAVID KIRBY J Wednesday 20 October 1999 REGINA v RICKY JAMES WHITE JUDGMENT 
    1    MASON P: The appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Naughton and a jury at Newcastle on three counts in respect of a complainant KLD. Count 1 was aggravated indecent assault (s 61E(1A) of the Crimes Act). Counts 2 and 3 were aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between ten and fifteen years by a person in authority (s 66C(2)). The appellant pleaded not guilty. 
    2     The Crown called five witnesses including the complainant. The complainant's evidence as to the matters charged was clear and, if accepted by the jury, certainly established the offences charged. The complainant and the other witnesses were cross-examined by counsel for the appellant. 
    3     After a retirement of about thirty-five minutes the jury convicted the appellant on all three counts. 
    4     When called up for sentence on 31 October 1997 the appellant asked the trial judge to take into account three other matters concerning another complainant in respect of whom the appellant had been charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault. 
    5     The appellant was sentenced as follows: 
     
     Count 1: A fixed term of penal servitude for one year commencing on 27 October 1997 and expiring on 26 October 1998. 
      
     Count 2: A fixed term of penal servitude for two years commencing on 27 October 1997 and expiring on 26 October 1999. 
      
     Count 3: (which took into account the Form 1 matters) a minimum term of penal servitude for five years commencing on 27 October 1997 and expiring on 26 October 2002 with an additional term of three years commencing on 27 October 2002 and expiring on 26 October 2005. 
      
    6     The facts relevant to the three counts may be summarised as follows.7     Count 1: The complainant was a friend of the appellant's daughter or stepdaughter, AR. She used to stay overnight in AR's home. On about 8 January 1998 the youngest daughter of the appellant was in hospital. Her mother, the appellant's de facto wife, stayed in the hospital for a period to be with the sick child. At that time the appellant was living with his de facto wife and the children. The complainant, then aged eleven, stayed overnight with them on one of the nights during that period. Accordingly, it is clear that the appellant had the care and control of the complainant and the younger child, AR, who was about two years younger than the complainant. 
    8     While the complainant was in bed the appellant entered the room. The complainant saw him but pretended to be asleep. The appellant crouched down beside the bed and rubbed on her vagina over the top of her pants. He then wet his fingers with saliva, placed them inside her pants and again rubbed on her vagina. He then took his hand out and played with the complainant's nipples. Then he left the room. 
    9     The facts relevant to counts 2 and 3 were that on a night prior to 17 March 1991 AR's mother was not at home. Once again, the appellant had the care and control of AR and the complainant who stayed overnight at the home. 
    10    The appellant persuaded AR and the complainant to take off their nighties and when both were clad only in panties engaged them in a game of strip poker. By the time both young girls were naked, the appellant persuaded them to position themselves with their knees against their chests. He inserted a finger into the vagina of the complainant. The situation progressed. The appellant took off his own clothes and persuaded the complainant to lie down on top of him so that there was sexual contact. Then the appellant separated the two girls into different rooms and he entered the room where the complainant was and had penile sexual intercourse with her. This act caused severe physical pain. The complainant cried and told him to stop. He did so, but not immediately. 
    11    The complainant then went to bed. She woke up the next morning to discover the appellant was behind her on the bed with his penis pushed against her vagina. Her own pants, which she had earlier found to have blood on them from injury caused by the penetration the previous evening, had been removed, presumably by the appellant, and she was wearing different panties. 
    12    She was later told by the appellant that if ever she told her mother or her mother's boyfriend what had happened then terrible things would happen to them.  
    13    Those are, in broad essence, the facts which the Crown sought to establish and which the jury must be taken to have accepted in convicting the appellant. 
    14    As I have indicated, the principal witness in the Crown case was the complainant. The appellant's daughter AR was, on the evidence, a clear witness and a person herself involved as a victim in an offence upon her. She did not give evidence at the trial. What was established was that a subpoena had been issued to her and that her reaction to the requirement to come to give evidence was so extreme, including threatened suicide, that real concern was felt by her mother about her well-being should the subpoena be pressed. She was taken to a medical practitioner who, although not a treating doctor, nevertheless interviewed the girl and expressed the opinion on oath, to which she was tested, that the girl was not in a fit condition to give evidence. There was corroboration about this from the daughter's mother who, by that stage, was the prior de facto wife of the appellant. 
    15    The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. He has represented himself in the appeal. 
    16    He provided a letter to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal outlining his arguments in very summary form. 
    17    On 17 May 1999 the appellant appeared before a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal. He sought and was granted an adjournment to give him the opportunity to prepare and file more detailed written submissions. No such submissions were filed. The appellant, however, put his arguments to us orally. It is clear that he did not find it easy to put his submissions but. Nevertheless, he was able to cover the matters he wanted to put with the aid of notes that he had. 
    18    The appeal against conviction clearly raised three broad grounds. First, it was submitted that there were contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence of the Crown witnesses, especially the complainant. We were taken to pages in the transcript that were relied upon. Some of the conflicts or so-called conflicts were differences between the testimony of two different witnesses. A few were said to be contradictions within the total evidence of the same witness. Some, and indeed a significant number of the matters to which our attention was taken - and the detail will appear in the transcript - were not, when properly considered, true discrepancies in that, to give an example: one witness said X and the other witness said, ""I can't remember whether X was the case"". 
    19    As to one or two of the inconsistencies which the appellant sought to rely upon in this Court, the basis of the argument really was a statement the appellant made in this Court.  
    20    All of the matters relied upon by the appellant were matters peripheral to the principal issue. All were explored or, at the very least, open to be explored at the trial. Indeed, many of the matters to which attention was drawn were matters that were brought out in the cross-examination that occurred at the trial. 
    21    None of the so-called contradictions were of any real cogency. As I have indicated, they all were matters peripheral to the real issue and none of them really in any significant way affected the credibility of the witnesses involved.  
    22    In my view, the jury were entitled to form their own view as to the credibility of the Crown witnesses. In the jury accepting the Crown case, notwithstanding the matters to which the appellant took this Court, many of which I am sure would have been addressed upon at trial, there was no miscarriage.  
    23    The second broad attack was the submission that the trial judge should have disqualified himself for bias or the appearance of bias. There was an application, indeed there were two from recollection, at trial by counsel for the appellant. His Honour addressed them in terms and gave his reasons for declining to accede to the applications. 
    24    We have not been taken to any material in the record which suggests any factual basis for the submission. I have read the appeal book in its entirety and I am not aware of any material which would establish grounds for this complaint. 
    25    It is true, because his Honour refers to it himself, that at one stage the trial judge described a submission of counsel for the appellant at trial as ""nit picking"". That criticism has been advanced many, many times to many, many people, probably everybody in this court who has appeared as counsel at some stage in their life. It does not generally, nor in a particular context, represent a basis for perceived bias. 
    26    The third matter relied upon concerned the circumstances in which the non-attendance of the appellant's daughter or stepdaughter AR was established in the evidence. As I have indicated, a general practitioner was called and cross-examined. She had seen the girl once, but at a time when there had been an extreme reaction to the subpoena requiring her attendance at the particular trial. She gave the basis of her opinion and was cross-examined on it. 
    27    Notwithstanding what the appellant has put to us today, it was clearly in my view a matter about which the doctor was entitled to give evidence and the jury were entitled to form their own assessment of it. 
    28    There were directions given as to the way in which the jury should address the issue concerning the absence as a witness, whether for the Crown or the defence, of the young girl AR and I see no error in the way the jury were instructed about that matter. 
    29    In the written submission it was suggested that the DPP - and by that I take it the reference is to counsel for the Crown at trial - had in effect put an argument to the jury leading the jury to believe that AR was suicidal ""because of me"". The way the evidence was given shows that considerable care was taken not to suggest directly the cause of AR's concern beyond the concern about having to come and give evidence about matters which would clearly have been distressing to any person and clearly, for whatever reason, were extremely distressing to AR. 
    30    I see no error or miscarriage in the way the evidence was given or the directions given relevant to the non-appearance of the witness AR. 
    31    These then were the substantial grounds of challenge to the conviction. For the reasons I have indicated, I am of the view that none were made good and the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
    32    On the issue of sentence his Honour recounted the facts as established. He made the obviously correct statement that sexual assaults upon young girls by persons having their care, control and custody represent heinous crimes and they are so regarded by the community. The need for both general and specific deterrence was, his Honour correctly said, of particular importance in this type of crime. His Honour referred to the impact of the particular offences upon the complainant. He addressed the subjective matters including the appellant's criminal record which, in a word, did not assist the appellant. 
    33    His Honour turned to the oral evidence that was called in the sentencing proceedings. This evidence consisted of evidence given by the appellant himself, his mother, his younger sister, a paternal aunt and a family friend. His Honour had regard to the appellant's personal history, the fact that he had left school at an early age, had a variety of jobs and was a keen sportsman. His Honour referred to the fact that the appellant lived with his elderly mother whom he helped look after. This was a brief but, in my view, sufficient acknowledgment of the evidence that had previously been given to the effect that the appellant's mother was an amputee and, therefore, had a particular need for assistance from her son. 
    34    The appellant, in his note to the Registrar as to the grounds of his appeal against sentence, made reference to the judge not taking into account what he refers to as life on protection. I am not clear whether that ground is pressed. His Honour would clearly have been aware of the normal circumstances in which a person convicted of this offence would be incarcerated. I cannot see that that omission, if omission it was, had any impact upon the sentencing process.  
    35    If I may say so, the sentences imposed were, if anything, on the light end of the relevant spectrum, having regard to the particular situation of abuse and the pain as well as the harm inflicted upon the young complainant in the circumstances that occurred. 
    36    The appellant also refers, in his note to the Registrar, to the impact upon his own family of his own incarceration. He expressed concern for his daughter and, in particular, for his elderly mother, whose affliction has already been referred to. Imprisonment very frequently has sad and unintended but inevitable consequences upon family relationships. The victim of crime is seldom confined to the victim of the criminal. His Honour was aware of this factor and made reference to it. But it really cannot provide a basis for finding any error in the sentencing process. 
    37    As indicated, I am of the view that the offences called for at least as lengthy a period of imprisonment as was imposed and I can see no error in the sentences that were imposed. 
    38    I am of the view that the appeal as to conviction should be dismissed. 
    39    As to the appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
    40    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the President and with the orders proposed by his Honour. 
    41    KIRBY J: I also agree with the judgment of the President and the orders proposed. 
    42    MASON P: Those are the orders of the court.

     WEDNESDAY 20 OCTOBER 1999 
     REGINA v S.P.M JUDGMENT1   MASON P: I will ask James J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   JAMES J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against sentences imposed on the respondent S.P.M by Judge Viney in the District Court on 19 April 1999, after a jury had found the respondent guilty of four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation (s 61J(2)(a) of the Crimes Act) the circumstances of aggravation being the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim. The offences were all committed on 23 August 1998, the victim being the respondent's wife. 
     
      
    3   On the first count the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude of nine months to date from 24 August 1998. On the second count the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude of twelve months, also to date from 24 August 1998. On each of the third and fourth counts the respondent was sentenced to a sentence of penal servitude of four and a half years, consisting of a minimum term of eighteen months to date from 24 August 1998 and an additional term of three years. 
     
      
    4   On 3 May 1999 a letter was sent to the respondent notifying him that the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering appealing against the sentences. A notice of appeal was lodged and it was served on the respondent on 8 June 1999.  
     
      
    5   The following statement of the facts of the offences is taken, with some editing, from his Honour's remarks on sentence. As I have indicated, the respondent and the victim (or complainant) were married to each other. On the night on which the offences were committed they went out together drinking. They got home at around 2 o'clock in the morning of 23 August 1998. Each of them was well-affected by liquor. An argument arose between them. The respondent assaulted the victim in the lounge room of the house and then dragged her into the bedroom. The victim received a blow on the head but Judge Viney said in his remarks on sentence that this might have happened when her head hit the floor. 
     
      
    6   In the bedroom the offences were committed. The respondent removed the victim's clothing from the lower part of her body and had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. This conduct was the subject of the first count in the indictment. He then inserted what appears to have been a small metal bottle containing a body spray into the victim's vagina (the second count). He then inserted a long stick known as a ""boondi stick"", which was a piece of rope wrapped in tape with a rope handle, into her vagina (the third count). He then inserted the ""boondi stick"" into her anus (the fourth count). 
     
      
    7   The respondent and the victim left the bedroom There was a further argument between them during which his Honour said in his remarks on sentence, “he picked up a knife at some stage in the kitchen and she said he threatened her with it. The police arrived at the scene and the respondent was arrested, initially for breach of an apprehended violence order which was in force in favour of the victim. 
     
      
    8   On the following day, 24 August 1998, the respondent was charged with these offences. He remained in custody until he was sentenced and the sentencing judge made the sentences he imposed commence from 24 August 1998.  
     
      
    9   On 23 August the complainant was taken to a hospital where she was treated for her physical injuries, which appear to have been fairly minor. 
     
      
    10   The respondent when interviewed by the police said that he had no recollection of what had happened. However, he denied having committed the offences and defended the charges on the ground that he was sure that he would not have acted as he was alleged to have acted. 
     
      
    11   Evidence was given in the proceedings on sentence by the respondent's adoptive mother. Also admitted into evidence was a pre-sentence report, a report by a psychiatrist Dr McClure and a statement of an Aboriginal Outreach worker, who was also the mother of the victim. 
     
      
    12   In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney referred to a number of subjective circumstances of the respondent. The respondent is an Aboriginal man, who at the time of being sentenced was thirty-four years old. When he was only a few weeks old he had been taken from his natural parents and fostered out. Judge Viney found that the respondent grew up in a good household with two foster parents who later adopted him. As noted earlier, the respondent’s adoptive mother gave oral evidence in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    13   The respondent left school early and took up the trade of a plasterer, which was the trade of his foster father, and he became a good tradesman, earning good money. 
     
      
    14   The respondent met the victim in about 1988 or 1989. They entered into a relationship and in 1991 they were married. Four children were born of the marriage. However the marriage was seriously dysfunctional. The respondent was often violent to his wife. She, for her part, was addicted to certain prescription drugs and had a drinking problem. The complainant returned to the country town she had come from and the respondent followed her, desiring to maintain the marriage. However, he could not obtain work as a plasterer in the country. 
     
      
    15   The respondent discovered the whereabouts of his natural parents and in 1997 had contact with his natural mother. His Honour found that the respondent suffered emotional turmoil as a result of this contact with his natural mother. 
     
      
    16   The Aboriginal Outreach worker gave evidence, which the sentencing judge accepted, that on the Friday before the offences were committed she had asked the respondent what was the matter with him and he had replied, ""I just feel angry, real angry, I don't know why"". 
     
      
    17   On the Saturday night the Outreach worker was asked to baby-sit the children of the marriage, so that the respondent and his wife could go out together drinking. She unsuccessfully counselled the respondent's wife against going out with the respondent for this purpose. To her the respondent appeared “strange” and she was afraid that something untoward might happen that night. 
     
      
    18   In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney referred to further subjective circumstances of the respondent. The respondent had some previous criminal convictions but his Honour observed, justifiably, that his antecedents were “not terribly serious”. All the respondent's previous convictions were in the Children's Court or the Local Court and he had never previously been sentenced to imprisonment. He had a few previous convictions for assault, which had resulted in fines, community service orders or recognizances. His Honour proceeded on the basis that some of these assaults had been committed against the complainant. 
     
      
    19   His Honour found that the respondent was devoted to his four children and that he had been their primary carer. The respondent, somewhat ironically, had commenced some kind of counselling service or program in the country town in which he lived for people afflicted by domestic violence and alcohol-related problems. 
     
      
    20   His Honour noted a statement made by the respondent's legal representative in the proceedings on sentence that the respondent was ""in some sort of unbalanced mental state, perhaps attributable to a number of features of his background which had been unearthed, his drinking problems that he had been attempting to deal with and the serious dysfunctional matrimonial relationship that existed"". 
     
      
    21   After noting this submission his Honour said, ""It is difficult to know just precisely what was the state of mind of (the respondent) on this occasion"". His Honour continued, ""One could only suggest that he (the respondent) simply lost control of himself and inflicted these injuries, clearly when he was very heavily affected by liquor and possibly affected in some other way"". His Honour concluded his account of the subjective circumstances of the respondent by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well it is a tragic story really, of a young man who started off life with some degree of deprivation, as one can appreciate, where a young child is taken from his natural family, with whatever good will that was done, and yet raised in a caring environment but then having all this emotional turmoil visited on him in the last ten years and the regrettably sad, dysfunctional marriage that eventuated which has led him to this pass.” 
        
       
      
    22   His Honour found special circumstances within s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, mentioning inter alia that it was the first time the respondent had been in gaol, that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation, that the respondent had problems with alcohol for which he would need attention and that the respondent would feel keenly the separation from his children. 
     
      
    23   It was argued on behalf of the Crown that the sentencing judge made some specific errors in sentencing the respondent or alternatively that an error of principle was disclosed by reason of the sentence being manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    24   I am not satisfied that any of the specific errors alleged by the Crown have been made out. It was submitted by the Crown that the use of a knife was a significant aggravating circumstance and had not been taken into account by the sentencing judge. As I have noted, his Honour did find that the respondent picked up a knife in the kitchen. His Honour also referred to evidence by the complainant in which she said that he had threatened her with it. It is not clear whether his Honour accepted this evidence by the complainant that the respondent had threatened her with the knife. In any event, any use of the knife by the respondent occurred after the commission of the offences for which the respondent was being sentenced. 
     
      
    25   It was submitted by the Crown that the sentencing judge did not take into account that the offences involved breaches of an apprehended violence order in favour of the victim. It was submitted by counsel for the respondent that this was not a circumstance which either the sentencing judge or this court could properly take into account. His Honour did refer to the apprehended violence order in his remarks on sentence and I would not infer that his Honour omitted to take this circumstance into account to the extent that he was entitled to do so. 
     
      
    26   It was submitted by the Crown that his Honour had accepted that at the time of committing the offences the respondent was in some sort of unbalanced mental state at least partly attributable to his consumption of alcohol and in saying this his Honour had incorrectly regarded the consumption of alcohol by the respondent as a mitigating circumstance. The Crown referred to R v Fletcher Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381. 
     
      
    27   However in the passage in the remarks on sentence referred to in the Crown's submissions his Honour was setting out, not a finding made by his Honour, but a submission made by the respondent's legal representative in the proceedings on sentence. His Honour went on immediately to say it was difficult to know what was the respondent's state of mind at the time of committing the offences. His Honour simply found that the respondent had lost self-control. 
     
      
    28   In my opinion, the outcome of the present appeal depends on whether the sentences should be regarded as manifestly inadequate and particularly whether the total minimum terms and fixed terms set by his Honour are manifestly inadequate. The minimum term of a sentence should be the minimum term that justice requires the offender should serve in prison having regard to all the circumstances of the offence. See R v Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 536. 
     
      
    29   The principles which this court should apply in determining a Crown appeal against sentence are stated in a number of cases and there is no need to repeat them here. See for example R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-3. 
     
      
    30   It is accepted that a Crown appeal against sentence should not be upheld, simply because members of the appeal court consider that if they had been the original sentencing judge they would have imposed a heavier sentence. However, it seems to me that the effective minimum term of one and a half years imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate, having regard to the circumstances and particularly the objective facts of the offences. I have reached this conclusion, even allowing for the fact that the four offences should be regarded as part of one continuing episode of criminality, allowing for the respondent's unfortunate, or favourable, subjective circumstances and allowing for the restraint which this Court should exercise in determining whether a Crown appeal against sentence should succeed. 
     
      
    31   The objective facts of the offences were serious. The respondent had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent. As was conceded, it was not a circumstance of mitigation that the victim was his wife. The respondent then inserted two objects, one after the other, into the victim's vagina and the respondent then inserted one of those objects into the victim's anus. The victim received injuries for which she required some hospital treatment. The respondent had previous convictions for assaulting the victim and at the time of committing the offences was subject to an apprehended violence order in favour of the victim. An argument was addressed to us based on alleged double jeopardy that the sentencing judge should have disregarded, and that this Court should disregard, the existence of the apprehended violence order but I would not accept this submission. If any proceedings are taken against the respondent for breach of the apprehended violence order, then no doubt the sentence imposed on the applicant for these offences will be taken into account by any judicial officer punishing the applicant for breach of the apprehended violence order. The respondent did not plead guilty and hence is not entitled to the credit he would have received, had he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    32   I do not consider there is any discretionary reason why this Court should refrain from upholding the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    33   Accordingly, the Crown appeal against sentence should be upheld and this Court is required to re-sentence the respondent. In re-sentencing the respondent this Court should impose lesser sentences than should have been imposed by the original sentencing judge. I would accept that in re-sentencing the respondent this court should find, as did the sentencing judge and for the same sort of reasons, that there are special circumstances under s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
     
      
    34   Having regard to the principles of restraint which govern Crown appeals and having regard to the objective facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances favourable to the respondent, I would leave intact all of the sentences imposed by Judge Viney, except that I would quash so much of the sentences for the third and fourth counts as divided the total sentences into a minimum term of penal servitude of eighteen months and an additional term of penal servitude of three years. I would propose that the total period of each of those sentences of four and a half years be retained but that the sentences be divided into equal periods for the minimum term and the additional term. 
     
      
    35   I accordingly propose that the sentences imposed by Judge Viney on the third and fourth counts be quashed to this extent, that the orders made by his Honour dividing those terms into minimum terms and additional terms be quashed and that in lieu thereof on each of the third and fourth counts the respondent be sentenced to a term of penal servitude of four and a half years, consisting of a minimum term of penal servitude of two years and three months commencing on 24 August 1998 and expiring on 23 November 2000 and an additional term of two years and three months. The earliest date on which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole would be 24 November 2000.

      KIRBY J: I also agree. 
       
      MASON P: The orders of the court will be as indicated.

    1    GROVE J :  This is an appeal by Josef Plevac against the conviction for the murder of his wife Dana Plevac following a trial before McInerney J and a jury. Those proceedings were a retrial following orders made in this court on 5 October 1995.  
     
      
       
      
    2     The appellant and his wife lived apart. He had been residing in the former matrimonial home at Bossley Park but this was destroyed by fire in February 1989. The victim (who was the appellant's second wife) resided with their daughter Natalie on the fourteenth level of an apartment building in Parramatta. Natalie was at the time of her mother's death aged five. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The deceased had been employed as a paymistress and she had commenced an association with a work colleague, Timothy Sullivan. Mr Sullivan had gone to Western Australia seeking employment and a residence. Dana Plevac joined him in Western Australia for a time but returned to Sydney, although it would appear that this return may have been intended to be temporary.  
     
      
       
      
    4    There was in existence a restraining order prohibiting the appellant amongst other things from approaching the residence of the deceased. He claimed that he consented to that order to allay an unfounded apprehension of his wife that he might take Natalie to the Czech Republic where he had family including his mother. 
     
      
       
      
    5    On the morning of 22 September 1989 Dana and Natalie Plevac emerged from their apartment and were making their way towards the lift in order to proceed to work and to school respectively. An assailant whose head and face were covered by a balaclava-like disguise, doused the victim in what was later identified as petrol and ignited her. Natalie ran to the door of a nearby apartment and was taken in to safety. The victim, aflame, was found by the building manager. He attempted to apply a fire extinguisher. He had been alerted by a signal system that there had been a conflagration of some sort on the fourteenth level. 
     
      
       
      
    6    Dana Plevac was taken by ambulance to Westmead Hospital where she died later in the day. Before lapsing into unconsciousness, questions were asked of her concerning the incident and she said that she could not identify her attacker and also specifically said that it was neither her husband nor her boyfriend. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The appellant did not dispute that at the relevant time he was in the vicinity. He had himself suffered burns in the fire at the Bossley Park residence. As at September he had only recently been discharged from hospital where he had further treatment in respect of those injuries. He claimed to be on relatively good terms with his wife. She was doing his ironing. He said that he had an arrangement to collect some shirts from her but that he was diffident about being seen (in breach of the restraining order) in the vicinity of her residence. He claimed that she told him to come up and wait in the stairwell. He removed his shirt in anticipation of replacing it with a clean one. At his trial in an unsworn statement he said that he heard screaming whilst he was within the stairwell and when he opened the door he saw a man ""in black - in blue tracksuit, towel over head - over neck, on the left shoulder back, jumping and running down."" He saw a fire and panicked and ran to his car. Many witnesses saw a shirtless man running in the Parramatta area. The appellant did not dispute that this was him.  
     
      
       
      
    8    He drove to Katoomba where he went to a hairdresser. The hairdresser said that she detected sooty-like substance in his hair. An assistant at the hairdressing salon said that she smelled petrol. He made telephone calls to an acquaintance, Betty Cortis, with whom he had been keeping company. He later visited her and asked her to telephone Dana's place of work. She did and passed to him the news that she was dead. She said the appellant appeared shocked and said, ""I don't believe it"". 
     
      
       
      
    9    At about 4.20pm the appellant was driving in Woodville Road, Parramatta when he was stopped by police. He denied killing his wife. The police noticed some burns on the appellant and in response to questions he claimed that these were an aftermath of the fire at Bossley Park. At about 7pm a police medical officer was called and he expressed the opinion that raw, weeping burns which he detected on the body of the appellant had occurred within the last twenty-four hours. The appellant admitted to the doctor that those burns had occurred that morning. 
     
      
       
      
    10    There was evidence from observers of violence in the relationship between the appellant and his wife. A daughter of his first marriage, Eva, who visited him in hospital shortly before the events of 24 September testified that her father had appeared distressed because Dana was said to be wearing a new ring on her finger. (He was aware of the existence of Timothy Sullivan.) He complained that he wanted his wife back and felt that he was being rejected because he was scarred and ugly and he said that he wished ""she could feel just one bit of the pain he was in."" The appellant did not dispute making this statement but he asserted that he was referring to emotional and not physical pain. 
     
      
       
      
    11    There was evidence from Anthony Valenti that he knew the accused, who was a milkman and a customer of his motor garage. He often spoke to the appellant. The appellant repeatedly told him that he wanted his wife back and couldn't live without her and he constantly said things like, ""I can't live without her. I won't let her stay without me"" and ""If I can't have her, no-one else will."" 
     
      
       
      
    12    There was further evidence that on 22 September the appellant had called at a garage where he purchased about fifteen litres of petrol. The console operator at the garage, who was acquainted with him, said that he could not see whether all of the petrol was discharged from the pump into the vehicle or otherwise. The amount of petrol purchased was larger than would have fitted into a container which was found at the scene of the crime and demonstrated to have previously contained petrol. 
     
      
       
      
    13    Subject to some reference to asserted evidence from Natalie, who was aged twelve when she gave evidence in the trial with which this appeal is concerned, there was no direct evidence identifying the appellant as the offender. I say asserted in the context of submission on behalf of the appellant to this court to which I will turn. The foregoing is a sketch of the circumstantial case upon which the Crown relied. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Twelve grounds of appeal were filed including seven additional grounds sought to be relied upon. Four of these grounds were formally abandoned and it will be convenient to deal with the remainder in the numeral order allocated to them.  
     
      
       
      
    15    Ground 4: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The trial judge failed to adequately or properly direct the jury as to the issue of 'relationship' and the use to be made of evidence said to be relevant to that issue."" 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      
    16    A number of complaints were raised under this ground. During the testimony of Mr Fennell, the building manager of the flats at which the victim resided, the learned trial judge declined to admit evidence concerning the existence of the restraining order which was relevant to the physical presence at the premises of the appellant. A transcript notation shows that counsel stated at this point that he objected to any reference to the apprehended violence order either by Mr Fennell or the police or anybody on the basis that it was not relevant to the case. The precise terms of his Honour’s ruling are noted as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour stated that he would not admit that evidence at this stage but granted the Crown leave to recall Mr Fennell to give that evidence if his Honour ruled later on in the trial that the issue of an apprehended domestic violence order should go before the jury.” 
         
        
       
       
        
        
       Later, through Det Sgt Southam, evidence was given of a conversation in which the appellant was questioned about his knowledge of the existence of that order. It cannot be imagined that senior counsel appearing for the appellant (who did not appear in the appeal) was unaware of the intended evidence and not only was there no renewed objection, there was no application for a specific direction to be given. Indeed, as I have already mentioned, it was the appellant's claim that he had consented to this order because of the misapprehension of his wife that he may take Natalie overseas and not because she was frightened of him and the matter was left to the jury on the basis of that claim.  
        
       
      
    17    Counsel has extracted considerable reference in the charge to the jury to the evidence of various witnesses concerning aspects of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased. That reference led to a submission that the summary occupied a disproportionate amount of the summing-up and therefore over-emphasised the significance of that evidence. The volume of reference was necessitated by the considerable number of people who had observed the nature of the relationship and particularly violence emanating from the appellant towards his spouse. The evidence was somewhat confirmed by the appellant himself in his unsworn statement when he said, ""It is true that I called Dana by bad names, ill treat her, but I was always sorry and apologised to her. I don't looking for any excuse because there is no excuse for my behaviour."" 
     
      
       
      
    18    I see nothing to criticise in his Honour's dealing with this topic. 
     
      
       
      
    19    Specific argument was addressed to his Honour's rhetorical question to the jury: ""Was it all as loving as he would have you believe?"" It is contended that this ""had a tendency"" to reverse the onus of proof. In my view it did no such thing. I would uphold the Crown's submission that the rhetoric did no more than invite the jury to assess critically material relied upon by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    20    Ground 4 is not made out. 
     
      
       
      
    21    Ground 6: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""A miscarriage of justice occurred by the admission of the identification evidence of Natalie Plevac and/or such evidence not being withdrawn from the jury's consideration after it was adduced."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    22    At the hearing senior counsel sought to expand his argument under this ground to contend that the relationship evidence possessed a greater significance than being merely background and was intimately connected to his Honour's reference to motive so that in the circumstances of this case it had become associated with intent. Therefore, as it bore upon that element of the defence it demanded a direction that motive be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Attention was drawn to Howard on Criminal Law, 5th edition, where the editor stated, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The conclusion is that there is no factual difference at all between intention and motive, the distinction being a linguistic convenience only."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    23    That statement is not entirely compatible with the distinction drawn in the earlier observation: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Motive is often relevant, however, as an item of proof either that D acted as charged or that he did so intentionally. Since intention and motive are both known to the law but serve different functions, there is some advantage in being able to distinguish one from the other but it is not always easy to do so."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    24    Reference was made to Penney v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1316 where Callinan J noted: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant submitted that the passage confused intention with motive: if motive is to be relied on then it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    25    His Honour referred to R v Murphy (1985) 4 NSWLR 42 and Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521. 
     
      
       
      
    26    The remark in Penney has been the subject of subsequent comment. It was noted by James J in R v Pantoja (CCA, unreported, 5 November 1998) that in Penney, Callinan J went on to hold that the relevant evidence in that case had been relied upon not to prove motive but to prove relationship between the victim and the accused. In the same case, Adams J observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me that, especially having regard to the explanation of  
         Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) 
          (1984) 153 CLR 520 expressed in  
         Shepherd v The Queen 
          (1990) 170 CLR 573, no direction along the lines submitted by counsel for the appellant was called for in this case. (A direction that motive needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.) There may be cases depending upon circumstantial evidence in which proof of motive is an indispensable link in the chain of proof of the guilt of the accused and thus will need to be established beyond reasonable doubt. However, such cases must be rare."" 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    27    Remarks to this same effect were made by Callaway JA in R v Kotzmann [1999] VSCA 27 where he noted, ""It is unnecessary to decide whether motive must always be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is difficult to believe that that could be so."" His remark was made in direct reference to what had been said in Penney. 
     
      
       
      
    28    The present was a circumstantial case and the jury was not being invited to infer guilt from motive alone. It was not one of the rare cases referred to by Adams J and no such direction was called for. Experienced senior counsel appearing for the appellant at trial made no application for any such direction. The additional argument does not sustain the ground. 
     
      
       
      
    29    In her evidence in chief Natalie, who I have said was by then twelve years of age, was asked about what she remembered of the incident. She said that she remembered a man splashing something out of a bucket upon her mother and that she went up in flames. The man said nothing and she saw him go through an exit door close to the lifts. She ran to get help. She then gave this testimony: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Can you describe that man any more than the way in which you have described him? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Q. Are you able to recognise that person? 
          
         A. Well sort of. 
          
          
         Q. What do you mean 'sort of'? 
          
         A. Well I could tell it could have been - it was my dad because, well my mum was wearing high heels and he was about the same height as her and because of the build. 
          
          
         Q. That is as far as you can say that it could have been? 
          
         A. Well, and there was a phone call the night before and it was my dad."" 
          
         
        
        It is clear, particularly from the content of the final question set out above, that the Crown was not relying upon evidence from Natalie as identifying the appellant. This was made even clearer in cross-examination when in a series of questions she confirmed that all she could remember was that the man seemed to be dressed all in black and she could not see his face which was totally covered except his eyes nor could she see his hair. She gave this evidence: 
        
         
         ""Q. Now, would I be right if I said to you that when you saw that happen on that day you did not know who that man was. Would that be right or not? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. And would I be right in saying that you did not know who it was because, well I guess you did not see him for long enough, would that be right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Would it be right that there was just nothing about him that you saw that brought to your mind any person that you knew? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. See, was it the situation that when you saw him on that day and got yourself into the unit of these other people, that you did not know who that man was. Would that be right? 
          
         A. Yes."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    30    She confirmed that she had told the police that she did not know who the offender was. This ground is somewhat aligned with the next. 
     
      
       
      
    31    Ground 7: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury in relation to the frailties of the identification evidence given by Natalie Plevac and/or in providing inappropriate or inadequate directions in relation to such evidence."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    32    As I have indicated, there was no reliance at trial by the Crown upon any evidence from Natalie identifying the appellant. Indeed senior counsel at trial made no request for the standard identification direction obviously because there was no evidence of identification of the appellant as the offender other than by the circumstantial case. On repeated occasions during his charge to the jury the learned trial judge told them that there was no direct evidence of identification and that the Crown relied upon its circumstantial case. 
     
      
       
      
    33    This and the preceding ground had been advanced upon the flawed premise that the jury could have used the evidence of Natalie as identification of the appellant as the offender. Nothing in his Honour's summing-up nor in the content of the evidence invited them so to do. Both of these grounds should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    34    Ground 8: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour erred in allowing evidence to be adduced from Mr Tim Sullivan, the deceased's boyfriend, that the appellant had previously attempted to run him off the road."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    35    Objection was taken to evidence sought to be led that the deceased and Tim Sullivan were driving near a kindergarten attended by Natalie when the accused used his vehicle to force Mr Sullivan's vehicle from the road and caused it to mount a median strip. Mr Sullivan's description of the incident was simply that the appellant came alongside his vehicle and swerved and he (Mr Sullivan) had to avoid him by going off the road otherwise they would have collided. It might be mentioned that at the time of the fatal attack on Dana Plevac Mr Sullivan was in Western Australia. His Honour overruled the objection and said inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me that there is evidence before the jury that this accused had made statements to Mr Valenti that if he could not have her no-one else could, and it is my view his reaction in those circumstances to seeing Mr Sullivan with the child and Dana is a matter that is relevant for the jury to take into account."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    36    There is no error in his Honour's ruling. I would dismiss this ground. 
     
      
       
      
    37    Ground 9: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour erred in directing the jury to 'use your common sense and you will look at the facts in this case to determine who it was that committed this dreadful crime'."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    38    It is conceded by the appellant that appropriate directions as to onus of proof appear in his Honour's charge to the jury on at least three occasions. The complaint is that the comment above ""had had the potential to undermine or water down the force of such directions"". With respect to senior counsel, I find it an astonishing proposition that a judge should be criticised for asking a jury to use their common sense. It is quite an artificial construction of what was said to mutate the words into a qualification upon the clear directions as to onus of proof. His Honour was dealing neither with onus or standard of proof but was directing the jury as to their use of a tool (common sense) in order to determine, in accordance with onus and standard, the exquisite central issue in the case, namely, was the appellant the offender who doused Dana Plevac in petrol and set her alight. 
     
      
       
      
    39    Ground 10: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory."" 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    40    This ground is to be understood as asserting that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence in accordance with the jurisdiction of this court to be exercised pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is claimed that the Crown case was disproportionately based upon evidence of a deteriorating relationship, prior violent conduct and behaviour said to evince a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
       
      
    41    I have, with the obvious disadvantage of not being able to see the witnesses including the appellant delivering his unsworn statement, read the evidence. Judged from such resources, it is my conclusion that the Crown case was strong. I have sketched some of the background facts in the introduction to this judgment but in short summary it can be said that there was cogent evidence of the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      
    42    The appellant and the deceased had separated; the deceased had openly started a new relationship with Mr Sullivan; there was evidence showing that the appellant was unhappy about that circumstance; inter alia he made statements to Mr Valenti that if he could not have Dana then no-one would; there was evidence of violence and enmity directed from the appellant to the deceased throughout their marriage; he was present at the scene of the crime; he fled from the scene at Parramatta to Katoomba where he was seen by the staff at the hairdressers in circumstances above mentioned; he had fresh burns on the critical day and although he denied that the burns were fresh he did not maintain his denial when confronted by a medical expert; he had made the recent purchase of petrol; he engaged in the charade when talking to Mrs Cortis that he was shocked by his wife's death in the context of his own assertion that he had run away in panic because he had seen someone else put the torch to her. 
     
      
       
      
    43    A reading of the evidence left me without the impression that there was a possibility of wrong conviction. 
     
      
       
      
    44    Ground 11: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Expert evidence of the appellant's fear of fire was not adduced at trial, thereby causing a miscarriage of justice."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    45    The appellant seeks to tender evidence along the lines of a report from Yvonne Skinner, a psychiatrist, who examined the appellant on 25 January 1999. She did not as a result of that examination and the material that she had been invited to consider (which included the transcript of the unsworn statement of the appellant and his Honour's charge to the jury) find that the appellant was suffering from any psychiatric illness or emotional disorder. As I have said, her examination was earlier this year. She opined that he had not ever completely overcome his fear of fire because of his experience in February 1989 when the home at Bossley Park was burned. She continued that ""he had been sensitised to (fear of fire)"" and if this can be accepted as an explanation of why he fled the scene then ""his appeal might be successful"". 
     
      
       
      
    46    There is some paradox in this proposed evidence. The appellant's explanation for the fresh burns on his body which the appellant acknowledged to the police medical officer were mentioned in his unsworn statement when he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""I saw Dana and how she was holding clothes - it must be my clean clothes, it was in the fire. I jumped towards her because I got bandage on my hand. I pull everything out and I must have been burnt, I don’t know, and at that stage I completely lost it.” 
         
        
       
       
      
    47    Counsel has contended that this should be understood as an explanation for the appellant coming into contact with fire on that morning. It follows then that on his own version he came to the fire rather than as Dr Skinner theorized being sensitized to flee from it.  
     
      
       
      
    48    The issue on appeal is not whether or, in isolation, why he fled the scene. The Crown relied upon evidence of flight as part of its circumstantial case indicating the guilt of the accused not for fleeing the scene but for deliberately incinerating the victim.  
     
      
       
      
    49    The evidence proposed amounts to no more than opinion of one alternative explanation for one ingredient in a circumstantial case. It was by no means an essential or indispensable link in the circumstantial chain of causation and I am unpersuaded that the foreshadowed new evidence is such that the conviction should be categorised as a miscarriage. 
     
      
       
      
    50    As a practical matter, it is of no consequence whether the evidence is technically admitted and the ground rejected or leave refused to argue the ground. I would refuse that leave. 
     
      
       
      
    51    Ground 12: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""That the appellant was denied a fair trial in that a letter written by the deceased wife and relevant to his defence was not referred to and/or tendered at his trial."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    52    We have provisionally read an affidavit of the appellant proposing that on 16 August 1994 he received from his mother in the Czech Republic a typed letter signed ""Dana"" and addressed to one ""Jitka"". He identified the addressee Jitka as a friend of his wife who is now deceased. He recognised the signature of his wife. The letter came to the appellant with a note from his mother saying she had received it from an anonymous person in Australia. The letter was available at the time of the appeal against conviction following the first trial and, obviously, was still available at the time of the trial with which this appeal is concerned. The appellant claimed that he was advised by counsel who conducted the trial that the letter not be used. He recites that he signed an authorisation for counsel not to do so but later withdrew that authorisation. Finally he accepted counsel's advice that it should not be used. Clearly this letter is neither new nor fresh evidence. It is undated. The Crown does not accept the authenticity of this letter. A translation of the letter reveals this content in part: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""And why am I writing to you? I am now having problems with Pepa. He will be going to court in three weeks over the house fire and the problem is in that he knows who has done it and also has evidence. For this reason it would be good if you could extend your holiday stay until such time that Pepa’s court hearings are over. He now runs wild, searching for more evidence. You do not have to worry. I talked to Robert today and he would visit me on Friday with his friend. They already worked out a plan how to stop Pepa and get him finally to prison. As you know, Pepa is presently alone and everybody is against him. However, he trusts me and therefore it will be no problem. The only problem is with Natalie who talks about Pepa all the time and wants to be with him. However, she will forget about him in time, the same way Eva and Martina forgot. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         When you ring me on the telephone, please be very careful because I do not know what Pepa is doing now. Even Pepa’s solicitor does not want to talk to me any more about Pepa’s problems and it takes me a bit of time to learn everything.  
         
        
        
         
         Make the best of your holiday and do not worry at all as I and Robert have everything under control. On Friday I will write you another letter about the outcome of this all."" 
         
        
       
      
    53    The appellant may be identified as Pepa. The reference to court proceedings is to a charge of arson preferred against the appellant in connection with the fire at Bossley Park. This prosecution did not proceed. It was abandoned in 1991 after the appellant was sentenced at the conclusion of the trial to penal servitude for life. Eva and Martina are the appellant's daughters from his first marriage. Robert may be identified as the son of the late Jitka (Klasek). It is quite fanciful to imagine that Dana Plevac was involved in a conspiracy to falsely inculpate the appellant for the murder of herself. Even construing the letter with an extravagantly heightened sense of suspicion, at most it would demonstrate that the deceased believed there was something afoot which would see the appellant convicted on the charge of arson. This did not eventuate. 
     
      
       
      
    54    It was argued that the ""Friday"" mentioned in the letter can be located by a process of deduction as being the day of the killing. If that be so, the possible presence of Robert with an unidentified companion was said to be at least suggestively supported by the presence of used coffee mugs in the deceased's flat. There is no evidence that those mugs were used that morning. No question was asked of Natalie about the presence of Robert who, as the son of a friend of her mother's, she might have known, nor any questions about visitors in the flat that morning. 
     
      
       
      
    55    On the appellant's own testimony contained in an affidavit which we have provisionally read he acknowledges that he was advised twice by separate senior counsel and by his solicitor that it was not in his interest to rely upon this letter and he accepted their advice. 
     
      
       
      
    56    It is impossible to assign any cogency to the content of the letter in the present matter and it can only acquire arguable relevance by attributing credibility to an extremely remote hypothesis. In my view it is unnecessary to examine the issues of authenticity or admissibility of the letter because it fails to demonstrate that even if admitted, there is a significant possibility that a reasonable jury would have acquitted if that had been before them: R v Goonan (1993) 69 A Crim R 338. 
     
      
       
      
    57    None of the matters relied upon by the appellant has been made out and I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    58    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding judge and with the orders proposed by his Honour.

       JUDGMENT (Ex tempore; revised 9 November 1999) 
        
        
       
      
     
     
     1    
     HIS HONOUR: This case involves a dispute about the proceeds of sale of nine buses. The plaintiff, Esanda, seeks by notice of motion to strike out the amended defence in the proceedings as regards six of the buses. The first defendant, Mr Gibbons, seeks leave by notice of motion to file a cross-claim and join an additional party as cross-claimant. 
      
       
        
       The companies 
        
       
      
     2    
     The proceedings involve a number of companies in the Clifford Corporation Group. The third defendant (‘Busrent’) is a company the directors of which are Mr J B Loiterton and Mr I R Hall, and the secretary is Mr C J Ellis. The company's shareholder is Clifford Corporation Ltd. 
      
       
      
     3    
     The second defendant (‘TPI’) is a company the directors of which are Mr I R Hall, Mr J B Loiterton and Mr C J Ellis, as well as Mr E Lusew and Mr L E Stewart, and the secretary is Mr C J Ellis. There is no evidence identifying the shareholders of TPI, but the evidence which is before me indicates that it has the same registered office and address as other companies which are subsidiaries of Clifford Corporation. It is appropriate for the purposes of the present application to infer that whoever the shareholders are, TPI is a subsidiary which is part of the Clifford Corporation Group. 
      
       
      
     4    
     The first defendant's notice of motion seeks to join as a cross-claimant another company called Austral Pacific Group Ltd (‘APG’). The directors of this company are Mr J B Loiterton, Mr I R Hall, and Mr C J Ellis and Mr L E Stewart ceased to be a director on 15 February 1999. Mr Ellis is the secretary, and the sole shareholder is Clifford Corporation Ltd. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
      
     5    
     Mr Gibbons says that during 1998 TPI supplied seven bus chassis to APG for the purpose of APG manufacturing and mounting bus bodies on each chassis supplied. TPI supplied the bus chassis to APG on terms, recorded by invoice, that the property in the bus bodies manufactured by APG would not pass to TPI until full payment was received by APG. Additionally, during 1998 APG manufactured and sold two complete buses to TPI, on terms that property in the buses would not pass until APG received full payment. Mr Gibbons says APG has not received full payment for either the seven bus bodies and or the two buses. 
      
       
      
     6    
     Late in 1998 TPI and Busrent arranged for Esanda to provide finance on the security of the nine buses. The financing arrangement was by lease between Busrent and Esanda supported by a guarantee by Clifford Corporation Ltd. Esanda and Busrent entered into a master lease agreement dated 1 October 1998, apparently signed by Mr Loiterton and Mr Ellis on behalf of Busrent, and pursuant to its terms each bus was leased by separate contract, at least some of which appear to have been signed by Mr Loiterton and Mr Ellis on behalf of Busrent. 
      
       
      
     7    
     The master lease contained a provision headed ‘Acknowledgment of Delivery’, by which the lessee agreed that before taking delivery it would thoroughly examine the goods and satisfy itself as to their correspondence with the given description, their quality and their suitability for the lessee's purposes, and certify the same in writing to the lessor. In the case of each individual bus the form contained an acknowledgment of delivery which included a certificate by the lessee declaring and warranting, among other things, that the lessee had carefully examined the goods and that they corresponded with their description and were of a quality and condition suitable in all respects for the lessee's purposes. Although there appears to be no express acknowledgment or warranty on behalf of the lessee with respect to the lessor's title to the goods which were the subject of the lease in each case, the provisions to which I have referred clearly imply, in my view, an acknowledgment by the lessee that as between them the lessor had the better title to the goods. 
      
       
      
     8    
     At about the same time that the leasing arrangements were entered into, Esanda purchased each of the nine buses from TPI. It did not deal with APG, although as I have said, TPI and APG had four common directors at the time. 
      
       
      
     9    
     In the second week of December 1998 Esanda became aware that certain companies in the Clifford Corporation Group had gone into external administration. In fact Heller Financial Services Ltd appointed Mr Gibbons as receiver and manager of the assets of APG and of the book debts of Busrent. An administrator had also been appointed to TPI. Esanda says by virtue of these events Busrent came to be in default under the terms of the master lease agreement, and consequently under that agreement Esanda immediately became entitled to repossess the buses. 
      
       
      
     10    
     Mr Deeble, on behalf of Esanda, visited the premises of Busrent with a colleague and identified and inspected the buses on 10 December 1998. The person with whom he spoke at the premises indicated that the receiver needed to have Esanda’s title to the vehicles substantiated. On 16 December 1998 Mr Deeble sent Mr Gibbons a facsimile giving particulars of the invoices by which Esanda had purchased the buses from TPI. 
      
       
      
     11    
     On 17 December Esanda’s solicitors wrote to Mr Gibbons asserting that he had failed to deliver up a particular bus which Esanda had on-sold, or to allow Esanda to take possession of it, and making a demand that Esanda be permitted to take possession. On the same day Mr Gibbons' solicitors replied explaining that Mr Gibbons was the receiver and manager of all of the assets of TPI and that the particular bus which was the subject of the demand was in the possession of TPI. The solicitors asked for evidence of the consent of the administrator of TPI under s 440C of the Corporations Law. In fact, such consent was forthcoming on 22 December 1998. The solicitors also requested a schedule detailing the payments which Esanda had made to TPI. 
      
       
      
     12    
     Later on 17 December 1998 the solicitors for Esanda provided further information to the solicitors for Mr Gibbons and then on 18 December 1998 the present proceedings were instituted, after Esanda had not succeeded in obtaining possession of any of the buses.  
      
       
      
     13    
     On 18 December 1998 Esanda approached the Equity Duty Judge for abridgment of service of a summons seeking declarations that it was the owner of the nine buses and was entitled to immediate possession of them, and an order that Mr Gibbons do what was necessary to allow Esanda to take possession. Esanda also sought an immediate interlocutory order of that kind. There was a hearing on that day at which Mr Gibbons appeared and neither opposed nor consented to the making of orders. Windeyer J ordered abridgment of service and upon Esanda giving the usual undertaking as to damages, ordered Mr Gibbons to do all things necessary to permit it to take possession of the buses, subject to a conditional release by Esanda releasing Mr Gibbons from liability with respect to the detention of the buses, and subject also to Esanda undertaking to notify Mr Gibbons of the sale and sale price of the vehicles. 
      
       
      
     14    
     Subsequently, possession of the buses was obtained by Esanda for the purposes of sale and they were sold for a total consideration of $1,534,655. The buses having been sold, the dispute between the parties became a dispute with respect to the proceeds of sale. 
      
       
      
     15    
     Subsequently, the matter continued by pleadings and Esanda filed a Statement of Claim seeking declarations as to its ownership and entitlement to immediate possession of the nine buses at the relevant time, together with damages and an order for payment of moneys owing by Busrent. 
      
       
      
     16    
     By his amended defence, Mr Gibbons admitted that six buses were in the possession of TPI but asserted that three buses were in the possession of APG (paragraph 14). The amended defence said that Esanda was not entitled to possession of the buses at the relevant time because Esanda had purchased the buses from TPI, which did not have title to confer by that transaction since the buses were subject to retention provisions in favour of APG. In effect, the pleadings raised the question whether on 18 December 1998 Esanda was entitled to immediate possession of the buses and, more particularly, the question whether TPI, being in possession of six of the buses, could raise a  
     jus tertii 
      in order to defeat Esanda's claim that it was entitled to possession of them. 
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
      
     17    
     Esanda filed its notice of motion on 24 June 1999 and Mr Gibbons filed his notice of motion on 12 July 1999. By its notice of motion Esanda sought leave to proceed against TPI, notwithstanding that it was in administration, for the purpose of obtaining a declaration that Esanda was entitled to immediate possession of the nine buses, and an order that Mr Gibbons' amended defence be struck out. By his Notice of Motion Mr Gibbons sought an order that APG be joined as a cross-claimant and leave to file a cross-claim. These applications are the subject of the present judgment. 
      
       
        
       The ‘strike out’ application 
        
       
      
     18    
     The principal question before me relates to Esanda's application to strike out the amended defence by Mr Gibbons. The standard by which that application is to be judged was set out in the judgment of Barwick CJ in 
       
     General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) 
      (1964) 112 CLR 125. Having reviewed the authorities his Honour remarked (at 129) that ‘these cases uniformly adhere to the view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to the customary tribunal which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of a cause of action - if that be the ground on which the Court is invited, as in this case, to exercise its power of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.’ In the present case, of course, the question relates to the defence rather than the plaintiff's cause of action. Barwick CJ referred to the various formulae which courts have used to articulate the standard which must be achieved for success in an application of this kind. He said (at 130) that ‘once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law, and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and as an abuse of process.’ He contemplated that the Court may reach a conclusion favourable to the applicant even in a case where the conclusion that the other side's claim is futile is reached only after extensive argument. He said (at 130) that ‘argument, perhaps even of an extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.’ In the present case Esanda says that while its application raises some interesting questions of law, and the outcome is not obvious from the beginning, nevertheless upon proper consideration the Court should conclude that the defence is hopeless and should be struck out. 
      
       
        
       Pleading a  
       jus tertii 
        
       
      
     19    
     Esanda puts its case on the basis of the principle which precludes reliance on a  
     jus tertii, 
      and also on the broader ground of estoppel. As Professor Atiyah has remarked (‘A Re-examination of the  
     Jus Tertii 
      in Conversion’ (1955) 18 Mod LR 97,105), standard formulations of the law in this area hide a ‘mass of ambiguity’, especially as to the concepts of  
     jus tertii 
      and right to possession. The orthodox application of the  
     jus tertii 
      principle to an action in trover or conversion was explained in the judgment of Henchman J in 
       
     Henry Berry & Co Pty Limited v Rushton 
      [1937] SR (Qld) 109, who said (at 119):  
      
       
        
         
         ‘although where the plaintiff was in actual possession of the goods when the defendant by a wrongful act got possession of them the defendant can plead the  
         jus tertii 
          only in certain cases ..., it is otherwise when the plaintiff was not in actual possession when the wrongful act was done. When the plaintiff was not in actual possession, but relies upon his right to possession, he must recover on the strength of his title, and the defendant may, under a plea of not guilty or not possessed, show that the plaintiff has no right to immediate possession because that right is in some other person.’ 
         
        
       
      
     20    
     In the present case Esanda was not in possession of the buses on 18 December 1998 and the proceedings which it commenced on that day rely upon its right to immediate possession, arising under the terms of the master lease agreement. The principles stated by Henchman J, if one were to pause at that point, would imply that Mr Gibbons would be entitled to raise a  
     jus tertii 
      by denying Esanda’s right to immediate possession on the basis that TPI did not have good title to the buses when it sold them to Esanda in 1998. 
      
       
      
     21    
     However, the principles with respect to  
     jus tertii 
      are subject to further qualifications. Henchman J remarked (at 121) that ‘in cases of bailment for a term, the bailor has no right of possession and cannot sue in trespass or conversion until the contract is determined.’ In such a case, the bailee is precluded from setting up a  
     jus tertii 
      against the bailor. See also 
       
     Butler v Hobson 
      [1838] 4 Bing (NC) 290; 132 ER 800; 
       
     Leake v Loveday 
      (1842) 4 Man & G 972; 133 ER 399;  
     Woods v Mason Bros Ltd  
     (1892) 8 WN (NSW) 114. 
      
       
      
     22    
     The principle behind the rules concerning bailor and bailee has been explained by Messrs R P Balkin and J L R Davies in Law of Torts 2 ed (1996) p 73 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ‘The idea that the  
         jus tertii 
          can be pleaded by a converter of goods as against a plaintiff with only an immediate right to possession, is subject to the exception that a bailee, if sued by the bailor, is estopped from denying the bailor's title, although some other defence may be available. Moreover, the rule that the bailee is not entitled to dispute the bailor's title and therefore cannot plead the  
         jus tertii 
          against the bailor is itself subject to certain exceptions. Herron J in Edwards v Amos stated the rule thus: ((1945) 62 WN NSW) 204 at 206): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘the defendant, although a bailee, can plead the  
           jus tertii 
            in three cases, (a) where he defends the action on behalf of and by the authority of the true owner, (b) where he committed the act of conversion complained of on the authority of the true owner, and (c) where he has already made satisfaction to the true owner by returning the property to him.’’ 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     23    
     In my view, though they are expressed by reference to the particular case of bailor and bailee, the principles with respect to pleading the  
     jus tertii 
      are best understood not as a series of mechanistic rules but as a series of propositions which relate to the same fundamental concern for fairness which gives rise to the modern law of equitable estoppel. An understanding of the basis of principle should help to avoid confusion about the relevant legal concepts. Essentially, the defendant in an action in conversion in modern times will be precluded from pleading and relying upon the title of a third party in order to defeat the plaintiff's assertion of a right to immediate possession, when:  
      
       
        
         
         (a) the defendant's conduct has contributed to the plaintiff's belief that its right to immediate possession exists; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the defendant does not act with the authority of the true owner. 
         
        
       
      
     24    
     It may be that the principle underlying the cases on  
     jus tertii 
      is an application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. It is unnecessary for me to decide whether the  
     jus tertii 
      cases are merely cases of equitable estoppel or have some special characteristics. It is enough for present purposes to say that (assuming the true owner has not intervened) the cases require, inter alia, an inquiry with respect to the defendant's conduct, in order to determine whether there is in that conduct something which justifies the Court from preventing the defendant from defeating the plaintiff's right to immediate possession by pleading or relying upon the better title of the third party. 
      
       
      
     25    
     That this is the correct approach is confirmed, in my view, by the judgment of Walsh J in 
       
     Standard Electronic Apparatus Laboratories Pty Limited v Stenner 
      (1960) 77 WN (NSW) 833, 836. That was a case where the plaintiff in an action for conversion was the bailee of goods which had been taken by the bailor. Walsh J held that the bailee had special property in the goods in question by virtue of work done on them which had created a lien; that special property was sufficient to support the action. The question was whether the bailor, having entered into the bailment, could defend the action by asserting a  
     jus tertii 
     . His Honour held that the bailor, having purported to bail the goods to A, could not dispute his own right to do so by setting up a  
     jus tertii 
      even if the third party was in fact the true owner. His Honour contemplated that the position may have been different had it been shown that the true owner demanded the goods or that the bailor was acting under the authority or direction of the true owner. In the case before him, a claim of that kind had not been made, the bailor merely asserting that he had not made any agreement with the bailee in relation to the goods. Since this defence had failed and as between the parties to the proceedings the bailee was properly in possession, Walsh J held that the bailor should be precluded by his own conduct from pleading the  
     jus tertii. 
      
       
      
     26    
     It appears to me that the present case is quite similar to the 
       
     Standard Electronic 
       
     case. Here Esanda asserts its right to immediate possession against Busrent. In the amended defence it is admitted that six of the buses were in the possession of TPI on 18 December 1998. As far as those buses are concerned, it is not asserted that TPI had any better right to possession than Busrent. However TPI, it is said, had no title to confer upon Esanda in 1998 when it purported to sell the buses to Esanda subject to a leasing arrangement in favour of Busrent. Putting to one side for the moment the complexity which arises because there is more than one related company concerned and a separate party to the proceedings is the receiver and manager, the case appears as one in which a defendant to an action in which the plaintiff asserts a right to immediate possession of goods pleads that the plaintiff's title, and consequently its right to possession, are defective, because the defendant had no title to give when at an earlier time it purported to sell the goods to the plaintiff. Viewed in that manner the facts fall within the principles enunciated by Walsh J in the 
       
     Standard Electronic 
       
     case. 
      
       
      
     27    
     In the present case, however, additional complexity arises out of the corporate group relationship and the receivership. As far as the corporate group relationship is concerned, TPI can have no better right to retain possession of the buses than Busrent. Consequently, any assertion on behalf of TPI or Busrent challenging Esanda's right to immediate possession is an assertion of a  
     jus tertii 
      falling within the principles of the cases, whichever of those two companies makes the assertion. 
      
       
      
     28    
     Mr Gibbons has not asserted that APG authorised TPI to resist Esanda’s demand for possession on its behalf. The fact that there were four common directors is not of itself a basis for inferring that such authority was given. 
      
       
      
     29    
     Both TPI and Busrent were parties to the overall transaction of October 1998 by which TPI purported to sell the buses to Esanda for substantial valuable consideration and Esanda leased the buses to Busrent. In those circumstances, it can hardly lie in the mouth of either TPI or Busrent to assert now that a part of the transaction in which they both took part was ineffective because TPI was not able to confer good title. The facts that Mr Loiterton and Mr Ellis were signatories to the lease documentation on behalf of Busrent, and were also at the relevant time directors of TPI, merely confirm this conclusion. 
      
       
      
     30    
     As far as the position of Mr Gibbons is concerned, it is clear from the statement of claim that he has been joined as a defendant in his capacity of receiver and manager of the assets of TPI and part of the assets of Busrent (although the latter capacity is not significant because the receivership is confined to Busrent’s book debts). By the amended defence Mr Gibbons admits that he is receiver and manager of the assets of TPI. In that context it is clear that the rights which he purports to assert are not rights which he claims as an individual, but are rights asserted in his capacity as the receiver and manager of the assets of TPI. In other words, Mr Gibbons has no capacity in these proceedings other than as receiver and manager. And that being so, his assertion of a  
     jus tertii 
      must effectively be regarded as an assertion made by TPI through him rather than by him as an individual. 
      
       
      
     31    
     It appears to me, therefore, that the standard set by the 
       
     General Steel Industries 
       
     case has been met by Esanda with respect to six of the buses concerned. Mr Gibbons submitted that in the present case the dispute between the parties relates to difficult questions of law and some unresolved questions of fact, and consequently, it is not an appropriate case for the Court to accede to an application to strike out the defence. However, the mere fact that there are difficult questions of law involved does not prevent an application to strike out a pleading from succeeding, for the reasons explained by Barwick CJ in the 
       
     General Steel Industries 
      case. Once one analyses the difficult legal issues, one may, as I have here, reach the view that the claim which is challenged is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed. 
      
       
      
     32    
     As far as unresolved questions of fact are concerned, my view is that it is unnecessary to determine them in order to reach a conclusion on Esanda's application. Mr Gibbons' difficulty flows directly from the incontrovertible fact that TPI, as part of the finance lease transaction which it entered into with Busrent and Esanda, purported to confer good title to the buses upon Esanda for the purposes of the lease. Once one identifies that this is the case, it flows inexorably that the principles with respect to  
     jus tertii 
      should prevent Mr Gibbons as receiver and manager of TPI from making an assertion inconsistent with TPI's conduct in that respect. 
      
       
      
     33    
     As regards the remaining three buses, the amended defence denies that they were in the possession of any defendant because they were in the possession of APG on 18 December 1998. Esanda says in those circumstances the correct procedure is for it to discontinue the present proceedings with respect to these buses, on the basis that APG may seek to recover damages from it in appropriate proceedings if it wishes to do so. In the circumstances, Esanda says the correct orders are orders that the amended defence of the first defendant be struck out, that (on a final basis) the first and second defendants deliver up to it the six buses which the amended defence admits to being in the possession of TPI on 18 December 1998, and that Esanda be granted leave to discontinue the proceedings against Mr Gibbons and TPI with respect to the other three buses. 
      
       
        
       The application to join APG as cross-claimant 
        
       
      
     34    
     I turn to Mr Gibbons’ application for leave to join APG as a cross-claimant and to file a cross-claim. If I make the orders which Esanda seeks, then effectively any cross-claim will be the only substantial remaining part of the proceedings which is likely to be contested. It would be almost as easy for APG to institute separate proceedings to assert a claim against Esanda on the basis of its allegation of a superior title to the buses at the relevant time. However, I see no particular objection to that claim being asserted in what is left of the present proceedings and therefore I propose to grant leave to Mr Gibbons to join APG and file a cross-claim if that is what he is advised to do. 
      
       
        
       Costs 
        
       
      
     35    
     Esanda says that Mr Gibbons should be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings to date other than costs directly referable to the three buses referred to in paragraph 14(b) of the amended defence; and that as to the costs referable to those three buses, Esanda should be ordered to pay costs because it now wishes to discontinue the proceedings with respect to them. 
      
       
      
     36    
     It appears to me that Esanda is entitled to the benefit of a costs order, but the order proposed on its behalf would give it too much. My conclusions in this case were reached only after analysis with the aid of substantial argument by counsel. The main point at issue was not an obvious one at first blush, though in the end I have decided that the defence is unsustainable upon analysis. That being so, my view is that the proper order as to costs should reflect the fact that Esanda has been successful with respect to six of the nine buses but (in effect) unsuccessful with respect to three of the buses. The best way to reflect that outcome is to order Mr Gibbons as receiver and manager of TPI and Busrent to pay two-thirds of Esanda's costs of the proceedings to date. 
      
       
      
     37    
     Esanda submits that its costs should be assessed and paid forthwith. It seems to me there is force in that submission because, if a cross-claim is filed, the proceedings are not likely to be finally determined for some time, and yet the orders which I shall make now are final orders with respect to six of the buses. Moreover, it seems likely that any cross-claim will assert as its principal ground a claim by APG based upon its alleged title. This is essentially a different claim from the one which is the subject of this judgment. I see no good reason for depriving Esanda of the benefit of my order for costs while that different matter is determined. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
      
     38    
     At the hearing of the application on 5 October 1999 counsel for Esanda handed up short minutes of order which I now initial and date for identification.  
      
       
      
     39    
     I note for the purposes of the orders that the administrator of TPI consented by letter dated 22 December 1998 for the purposes of s 440D of the Corporations Law to Esanda commencing the present proceedings, and that the liquidators subsequently appointed to TPI consented to leave being granted under s 500 of the Corporations Law on condition that no orders for costs be made against them or the company and that no liability be imposed on the liquidators. 
      
       
      
     40    
     I make the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed against the second defendant for the purpose only of obtaining orders in terms of paragraphs 3 and 4 below. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Order that the Amended Defence of the first defendant be struck out. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Order on a final basis that the first and second defendants deliver up to the plaintiff the vehicles specified in paragraph 14(a) to the Amended Defence. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Grant leave to the plaintiff to discontinue the proceedings against the first and second defendants with respect to the vehicles referred to in paragraph 14(b) of the Amended Defence. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Order the first defendant to pay two thirds of the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings to date. 
         
        
        
         
         6. Direct the costs referred to above be assessed and paid forthwith. 
         
        
        
         
         7. Grant leave to Austral Pacific Group Limited (In liquidation)(Receiver and Manager appointed) to file a cross-claim in what is left of the proceedings.

      REGINA v. NGOC Dang 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner Ngoc Dang pleaded guilty before Barr, J. on 10 September 1999 to the offences set out in two counts in the indictment that had been presented against him that day. Those offences were: one count of murder of Van Hong Ly; and one count of maliciously wounding Tu Phu Le at Cabramatta, both on 25 April 1998. His Honour convicted the prisoner of each offence. 
    2   The matter came before me today for the imposition of sentence. On the sentencing proceedings the Crown tendered, and read aloud, short facts on sentence, which, I was informed were facts with which the prisoner agreed, as summarising the content of the various statements provided to the Crown on the circumstances in which the offences had come to be committed. 
    3   The deceased, Van Hong Ly, had been at the Mekong Club, Cabramatta on the evening of Friday, 24 April. He had worn a red baseball cap which from time to time he was asked by security staff of the Club to remove. At one stage of the evening he was seated at a table in the Club with the prisoner and another person. About 11.00 pm he was seen to hit the prisoner, who fell backwards and hit the back of his head on a table. The deceased picked the prisoner up by his hair, helping him into a chair and gave him a drink. 
    4   About 1.00 am on the morning of Saturday 25 April 1998, the deceased left the Club with Tu Phu Le. There had been some discussion of an acrimonious kind between them, Tu Phu Le telling the deceased that he should not have fought with the prisoner because the prisoner was older than the deceased. This discussion had continued to the point where outside the Club on the footpath, the deceased and Tu Phu Le were pushing at each other. 
    5   After a few moments the prisoner, having left the Club, rushed up to the deceased and Tu Phu Le holding a pistol which he deliberately fired at the deceased, killing him. One eye witness said that the prisoner said at the time of his killing the deceased said, ""Fuck your mum. You want to play with me?"". 
    6   A number of shots were fired, apparently four shots. Three of those shots seem to have hit the deceased. One shot hit Tu Phu Le causing a gutter injury to his head. The prisoner left the scene with the gun. 
    7   Tu Phu Le was admitted to hospital and, in the confusion, those who took him to the hospital were apparently arrested by the police. 
    8   The cause of death for the deceased was given as a gunshot wound to the head. The examiner observed three separate gunshot wounds, two to the head and one to the neck. 
    9   The prisoner apparently went to Melbourne. His sister said that he had come to her house in July 1998, stayed briefly and left his car in her garage. 
    10   A first instance warrant was issued for his arrest and upon him being notified of the police interest in him, he attended the Cabramatta Police Station on 4 November 1998 in company with his solicitor and surrendered himself. He has been in custody, bail refused, since that day. 
    11   The murder weapon has not been found. 
    12   Since he has been in custody referable only to these offences, the sentence that I will pass should date from that day. 
    13   It is apparent that the offence of murder was committed by his deliberate killing of his victim. The offence of malicious wounding was occasioned by his recklessness in firing a shot not intended to injure the victim. 
    14   It was common ground, so I was informed by both the learned Crown Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the defence, that at the time of the commission of these crimes the prisoner was intoxicated to an extent expressed by an eye witness to be ""middle drunk"". I take that description to be moderately, if not severely affected. 
    15   The objective facts of this crime show that the prisoner, albeit he might have been provoked to some extent by the actions of the deceased inside the Club and his anger aroused, as was submitted to me, by the actions of the deceased to Mr. Le, nonetheless had almost no cause of any reasonable kind to act in the way that he did. What he did was savage and apparently senseless. 
    16   There is, so I am told, nothing in his prior background and record which would suggest that such actions were in character. He was born on 24 October 1957 in Saigon and is now aged 42. He was one of a large number of children in his family which was poor, and from which the children went to work at an early age. After the fall of Saigon, having worked on a collective farm for a time, he escaped Vietnam and transited through a refugee camp in Malaya, coming to Australia as a refugee. He has become a citizen of this country and has been joined here by his family, in particular by his brother with whom he lived for some time prior to his marriage. 
    17   Having obtained initially other employment, he obtained employment with Streets Icecream being retrenched from that employment in September 1997 and living off the lump sum retrenchment moneys paid to him. He had married in 1993 and has two children; one born in 1994; one in 1996. 
    18   For 13 years prior to his marriage he had lived with brothers and sisters at Bossley Park. Subsequent to his retrenchment he has been unemployed and he has spent most of his time at the Mekong Club drinking and gambling. It was urged upon me that I should accept that he had an alcohol problem. 
    19   He had been, on the night in question, at the Club drinking for a lengthy period of time, that period being interrupted only by a short journey to his home for a meal. He had known the deceased, to what extent I am not informed, prior to the killing. 
    20   I am told that he has informed members of his family that he regrets his conduct and the shame that he has brought on his family; that he has severed all contact with his wife and children because of the shame that he feels; that in custody he has taken the view that he is at risk from associates of the deceased who are in custody and hence has, at least for the time being, caused himself to be placed in protective custody. 
    21   It was conceded that it was anger and intoxication that underlay his criminality that night. 
    22   An explanation has been given to me as to where the gun came from. I have been told that he had purchased the firearm two months before the killing for protection for himself and his family, the family having been threatened, and that there were drug dealers in the vicinity. He had found it necessary in his view, for his protection from whoever might be threatening him, to carry that gun, loaded apparently, with him at all times, including in the Mekong Club. 
    23   This explanation does not sit well with the suggestion that he is not a person of violent character. Persons not of a violent character usually resort to the authorities when threatened, rather than arming themselves with loaded firearms even on social occasions. 
    24   It is accepted that the plea and the surrender have great pragmatic value in avoiding an exacerbation of grief to the family of the deceased and cost to the community. It is clear that there is, accepted in the plea, in the circumstances of his surrender and the expressions that he made, a degree of contrition, particularly in the sense of sorrow for his crime and a clear intent to conform to what community standards might expect of a person in his circumstances. Albeit that he did not surrender himself for some six months after the shooting, it has nonetheless been conceded by the Crown that his actions in so pleading and in so surrendering should be treated as though he were to be afforded the maximum value for a plea of guilty when applying the principles expressed in s.439 of the Crimes Act (1900). 
    25   I accept the submission made that the plea and the circumstances of the surrender should receive that value, particularly for the pragmatic value to be attached to such conduct. That value, when taken in conjunction with the prisoner's otherwise blameless life in Australia and diligent work record, affords a circumstance of the greatest assistance to the prisoner but, nonetheless, it cannot be given such weight as to produce a sentence unduly disproportionate to the gravity of the crimes he has committed. 
    26   The culpability attached to a killing, albeit in hot blood and under some degree of intoxication, even if occasioned by reason of some element of provocation, is great. I cannot accept, however, that the plea is to be taken to be worth as much as it was suggested it might be when in submissions it was put to me that up to 30% should be allowed for it. Indeed, in my view in this case in particular, it is not necessary to quantify the plea and thereby assess its value discretely from the other circumstances of the case. 
    27   It was submitted to me that bearing in mind that the plea was offered at the first opportunity and that the malicious wounding was reckless, that crime added little to the totality of elements such that needed separate and particular evaluation on sentence, having been committed almost, as it were, incidentally to the prisoner's actions which resulted in the death of the deceased. So much might be accepted as far as the factual content of the submission goes, but it is necessary that regard be had to it as a separate offence, albeit in the circumstances it is entirely appropriate that I use my discretion to impose sentences which are to be concurrent. Further, since the minimum term of the total sentence I am minded to impose for the more serious crime will exceed the maximum for the crime of malicious wounding (which is seven years), I intend to impose a sentence for that crime by way of a fixed term. 
    28   Turning to the more serious offence. The maximum penalty prescribed by s.19A for the crime of murder in this state is life imprisonment. That sentence of life imprisonment, however, is reserved by s.431B for offences of extreme gravity as defined by that section. Otherwise the penalty is at large. Other offences in this State are punishable by up to a maximum of 25 years. In the case of murder and certain offences under the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act (1985), however, that maximum does not apply. 
    29   Having said that, it is to be accepted that I should be guided in the imposition of sentence not only by the particular facts and the objective culpability of the crime, but also the mitigatory matters arising from the personal circumstances of the prisoner and that range of sentences approved on appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal and passed by sentencing judges for this crime generally. 
    30   It was submitted to me by the prisoner's counsel that an appropriate range of sentence would have as its mean in the circumstances, a total sentence in the order of 15 years but that a minimum term, applying s.5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 should be imposed in consequence of the finding of special circumstances under s.5(2) so that the additional term would be longer than one-third of the minimum term. 
    31   My attention was drawn to the principles enunciated by the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v. The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525. In that decision the Court pointed out that the principles of sentencing, involving as they generally do the protection of society, general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution, weigh in the minimum term as they do in the overall sentence, but have a different significance when the separate components of the sentence are evaluated and particularly for ascertaining that period which a prisoner must serve before being permitted liberty. 
    32   So the prospects of rehabilitation, though not the only matter to consider, may weigh more heavily when defining the minimum term than they would when defining the total sentence. Nonetheless, when one comes to deciding whether there are special circumstances and given circumstances that might amount to special circumstances, whether an additional term should be longer than s.5(2) set, it is necessary to bear in mind that all the principles on which sentencing is based must receive due regard in the light of what was said in Bugmy (supra) when fixing the total sentence and fixing the minimum term. 
    33   It was urged upon me that the prisoner, being under protection at present, might well serve a sentence more onerous than might otherwise be the case. There is little reason to believe that this is not a matter that can be left safely in the hands of the prison authorities. There is no reason on what has been put to me, to expect that that condition might have to continue for any extensive period of time. 
    34   It was further urged that the prisoner had an alcohol problem. The Crown submitted there was nothing special about that in the context at least of this crime, and I accept the Crown submission. 
    35   It was put to me that the prisoner is a man of 42, with a prior blameless record, was going into custody for the first time, coming into that custody from a different cultural background to most prisoners, he being a refugee, estranged from his immediate family, albeit supported by his siblings. It was put that the sentence would inevitably be lengthy and that all of these considerations would bespeak the necessity for special assistance for a longer period of time at the conclusion of that sentence. Particularly my attention was drawn to the difficulty a person of his age would have in readjusting to society generally and obtaining employment, in particular, at the time of leaving gaol. 
    36   On behalf of the Crown however it was submitted that there was nothing special, in the sense of out of the ordinary, about this. I accept that those circumstances can be or could be, in an appropriate case, regarded as out of the ordinary, but that is not just what special circumstances under the section means. They mean such circumstances, out of the ordinary, as would produce a longer than usual period of by way of additional term for supervision and to serve the other purposes of an additional term, such as to provide an increased period of sanction during which the prisoner might be returned to custody, should the prisoner manifest any further anti-social behaviour. 
    37   The maximum period of supervision provided for by the Sentencing (General Regulation) (1996) upon the making of a parole order is three years, although the Board can extend that in an appropriate case for a further three years. 
    38   A paradox, of course, arises. If, as here, one is of the view that the prospects of rehabilitation seem to be high and that one is unable to say that there is, on the face of it, a real risk of further offences, particularly of the kind committed, then there seems little basis for requiring an additional term longer than the statute requires. Particularly is that the case when the sentence that one must pass, having regard to the gravity of the crime, is one where the additional term would be unlikely to exceed in length the maximum period for supervision on a normal, proportionate basis. 
    39   I am of the view that in the circumstances special circumstances as defined by the Act do not exist here. 
    40   Having heard submissions from both the Crown and the defence as to the appropriate range of sentence in the context of the prisoner's personal circumstances and as to the gravity of the crime, I have concluded that the appropriate sentence for the crime of murder is 16 years penal servitude, to date, as I have said, from 4 November 1998. That sentence to comprise a minimum term of 12 years to date from 4 November 1998 and to expire on 3 November 2010 and an additional term of four years to commence on 4 November 2010 and to expire on 3 November 2014. There will be, on the charge of malicious wounding, a concurrent sentence of a fixed term of three years, that will commence on 4 November 1998. 
    41   Madam interpreter have you explained what I have just said to the prisoner? 
    42   INTERPRETER: Yes I have interpreted everything your Honour. 
    43   HIS HONOUR: In that case would you rise please Mr. Ngoc. 
    44   I sentence you for the crime of murder to 16 years penal servitude, to comprise a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of 4 years, to commence and expire on the dates that I have referred to. You are also sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment for the offence of malicious wounding. That sentence is to be wholly concurrent with the sentence I have passed for the murder.

     REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
      
    HIS HONOUR: 1    On 18 August 1999 after a lengthy trial the Prisoner was convicted of having murdered his wife on 25 February 1997. He now stands for sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    2    Prior to coming to a conclusion as to the sentence to be imposed, I must come to such conclusions as I can, consistent with the verdict of the jury, bearing on the question of sentence. Before I rely on any such conclusion adverse to the Prisoner, I must be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. That said, it is not possible to reach some of the views I have formed to that level of satisfaction but as these are matters which operate in his favour. In respect of these latter matters, I shall indicate that my findings are on a more limited basis.  
     
      
       
      
    3    It was common ground that on the morning of 25 February 1997 the Prisoner and his wife had taken their children to school shortly after 9am , done some shopping, and had breakfast together at a restaurant at Bankstown. The Prisoner asserted that the two had then returned to their home for a limited period. The deceased’s body was found in a Padstow car park between the front of a parked car and a fence at about 11.15am that morning. It was also common ground that the Prisoner’s 4-wheel drive motor vehicle had been reversed into a car space adjacent to where the body was found in the preceding three-quarters of an hour or so.  
     
      
       
      
    4    No one saw the Prisoner kill the deceased. Both in the course of interviews with the police and in evidence, the Prisoner denied doing so and thus the circumstances of and reasons for her death can only be matters of inference.  
     
      
       
      
    5    Although it is clear that the deceased had bled and there was no blood found in the home of the deceased and the Prisoner, none in his car and no indication that the latter had been cleaned, the probability is that the deceased was killed at home and her body then carried in his car to the car-park. Factors pointing in that direction are that, at the time her body was found the deceased’s shoes were undone - the family practice was not to wear shoes in the house - the presence of a torn up Valentine’s day card and a picture frame in a rubbish bin at the house, and the fact that a pillow slip matching one found in the home was covering the deceased’s head at the time she was found. There were also tyre marks over the lawn leading to the back door. 
     
      
       
      
    6    At the time of the deceased’s death, she and her husband carried on a business of running two take-away food outlets, one principally managed by the deceased at Circular Quay and one principally managed by the Prisoner at Blacktown. I am satisfied that the takings of the Blacktown business which were banked in the second six months of 1996 were very substantially lower than they had been previously. 
     
      
       
      
    7    There was a deal of detailed evidence as to the financial situation of the business. I referred to this evidence in my summing up and do not think it necessary to carry out a detailed analysis of it here. The evidence satisfies me that, to a substantial degree, takings were being, as it were, siphoned off and not banked. The Prisoner gave explanation for the reduction in bankings and attributed this reduction to actions of his wife. 
     
      
       
      
    8    Sometime after the deceased’s death, the Prisoner wrote a suicide note in which he said “I have gambled my life away and my fortune” and it may well be that this is the explanation for the downturn in the bankings apparent from the Blacktown business. He gave evidence and told a psychiatrist that his gambling only became a problem after his wife’s death but, having regard to my views as to the Prisoner’s credibility, I am not disposed to accept these statements. Nor do I accept his evidence that it was his wife who was responsible for the those bankings being reduced, certainly to anything like the magnitude of the money that disappeared. 
     
      
       
      
    9    I am satisfied that the deceased was concerned at the financial situation of the Blacktown business. I am also satisfied that in the past and probable in the months leading up to her death, the deceased gave consideration to the possibility of divorcing the Prisoner and expressed thoughts to this effect. 
     
      
       
      
    10    There is a deal of evidence that, at least to outward appearance, the relationship between the deceased and the Prisoner was good and there is nothing to suggest that his killing of her was to any extent pre-meditated. Indeed the limited amount of time which elapsed between when they were seen at Bankstown and her body was discovered and the location and time at which her body was dumped - a public car park in broad daylight - leads me to the view that her death was not pre-meditated to any significant extent. I think the probability is that an argument developed after the Prisoner and his wife left Bankstown, that the argument commenced or continued at their home - the torn Valentine’s day card and picture frame so suggest - and it was in the course of, or in response to, that argument that the deceased was killed. I am not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her death occurred other than, as submitted by Mr Mulligan, in the course of an argument that got out of hand. The deceased’s concern at the financial situation of the Blacktown business and thoughts of divorce certainly provide possible bases for an argument. 
     
      
       
      
    11    On the other hand, the method of death - strangulation - satisfies me that at the time, the Prisoner intended to kill his wife. I am unable to understand how he might have only intended to do grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
       
      
    12    In arriving at the conclusions I have, I am not unconscious of the fact that the Prisoner’s actions in and about disposing of his wife’s body reveal a deal of care and that his actions in, for example, telephoning her place of work purportedly with the intention of speaking to her demonstrate a degree of conscious cunning. However, even though many and perhaps most people would not have reacted that way, those matters are explicable upon the basis of a desire to avoid the consequences of what had occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    13    Under the New South Wales Crimes Act the maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. However, the law is that that penalty is to be imposed only in cases which may be regarded as falling within “a worst type” of murder. Examples of that are premeditated contract killings, second or later offences, or where torture or great humiliation or pain has been inflicted on the victim. Those examples are not intended to be exhaustive. The circumstances I have outlined clearly do not come within a worst category. I was taken by the Crown Prosecutor to a number of prior decisions of the Court which lead to the conclusion that the usual range of sentences in the cases of a murder of a woman by a man, occurring in circumstances of a continuing or recently terminated relationship between them, reveals total sentences ranging from about 16 to about 22 years with minimum terms ranging from about 11 to 16 years.  
     
      
       
      
    14    I turn to the subjective circumstances of the Prisoner. He was born on 7 January 1958 in Hong Kong where he attended school until about the equivalent of year 9. He completed his schooling in year 12 at a Sydney High School. He joined a bank in early 1976 becoming a senior loans officer in 1987. He took some long leave in 1991 at which time he and his wife took over the running of one of the take-away businesses which was later acquired. He resigned from the bank in 1992 or 1993 and from that time onwards, his employment has been in running one or other of the take-away food businesses he and his wife, or their private company, has run. 
     
      
       
      
    15    He has two children, a daughter born in March 1987 and a son born in June 1991. There is one matter on his record which is of no significance for present purposes. 
     
      
       
      
    16    There was also tendered by the Crown a victim impact statement by Jean Mei, the sister of the deceased. I have read that statement but the use to which I can put it has been defined in R v Previtera (unreported, HUNT CJ AT CL, 27 May 1997)  
     
      
       
      
    17    On the Prisoner’s behalf was tendered a psychiatric report from Dr Canaris. I find little in that report of assistance. The only significant aspect is its reference to the Prisoner’s depression, evidenced also by his suicide note. These are matters to which the Jail Authorities should have regard. Any tendency towards depression I am sure will be exacerbated by the realisation that he will be separated from his children from much of their growing up years. 
     
      
       
      
    18    Evidence was also given by a person who had previously been the Prisoner’s superior at the bank at which he worked, who indicated that the Prisoner was a very valuable and efficient employee. 
     
      
       
      
    19    There is nothing in the circumstances of this case to indicate any likelihood that the Prisoner will offend again. Although the intent to kill which I have found argues against this conclusion, the lack of pre-meditation and the absence of any suggestion of violence in his past argue in favour of a sentence which is towards the lower end of the range to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      
    20    The sentence I impose is one of minimum term of 14 years penal servitude with an additional term of 4 years. The commencing date of the minimum term will be 28 July 1999, a date which reflects the date of 18 August 1999 when the Prisoner went into custody after the jury’s verdict and 3 weeks custody subsequent to his arrest. He will become eligible for parole on 28 July 2013.

    1    HIS HONOUR :  Barry Russell Nardoni pleaded guilty before me on indictment for manslaughter of Kylie Anne Neil.  
     
      
       
      
    2    The prisoner and the victim lived together in a de facto relationship in a tiny bedsitter flat in what appears to be have been a large complex of such dwellings made available by the Housing Commission in Northcliff Drive Warrawong. As at 25 July 1997 the prisoner was aged twenty six and the victim aged eighteen. They had commenced their association in Victoria but had led a somewhat nomadic existence which it is not necessary now to detail but it appears that they had at least formed an intention to stay for a time in the Wollongong area. They had some discussions with an acquaintance who was in occupation of a two bedroom flat about whether or not an exchange of their accommodation might not be able to be arranged.  
     
      
       
      
    3    I am satisfied that the relationship between the parties was substantially affected by the circumstance that neither of them followed any occupation and their time was largely spent imbibing intoxicating liquor and partaking of marijuana. The evidence leads me to suspect that other illicit substances may have been ingested from time to time but I am not satisfied of this to the requisite standard.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The violence of the prisoner towards Kylie Neil was evidenced by his appearance at Port Kembla Local Court on 13 May 1997 where he was fined for an offence of malicious injury and, significantly, placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years and to accept the supervision of the Parole and Probation Service for an assault upon Kylie Neil. That recognizance was current at the time of the killing. It is convenient to note at this point that the prisoner has a prior record including convictions in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. I do not regard his prior record as trivial but many of the offences are of nuisance type and none approach the seriousness of the conviction on the current indictment. 
     
      
       
      
    5    On Friday morning 25 July 1997 the prisoner and the victim acquired a slab of beer and a bottle of Cougar brand whiskey and began to drink it. They were joined towards midday by an acquaintance Norman Rausch who was despatched to the supermarket later to obtain a further ten bottles of beer after the original supplies of liquor had been completely consumed. By 5 pm in the afternoon or thereabouts I am satisfied that the parties could be described as being in an alcoholic fog. In that haze the prisoner became inspired to attack his de facto partner. I am unable to determine exactly what provoked his rage, if anything, but it is clear that he was exercising no control over his passion and violently attacking Kylie Neil. Another acquaintance Rachael Marrello was in a nearby flat and, as did others, she heard the sounds of the violent encounter. She heard Kylie Neil saying “I am trying to talk to you and you just keep bashing me”. She heard screaming and she came to investigate. She saw the prisoner striking the victim on many occasions once causing her to be forced into a screen door.  
     
      
       
      
    6    Rachael Marrello sought to rescue Kylie Neil. The two women quit the premises. They were followed by Norman Rausch but Miss Marrello remonstrated with him and guided her to a women’s refuge. Miss Marrello urged her to leave the prisoner but Miss Neil said that she stayed with him because he was faithful to her and did not “play up like other guys” with whom she had kept company. Miss Marrello’s comment was that nobody else would put up with the prisoner.  
     
      
       
      
    7    Whilst at the refuge Miss Neil complained of having a headache but understandably although tragically this was thought not to be of any great significance by the welfare worker who was present as there was the history of the attack and it was obvious that Miss Neil had consumed a considerable quantity of intoxicating liquor. She told people at the refuge that she had remembered a place where she could have some accommodation for the night. There was none available at the refuge. Police were called. They escorted her to a police vehicle and took her to premises in Matthews Crescent, Port Kembla. On the way she told police that she had simply had a blue with her boyfriend. It was apparent to police that she had been partaking of intoxicating liquor but they did not assess her as being abnormal in the sense of displaying signs of injury or medical distress. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The address at Port Kembla was in fact the flat belonging to Norman Rausch with whom she and the prisoner had been drinking earlier in the day. After Miss Neil had been dropped at the premises she encountered a woman Linda Sheppheard who was in possession of a key to the flat given to her by Norman Rausch. She was inside the flat with a friend Jason Collier. Miss Sheppheard answered a knock on the door and saw Kylie Neil whom she gauged to be intoxicated. She identified herself as Barry’s girlfriend - that is to say the girlfriend of the prisoner - and asked whether she could come in and wait for Norm (Rausch). She was told to wait outside because Miss Sheppheard and Mr Collier were going down the road. By this time it was dark. They left but returned half an hour later and found Kylie Neil still waiting in the foyer crying. In response to enquiry she said that Barry had belted her. She complained of a headache. Miss Sheppheard invited her to lie on Mr Rausch’s bed until he came home and then she (Miss Sheppheard) lay down on a mattress on the floor and went to sleep. Jason Collier was on a lounge near a window.  
     
      
       
      
    9    Some time in the middle of the night Norman Rausch came home. Miss Neil was moved from the bed but complained of cold and of an aching head. She camped on the floor where she was covered with some clothing for warmth. 
     
      
       
      
    10    On the Saturday morning Miss Sheppheard awoke and perceived that Kylie Neil was deceased. She and Jason Collier separately left and advised Norman Rausch to ring an ambulance and the police. This he did. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Post mortem examination showed that there had been a head injury to the right side of the face between the eye and the ear which had caused a depressed skull fracture as well as distortion of the brain and tonsillar herniation. The pathologist certified head injury as a direct cause of death, the effects of cannabis and alcohol as other significant conditions contributing to the death. 
     
      
       
      
    12    As I sought to emphasize at the sentencing hearing, I have accepted the plea of guilty by the prisoner as indicating an acknowledgment that an unlawful and dangerous act by him in battering the victim caused her death and, in his presence, that acknowledgment was affirmed by counsel. It is also important to bear in mind that the count in the indictment does not involve any allegation of intent by the prisoner to cause really serious injury. 
     
      
       
      
    13    It is not possible to identify any particular blow struck by the prisoner which caused the death. The prisoner accepts however that it was his attack upon her which was causative of the death and although his memory of the events is fogged both by extravagant consumption of intoxicating liquor and later partaking in smoking of cannabis he has through his counsel explicitly accepted that I should look to the evidence of witnesses as to what occurred rather than to his own recollection (possibly reconstructed) of milder aggression such as he has described to police and other enquirers. 
     
      
       
      
    14    An extract from a letter by the prisoner handed up at the sentencing proceedings includes these statements: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I understand completely the trouble I am in. When I was told of Kylie’s death I was very shocked. For the past two years, I have pleaded my innocence. I know I was very drunk that day, and cannot remember exactly what happened. But when I heard or seen in my police brief that a man who lived under the house where she was found told of hearing two sets of four to five thumps on his ceiling, right at the time of death and when they said Kylie’s g-string underwear were on back to front, I just freaked out and thought the worst. And not to mention the different stories of the people that were in the house at the time. But now I have had time to think, I really have no idea if Kylie could have struck her head on anything. My mind has been very clouded since that day and because I have admitted to assault I must stand up and take responsibility for my action.” 
         
        
       
      
    15    I have made some obvious corrections to the text of the letter. The prisoner goes on to express his confidence in divine omniscience and justice. 
     
      
       
      
    16    Some matters referred to in that text merit elaboration. The reference to thumps on the ceiling is to a statement by a Mr Goodyear who was resident in the flat immediately below Mr Rausch that is to say in the flat within which during the night the deceased, Linda Sheppheard and Jason Collier were present later joined by Norman Rausch himself. There is nothing in the material which would enable determination of what exactly Mr Goodyear was hearing. Certainly Kylie Neil was at some stage moved from the bed onto the floor but there was a separation in the group of noises and indeed they were so loud that Mr Goodyear inserted ear plugs in order to enable himself to sleep. Jason Collier is now said to be also deceased. A further statement from Linda Sheppheard reveals that about a week after the death she encountered Jason Collier who revealed to her that he had slept with the victim on the night that she died. By his statement he obviously meant that he had had sexual intercourse. Post mortem examination had detected semen on vaginal smears and these had been subjected to DNA tests. These tests affirmatively demonstrated that the source could not have been the prisoner.  
     
      
       
      
    17    It may be said that, given the prisoner’s plea of guilty, these circumstances are not now directly relevant but in my view they add very powerful enhancement to the value of the demonstration of contrition manifest in the plea of guilty. I do not think it necessary for me to spell out why I come to that view. As I have indicated, I regard this as a case where a finding of remorse can be made and I make it with considerably more confidence than could be the case if I were left to rely upon subjective matters alone.  
     
      
       
      
    18    That leads me to turn to some subjective matters concerning the prisoner. He had the disadvantage of early life in an unstable family situation although within the community this is regrettably not unusual. When the family split however, he for a time joined his father who went to England whilst his sisters remained with his mother. In the course of time he came back to Australia but by the age of fourteen he was virtually living as an itinerant moving from the streets into accommodation at charitable hostels and the like. He descended into alcoholism and very substantial use of marijuana. He has claimed that any use of other drugs was no more than experimental. 
     
      
       
      
    19    By the time of the death of Kylie Neil the prisoner’s life was at a low ebb and his existence had a pointlessness about it. Kylie Neil had joined him at that level and whilst I do not regard that as a matter of culpability I believe he should recognize and does recognize his responsibility to an extent for that situation. 
     
      
       
      
    20    I have seen the prisoner several times now in Court. It is difficult to coordinate his appearance with the descriptions of him as at mid 1997. I have read the report of the psychologist Ms. Barrier and I note her assessments of his personality traits. I am impressed with his assertions of intent towards rehabilitation made to the probation and parole officer and I find some support for that impression in the conduct of the prisoner during a period of bail during last year and until earlier this year. He has re-established contact with his mother who has remarried and settled in Queensland. Whilst on bail he resided with her and he obtained employment in a bakery manufacturing pies and seems to have diligently applied himself to that employment. It is his expressed hope upon release to return to Queensland and his mother has indicated her preparedness to have him. 
     
      
       
      
    21    I consider the prisoner’s prospects of successful rehabilitation to be reasonable, indeed reasonably good but given his long unpromising background, it is in my view desirable that he have an extended period of close supervision whilst on parole. For that reason I hold that there are special circumstances justifying the extension of the additional term component of sentence beyond that which would emerge from direct application of the formula in s5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
     
      
       
      
    22    Despite these good impressions, I must not overlook that life has been extinguished by the act of the prisoner and it is an aggravating circumstance that his offence was committed whilst on a recognizance which specifically related to attack by him upon her. Whilst I do not regard his prior record as gross, it disentitles him to leniency which might otherwise be made available if it did not exist. 
     
      
       
      
    23    The prisoner was in custody from arrest on 30 July 1997 until released on bail on 4 February 1998. He was returned to custody on 18 April 1999 and has remained there. Until today he has on my calculation been in custody for one year and thirty two days. 
     
      
       
      
    24    The total sentence imposed upon the prisoner must reflect the objective seriousness of his offence but the orders made should be such as to encourage the prisoner to continue his seemingly remarkable efforts towards rehabilitation. I mention in that regard that I take into account in his favour the content of the letter from Reverend Richard Howarth. I should also record that I have read the content of the victim impact statement but in accordance with published authority I do not utilize its content to aggravate my assessment of appropriate penalty.  
     
      
       
      
    25    I have come to the conclusion that in all the circumstances an appropriate sentence is six years penal servitude. This I will reduce to five years to take into account previous custody. I am conscious that that period of pre-sentence custody exceeds one year by thirty two days. The assessment of six years represents a considerable reduction from what I would regard as objectively appropriate for the taking of life whilst in a drunken rage. My conclusion, taking all matters into account, is that I should impose a sentence of five years from today. 
     
      
       
      
    26    Barry Russell Nardoni, for the manslaughter of Kylie Neil you are sentenced to penal servitude for five years to consist of a minimum term of two years commencing today 12 November 1999 and to expire on 11 November 2001 together with an additional term of three years to commence on 12 November 2001. 
     
      
       
      
    27    You will be eligible for parole on 12 November 2001.

     REGINA v Wilfred Lawson REID 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   SULLY J: Before the Court is a case stated, pursuant to section 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), by his Honour Judge R. N. Howie QC of the District Court of New South Wales. His Honour has stated the case at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW).  
    2   His Honour states in the case, and as follows, the relevant facts: 
     
      
       
       “2. Facts 
       
      
      
       
       2.1 On 25 January 1996 the appellant was charged with the offences of negligent driving, offensive language and assault arising out of a motor vehicle accident at Moruya on 13 January 1996. 
       
      
      
       
       2.2 The appellant pleaded not guilty but was convicted and fined on each charge following a hearing before the Local Court at Moruya on 24 May 1996. During the course of the hearing Alexander John Becchio was called as a witness in the case for the appellant and gave evidence exculpatory of the appellant. 
       
      
      
       
       2.3 Evidence was led before me on behalf of the Crown from which it would be open to conclude as follows: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) At some time before the matters referred to in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 came on for hearing before the Local Court the appellant approached Mr. Becchio, who was a personal friend of his at the time, and said: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          “I need a witness, what do you say Becchio?” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Becchio replied; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          “Well, I don’t like it, but yes, seeing you’re a good friend I’ll be a witness for you.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) In fact, Mr. Becchio had not observed any of the incidents which gave rise to the charges referred to in paragraph 2.1. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) Soon after, Mr. Becchio had a conversation with the appellant at the appellant’s home, allegedly in the presence of the appellant’s wife, in which the appellant indicated to Mr. Becchio the evidence which he would be required to give as a witness. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) Shortly after, the appellant, the appellant’s wife and Mr. Becchio travelled to the scene of the accident and further discussed the facts and circumstances of the collision in order that Mr. Becchio would be able to give plausible evidence in relation to the matter. (T.13-14, 38) 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (v) Some time later Mr. Becchio attended the office of the solicitor who was acting for the appellant and made a statement of the evidence which he was able and willing to give. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (vi) As above stated in paragraph 2.2 at the Local Court hearing on 24 May 1996 Mr. Becchio gave evidence on behalf of the appellant. Notwithstanding that evidence, the appellant was convicted and fined in respect of each charge. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (vii) Following the Local Court proceedings the appellant and Mr. Becchio had a falling out over an unrelated matter. They later made up to some extent. However when Mr. Becchio was informed by the appellant that he was going to appeal to the District Court against his convictions referred to in paragraph 2.2 he became upset and concerned that he would have to give false evidence again. Therefore, on 10 February 1997 Mr. Becchio attended Bateman’s Bay Police Station and informed Police that he had committed perjury in the Local Court proceedings at Moruya referred to in paragraph 2.2 He participated in an electronically recorded interview and gave full details of the perjury. Mr. Becchio subsequently was charged with one count of perjury, to which he pleaded guilty at Moruya Local Court on 7 November 1997. He was convicted and fined for this offence. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (viii) I noted the appellant subsequently withdrew his appeals to the District Court against the convictions referred to in paragraph 2.2 when those proceedings came before me (with the proceedings in question) at the Moruya District Court on 17 February 1999. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       2.4 As a consequence of the disclosures by Mr. Becchio the appellant was charged with the offence, particulars of which are set out in paragraph 1. 
       
      
      
       
       2.5 During the course of the proceedings before me I sought and received submissions from Counsel as to whether the evidence in the matter, if accepted by me, could properly form the basis for proof of an offence under s.323.” 
       
      
    3   The “appellant” to whom Howie DCJ refers in the foregoing statement of facts, is Mr. Wilfred Lawson Reid. The charge preferred against Mr. Reid, being a charge in respect of which he was convicted at the Wollongong Local Court on 12 November 1998, was a charge laid under section 323(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The terms of the charge were as follows: 
     
      
       
       “That Wilfred Lawson Reid on 24th May 1996, at Moruya, did with intent, cause and persuade Alexander John Becchio, a witness, to give false evidence as a witness in a judicial proceeding.” 
       
      
    4   Mr. Reid appealed to the District Court against his conviction and against the sentence imposed upon him as a result of his conviction. It was this appeal that came before Howie DCJ, and which gives rise to the present stated case.  
    5   On 18 February 1999 Howie DCJ indicated that his Honour was of a mind to allow the appeal and dismiss the information. His Honour published reasons for that proposed judgment. Before his Honour actually pronounced an order dismissing the appeal, he was asked to state the present case. 
    6   The essential reasoning of Howie DCJ is set out in the stated case, and as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Grounds of Judgment 
       
      
      
       
       3.1 In my opinion s.323 addresses the situation where a person intentionally tries to interfere with the administration of justice which is underway, by attempting to interfere with a person who is then a witness or who is intended at the time of the interference to be a witness in judicial proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       3.2 On the other hand s.333 of the Crimes Act deals with subornation of perjury and addresses the situation were the person is not, at the time of the subornation, a witness. 
       
      
      
       
       3.3 The question to be determined, therefore, was whether Mr. Becchio was a person to be called as a witness for the purposes of s.323(a). 
       
      
      
       
       3.4 I rejected a submission for the Crown that from the moment Mr. Becchio was asked to give false evidence for the appellant and agreed to do so, that he thereupon became “a witness” in the judicial proceedings. In my opinion the earliest stage at which he could be considered to be such a witness occurred when he provided a statement to the appellant’s solicitor. 
       
      
      
       
        There was no evidence before me of any act done by the appellant in respect of Mr. Becchio, or the evidence that he might or might not give, after he was a witness to be called in the proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       3.5 I concluded therefore that Mr. Becchio was not a witness, for the purposes of s.323(a), at any time when the appellant was said to have procured, persuaded, induced or caused him to give false evidence.” 
       
      
    7   Section 323 of the Crimes Act provides, so far as is at present relevant, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “323. A person who does any act: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) intending to procure, persuade, induce or otherwise cause any person called or to be called as a witness in any judicial proceedings to give false evidence or withhold true evidence ……………..; 
       
      
      
       
        is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.” 
       
      
    8   Section 333 of the Crimes Act provides, so far as is at present relevant, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “333(1) A person who procures, persuades, induces or otherwise causes a person to give false testimony the giving of which is perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury and liable to imprisonment for 7 years. ……………………..:” 
       
      
    9   An offence of perjury is created by section 327 of the Crimes Act. It is there provided, so far as is at present relevant, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “327(1) Any person who in or in connection with any judicial proceedings makes any false statement on oath concerning any matter which is material to the proceeding, knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true, is guilty of perjury and liable to penal servitude for 10 years………………………….” 
       
      
    10   Section 323 appears in Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act; and sections 333 and 327 appear in Division 4 of the same Part. Division 3 is headed: “Interference with judicial officers, witnesses, jurors etc.”; while Division 4 is entitled: “Perjury, false statements etc.”. 
    11   The judgment of Howie DCJ turns, as the resolution of the question stated by his Honour will turn, upon the correct understanding of the concept, as embodied in section 323(a), of “any person ………… to be called as a witness in any judicial proceeding”. There are two relevant Australian decisions; and there is relevant English authority. 
    12   The first of the Australian decisions is that of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal, (Thomas, Williams and Lee JJ), in R v Danahay [1993] 1 Qd. R 271. 
    13   That case concerned the construction of section 127(1) of the Queensland Criminal Code which provided, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Any person who ………………. offers to give …………… any ………benefit ………. to………….any person, upon any agreement or understanding that any person called or to be called as a witness in any judicial proceeding shall give false testimony or withhold true testimony …………. is guilty of a crime ……… ….” 
       
      
    14   Thomas J dealt as follows with the point here in question: 
     
      
       
       “The first submission for the appellant is that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that at the material time ………….(the relevant witness) ……… was about to be called as a witness in a judicial proceeding. I do not think that such a matter needs to be proved as an objective fact upon an indictment under s.127(1). It is only within the context of the understanding that such a matter needs to be proved. If the proffered agreement or understanding is in relation to a person identified in the agreement or understanding as one who is called or to be called as a witness, the offence may be made out whether or not he is ever actually called or to be called as a witness. It is enough that the person making the offer and the putative witness understand that he is to be called. It follows that it was unnecessary for the prosecution to prove that ………. (the relevant witness) …………was in fact ‘about to be called as a witness’. Plainly the understanding of the parties at the material times was that he was to be so called. ……………….”  
       (at 273 (25) - (35) ) 
       
      
    15   Williams J approached the matter in a somewhat different way. His Honour’s reasoning, - (it is at 279(5) - (40) ), - appears to depend upon the particular facts of the case. The witness in question in Danahay had been an eye-witness to the alleged criminal offences. Williams J describes him as a person who “in the ordinary course of events ………… ought to have been called by the prosecution”. The name of the witness had been notified in the bail conditions as that of a potential witness at any hearing; and he had actually been served with a subpoena requiring his attendance at Court for the purpose of giving evidence. 
    16   Williams J does observe, however, that particular acts and statements of the appellant Danahay were such as to be capable, at the very least, of being considered by a jury as establishing to the requisite standard that Danahay had regarded the relevant witness “as a person who was to be called as a witness and was dealing with him as such”.  
    17   Williams J does make the following particular observations about the relevant test: 
     
      
       
       “The test determining whether or not a person is ‘to be called as a witness’ cannot be whether or not that person was subsequently in fact called as a witness. If, as happened here, the accused person pleaded guilty that could hardly absolve a person from criminal responsibility for conduct already completed of corrupting a witness who would have been called if the matter went to trial. The gravamen of the offence is the corrupting of a witness; whether the inducement is effective or not - for any reason - is beside the point. That is the rationale behind all the common law decisions on analogous offences …………. .” 
       
      
    18   The reasoning of the third member of the Court, Lee J, does not seem to me to parallel exactly the reasoning of either Thomas J or Williams J. It seems to me, however, that Lee J was, like Williams J, largely influenced in his Honour’s ultimate view by the facts of the particular case as I have earlier summarised them. The essence of the relevant portion of Lee J’s reasoning is caught, I think, in the following extract from his Honour’s judgment: 
     
      
       
       “Whilst the sub-section is not free of difficulty, and possibly suggests that the contemplated calling of the witness should not be too remote in point of time in relation to the offer, particularly when the word ‘about’ is added to the charge, I agree generally with the submission that the words ‘then to be called’ (or ‘then about to be called’), mean then ‘intended’ to be called as a witness There was ample evidence to support this conclusion.” 
        (at 292(5) ) 
       
      
    19   The decision in Danahay was considered by this Court, - (constituted by Gleeson CJ, Finlay and Simpson JJ), - in Reg v Lansdell: CCA (NSW); unreported; 22 May 1995. 
    20   The relevant views of Gleeson CJ are found at pages 6 and 7 of his Honour’s judgment. His Honour there expresses the view that “(t)he meaning of the expression is to be found in the legislative purpose of the section. The offence is aimed at preventing the corruption or improper influencing of witnesses, and the critical element is the intention with which the alleged offender has acted.”. The Chief Justice went on to observe that it was “………….unnecessary, and undesirable, to formulate a comprehensive statement of what will be necessary, or sufficient, for a conclusion that, in a given case, someone satisfies the description of a person to be called as a witness”. His Honour’s view was that in Lansdell, as in Danahay, the given facts were such that it was not necessary to resolve what his Honour described as “some difference in the approach taken by the members of the Court in Danahay as to whether the objective element mentioned is necessary or whether the test is purely subjective, and related solely to the understanding and intention of the accused”. That said, however, his Honour added the following observations: 
     
      
       
       “There is much to be said for the view, preferred by Thomas J, that the test is purely subjective, and that it is the understanding and intention of the person exerting the corrupt influence, rather than the objective likelihood that one or other party to future proceedings will take a particular course, that matters. However, that question should await resolution in a case where it arises on the facts.” 
       
      
    21   Finlay J expressed a simple concurrence with the views expressed by the Chief Justice.  
    22   The principal judgment of the Court was written by Simpson J. Her Honour explores in much greater detail the question that is central to the present particular case. The relevant portions of her Honour’s judgment appear at pages 40-43 of her Honour’s judgment. 
    23   The core of her Honour’s reasoning as now relevant is contained in the following passage taken from page 42 of her Honour’s judgment: 
     
      
       
       “What must be recognised in the analysis of the argument on behalf of the appellant is that it may be the very act of the person accused which converts, or is designed to convert, a person into a person ‘to be called as a witness’. It is quite wrong to say that the offence is not committed unless the person has been designated as such a person. The section is broad enough to include a person who, absent the very act constituting the offence with which the person accused is charged, is not a person called or to be called as a witness, but who, by reason of that act, becomes such a person, or is intended, by the act, to become such a person.” 
       
      
    24   The foregoing discussion of authority can be supplemented usefully by a brief reference to a decision of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal: Panayiotou and Antoniades (1973) 57 Cr.App.R 762. The allegation made against the two accused persons in that case was, put shortly, that they had offered money and other material inducements to a particular woman in order to induce her to withdraw an allegation which she had made to the police that one of the two accused had sexually assaulted her. The basic question on the hearing of the appeal was said to be “whether ……….(the woman in question) ……is to be regarded as a witness or a prosecutor”. 
    25   The judgment of the Court contains the following expression of opinion: 
     
      
       
       “In our judgment, the question whether a person is to be treated as a witness or not can only be answered by having regard to the proceedings contemplated. If a person has made a statement with a view to the provision of evidence in support of criminal proceedings, certainly in that case such a person in relation to those proceedings is a witness, and it is a perversion of the course of justice as to offer him (or her) an inducement to alter or withdraw the statement.” ( 
       at 766, 767) 
       
      
    26   Applying all that has thus far been said to the given facts of the present case, I would reason as follows: 
     
      
     (1) It is, in my opinion, erroneous to contrast sections 323 and 333, and to base upon that contrast a proposition that facts sufficient to support a conviction for an offence against section 333 cannot be sufficient, in a particular case, to found equally well a conviction for an offence against section 323(a). I do not see in the language of either section language that would justify a conclusion that the two sections are mutually exclusive. There is nothing that I can see in the relevant legislative background, - (it is summarised helpfully by Simpson J at pages 40-42 of her Honour’s judgment in  
     Lansdell 
     ), - to warrant a contrary conclusion. 
      
      
     (2) There is in section 323(a) nothing to indicate a legislative intent that it is only a witness, or an intended witness, for the prosecution, who is to come within the purview of the section.  
      
      
     (3) The basic question for present purposes is not whether Mr. Reid might lawfully have been convicted of an offence against section 333. The basic question is whether he was liable, on the given facts, to lawful conviction for an offence against section 323(a). In that context, I consider that the views expressed by Thomas J in  
     Danahay 
      are logically convincing. I am strengthened in that view by the provisional endorsement of those views by Gleeson CJ in  
     Lansdell 
     ; and by the general thrust of the reasoning of Simpson J in the latter case. 
      
      
     (4) Applying those principles to the given facts of the present case, I am of the opinion that there is ample evidence to support a conviction of Mr. Reid for an offence against section 323(a). When Mr. Reid did the act particularised at 2.3(i) of the stated case, he intended that, if Mr. Becchio were agreeable to give false evidence in aid of Mr. Reid’s case at the forthcoming Local Court hearing, then he, Mr. Reid, would call Mr. Becchio as a witness in his case, and for the purpose of giving that false evidence in aid of that case. 
      
     Once Mr. Becchio accepted the proposal of Mr. Reid, then he became, in my opinion, a person intended  
     “to be called as a witness” 
      in the sense contemplated by section 323(a). Mr. Reid, having secured Mr. Becchio’s agreement to appear as a witness, undoubtedly intended thereupon to call Mr. Becchio in fact as such a witness. It is equally clear, in my opinion, that Mr. Becchio, having accepted Mr. Reid’s proposal, intended thereupon to make himself available for the purpose that Mr. Reid had proposed. 
      
      
     (5) Thereafter, each of the acts done by Mr. Reid as particularised in 2.3(iii), (iv) and (v) of the stated case, was an act of the kind contemplated by section 323(a). Each such act done by Mr. Reid in order to procure a witness who would give false evidence was, in my opinion, an act corrupting public justice in exactly the way at which section 323(a) is intended to strike. 
      
    27   Howie DCJ has put to the Court, in his Honour’s stated case, the following precise question: 
     
      
       
       “…………(W)hether, for the reasons stated, I erred in law in concluding that at the relevant time Mr. Becchio was not a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceeding for the purposes of s.323(a).” 
       
      
    28   In my opinion that question should be answered: yes; and the stated case should be remitted to his Honour with that expression of opinion.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    29   HULME J: Subject to one matter, I agree with the order proposed by Sully J and with His Honour’s Reasons. 
    30   My reservation is that I wish to make it clear that I am not endorsing that portion of the remarks of Simpson J in R v Lansdell (unreported, CCA, 22 May 1995) wherein Her Honour said “but who, by reason of that act, becomes such a person, or is intended, by the act, to become such a person” and quoted by Sully J at paragraph 23. 
    31   It seems to me that included within the essential ingredients of s323 of the Crimes Act are:- 
     
      
       
       (i) The doing of an act by the offender, 
        
       (ii) with an intention which includes that false evidence will be given or true evidence withheld by, 
        
       (iii) a second person who answers the description “called or to be called” as a witness… 
       
      
    32   One can only determine the issue of whether that second person is “to be called” by looking at the intention of someone having control or influence over the presentation of the proceedings. I incline to the view, that at the time the act is done by the suggested offender, the second person must answer the description “called or to be called” and it is not sufficient that that person is someone who merely might be called, even if that possibility will become a matter of likelihood or intention once he or she indicates willingness to participate in the corrupt conduct suggested. 
    33   The acts done by Mr Reid as particularised in paragraphs 2.3(iii), (iv) and (v) of the Stated Case occurred at a time when Mr Becchio answered the description of a witness “to be called” by Mr Reid.

    34   HIDDEN J: I also agree with Sully J. I share Hulme J’s reservation about the passage quoted from the judgment of Simpson J in Lansdell. However, the matter does not need to be resolved for the purposes of this case.

     SPIGELMAN CJ  DUNFORD J ` HIDDEN J  26 November 1999 
     
     Regina v Bao Vinh Ha 
       
      
      
     Judgment 
    1     SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Mr Justice Hidden to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    2     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Bao Vinh Ha, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to two charges: firstly, being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a trafficable quantity of heroin and, secondly, being in possession of prohibited imports, being also a trafficable quantity of heroin. On the first charge he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, on the second charge to 4 years imprisonment, and a non-parole period of 8 years was fixed. 
     
      
       
      
    3     Shortly stated, the facts are these. The applicant came to this country with his family from Vietnam in 1987, when he was about seventeen years old. In due course he became an Australian citizen. However, he did not sever his links with his country of origin, and in 1996 he opened a coffee lounge in Ho Chi Minh City and apparently became involved in another business venture in that city. For that reason he travelled frequently between Australia and Vietnam. 
     
      
       
      
    4     In 1997 he sent a quantity of heroin to Australia by post. The heroin was in heat-sealed plastic bags contained in envelopes which were addressed to one or other of two post office boxes, one of which was in his name and the other in the name of his fiancee. Between March and June 1997 police retrieved a total of twenty such envelopes. The gross weight of the heroin in them was 449.7 grams with an average purity of 70.7 per cent, yielding a total quantity of pure heroin of 317.9g. This was the subject of the first count. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The second count arose from a search of the applicant’s home in Sydney conducted by police in September 1997. Police found fifteen heat-sealed plastic bags identical to those which had been found secreted in the envelopes. They contained 123g of heroin of a purity of about 70.8 per cent, yielding 87.72g of pure heroin. In addition, police found in a glass jar a further 206.3g of heroin of a purity of about 67.4 per cent, yielding 139g pure. The total gross weight of the heroin when seized was 779.9g; the total amount of pure heroin was 544.6g. 
     
      
       
      
    6     In evidence before his Honour the applicant claimed to have been approached in Ho Chi Minh City by a man, of whom he could only supply a first name, who offered to assist him to obtain a liquor licence if he would provide in Australia a post office box for the receipt of parcels. His Honour rejected that account and that rejection has not been challenged in this Court. His Honour concluded that the applicant was either the sole operator or one of the principals in the venture, and he sentenced him on the basis that he was not a mere courier. 
     
      
       
      
    7     The applicant is now twenty-eight years old and has no prior convictions. In this country he has a creditable background in terms of his education and employment. He has enjoyed the continuing support of his family and, I gather, of his fiancee. He expressed remorse, which his Honour accepted as genuine. 
     
      
       
      
    8     His Honour intended the twelve year sentence in respect of the first count to embrace the criminality of both charges, observing that they arose from a continuing course of conduct. The question is whether that effective sentence is manifestly excessive for those offences involving, as they do, a total quantity of pure heroin of 545g in round figures. 
     
      
       
      
    9     The trafficable quantity for the purposes of the legislation is 2g and the commercial quantity is 1.5kg. Accordingly, the quantity here falls into the lower range of trafficable quantities, although towards the middle of it. 
     
      
       
      
    10     Senior counsel for the applicant referred, amongst other cases, to the decision of this Court in R v Doan (unreported, 27 September 1996) and, in particular, to the schedule of comparable cases attached to the judgment of the then Chief Judge at Common Law in that case. The cases in that schedule were concerned with the importation of trafficable quantities of heroin in amounts ranging from 18g to 863g and the sentences imposed ranged from 5 to 9 years. It is not apparent on the face of the schedule that those cases are confined to cases involving couriers, but I have always understood that to be so and it makes sense, given that Doan itself was a case involving a courier. 
     
      
       
      
    11     This case, of course, is different because of his Honour’s finding that the applicant was a principal or the principal as the case may be. 
     
      
       
      
    12     The recent decision of the High Court in R v Olbrich (1999) 166 ALR 330 does not alter the fact that in many cases the role of the person in the importation and, in particular, whether the person might be classified as a courier or a principal remains of importance. 
     
      
       
      
    13     In any event, when one looks to previous decisions of this Court for guidance in a particular case, it has to be recognised that most of those decisions were based upon the assumption that the determination of the offender’s role was essential and the classification of an offender as a courier or principal was one invariably embarked upon. That being so, the schedule of cases in Doan has to be viewed in light of the fact, as I understand it, that all were cases involving couriers. 
     
      
       
      
    14     That said, the present sentence of 12 years appears to me to be more appropriate for a principal in the importation of heroin at the top of the trafficable range or at the bottom of the commercial range. That appears from the cases referred to by this Court in R v Bernier (1998) 102 ACrim R 44 at 48. It is also consistent with the Judicial Commission’s statistics provided to us this morning by senior counsel for the applicant. Counsel for the Crown indicated that recent research had not suggested that that view should be modified in any way. 
     
      
       
      
    15     That being so, it does appear to me that the sentence in the present case is manifestly excessive. I put to one side the applicant’s prior good character and his pleas of guilty which are common features of cases of this kind. The fact remains that the quantity involved in the two offences, while significant, is nowhere near the top of the trafficable range. For that reason I am of the view that his Honour did fall into error and that it falls to this Court to re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    16     Having regard to the quantity involved and to the other favourable subjective features, I am of the view that the appropriate effective sentence is imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6½ years. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Accordingly, the orders I would propose are that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed, the sentence imposed by his Honour on the first count be quashed but the sentence imposed by his Honour on the second count be affirmed. 
     
      
       
      
    18     On the first count I would propose that the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years to date from 30 September 1997, and that with respect to the two sentences a non-parole period of 6½ years be fixed. 
     
      
       
      
    19     SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and generally with his reasons. I would, however, not wish to determine on this occasion the proposition that his Honour put to the effect that 12 years was appropriate for a principal at the top of the trafficable range or the bottom of the commercial range. I should note that the cases referred to in the judgment of the Court in R v Bernier (1998) 102 ACrim R 44 at 48 to which his Honour made reference in the course of his reasons were not supplemented in any way by the Crown on this occasion. Indeed, counsel appearing for the Crown indicated that enquiries had been made and that no additional cases could be put before the Court for the purposes of determining the present case. 
     
      
       
      
    20     I am, however, of the view that the significance always attached to the quantity in sentencing for offences of this character was not given appropriate weight by his Honour and, therefore, that the sentence was excessive to the extent identified by Justice Hidden. I agree, that in the exercise of this Court’s discretion, the sentence proposed by Justice Hidden is the appropriate one. 
     
      
       
      
    21     DUNFORD J: I agree with the orders proposed and generally with the reasons given by Hidden J and I also share the reservations expressed by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
       
      
    22     SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as indicated by Justice Hidden.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60675/98 DUNFORD J GREG JAMES J SMART AJ 26 NOVEMBER 1999 
     
     R v John SERRATORE 
      
     HEADNOTE 
     
     
     The appellant was convicted of the murder of his ex-girlfriend. The indictment comprised a single count charging that the appellant ""did murder"" the deceased, but the Crown put its case on the alternative basis that either the appellant killed the deceased himself or he arranged for someone else to do so.  
      
     The appellant and the deceased had been in a relationship since about 1993. It was a volatile relationship, marked by violence, obsessiveness and jealousy on the part of the appellant. Following a number of incidents, an Apprehended Violence Order was made against the appellant in November 1994, and the relationship ceased for a period but was resumed sometime in late 1994 or early in 1995 and they were seen together on a number of occasions, but in late February the deceased told her mother she intended to end the relationship. There was evidence of a telephone call on the evening of 28 March in which she agreed to meet the appellant the following day on her way home. The next day the deceased did not come home or call, and her partly decomposed body was found on 2 April 1995. 
      
     There was evidence that the appellant had left work early on 29 March (the day of the deceased's disappearance), that fibres from the carpet in the appellants motor vehicle matched those found on the soles of the deceased's boots when her body was found, and that she most likely died late on 29 March. 
      
     There was also evidence that in late 1994 the appellant had asked one BR to kidnap and kill the deceased and when BR refused, the appellant said ""You don't think this is going to stop me, I'll get her six months later"", and in about late February 1995 he said to BR, ""Don't think I've forgotten about it, I'm still going to do it"". 
      
     The appellant at all times denied any involvement in the death of the deceased and in particular denied the conversations with BR, denied that he had arranged to meet her on 29 March, denied he left work early that day and called expert witnesses who disputed the Crown's evidence as to the date of death, and the identification of the fibres on the deceased's boots. 
      
     The case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. The jury was directed that before they could convict the appellant on either basis of the Crown case they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of four ""essential circumstances"". Namely: 
      
      1. That on the evening of 28 March 1995, the deceased and the appellant arranged to meet on the following evening. 
       
      2. That the appellant left work early on 29 March 1995. 
       
      3. That the deceased was killed on 29 March 1995. 
       
      4. That the deceased was in the accused's motor vehicle shortly before her death. 
      
     A number of grounds of appeal were relied on by the appellant, including: 
    1. The indictment was defective and the Crown should have been required to plead the alternative methods of murder in separate counts, one charging the appellant as a principal and one charging him as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory before the fact.2. The trial judge erred in:· admitting hearsay evidence, and · refusing to admit into evidence a police running sheet relating to a witness who gave evidence of seeing a person she identified as the deceased alive in a motor vehicle on 31 March 1995.3. The trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it:· would be dangerous to convict on the evidence before the jury; and· could be dangerous to accept the evidence of certain specified witnesses.4. There was no case to answer.5. That it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any of the four ""essential circumstances"", and that accordingly the verdict was unsafe, dangerous and unsatisfactory and was unreasonable, and could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
     
     Held: 
    (a) The form of the indictment was entirely proper and the trial judge was correct in permitting the Crown to put its case on the alternative basis that either the appellant killed the deceased himself or arranged for someone else to do so.

     (b) The trial judge's rulings on the admissibility of hearsay evidence which went to the relationship between the appellant and the deceased and not admitting the police running sheet were correct.

     (c) The evidence for which warnings were sought did not come within any of the categories specified in the  
     Evidence Act 1995 
      s 165(1), but that did not exclude the necessity to give warnings in appropriate cases. However, apart from the evidence of BR, the evidence did not belong to any particular category which may, because of its nature, be unreliable, but was merely evidence which was challenged by the defence. The trial judge summarised the relevant evidence and directed the jury that the evidence of the deceased's mother and sister may be unreliable because of their close relationship to her. No further warnings or directions in relation to these matters were necessary or appropriate.  
      
     (d) Section s 165(1) did apply to the evidence of BR because he had been charged with a number of burglary offences and had given an undertaking to give evidence in accordance with his statement and had thereupon been granted an indemnity; but the warning given in respect of his evidence was sufficient in the circumstances.  
      
     (e) There was a case to answer.

     (f) (Per Dunford and Greg James JJ, Smart AJ dissenting) That it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the first and second ""essential elements"", although there was evidence that supported both propositions; but it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the deceased most likely died on the evening of 29 March and certainly no later than 30 March, and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the fourth ""essential element"". 
      
     (g) That the trial judge erred in directing the jury that in order to convict on either basis of the Crown case they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all four ""essential circumstances"".  
      
     (h) The proposition that the appellant himself killed the deceased required proof beyond reasonable doubt of ""essential elements 2, 3 and 4 but not necessarily 1. If 2 and 4 were satisfied it was open to the jury to conclude that they had met, but it was not necessarily pre-arranged in a telephone conversation the previous evening. 
      
     (i) The alternate basis of the Crown case by procuring the murder required something beyond the history of the relationship and the alleged kidnap plot of the previous November as described by BR; but if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of ""essential element"" 4 that would itself provide the necessary link. 
      
     (j) The direction that in order to convict on either basis of the Crown case required proof beyond reasonable doubt of all four ""essential circumstances"" constituted a wrong decision on a question of law, but it was unduly favourable to the appellant and would not justify the upholding of the appeal on that ground. 
      
     (k) There was a considerable body of evidence on which it was open to the jury, acting reasonably and having regard to the evidence, to find the appellant guilty on one or other of the bases alleged by the Crown. 
      
      Plomp v The Queen 
      (1963) 110 CLR 234, referred to. 
      
     (l) As the jury could not, acting reasonably, have followed the trial judge's directions and found all four ""essential circumstances"" proved beyond reasonable doubt, there had been such an irregularity as to constitute a miscarriage of justice, or to use the language that was current prior to  
     Fleming v The Queen  
     [1998] HCA 68, (1998) 158 ALR 379, such an irregularity as to render the verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory.

     (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 180, referred to.  
      
     (m) Accordingly, the appeal would be upheld and the conviction set aside but, as there was evidence on which it would be open to a jury acting reasonably to convict, the appropriate course was to order a new trial rather than enter a judgment of acquittal.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60675/98 DUNFORD J GREG JAMES J SMART AJ FRIDAY, 26 NOVEMBER 1999 
     
     R v John SERRATORE 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: The appellant, John Serratore, has appealed against his conviction for the murder of Frances Tizzone, whose body was found on 2 April 1995 after she had been missing since 29 March, following his trial before Newman J and a jury. He was subsequently sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum term of 13 years with an additional term of 7 years. 
    2    The indictment comprised a single count charging that the appellant ""did murder"" the deceased, but the Crown put its case (and over objection was permitted to do so) on the alternative basis that either the appellant killed the deceased himself or procured someone else to do so, and the jury was not required to say on which basis it found the appellant guilty.3    Although it will be necessary to go into the facts in more detail when dealing with some of the particular grounds of appeal, the nature of the Crown case can be summarised as follows. 
    4    The appellant and the deceased had been boyfriend and girlfriend since about 1993 and in due course a sexual relationship developed. The relationship was somewhat stormy and was marked by violence, obsessiveness and jealously on the part of the appellant.  
    5    Following a number of incidents in early November 1994, an Interim Apprehended Violence Order was made against the appellant on 9 November, and such order was made a final order on 14 November 1994 ""by consent and without admissions,"" and the relationship between them ceased for a period. 
    6    It was revived sometime late 1994 or early in 1995 and they were seen together on a number of outings and parties, but in late February the deceased told her mother she intended to end the relationship. There was evidence of a telephone call on the evening of 28 March in which she agreed to meet the appellant the following day on her way home, to exchange cards and other mementos as signalling the end of their relationship, and she said she would telephone for a lift about 6 pm when she was finished. 
    7    The next day the deceased went to university as usual and left there about 4.20 pm by bus, telling a university friend that she was going to visit a sick relative. She did not come home and did not call, and her partly decomposed body was found on the afternoon of Sunday, 2 April in bush not far off the Wakehurst Parkway at Frenchs Forrest.  
    8    There was evidence that the appellant who worked at Botany had left work early on Wednesday the 29th (the day of the deceased's disappearance), that fibres from the carpet in the appellant's Honda CRX motor vehicle matched those found on the soles of the deceased's boots when her body was found, and that she most likely died late on 29 March. 
    9    The appellant, both in his sworn evidence at the trial and in two recorded interviews with police, denied any involvement in the death of the deceased, and in particular denied that he had arranged to meet her on 29 March, denied he left work early that day and called expert witnesses who disputed the Crown's evidence as to the date of death, and the identification of the fibres on the deceased's boots. 
    10    The case against the appellant was therefore entirely circumstantial, and his Honour gave the appropriate directions to the jury concerning finding guilt in a circumstantial evidence case. He also directed them (having regard to Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573) that before they could convict the appellant on either basis on which the Crown relied, they had to find four ""essential circumstances"" or intermediate facts proved beyond reasonable doubt, namely: 
     
      
       
       (1) That on the evening of 28 March 1995 Frances Tizzone and John Serratore arranged to meet on the following evening. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) That the appellant left work early between 3.45 and 4 o'clock on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) That the deceased was killed on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       (4) That the deceased was in the appellant's Honda CRX motor vehicle shortly before her death. 
       
      
      
    11    As amended at the hearing, the Grounds of Appeal relied on were as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. (a) His Honour Barr J (who had dealt with some pre-trial issues) and the learned trial judge were in error in not requiring the Crown to plead the alternative methods of murder in two alternative counts, one charging the Appellant as a principal and one charging him as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory before the fact. 
       
      
      
       
        
         (b) His Honour the learned trial judge was in error in permitting the alternatives to be considered by the jury. 
        
       
      
      
       
       2. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in law in holding the Appellant had a case to answer. 
       
      
      
       
       3. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       4. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in refusing to admit into evidence Statements by Marie Wilthsire as follows: 
        
        Source Doc: JR090405.H Running Sheet 9/2/1 created 9 April 1995; 
        
        Source Doc: MR120402.H Running Sheet 9/2/2 created 12 April 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       5. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence before the jury. 
       
      
      
       
       5A His Honour the learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Patricia Tizzone and Antonella Tizzone as to the alleged telephone call of 28 March 1995 and the alleged arrangement whereby the Appellant was to meet the deceased. 
       
      
      
       
       5B His Honour the learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Damien Bower that the Appellant left work early on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       5C His Honour the learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Patricia Tizzone and Bassam Radwan as to the alleged soliciting to murder. 
       
      
      
       
       6. The conviction was unsafe, dangerous and unsatisfactory in the administration of justice because: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) the jury could not reasonably have found that the deceased died on 29 March 1995; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) the jury could not reasonably have found that the Appellant left work early on 29 March 1995; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) the jury could not reasonably have found there was an arrangement made between the Appellant and the deceased on 28 March 1995 to meet on 29 March 1995; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) the jury could not reasonably have found that the deceased was in the Appellant's Honda CRX motor vehicle on 29 March 1995. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        (v) on the whole of the evidence it was not reasonably open to the jury to convict; they should have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Appellant. 
       
      
      
    12    In relation to grounds 1(a) and (b), I agree with the judgment of Greg James J that there is no substance in those grounds, but I would prefer not to express any view at this stage concerning the appropriate directions to be given to the jury at the new trial. Those matters are best left to the trial judge having regard to how the case is presented and the evidence given at such new trial. 
     
      
     Hearsay Evidence 
      
    13    I pass over ground 2 for the time being and turn to ground 3 which was that the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence.  
    14    This evidence was objected to and ruled on prior to the trial, by reference to the proposed witnesses' statements, some of it was ruled inadmissible, and not all of that ruled admissible ultimately found its way into evidence. It was tendered as relationship evidence and can conveniently be divided into two categories: 
     
     (a) evidence from family and friends of statements made to them by the deceased that the appellant had verbally abused her, physically assaulted her, followed her to university and sat in her classes, was always calling her on the telephone and always wanted to know her whereabouts; 
      
     (b) similarly sourced evidence of statements by the deceased to the effect that she was intending to end the relationship but the appellant was making it difficult or always asking her for another chance, at another stage that the relationship had been resumed and finally on the evening before she disappeared that she was intending to meet him the following day to exchange mementos, signalling the end of the relationship.  
      
    15    In relation to category (a) the evidence objected to was supplemented by direct oral evidence which was not hearsay; e.g. some of the witnesses actually saw the appellant behaving in a dominating and abusive manner towards the deceased when they went out together or saw him in her classes etc at university, and many of the statements by the deceased about physical assaults were made in response to questions about, and/or at the time when they observed marks and bruises on her body. 
    16    The evidence was objected to on three grounds: 
     
     (1) It was not relevant, or at most, only marginally so. 
      
     (2) It was hearsay. 
      
     (3) It ought to be excluded on discretionary grounds pursuant to ss 135 or 136,  
     Evidence Act 1995. 
      
    17    It is now well established that in murder trials, evidence of the relationship between the parties is relevant and admissible: Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334, R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208, The Queen v Hissey (1973) 6 SASR 280, R v Ballantine (CCA - 27 June 1978), R v Hurst (CCA - 2 November 1983). 
    18    To reject the evidence would require the jury to examine the matter as if it happened in a vacuum: Wilson at 334 per Menzies J. The term ""relationship evidence"" is vague and it will often be necessary to identify more precisely the nature of the evidence: Frawley at 230 per Gleeson CJ. 
    19    Here the evidence, if accepted by the jury, tended to show that the relationship between the parties was an extremely obsessive, jealous and dominating one on the part of the appellant, peppered with incidents of physical violence, not showing a tendency to violence in the sense of a tendency to kill (it was not tendered or admitted on that basis), but as showing the degree of domination and obsessiveness which the appellant brought to the relationship. It was not what might be described as an ordinary boyfriend / girlfriend relationship with its occasional ups and downs and odd verbal disagreements. In addition the evidence, if accepted, disclosed that the deceased had previously tried to end the relationship, that the appellant had made it difficult but she had finally resolved to do so and the return of mementos was to mark this event. 
    20    In addition, there was other evidence: of his accusing her (apparently falsely and without any evidence to justify the accusation) of resuming a relationship with a former boyfriend, his humiliating her in front of her parents by reference to an abortion; and of statements of intention to kill or otherwise harm or humiliate her in his statements to Bassam Radwan and Manolis Kasdaglis; and of the threats allegedly made to the deceased and her family at the Burwood Court on 18 November 1994, including the statement to Radwan as late as February 1995 that he still intended to ""do it"". This evidence was clearly admissible and not objected to, at least when it was given, and the so called ""relationship"" evidence was necessary to put such evidence in its proper context. 
    21    It was submitted that even if such evidence of the relationship were admissible in cases where the issue is such as intention to kill or self defence etc, it is not admissible where, as here, the issue is the identity of the killer, but in Wilson itself the issue was whether the accused had fired the gun (or whether it had discharged accidentally perhaps when a dog jumped on the bale of hay on which it was resting) and Hissey and Ballantine were also cases where the identity of the killer was in issue. 
    22    Indeed in Wilson, Barwick CJ at 339 referred to what Lord Atkinson had said (arguendo) in R v Ball [1911] AC 47 at 68, namely: 
     
      
       
       ""Surely in an ordinary prosecution for murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to show he entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased's life. Evidence of motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as well as his ""malice aforethought,"" inasmuch as it is more probable that men are killed by those who have some motive for killing them than by those who have not."" 
       
      
      
    23    For these reasons, I am satisfied that both categories of the relationship evidence described above were relevant, and therefore admissible: Evidence Act 1995, ss 55, 56, provided they did not offend the hearsay rule or came within one of the exceptions to that rule. In respect of so much of it as was hearsay (s 59) the Crown relied on the exceptions contained in ss 65(2)(b)(c) and 72. 
    24    Section 65, so far as is relevant provides as follows: 
     
      
       
       (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was: 
       
      
      
       
        
        (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable . . . 
        
       
      
      
    25    The evidence by family members and friends of the deceased about what she told them concerning verbal abuse, physical assaults and harassment was therefore admissible if it satisfied the conditions laid down in subs (2)(b) or (c) that is, if the representations by the deceased to the witnesses were made when or shortly after the asserted facts occurred and in circumstances that made it unlikely that the representations were fabrications (b), or were made in circumstances that made it highly probable that the representations (i.e. by the deceased) to her friends were reliable (c). 
    26    In R v Dean (12 March 1997) I expressed the view (at p 5) that, having regard to what was said by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report (ALRC 26) and the previous limitations of the Res Gestae exception to the hearsay rule, para (b) was limited to representations about the crime itself and not about some antecedent event: cf R v Plevac (CCA - 5 October 1995). These representations did not relate to the crime itself but to antecedent events and, if I was right in so limiting the effect of subs (2)(b), the representations would not be admissible under that paragraph. 
    27    In Dean my attention was not directed to the definition of ""asserted fact"" in s 59; and it may be that the ""asserted facts"" in para (b) could include the previous assaults, etc and not be limited to the alleged crime itself. No such limitation appears to have been placed on para (b) by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 359-60 (which concerned prior stabbings) or Sperling J in R v Mankotia (27 July 1998) which concerned previous threats to kill; and what I said in this regard in Dean may need to be reconsidered in an appropriate case. It is not necessary to do so in this case because I am satisfied that such evidence was admissible pursuant to s 65(2)(c). 
    28    That paragraph requires that the evidence be made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation (i.e. what the deceased said) was reliable and it is unnecessary here to consider whether the circumstances which may be taken into account can include subsequent events such as the death as was held in Dean and Lock or whether as Sperling J held in Mankotia they are limited to circumstances existing at the time, as the Crown does not in this case rely on subsequent circumstances (such as the death of the deceased) to establish the high probability that the representations were reliable. Here the representations were made in reference to particular scratches and bruises, etc on the deceased's person, or when she was crying and distressed immediately after leaving the appellant's company (e.g. the evening of the outing to Jesus Christ Superstar), and in such circumstances I consider it was highly probable that they were reliable. There were also representations in late 1994 and early 1995 that they were seeing each other and having sexual intercourse. There is no dispute they were seeing each other, and the deceased's visits to the two doctors (independently proved) render the representations concerning sexual intercourse reliable. 
    29    In relation to the statements made by the deceased to her mother and various girl friends to the effect that she was in a relationship with the appellant, was intending to break the relationship, was intending to meet him for mutual return of mementos of the relationship and such like, these statements were contemporaneous representations about her feelings, intentions and / or state of mind and were consequently admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to s 72. 
    30    It follows that the disputed evidence was admissible unless grounds were shown for its exclusion under ss 135 or 137. Section 137 is mandatory, the evidence must be excluded if it is adduced by the prosecutor in criminal proceedings and its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant; s 135 confers a discretion but it is difficult to see how it could be relevant in criminal proceedings to ""unfairly prejudicial"" evidence led by the prosecution which would be excluded (not merely as a matter of discretion) under s 137. 
    31    ""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Act as meaning the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the particular fact in issue; in this case, whether the appellant was involved in the death of the deceased. All relevant evidence led in the Crown case at trial is prejudicial to the accused, but it is only that of which the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice which is excluded; that is evidence which has only slight probative value but which carries with it a probability that it be misused by the tribunal of fact in a way logically unconnected with the issues in the case: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457. See also R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397. 
    32    In my opinion this evidence was clearly relevant, showing as it did, the nature of the relationship between the parties in the period leading up to the deceased's disappearance; and although prejudicial to the appellant, that prejudice was not ""unfair"" in any way. There was accordingly no ground for its exclusion under ss 135 or 137. It is not disputed that his Honour gave the appropriate warning in respect to the possible unreliability of hearsay evidence required by s 165(1)(a). 
    33    Ground of Appeal 4 concerns the admission of two police running sheets concerning the sighting by Marie Wiltshire of a person whom she allegedly identified as the deceased in a car on the Gosford Freeway near Berowra on the afternoon of Friday 31 March 1995 and is more conveniently considered in conjunction with ground 6 (i). 
    34    Before considering grounds 2 and 6 (i) to (v) it is necessary to refer to the evidence in more detail. (Unless otherwise indicated the numbers in brackets are reference to page numbers in the transcript.) 
     
      
     Background and Relationship Facts. 
      
    35    The deceased and the appellant grew up close to each other in Croydon Park, a suburb of Sydney, they went to different high schools but in Years 8 and 9 they formed a boyfriend / girlfriend relationship. This relationship ended when they were in Year 10 and the deceased formed a relationship with another boy, Joe Elia. In 1993 the deceased was attending Macquarie University studying for a science degree and she and the appellant resumed their boyfriend / girlfriend relationship, and in May of that year she brought the appellant to her home and introduced him to her parents. Subsequently, the parents of the appellant and the deceased also met (32, 34). It was not disputed that this relationship continued until November 1994 shortly before, or up to, the time when an Apprehended Violence Order was made.  
    36    The Crown alleged that from about mid 1994 the relationship was visited with violence and obsession on the part of the appellant. The deceased's mother, Patricia Tizzone, said that she noticed they were often arguing on the telephone and in June 1994 she saw a bruise on the left side of the deceased's face and the latter told her that she had hit her face against a door (35), subsequently she noticed bruises on the deceased's arms (35). In about August 1994, the deceased told her mother that the appellant would come to the university and sit in her classes (although he had no business at the university), that he would ask her what she had been doing that day and tell her that he had been watching her (54). She also told her mother that the appellant would some times hit her and showed her some nail marks on her arms which looked fresh (54), and she said that when he saw her sitting with a group of students, male and female, at the university he became abusive towards the male students so that they did not speak to her any more (55). She told her that she had a plastic bag containing personal items and the appellant had the same kind of bag and they were supposed to exchange the bags, that she gave him her bag but he never gave her his (55). 
    37    In about August 1994, there was an incident where Mrs Tizzone went into the deceased's bedroom and saw her crying, the deceased told her that the appellant used to stand out the front of her window and watch her from there, that they got into an argument and he punched her through the fly screen. On this occasion the mother saw the deceased had a cut lip which was red and the flyscreen was broken with a hole in it (56). About this time the deceased told a friend of hers, Natasha Skiadopoulos, that the appellant was hitting her (384) and she later also told Rima Abou-Raad, a fellow university student, that he would hit her, abuse her emotionally and physically, and the witness saw she had scratches and bruises (415). Miss Abou-Raad confirmed that the appellant came to the university and sat in the deceased's classes. She also described an occasion when she saw the appellant hit the deceased on the head and push her into the brick wall when the appellant's mother came out and separated them (417-18). She also described another incident at university in October on a Saturday morning when she overheard a conversation where the appellant said to the deceased, ""You're coming home with me"", the deceased said, ""No, I'm not"", the appellant grabbed her hand and said, ""Yes you are"", he was very forceful, and he appeared angry, the deceased walked away with him for a few minutes then returned and said she was going home with the appellant which she did, although she did not look too happy about it (420). 
    38    In September 1994, the appellant came to the deceased's home, she met him at the front of the house and her mother saw them arguing and the appellant then grabbed the deceased by the neck and shook her (55). About this time, the deceased went to the theatre one evening to see Jesus Christ Superstar with her friend Michelle Kaltoum and another friend. After the show was finished they saw the appellant on the footpath outside the theatre, but this was apparently a pre-arranged meeting. They decided to go to a hotel at Darling Harbour and after a while the deceased told her that she was going for a walk with the appellant. Miss Kaltoum and her other friend waited about 20 minutes after which the deceased returned on her own, she was distressed and crying and said that the appellant had hit her. They then returned home, the three of them by themselves (411-412). She told her mother that an argument developed because the appellant demanded that she go home with him and when she went outside the hotel he became abusive and hit her a few times about the face and head butted her to the head (56). Although the appellant in his sworn evidence gave a slightly different version of the background leading up to the argument he agreed that on that evening when he and the deceased were outside the hotel they got into an argument and he ""slapped her in a fight"" (691-2, 774-5). 
    39    After this incident the deceased told her mother that she was thinking of ending her relationship with the appellant, and had discussed it with him but that he always asked for another chance (57) and that he sort of threatened to show her father the bag that they had exchanged and the deceased did not want her father to see the bag (57-58). The appellant said that at about this time the relationship changed, she stopped accepting his phone calls, but he saw a bag of hers (650-651) beside the bed, full of letters, cards and photos including an old photo of Joe Elia, the boyfriend she had in her later years of high school. The appellant said he questioned her about it because he had seen Elia driving around the area. He asked her had she been seeing Elia, she replied, ""no"" and then she handed him the bag and said, ""Listen, here is the bag to prove it doesn't mean anything to me"". (651)  
    40    A major confrontation took place on 5 November, a Saturday afternoon. According to the deceased's mother, she went to call the deceased and noticed that the appellant was out the front of their house and that the deceased had gone out to see him. They were having an argument and she saw the appellant hit the deceased across the face, so she called her husband and they all went out the front. Her husband asked the appellant what was going on, and in the course of further argument the appellant said, ""You ask for answers about when she was pregnant and had the abortion"", that being the first time the deceased's mother or father had heard of any pregnancy or abortion. The deceased and her mother went inside and the appellant and the deceased's father continued arguing and yelling at each other outside for some time (58-59, 131).  
    41    The appellant in his evidence said (652) that when the deceased came out of the house he confronted her about Joe (Elia) and asked, ""Is something going on? Are you seeing Joe?"". He said she had a guilty look on her face, but she denied it and so he said, ""Don't lie to me, I just saw him."" She told him that she was just speaking to him, that she was not seeing him but he slapped her in the face . . . ""because she lied to me and she was seeing her ex-boyfriend. I suppose I lost my temper"". Soon after that her father came outside and they started getting into an argument. 
    42    He said he told the father that she had been seeing her ex-boyfriend and the argument continued, he pushed the father, who started screaming and saying he was going to hit the appellant. He continued,  
     
      
       
       ""I told Frances, C'mon tell him. I'm getting my arse kicked in here and its not my fault. Tell him what you have been doing, and she just didn't say nothing, just standing there. We kept on arguing for a little bit longer, screaming at each other and Frances said ""I was only speaking to him a few times. I never seen him"". When she said that, I don't know, I just told her father about how she was pregnant to me and she had an abortion and he seemed like it was a big shock at the time."" 
       
      
      
     He said that when he went home he poked a finger through a photo that he had at home of him and the deceased. He agreed in cross-examination (710) that he accused the deceased of having an affair with her ex-boyfriend solely on the basis that he saw the latter driving his car in the street where the deceased lived and in the general area; and see further cross-examination of the appellant at 723-5, 728-31.  
      
    43    Later that day the deceased, her mother and her father went to Burwood Police Station and reported the incident (59).  
    44    The following day (Sunday), the deceased's father, Santo Tizzone, went to the Serratore house and spoke with the appellant's father, Frank Serratore, and whilst he was there the appellant came out and said to him, ""The problem is your daughter she goes off with somebody else, she's a slut, I can prove it to you . . . I have got some documents, I can prove it to you"". He went inside, brought out a plastic bag and showed him pictures of the deceased at a school formal from Year 12, three years previously. He repeated the statement about the deceased having had an abortion, went inside but later came out again and indicated that he wanted to fight Santo Tizzone saying, ""Come on throw the first punch, I'm going to kill you"", whereupon his sister came out and asked Santo to go home, which he did (132). In his evidence (655) the accused confirmed the confrontation and his production and reliance on the three year old photo, and that he had slapped the deceased ""for what she did to me"", but he claimed that Santo Tizzone threatened to kill him.  
    45    Although the deceased may have seen Joe Elia in the street, there was no evidence that she had been out with him or had been associating with him in any romantic sense.  
    46    The following day, Monday 7 November, according to the appellant, Monica Kollar telephoned the appellant on behalf of the deceased and wanted to know why he had told her father about the abortion and he replied that she deserved it because she did not stick up for him when he was copping all the blame on Saturday (656). This was a somewhat unsatisfactory perception of what happened in view of the fact that the appellant had accused the deceased (apparently falsely and without any evidence) of resuming a friendship with her ex-boyfriend, a thing she was perfectly entitled to do if she wanted to in any event, and he had refused to accept her denials.  
    47    It was open to the jury to infer from this evidence that the appellant was intensely jealous of his relationship with the deceased, that he was irrational and suspicious, would not accept her denials, and inclined to unreasonable anger and physical violence towards her.  
    48    That evening (Monday 7 November) the appellant came to the Tizzone house and was bashing on the front door looking for the deceased; she didn't go out, so he started yelling for her father to go out because he wanted to fight him, but the father did not go out and told him to go home, which he did (60). They telephoned the Enfield police station and Constables McDonald (now Jackson) and Shaw attended the Tizzone house at about 8.45 pm. The deceased told them that the appellant was possessive of her, he would come to the university and she felt he was stalking her, and he would come to the house and request a fight with her father. She felt threatened by him and said that he would push her about when she would try to end the relationship and he would refuse to accept that, also that he would push her about and become a bit violent and aggressive (448-9).  
    49    Bassam Radwan had gone to school with the appellant, but after leaving school they drifted apart until October 1994 when they started to see more of each other. The appellant told him about the deceased, that he had broken up with her and he was depressed about it and had a hard time. He said it was the deceased's family getting involved and started suggesting that he wanted Radwan to ""hurt a lady"" (533) and eventually he said the lady he was referring to was the deceased's mother (534). Approximately two weeks later, (8 November) he asked Radwan to help him get the deceased. He said that she would be driving her mother to work at Concord Hospital the following morning at 8 o'clock and dropping her off and driving on to university, and that after she dropped her mother off she would come to an intersection and as she approached the intersection he wanted Radwan to jump into the passenger's seat of the car, to drive somewhere remote with her, make her write out a suicide note and force her to swallow a whole lot of pills, as he wanted to get her back for what she had done to him (535). 
    50    Radwan said he would not do it, but the appellant kept trying to convince him, saying, ""You have to help me, if you don’t help me I won't get away with it"". The conversation lasted over half an hour (535-538). In due course the appellant left, but later returned, still trying to persuade Radwan to do what he asked. Radwan told him he would tell the deceased, her father, the police, everybody (538), but the appellant kept on persisting, he got angry and frustrated, and ultimately offered to give Radwan his car and the money he had saved, approximately $3,000. Radwan again refused (541). At that stage Radwan did not think he was serious, but he spoke to him again that night and knew he was serious, although he did not think he would go through with it (541). Radwan understood that the initial plan was for him to help the appellant so that the latter would have an alibi (548), and on one occasion, which Radwan thought was in the conversation on 8 November, the appellant also said, ""My cousin knows some Greeks, hit men, or people from the Cross"" (548). 
    51    The next morning he asked him one more time, and when Radwan again refused, the appellant said, ""Okay, I'm going myself to do it"" and then drove off (542). Radwan thereupon went to the Tizzone household where he told the deceased (and her mother) not to go to university, that the appellant was waiting for her, that he had asked him to hurt her, but he (Radwan) would not go through with it, and that that day was his last chance (543). He said he also told them of the proposal for him to abduct the deceased, have her write a suicide note and swallow a lot of pills (60, 543-4) so, after telephoning the police and picking up the deceased's cousin, Antonella Notaro, from her home, the deceased, her mother and the cousin all went to the university (62-3).  
    52    When they arrived, the deceased went to class and the others saw the appellant was present on campus and went to see Mr Dickson, head of security who notified Eastwood police and Constables O'Connor and Sharrock attended (63). The police spoke to Mrs Tizzone and Miss Notaras and later when her class finished they also spoke to the deceased (64). The police were told of the relationship and that the deceased was trying to break it off but that the appellant had turned up at university that day, that contact had already been made with police and there was talk of a restraining order (462). No notes of what was said were taken by the police or by Mr Dickson, and they do not recall anything being said about a proposed kidnapping etc, although Miss Abou-Raad who accompanied the deceased from the lecture to the Security Office said the deceased did tell her of it (430-1) and Mr Dickson said there appeared to be something serious afoot (427) and the deceased appeared nervous (428). The police then approached the appellant and told him the deceased did not want to see him and had left anyway, they searched his car, found nothing of interest and asked him to leave, which he did (462-3). Constable O'Connor said that he told him there was no need to wreck his life over a woman, and that he seemed emotional (463). 
    53    The appellant said his reason for going to the university was that he wanted to speak to the deceased to find out about what happened because he had to know, and he did not intend to do her any harm and he had no weapons in the vehicle (663).  
    54    Radwan was facing criminal charges and gave an undertaking to give evidence against the appellant as a result of which he apparently received a significant discount when the charges were dealt with (559-564). An appropriate warning was given by the judge in respect of his evidence, but his evidence was partly corroborated by Monzer Radwan (his brother) who said he overhead the appellant say to his brother something along the lines, ""come on Bassam, come on if you don't do it, I'll do it"" (584) and also corroborated by the fact that following Radwan coming to the Tizzone house on the morning of the 9th the deceased and her mother collected the cousin Antonella Notaro and then all proceeded to Macquarie University where the appellant had in fact gone.  
    55    The appellant denied asking Radwan to help him kill the deceased (661), but agreed he had spoken to him on 8 November about his relationship with the deceased and troubles with her parents the previous Saturday, and said he wanted to go and see her at the university the next day and ask her why she had gone with Joe (Elia) and why she had lied about it (660). He said he was very angry and Radwan told him to keep away from her, but the appellant insisted he was going (661). 
    56    When first interviewed by police on 30 March 1995 (Ex. G), reference was made to him speaking to Radwan about the deceased and when he was asked (Q 191), ""Did you speak to Bassam and ask him to do something on your behalf?"" (which could have related to delivering a message), his answer was, ""No, because I wouldn't be that stupid to do something,'' and when it was put to him (QQ. 195-197) that he had asked Bassam to abduct the deceased on her way to university and arrange for her to be given a drug overdose, his response was, ""No, I don't recall that, no"", a somewhat strange answer when an express and immediate denial might have been expected, and (at AA 222 and 230 and 230-232) he referred to ""rumours"" going around at the time (November 1994) about Radwan helping him get her and overdosing etc, which ""rumours"" he presumably would not have known of at that time unless there was some substance to them. The jury saw and heard the witness and it was open to them to accept Radwan's evidence.  
    57    Later that day, Constable McDonald (Jackson) applied for and obtained an Interim Apprehended Violence Order at Burwood Court (449). In making the application, she did not refer to the abduction threat in the complaint, but to the information she had received on the Monday evening together with additional information she had received about him threatening to attend Macquarie University and shoot the deceased (451). The complaint was Exhibit 1 at the trial. About 6 pm that evening the appellant was served with the order at Enfield Police Station (450). 
    58    Late that afternoon the appellant came to Radwan's house, asked him if he had said anything to the deceased, and told him that the police had seen him at the university, to which Radwan replied, ""yes, I told them"", and the appellant then saw the deceased's telephone number which Radwan had written down on a piece of paper (545- Radwan, 664 - appellant). On that or a subsequent occasion the appellant told Radwan about the restraining order and said, ""You don't think this is going to stop me, I'll get her six months later"" (546). About this time the deceased told her friend Natasha Skiadopoulos that she was going to court because of violence on the part of the appellant and showed her fingernail marks (384).  
    59    On 18 November 1994, the Interim Apprehended Violence Order was made final ""by consent and without admissions""; accordingly, no one gave evidence. The deceased's mother said that as they were leaving the court the appellant said to the deceased, ""you're gone, you're gone"" (67), according to her father he said, ""you're dead, its going to cost me money but you're dead"" (128,134) and to the father he said, ""I'm going to be your nightmare"" (135). The appellant and his relations gave a different version of these conversations (673, 880, 896) to the effect that the appellant abused Santo Tizzone, rather than threatened anyone, although in his Recorded Interview on 30 March 1995 (Ex. G) the appellant virtually admitted making threats to the deceased and her father ""on the spur of the moment"" (AA 88 - 91). The other witnesses agreed that the appellant did use a string of abuse and was restrained by his cousin John Serratore. The Police Prosecutor who appeared in relation to the Apprehended Violence Order, Sergeant Adam Sutton gave evidence that the deceased told him that she was fearful of being abducted by the appellant or someone acting on his behalf (507). 
    60    After the court hearing in November 1994, the Tizzone household received numerous phone calls, but whenever anyone other than the deceased answered the phone, the caller would hang up (67). This happened anything from two or three times and on one occasion up to 15 times a day, another estimate given was 5 to 10 per night (151) and the deceased's brother, Joseph Tizzone identified the appellant as the caller on one occasion in early March 1995 (161). 
    61    Sometime after the making of the Apprehended Violence Order, their relationship was resumed but there was no specific evidence as to when this occurred. On 7 December 1994 the deceased saw Dr Padmanabhan in the company of a male person and requested ""the morning after pill"" stating that she had had intercourse whilst menstruating (Ex. R). Shortly after the order was made, the deceased told Natasha Skiadopoulos that she had started seeing the appellant again, and for some time it seems Miss Skiadopoulos acted as an intermediary so they could arrange meetings (385) and by 1995 she was aware a sexual relationship had been resumed (386) although he was still grabbing her and hitting her. She told Skiadopoulos that she wanted to break up with him but was finding it hard (386). 
    62    At Monica Kollar's 21st birthday party on 27 January the couple were together (391) but the following week the deceased told Miss Kollar that she was confused about the relationship, that sometimes he was angry with her but that at other times he would be okay (392); and three weeks later, with Miss Kollar's fiancee, the four of them went to Bondi but at the end of the evening the appellant insisted that the deceased go home with him in his car and spoke to her in an angry, demanding manner (392). A few weeks later, the four of them went to Manly again and the deceased and the appellant were affectionate towards each other. This trip was about three weeks before the deceased disappeared.  
    63    In February the deceased told her mother that they were going to give the relationship another go but apparently the father was never told this (68) and in the middle of February 1995 her mother found a Valentine's Day card under the bed signed ""John"" and the date ""95"" (68). There was also a 21st birthday card, the deceased having turned 21 on 9 January, also signed ""John"" (68). The deceased also gave the appellant a Valentine's Day card (Ex. M) in generally affectionate terms. She wrote of reigniting ""our flame which was once burning quite strongly"" and ""it will take time for our love to become as strong as it was earlier"". The card concluded, ""I don't want any abuse like was previously experienced. I want the old Johnny the one I had when we first met"". Towards the end of February she told her mother that she was thinking of ending the relationship because she just could not forget all the things that had happened in the past (69).  
    64    They attended Natasha Skiadopoulos' 21st Birthday party together on 18 February and were cuddling and embracing (383, 388). And on 20 February the deceased saw Dr Quek and requested the ""morning after"" pill (Ex. S).  
    65    During late February and early March, the deceased telephoned the appellant about once a day at his place of work and on one occasion the appellant asked a fellow employee to take a message if she rang whilst he was out, as to which railway station they were to meet at after work, but these calls stopped about two weeks before she disappeared (503). Radwan and his girlfriend, Zahia Charbel, saw the appellant waiting for the deceased at Burwood Station on one occasion at about this time (547, 604). The appellant gave them a lift home and said he was just waiting for the deceased, but drove past her bus stop and said, ""She mustn't be here or she must have gone home already."" (547-8). Radwan also said that in about late February the appellant said to him, ""Don't think I've forgotten about her, I'm only just sleeping with her . . . . Don't think I've forgotten about it, I'm still going to do it"" (547).  
    66    In cross-examination of the accused, it was put to him (776) that he had told a Manolis Kasdaglis that he would get her back or make life hell for her, to which he replied, ""I think at that stage, on the spur of the moment, I was upset"" and when asked if he had said those things, his reply was, ""Not exactly in those words but I said I am embarrassed or something like that"", and he claimed it was in November 1994. Kasdaglis said that in January 1995 the appellant told him that he was upset and devastated because he had broken up with the deceased and said ""something about humiliating her and stuff, you know embarrassing her and things like that"" (466). 
    67    On 18 March 1995 the deceased and the appellant both attended Jadranka Vulic's 21st birthday party. Miss Vulic said they seemed to be a happy couple just cuddling and talking to one another and were together basically the whole evening (383) (photo Ex. K). A week later, on 25 March, the deceased telephoned Vulic and told her that the appellant had harassed her a little bit, he went over to Macquarie University where she was studying and would harass her, and that ""he had hit her once repeatedly"" (sic) (382).  
     
      
     Evidence Surrounding the Disappearance of the Deceased 
      
    68    The Crown alleged that following a telephone call to the deceased on the evening of 28 March, overheard by her sister Antonella (151), the deceased told her mother that she and the appellant had agreed to break up the relationship and that they were meeting the following afternoon after university so that he could give her back the bag that he had of hers and she could return his Valentine's Day card, and she arranged with her mother to give her a telephone call from Strathfield Railway Station when they were finished so she or her husband could pick her up and it was expected this would be about 6 o'clock (73).  
    69    She spent the next day (29th) at university in company with Rima Abou-Raad, during the day they attended a protest march and between 4 pm and 4.30 pm Miss Abou-Raad telephoned the Tizzone home, spoke to the deceased's younger brother, Joseph, and said the deceased had asked her to ring and request that they tape the 6 o'clock news because she may not be home by then and it was anticipated that the protest march they had attended might be filmed and on the news (418-9). This last item was confirmed by the brother (161). Towards the end of the day, Miss Abou-Raad offered the deceased a lift home, but the deceased said she was going to visit a sick relative and would be getting off the train at Burwood or Strathfield (419). She caught the 4.21 pm bus from the university which arrived at Epping Railway Station at about 4.40 pm (470-472). 
    70    Neither her family nor Miss Abou-Raad saw her alive again and her body was found near the side of the Wakehurst Parkway at Frenchs Forest in the late afternoon of Sunday 2 April at about 3.40 pm. By that time the body had been subjected to maggot infestation, there was no sign of any assault, sexual or otherwise, and a blue Sportsgirl bag in which she carried her university books and folders, her purse and a small plastic bag in which she carried other items for university were nearby. There was no evidence of any sick relative but Miss Abou-Raad said that she had no idea that the deceased and the accused had renewed their relationship (417). 
    71    When there was no call from the deceased by 8 pm, her mother telephoned Miss Abou-Raad who told her that she had last seen her going for the 4.20 pm bus and at 9.00 pm she and her husband went to the Burwood Police Station where they spoke to Constable Hall and told her of their fears, but did not mention a word about the alleged arrangement for her to meet the appellant at the Strathfield Railway Station. Constable Hall then rang the appellant's home and after introducing herself said, ""Frances Tizzone has not come home and her parents are worried about her, have you seen her?"" to which he replied, ""No I'm not allowed to see her, she took out an order"". She asked him, ""Where have you been this afternoon?"" and he said, ""I came home from work and have been here all the time."" She asked, ""What time did you come home from work?"" and he said, ""about 5 pm"" (210-211).  
    72    At about 10.00 pm Mrs Tizzone telephoned the appellant and he assured her that he had not seen or heard from the deceased that day and said the last time he had seen her was in December, except for once at a party. Later they again contacted the police and Constable Gregory came to the Tizzone's premises about 2.30 am on the morning of the 30th, then Detectives Williams and Marks came at about 7 am. Detective Williams said that after going to the Tizzone residence, he went to Macquarie University where he later spoke with Miss Abou-Raad and a lecturer, Mr Ali, and later went to the Serratore house and asked Mrs Serratore to get the appellant to contact them, which he did later that evening where he took part in a Recorded Interview (Ex. G) (196-198). The interview commenced at 7.02 pm.  
    73    In that interview the appellant gave a number of statements which were subsequently proved to be untrue. He said that since November 1994 he and the deceased had spoken and seen each other a few times, and that was about it (A 57). He said he had last seen her at Jadranka's party two weeks previously where they had had a short conversation (A 72). He denied they had had a sexual relationship since the Apprehended Violence Order (AA 163-167, AA 245-6). At the trial he explained that the reason for these lies was that he did no wish to incriminate himself in any breach of the Apprehended Violence Order. He also said that on Wednesday the 29th he left work at 4.50 pm and went straight home, arriving there about 5.25 pm and he did not go out again that night (AA 285-292). He was interviewed again on 17 May 1995 (Ex. J).  
    74    The appellant worked at Botany and Detective Williams gave evidence that it took him approximately 29 minutes to drive from Botany to Croydon Park and a further 6½ minutes to travel from there to Strathfield Railway Station making a total of 35½ minutes (201-2). Mr Erlandsson (called on behalf of the appellant) took slightly, but not significantly, longer (1071-2). The appellant was under police surveillance from 30 March. 
    75    The appellant gave sworn evidence in which he denied he had anything to do with the death of the deceased and also denied most of the violence to the deceased during their relationship alleged against him. He said that in March 1995 his normal working hours were 8.30 am to 5 pm and the journey to his workplace from his home took 30-40 minutes by car (613). On Wednesday 29 March 1995, he arrived at work at 8.20 am and left at 4.50 pm (614), arriving home at about 5.30 pm (614). The appellant drove to work in his Toyota Corolla that day and when he got home he parked it in the double garage behind the Honda CRX. As the appellant approached the house he saw his neighbour, Sam Vitaliti and his cousin, Vince Mazzotta (616). His mother and father were at home when he arrived. The appellant denied going to Burwood or Strathfield Station. The appellant had a shower and read the paper. His sister arrived home at about 5.45 pm, and he did not go out at all that evening. He denied telephoning the deceased on the night of Tuesday 28 March 1995 and arranging to meet her (618). 
    76    The next day the appellant's sister telephoned him at work and told him that the police wanted to interview him. He left work early at about 4 pm. He went home and waited for about an hour for his sister to come home. He then went to buy cigarettes and when he returned, his sister and cousin were at the house. They then went to the Police Station. 
    77    As already noted, the Crown case was put on the alternative basis that either the appellant killed the deceased himself or he arranged for someone else to do it. Besides giving the jury the usual directions as to circumstantial evidence (the need to exclude any explanation consistent with innocence) his Honour (at SU p 8) also directed them that there were four ""essential circumstances"" of which they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, these were ""links in the chain"" rather than ""strands in the rope"" (see Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573) and that these four ""essential circumstances"" were: 
     
      
       
       1. That on the evening of 28 March 1995 Frances Tizzone and John Serratore arranged to meet on the following evening.  
       
      
      
       
       2. That the appellant left work early between 3.45 and 4 o'clock on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       3. That the deceased was killed on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       4. That the deceased was in the accused's Honda CRX motor car shortly before her death. 
       
      
      
    78    The principal submission on behalf of the appellant was that it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any of those four ""essential circumstances"", and that accordingly the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and was unreasonable, and could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
     First Essential Circumstance - That in a Telephone Call on the Evening of Tuesday 28 March 1995, the Deceased and the Appellant Agreed to Meet the Following Evening.  
      
    79    Antonella Tizzone, the deceased's sister said that on 28 March she overheard the deceased speaking on the telephone saying, ""I don't want to meet you . . . why are you speaking to me this way . . . okay I'll meet you tomorrow afternoon after uni at the station, I will bring the card but make sure you bring the bag"". She said that she did not know that at the time her sister was back in a relationship with the appellant, her voice sounded ""sort of scared"", but she had heard her use that tone of voice previously when speaking to the appellant (151-152).  
    80    Her mother, Patricia Tizzone, said (71) that on the evening of the 28th she had a conversation with the deceased who told her that she did not wish to take the car the following day, that she had spoken to the appellant on the phone and they had arranged to meet in the afternoon at Strathfield Railway Station, that the appellant had agreed to break up the relationship, that they would just remain friends, and he was going to give her back a bag that he had of hers and he wanted back a Valentine's Day card; and she arranged with the deceased for her to telephone from Strathfield Railway Station after she finished the meeting with the appellant so that she or her father could pick her up.  
    81    There were a number of difficulties with Antonella's evidence. Firstly, the references to, ""Why are you talking to me this way"" and ""I will bring the card but make sure you bring the bag"" were not in her original statement made to police on 4 April 1995 but first appeared in her later statement on 21 April 1995 or in her evidence at the Committal on 13 February 1996. Standing by itself I would not regard this discrepancy as significant. However, in his statement to police on 4 April 1995 (148) the deceased's father, Santo Tizzone, said that Antonella told him on the following day (30 March) that she heard the deceased talk over the phone on the evening of the 28th and she was arguing with this person about meeting him the next day after university but went on, ""Antonella did not take much notice because she didn't think it was John on the other end of the phone"", yet in her evidence Antonella said that she had reported to her mother that she ""thought she was speaking to John"" (159). 
    82    In cross-examination her answers were unimpressive, she answered, ""not sure"" to a number of propositions, including whether she told her father on 30 March of the telephone conversation or who she told, whether she told her father she did not think it was the appellant on the phone, whether on the evening of the 29th when they were worried about her sister not coming home she reminded her mother of the phone call, whether she told the police about it that night, and whether she spoke to police officers who came to the house the following morning.  
    83    There were also major difficulties with the mother's evidence. When the deceased did not ring at or shortly after 6 pm for someone to go and pick her up, she became concerned. When they had not heard anything by about 8.00 pm she rang and spoke to the deceased's friend, Rima Abou-Raad, who told her that she had last seen her running to catch the 4.20 bus at the university, so at about 8.30 she and her husband and Antonella went to Burwood Police Station where they saw Constable Hall and reported that she had not come home, and they told her of the previous problems with the appellant. According to Constable Hall, they told her that they were worried as to where she could be, they were not aware how she was getting home that night, and they were worried in light of her previous relationship with the appellant as to her welfare (212), but Mrs Tizzone and Constable Hall both agreed that at no time did anyone mention that the deceased had arranged to meet the appellant that afternoon at Strathfield Station on her way home. Constable Hall telephoned the Serratore household, spoke to the appellant and asked him if he knew where the deceased was, and he said in effect that no he had not seen her and because of the Apprehended Violence Order he was not permitted to see her (210-11). The Tizzones then returned home.  
    84    At about 10 pm Mrs Tizzone telephoned the Serratore home herself. She first spoke to the appellant's sister who said the appellant was home when she had arrived home by 6 pm so he must have been home by about a quarter to 6. She then spoke to the appellant (74) and asked, ""Are you sure you haven't seen or heard from Frances at all today?"" to which he replied that he had not seen her, the last time he had seen her was in December, but that he had seen her once at a party (namely at Jadranka Vulic's). She did not say anything to him about any proposed meeting between them that day. Her explanation was that she wanted him to tell her himself that he had met her after she asked him, but he did not. She was cross-examined as to why she had not mentioned the planned meeting to Constable Hall (77 & 78) and her answers were particularly unconvincing. Similarly her answers were unconvincing as to why she did not mention it in the telephone call to the appellant or when speaking to his sister at about 10 pm (80).  
    85    She also told the police that they did not know how the deceased was getting home, rather strange if an arrangement had been made for her to telephone from Strathfield Railway Station after the meeting to get a lift from one of her parents. The mother's evidence is also inconsistent with that of the father who said that the mother told him that she had rung Rima and been told that she would be late and was expected home between 7 and 7.30 pm which was the normal time she arrived home when she had late lectures (142). Then no member of the family mentioned the proposed meeting when Constable Gregory came to the house about 2.30 am on 30 March, and in view of the fact that when the appellant was interviewed by Detective Williams on the evening of the 30th (Ex. G) he was not asked any questions about the proposed meeting, I consider it clear that no member of the family told the detectives about such proposed meeting when they came to the house at about 7 am on the morning of the 30th.  
    86    I find it incredible that if the conversation between the deceased and her mother had taken place the evening before as the mother claimed, so that the mother was aware of an arrangement for the deceased to meet the appellant at Strathfield Railway Station after university, and she knew from Miss Abou-Raad that the deceased had left the university, but she had not telephoned to be picked up, the first thing that the mother would not have told the police when they visited Burwood Police Station at 8.30 pm would not have been her knowledge of the proposed meeting. Similarly, I find it incomprehensible that when she telephoned the appellant herself she did not refer to the proposed meeting. Her explanations for not doing so I find totally unconvincing.  
    87    It may well be that Antonella's evidence of overhearing a telephone call is substantially true, and that she did not tell her parents either because she was not aware that the relationship was ongoing, or if she was aware that she did not believe the parents were aware and did not want them to know, but this is pure speculation. We do know that the deceased had declined a lift from Miss Rima Abou-Raad and used the excuse that she was going to visit a sick relative but there was no evidence of any sick relative and Miss Abou-Raad was not aware that the relationship between the deceased and the appellant had been resumed and the evidence of the fibres in the car is strong evidence that a meeting took place, so there may have been a meeting arranged but the evidence of the family members about the arrangements for the meeting to which I have referred contains discrepancies, displays inaccuracies, is tainted and otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead me to conclude that even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the mother knew on the evening of 29 March 1995 of any meeting arranged for the following afternoon.  
     
      
     Second Essential Circumstance - That the Appellant Left Work Early Between 3.45 and 4 o'clock on Wednesday 29 March 1995. 
      
    88    The appellant was at the time employed by John O'Donnell Customs Agency at Ocean Street, East Botany, the principal of which firm was John Cecil O'Donnell, who said the appellant's nominal working hours were 8.30 am to 4.30 pm and his duties included deliveries of packages to any area within the Sydney Metropolitan area. One of his employees was Sally Bower who was married to Damien Bower and he recalled her husband coming to the business premises and moving furniture around the office one day during the week commencing 27 March, but he could not recall which day. He recalled allowing the appellant to leave early one day during that week, about 10 to 4 or 4 o'clock but he could not say which day it was (406). On Friday 31 March when the appellant came to work he was upset and said his girlfriend, whom he had not spoken to for a couple of days, had been kidnapped and the police thought he had done it and had questioned him at the Police Station for a few hours the previous evening, and that the police had been following him to work, and Mr O'Donnell sent him home during the morning (407).  
    89    Sally Bower said that during the week of 27 March the appellant worked each day except Friday, her husband came to the work place twice during the week, once on the Wednesday and she was not sure whether the other day was the Tuesday or the Thursday. One day he was there to help John O'Donnell move furniture and the other day he was waiting to pick her up because he had been to the hospital in the morning, but she was unable to recall which day was which (502-504).  
    90    Damien Bower, gave evidence that he went to his wife's workplace at about 3.15 pm on Wednesday 29 March and saw the appellant leave work that day between 3.45 pm and 4 o'clock (510). He recalled the particular date because he had attended the hospital at HMAS Penguin and had a blood sample taken by a Dr Gray whose hands were shaking when he took the sample; he had lunch with friends after having the blood sample taken and then went to his wife's work (504). He said he noted the time the appellant left because he and his wife were angry because as a result of the appellant leaving early they were unable to do so. He then attended the hospital on the following day, Thursday 30 March and was told Dr Gray was unavailable (he had had a stroke the previous day), and he then had another blood sample taken in the pathology department (510). He was cross-examined vigorously about inconsistencies with previous statements and previous evidence and confronted with the naval and hospital records, but did not vary his evidence, and insisted that Wednesday 29th was the day that he went to hospital in the morning and that the appellant left work early. 
    91    Danielle Seidl was another employee of Mr O'Donnell who said (413) that during the week commencing 27 March she saw Damien Bower in the office on the Wednesday but she said, ""I can't really remember now but when I look back at my statement I do recall I had a conversation with Sally who I was working with and he was ill and had to go for blood tests and she told me it was on the Wednesday"". She remembered there was a day when Damien Bower moved furniture about the office. She thought it was the day after he had the blood tests. Asked about the time the appellant finished work during that week, she replied, ""no I am not a hundred percent sure but I know on the Wednesday that he and Damien was in the office, he was quite ill and I remember him wanting his wife to come home early, and John (i.e. O'Donnell) let John Serratore go home early, but I can't remember what time of the day it was"". 
    92    Catherine Cavanagh, the pathologist from HMAS Penguin produced the relevant naval and hospital records relating to Mr Bower (Ex. 19). She said that Dr Gray had collapsed at his desk mid-morning on 29 March, having suffered a stoke, and died a few weeks later. The pathology records indicate that a sample of blood from Mr Bower was received on 30 March 1995 but the request form was not signed. The Clinical Notes dated 27 March and signed by Dr Gray indicate that he is for review on 30 March and the document headed ""Specialist Referral and Report"" dated 28 March 1995, contains a referral by Dr Gray for pathology tests and has the note at the top left hand corner, also apparently in Dr Gray's writing ""Thursday 0800 30.3.95"" indicating that Dr Gray wished to see him for a review on the Thursday, and presumably wanted the results of the tests before then. The document also contains in a different handwriting, a reference number 300395-2 which ties in with the following document in the exhibit which is a worksheet and contains the request number 300395-2 and the surname Bower. It was explained that this indicates it was the second request received on 30 March, but Miss Cavanagh said the request form was not signed and the sample may have been taken the previous day and not delivered to the laboratory until the 30th (497). Miss Cavanagh was unable to say when the sample had been taken and she would not concede that the records necessarily indicated that it was taken on the 30th (499). The following document records the sample date as 30/3/95 but the time space is left blank. There is also a leave pass dated 28 March signed by Dr Gray granting Mr Bower leave from 28 March 1995 expiring on board HMAS Penguin at 0800 on 30 March 1995. 
    93    Luke Yatris (a friend of the appellant) said that on the 29th, he rang the appellant at his home at about 6.30 pm but the latter's mother told him he was not home (401), Luke left a message for the appellant to ring him back, but he did not (402). The appellant (617) and his mother (966) both said that he was at home when Luke rang but did not want to speak to him and he told his mother to tell the caller he was not home, which she did. 
    94    The appellant denied that he left work early on Wednesday 29 March and said the day he left work early was Thursday the 30th, and this was because during the afternoon he had received a message from his sister that the police wanted to speak to him and he accordingly went home. Both in his recorded interviews and in his sworn evidence at the trial he said that he left work on the 29th at about ten to five and arrived home at about 5.30 pm. His mother and father were already there (614), and he parked his Toyota Corolla in the garage behind his Honda CSX, his sister arrived at about a quarter to six (615). He said that as he approached the house he saw Sam Vitaliti and Vince Mazzotta outside in the street (616).  
    95    He said that on Thursday 30 March he got a call from his sister during the afternoon that the police wanted to see him and so he left work at about 4 o'clock, went home and was home for about an hour and then he went up the street to get a packet of cigarettes, and it was while getting the cigarettes that his sister arrived home and he was not there; they then went to the police station where they arrived at about 6.30, and the recorded interview started at 7.02 (620-21). His evidence was generally supported by his sister Barbara Calati (808-810, cross-examined 842-844) and his mother and father. The issue was therefore whether it was the Wednesday or the Thursday that the appellant left work early, he maintaining it was the Thursday and Mr Bower claiming it was the Wednesday. If it was the Wednesday there was sufficient time for him to come home, change motor vehicles, travel to Strathfield Railway Station and meet the deceased. There may not have been time to take her to Wakehurst Parkway at Frenchs Forrest and be back by 8.30 to 9 pm, when Constable Hall rang, but he could have had an accomplice. On the other hand, if the appellant in fact left work early on Thursday 30th (as he now claims) it is surprising that in his second recorded interview on 17 May 1995 (Ex. J) he did not refer to that fact in answer to QQ 141-143. 
    96    The jury was in my view entitled to reject the evidence of the appellant, his family members and the two neighbours; in particular in relation to the two neighbours their evidence was such as to arouse suspicion of collusion. The appellant said they both spoke to him on Saturday, 1 April, and they had virtually identical but separate conversations with him; but, and notwithstanding those conversations where they allegedly told him they had seen him get home at about 5.30 pm on the Wednesday, he did not report that to the police until his solicitor did so some considerable time later. Moreover, Mazotta said they were both out the front of Vitaliti's house leaning on the front fence when they saw the appellant come home (1025) whilst Vitaliti said they were standing at the front of his driveway at that time (1049). It was a remarkable coincidence that they had both started to watch the Channel 10 news at 5 o'clock as they always did, and after watching the headline items for about ten to fifteen minutes, they both went out the front at about the same time for the same purpose of watching their children play in the street.  
    97    The assessment of Damien Bower and his evidence of the early departure of the appellant on the Wednesday was a proper function of the jury, and generally speaking they would be entitled to accept him as a witness of truth if he so impressed them, but in this case there was the problem of the medical records. Miss Cavanagh was not prepared to assert that the records necessarily indicated that he was not at the hospital on the 29th and that the blood test was not taken on the 29th. There is support for at least one of the blood tests being done on Wednesday the 29th because Dr Gray's Specialist Referral Report had ordered an HIV test for Damien Bower as well as other tests and Miss Cavanagh knew that such tests only occurred on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (500). I have come to the conclusion that, although the records may not necessarily have been right, there was a distinct possibility that they were, and in the light of that distinct possibility it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Bower's blood test was taken on the morning of Wednesday the 29th, and therefore it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had left work early at 4 o'clock on that date.  
     
      
     Third Essential Circumstance - That the Deceased was Killed on 29 March 1999. 
      
    98    Dr Botterill performed the post mortem on the deceased. He attended the Wakehurst Parkway on 2 April 1995 and observed the deceased's body at that location. He saw that the neck and chin were pushed forward so that the head was twisted backwards and there was a large wound to the front of the neck that had been caused by a small animal. At the post mortem he observed an injury to the right eye which might have been caused by local trauma to the side of the eye or face or by the petechiae coming together as a larger area of haemorrhage. The latter would be caused by asphyxiation (336). He also noted the presence of maggots in the head area of the deceased. These were sampled on 5 April and sent to the laboratory for investigation. He saw a bruise on the neck which in his opinion was caused within an hour before or after death and was consistent with a broad ligature being applied at that point (339). He also observed bruising to the lip, a number of multiple small abrasions over the left cheek, a 25 x 20 mm bruising over the scalp consistent with local trauma to that area, two areas of bruising over the right side of the cheek, one of which contained a finger nail scratch, and an abraded bruise on the left side of the neck which was consistent with being caused whilst defending oneself from strangulation; and all of these injuries he believed were caused within an hour before or after death. 
    99    His view was that the cause of death was consistent with strangulation (341) and this was suggested by the presence of bruising / abrasions over the left side of the neck, the areas of haemorrhage within the eyes, the additional bruises over the sides of the neck which were consistent with trying to prevent strangulation and the absence of any other explanation for the death (342). Defensive type injuries were also noted on the deceased's fingers (344). He concluded that death occurred between 29 March and 2 April 1995, but based on the degree of decompositional change, considered the most likely dates were 29 or 30 March (348). In evidence he maintained that 29 - 30 March was the most probable date but conceded that ascertaining the date of death is not a matter that could be approached with any great exactitude (348). He considered it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the deceased was still alive on the morning of 1 April (348). He could not completely exclude her being alive on 31 March, but thought it unlikely (348). There were no other wounds consistent with stabbing, shooting or other trauma. He said the decompositional changes suggested a post mortem period of four to five days, irrespective of the weather and the fact that the deceased was seen alive on the fifth previous day reduced it to the fourth which was 29 March (358). 
    100    Dr Peter Ellis, forensic pathologist, was called in the defence case. He based his opinion on photographs taken of the post mortem and where the body was discovered, he had read Dr Botterill's report, and also meteorological reports relating to daily temperatures. Based on his observations from the photographs of the extent of post mortem decomposition and to a lesser extent on Dr Botterill's report, he considered that death most likely took place two days prior to the body being found, that is on 31 March. He personally thought that earlier than 30 March was very unlikely (931). He was unable to nominate the cause of death but disagreed that the right eye injury was indicative of strangulation (932), although he was not able to say that she had not been strangled. He did not know the cause of death and said suffocation was a possibility. In cross-examination he conceded that death could have taken place as early as 29 March although he did not consider this likely (995). He also agreed that ascertaining the date of death is not a matter that can be approached with any great exactitude. Dr Botterill had had the advantage at about the time of the post mortem of discussing the subject with another pathologist Dr Cala, and Dr Ellis conceded that examination of the body and the scene itself was preferable to relying on photographs (see 983, 985). 
    101    Dr Levot, an entomologist, received the maggots sample by Dr Botterill from the body of the deceased and examined them. In his opinion, the eggs of those maggots were most likely to have been laid during the daylight hours of Friday 31 March 1995 (436), as maggots tend to lay eggs at the first available opportunity, but only during daylight hours. This would be consistent with the body being dumped on the evening of Thursday 30 March, but he conceded there were a number of variables, including uncertainty as to the actual species, the timing and extent of the refrigeration, uncertainty as to the temperature where the body was, and the small number of maggots and the small number of lavae examined (437).  
    102    Dr Dadour, a forensic entomologist, was provided with various materials including the report of Dr Botterill, the evidence of Dr Levot, a video of the body at the crime scene, enhanced photographs, and the two specimens of maggots given by Dr Botterill to Dr Levot, and he expressed the view that the time of placement of the body was about 42 hours before it was found, that is between the early evening of 31 March and 6 am on 1 April (637). Both entomologists agreed there were many variants that could affect their opinions, and that in different species, and even within species, there are different rates of growth.  
    103    There was evidence of alleged sightings of the deceased after her disappearance. Marie Ellen Wiltshire said that on Friday 31 March at about 4.15 pm she saw a girl in a car on the freeway near Berowra who appeared to be gagged and distressed looking out the rear window. The girl was in great distress, was in tears, had brown eyes and curly shoulder length dark brown hair. She almost immediately reported the fact to the police on the emergency number 000 (938-9) and the call was recorded (Ex. 17). On 2 April, her husband told her about a body being found near the Wakehurst Parkway at Narrabeen (940). She went to the Gosford Police Station, was shown some photographs and said that she was ""one hundred percent sure"" that the photos of Frances Tizzone were those of the person she had seen in the car (941). The vehicle was an older model Ford ""faded red"" (938). The difficulty about her evidence was that she was in a vehicle travelling south on the Gosford Freeway and the person she saw was in the back of a car parked at the side of a road looking through the rear windscreen, yet she purported to be able to describe her in detail including the colour of, and the fact of, tears in her eyes. Mrs Wiltshire was only shown photographs of the deceased and none of other persons of similar appearance. This tends to reduce the quality of her alleged identification.  
    104    John Gardiner was medically unfit to give evidence but his statements were read (1080-1082). He was an off duty police man at his home in Umina at about 9.30 pm on Friday 31 March, sitting in his bed listening to the news on his radio, when he heard a female voice screaming out from some distance away. He also heard a male arguing with her and the yelling and screaming becoming louder. He went to his window and saw a red Ford Falcon sedan in front of his next door neighbour's place approaching towards a roundabout at a street intersection and the male driver was swearing at the female passenger. The female was crying and looked distressed, calling out asking him to let her go. The Falcon had a red roof and the headlights were on. It had a ""patchy faded red roof"" (1081). He described the female as about 20 years of age with hair to shoulders which appeared to be permed giving it a wavy look, wearing a dark top, of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern appearance and Australian accent. The next morning he looked in the Sydney Telegraph and saw a picture of the same female person that he had seen in the red Falcon (this was a photograph of the then missing deceased) (1081). 
    105    In my view it was open to the jury to discount this evidence; both witnesses only had fleeting views and it is difficult to see how they could in the light and the circumstances of moving vehicles have an adequate view of the person they were referring to. In addition, the evidence concerning the fibres on the soles of the deceased's shoes (see Fourth Essential Circumstance below) could not have come from a Ford vehicle, and both of them referred to a vehicle of that make. 
    106    There was also the evidence of Betty Chown who was the Station Assistant at Doonside Railway Station and recalled selling a single ticket to Epping to a girl named Tizzone, between 4.30 and 5.15 on the afternoon of either 29 or 30 March (she was unable to say which). Statements were tendered by 13 young ladies with the same surname to say that they were not at Doonside on either day (Ex. EE). Moreover, the deceased told Rima Abou-Raad when she left university that she would be getting off the train at Burwood or Strathfield, and the person at Doonside was buying a ticket to Epping. It appears that all the deceased's friends lived in the Croydon Park area, and certainly not at Doonside, so the jury were entitled to form the view that it was inconceivable that the person to whom Mrs Chown was referring to was the deceased. She would have had no reason to go to Doonside, and if she was at Doonside, no reason to buy a ticket to go to Epping rather than to Burwood or Strathfield. Mrs Chown was not even sure which day it was that she sold the ticket. 
    107    One other factor which in my view is relevant to the date of death, is that not only was the deceased found fully clothed as she had been at university, but the back pack in which she carried her university notes and books, etc and the other bag that she took to university to carry her white coat and plastic gloves, along with her purse (which had apparently not been interfered with in any way) were all found very close to her body. I regard this as a significant factor indicating that her body was dumped very shortly after she was abducted on her way home from university.  
    108    Having regard to the whole of the evidence I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased met her death late on Wednesday 29 March, or very soon thereafter, and no later than 30 March. 
     
      
     Fourth Essential Circumstance - That the Deceased was in the Appellant's Honda CRX Motor Vehicle Shortly before her Death.  
      
    109    To prove this point, the Crown relied on evidence which it claimed matched the fibres adhering to the soles of the boots the deceased was wearing, with the fibres in the appellant's motor vehicle, which fibres and carpet were unique to that model of car and not found elsewhere in Australia. 
    110    Constable Layton, the Crime Scene Examiner, attended the body about 4.15 on Sunday 2 April and took a number of photographs (Ex. B). He noted there were fibres on the boots the deceased was wearing and removed a number of them. He said the fibres appeared to be adhering to the scuff marks on the soles and most of them were sitting up off the sole erect (182-3) and he subsequently took samples of the carpet from the various sites at the university identified to him by Rima Abou-Raad that the deceased had visited on 29 March (183).  
    111    The fibres removed by Detective Layton made their way to an analyst, Mr Wagner, who carried out infra red spectroscopy and identified three types of artificial fibre, namely grey polypropylene, blue polypropylene, and black polyester (244). On 28 April he received further items from the police, namely the fibres collected from various locations around Macquarie University. He compared these fibres with those from the boots and found that none were similar (245). He was also provided with the boots found on the body of the deceased and found a number of fibres still adhering to the soles thereof. These fibres again comprised the grey polypropylene, blue polypropylene and black polyester fibres (246-7).  
    112    He subsequently received and himself took samples from the carpet of the appellant's Honda CRX motor vehicle, he counted the fibres from the samples provided to him, carried out tests and found on microscopic examination that the fibres found on the boots of the deceased and the fibres obtained from the carpet on the floor in the front of the Honda were similar (252). He also carried out a count of the fibres and he found that the carpet on his count contained 53% grey polypropylene, 18.43% blue polypropylene, and 26.4% black polyester fibres. There was evidence from the manufacturer of Honda that the constitution in the carpet of the Honda CRX was 60% grey polypropylene, 15% blue polypropylene and 25% black polyester, these results being very similar to those found by Mr Waight when he did his examination of the fibres.  
    113    He expressed the view that his testing showed that the three types of fibres which had been obtained from the deceased's boots were the same as the sample fibres obtained by himself from the floor of the front seat of the appellant's car (254). Further testing led him to the conclusion that fibres similar to those in the carpet in the Tizzone's vehicle were not found on the deceased's shoes, and nor were fibres from all the samples that had been taken at Macquarie University (257).  
    114    He also conducted experiments in relation to adherence, that is the ability of fibres to be picked up by shoes and also resistance to the loss of fibres from the soles of shoes (258). For this purpose he had a female assistant wear the deceased's left shoe and a new right shoe, and as a result of those experiments he concluded that all three of the fibres found in the carpet on the front floor of the appellant's Honda CRX were easily transferred to the soles of the shoes of the passenger, and just as easily lost once the passenger walked on a hard surface (264). 
    115    There was evidence that this carpet was manufactured in Japan and was used only in 1990 or 1991 Honda CRX vehicles, and a schedule (Ex. GG) was tendered showing that the owners of 291 of such vehicles claimed not to have been in the Frenchs Forest area between 29 March and 2 April 1995. Only 296 vehicles of the 1990 / 1991 model had been distributed in Australia (Ex. FF). 
    116    In cross-examination, Mr Waight confirmed that information was now available to him which indicated that the Honda CRX carpet had four rather than three types of fibres, in that of the 60% grey polypropylene, 40% were 15 denier, and 20% were 7 denier, a fact that he had not taken into account (266). All the grey fibres he found he considered 15 denier, but he did not consider that this affected the validity of his conclusions (270). His attention was also drawn to the fact that the fibres on the boots and in the car were in different proportions, but again he did not consider this was a significant factor (273-274, 286). 
    117    Dr James Robertson, Director of Forensic Services, Australian Federal Police, gave evidence that he had been involved in studies relating to the transfer of fibres under different situations, and those studies showed that fibres are not retained upon the soles of shoes for more than a few minutes after being walked upon, regardless of the nature of the sole (302), and he expressed the opinion that it was unlikely the deceased could have walked for more than about 5 minutes, if at all, after leaving the source of the transferred fibres (307). He was also questioned about the difference in the variation in the percentage of different fibres which might be transferred from a carpet as compared to the percentage each of those fibres has in the source carpet and said that tests carried out showed that the percentage of fibres transferred was very variable, and indeed the composition of the actual carpet did not bear any relationship to the way in which the fibres were transferred by the shoes (309). 
    118    Sara Jones, a podiatrist, had examined the wear patterns on the deceased's shoes and said that the fibres were located on areas which would come into direct contact with the ground during normal gait or walking (332) and therefore she would expect that normal walking would have removed the fibres from the shoes (333). 
    119    Mr Pinakin Chaubal, who is the Manager of the Testing Services Division, Melbourne Institute of Textiles, gave evidence that there would have been virtually no polyester carpets such as that found in the appellant's vehicle in Australia in April 1995. He said that polyester is not used in Australian carpets particularly in the commercial field (377) and he had not come across a blend of polypropylene and polyester fibres in a carpet (378) either commercial or residential. He also expressed the opinion that it is unlikely that the blend of fibres lost from a carpet is identical to the blend in the carpet (378). 
    120    John Cauce, a chartered textile technologist, gave evidence that the fibres in the carpet installed in Honda CRX 1990/91 model vehicles have never appeared in any carpet installed in any Australian made car (476), such carpet has never been manufactured in Australia (476), and was a very unusual blend of fibres. He also said that the lighter the denier in carpet fibres, the greater the reaction to heat so, in relation to the Honda CRX carpet, the effect of the application of heat would be that the 7 denier fibre would shrink into the base of the carpet, the black polyester would be unaffected and the 15 denier fibre would shrink down only slightly. As a result it would be very difficult to remove the 7 denier fibre from the carpet (478-9).  
    121    The fact that this type of carpet was exclusive to Honda motor vehicles was also relevant to a Crown submission, already noted, that Mr Gardiner and Mrs Wiltshire could not have seen the deceased on 31 March, because the person they saw was in a red Ford.  
    122    The defence called Dr Ross Griffith, a textile technologist, who expressed the view that the conclusion that the fibres on the deceased's boots were from the Honda CRX was questionable for two reasons: a) there was no fine denier polypropylene found on the boots; and b) the results of the transfer / scuffing trials of Mr Waight were sufficient to query the proposition that the fibre came from the Honda CRX carpet. He said (1090) that he found Mr Waight's figures to show a surprisingly high proportion of polyester fibres on the boots from the proposed source of the Honda CRX carpet specified and as tested by Mr Waight in his various trials. He said there were alternate fibre sources from carpets which could have transferred to the boot and in particular 6 denier black polyester is extremely common and is used extensively in the Australian automotive industry ""at least to produce boot liners"" (1091). He also said (1092) that the failure to identify the different denier of grey polypropylene raised a serious doubt as to whether the fibres on the boots came from the relevant carpet. He sat in the Honda car and had the mat on the floor in front of him and tried to move it with his feet and by hand, and found it difficult to move and noted it was rubber backed (1093). In cross-examination, he agreed that Dr Robertson was a leading world expert in relation to transference and that when fibres are shed from a carpet they are shed differentially from their percentage within the carpet (1100, 1103). He also conceded that he had not used any information available from Dr Robertson in coming to his conclusions (1105) and ultimately (at 1106) said: -  
     
      
       
       ""I have not said that this is open and shut and there was not transfer from this carpet to that boot. I have simply said there has been two very observable differences in the information available one in relation to the proportion of fibres polyester in particular and secondly that no fine denier polypropylene was found. This brings into clear question in my mind the validity of the conclusion that of necessity one set of fibre data is linked to the other."" 
       
      
      
    123    Before this Court, significant reliance was placed on the failure of Mr Waight to identify four instead of three different fibres, treating the different denier grey fibres as two different fibres, also the different proportion of black polyester in the carpets (25%) and on the boots (73%). However, in my opinion these matters were thoroughly explored in the examination and cross-examination of the various witnesses, and both were explained in a way that could have satisfied the jury that they were not significant.  
    124    It was also argued that as the Honda had mats made of a different fibre composition on the floor between the passenger seat and the firewall, the shoes on a passenger in the front seat could not have picked up fibres from the carpet, but it was open to the jury to consider that if such passenger was being strangled, or otherwise under stress, she might well move around and thereby move the mat, or alternatively, some of the fibres could have been picked up from the carpet which protruded from underneath the edges of the mat.  
    125    In my opinion, there was ample evidence on which it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the fibres on the deceased's shoes came from the appellant's Honda CRX and that the remaining fibres on the shoes indicated she had not walked for more than about 5 minutes after leaving the vehicle. It was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was in the appellant's motor vehicle shortly before her death. 
     
      
     Conclusions 
      
    126    I am therefore of the opinion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and the deceased had agreed in a telephone call on the evening of 28 March to meet the following afternoon, nor that the deceased left work early on 29 March, although there was evidence which supported both propositions; but it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the deceased most likely died on the evening of 29 March and certainly no later than 30 March, and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was in the appellant's motor vehicle shortly before her death. 
    127    In determining whether there is a case to answer, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands, the accused ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands, he could lawfully be convicted: May v O'Sullivan (1995) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In considering such an application, the judge does not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case: R v Towers (1984) 14 A Crim R 12 at 14, Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-5, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; and in a case of circumstantial evidence, such as the present, a finding of no case to answer is not open if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be postulated: R v JMR (1991) 39 A Crim R 39 at 44. I am satisfied that there was a case to answer and ground of appeal 2 is not made out. 
    128    In relation to grounds 6 (i) to (v) his Honour directed the jury that before they could find the appellant guilty on either of the alternative bases alleged by the Crown, it was necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the four ""essential circumstances"" which he identified. With due respect to his Honour, I consider that this direction was not appropriate, and unduly restricted the Crown case. Bearing in mind that the appellant was under police surveillance from late on the 29th, the proposition that the appellant himself killed the deceased required proof beyond reasonable doubt that he left work early on that day, that the deceased was in his car shortly before her death and that she died on the evening of the 29th, but not necessarily that they arranged in a telephone call the previous evening for a meeting to take place. If she was in his car that evening shortly prior to her death, and he had left work early, it was open to the jury to conclude that they had met, but it was not necessarily pre-arranged in a telephone call the previous evening overheard by her sister and discussed with her mother. Her declining of the lift from university offered by Miss Abou-Raad clearly indicated that she was intending to meet someone. 
    129    On the other hand, the alternative Crown case did not require such specific proofs. It did require something beyond the history of the relationship and the alleged kidnap plot of the previous November as described by Mr Radwan; but the fact that the deceased was in the appellant's motor vehicle shortly before her death, if proved to the jury's satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, would itself have provided the necessary link. It was not necessary for this alternative case to establish the arrangement of the meeting nor that the appellant left work early on the 29th, although this case was considerably strengthened if the Crown was able to satisfy the jury that she had died on that day.  
    130    But the jury were directed by his Honour that they could only convict if satisfied at least that all four ""essential circumstances"" or intermediate facts were established beyond reasonable doubt, and in my view, they could not, acting reasonably, have been satisfied to that standard of two of those matters; and accordingly they must have misunderstood or not followed the directions given by the trial judge. 
    131    The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) provides that on an appeal against conviction, the Court shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion: 
     
      
       
       (a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) that the judgement of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or 
       
      
      
       
       (c) that on any other ground there was a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
      
    132    The High Court has recently drawn attention to the necessity to pay proper attention to the wording of the section when considering appeals: Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68, (1998) 158 ALR 379 at [12], see also R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53 at [32] - [39]. 
    133    In my opinion, the direction that in order to convict on either basis of the Crown case required proof beyond reasonable doubt of all four so-called ""essential circumstances"" constituted a wrong decision on a question of law, but it was a decision which was unduly favourable to the appellant and would not justify the upholding of the appeal on that ground. 
    134    An appeal may also be allowed in accordance with the section if the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. In my opinion there was a considerable body of evidence on which it was open to the jury, acting reasonably and having regard to the evidence, to find the appellant guilty on one or other of the bases alleged by the Crown. Without being exhaustive, this evidence included that she had been in his car shortly before her death, the evidence of the relationship between them including his violence towards her, his obsessiveness and jealousy in relation to her, his approach to Radwan to have her kidnapped and killed, and his statement to Radwan in February 1995 that he was still ""going to do it,"" the lies he told in his recorded interviews about not seeing her since November (he gave an explanation for these lies, but it was up to the jury to assess the explanation) and that, although claiming to be in love with her, when made aware of her disappearance he made no offer to help look for her, no approaches to their mutual friends to see if they knew anything about her whereabouts, nor did he make any enquires over the next few days to ascertain whether she had been located, nor disclose the true nature of their relationship. Compare Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234. 
    135    The third ground on which an appeal may be allowed is that on any other ground there has been a miscarriage of justice. In my opinion, as the jury could not, acting reasonably, have followed the trial judge's directions and found all four ""essential circumstances"" proved beyond reasonable doubt, there has been such an irregularity as to constitute a miscarriage of justice, or to use the language that was current prior to Fleming, such an irregularity as to render the verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory, notwithstanding that it was on the evidence reasonably open to the jury to convict: R v Anderson (1991) 53 A Crim R 421 at 449, R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 402. To adopt the words of the High Court in a quite different case, the court  
     
      
       
       ""will set aside a conviction whenever it appears unjust or unsafe to allow the verdict to stand . . . because there is some feature of the case raising a substantial possibility that, either in the conclusion itself, or in the manner it has been reached, the jury may have been mistaken or mislead"":  
       Davies and Cody v The King  
       (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 180.  
       
      
      
    136    On upholding an appeal against conviction, the Court has power, to enter a verdict of acquittal (s 6(2)), or order a new trial (s 8(1)). The factors relative to whether a new trial should be ordered have been considered in a number of cases, including Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627, King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423, Clough, Anderson and Giam. In Anderson at 453 Gleeson CJ (although not ordering a new trial in the particular circumstances of that case) said: 
     
      
       
       ""The principal considerations in favour of ordering a new trial . . . are the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders, the serious nature of the alleged crimes, and the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the appellant finally determined by a jury which, according to the constitutional arrangements applicable in this State, is the appropriate body to make such a decision."" 
        
       
      
     In a case such as the present where the appeal succeeds on the ground of irregularity and there was evidence on which, acting reasonably and in accordance with appropriate directions, it would be open to a jury to convict, I consider the appropriate course is to order a new trial. 
      
      
     Grounds of Appeal 5, 5A, 5B, 5C - Failure to give Warnings. 
      
    137    At the trial the Defence sought a number of warnings from the trial judge. His Honour was specifically asked to direct the jury that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Patricia Tizzone and Antonella Tizzone as to the alleged telephone call of 28 March 1995 and the alleged arrangement whereby the appellant was to meet the deceased; that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Damien Bower that the appellant left work early on 29 March 1995; and that it could be dangerous to accept the evidence of Patricia Tizzone and Bassam Radwan as to the alleged soliciting to murder. 
    138    These pieces of evidence did not come within any of the categories specified in the Evidence Act 1995, s 165(1) but that does not exclude the necessity to give a warning in an appropriate case. 
    139    However, apart from the evidence of Bassam Radwan, this evidence did not belong to any particular category that may, because of its nature, be unreliable, but was merely evidence which was challenged by the defence; in the case of the evidence of the sister and mother on the basis of alleged inconsistencies with their subsequent conduct, and in the case of Damien Bower on the basis of the relevant medical records. These were pure questions of fact and were properly matters for the jury. They did not involve considerations of particular issues which would be well understood by lawyers, but may not be so well understood by, or familiar to, lay persons, as are those matters specified in s 165(1): compare Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 323-4 per Brennan J. The trial judge summarised the relevant evidence and it may be assumed that Counsel addressed on these matters in some detail. In my view no further warnings or directions in relation to these matters were necessary or appropriate. In any event, his Honour did direct the jury that the evidence of the mother and sister may be unreliable because of their close relationship to the deceased (SU 17). 
    140    As to the evidence of Bassam Radwan, s 165(1) did apply because the witness had been charged with a number of burglary offences and when charged had given an undertaking to give evidence in accordance with his statement and had thereupon been granted an indemnity; but in respect of his evidence, his Honour gave the jury an appropriate warning (SU 17). 
    141    It was also submitted (ground 5) that the jury should have been warned that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence before the jury. As I have already indicated, I consider there was evidence upon which it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to convict. In those circumstances such a warning would have been totally inappropriate and an unwarranted interference in the jury's role as the tribunal of fact. 
     
      
     Ground of Appeal 4. 
      
    142    Finally ground 4 was that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit into evidence a running sheet created 9 April 1995 relating to the information reported to police by Mrs Wiltshire. This was tendered as truth of its contents to corroborate her evidence. The witness had given her account orally before the jury, she had not been attacked on the basis of recent invention or that the evidence was a fabrication, but merely that it lacked reliability. The running sheet was not admissible under s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 because it was not suggested her evidence was fabricated but merely that she was mistaken, and it was not admissible under s 69(2) because it had been made in connection with an investigation leading to a criminal proceeding: s 69(3)(b). It was submitted it was admissible under s 66(2), but it added nothing to her evidence, and was therefore not probative of anything. 
     
     Order 
      
    143    I therefore propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence set aside and a new trial ordered.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL No. 60675 of 1998

     FRIDAY, 26 NOVEMBER 1999 
     
     REGINA v. JOHN SERRATORE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    144    GREG JAMES, J: I have had the advantage of seeing a draft of the judgment of his Honour Mr. Justice Dunford and am grateful to his Honour for his review of the case and summary of the evidence. 
    145    I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour's reasons for those orders. 
     
      
     The new trial 
      
    146    In relation to the discussion of the matters in respect of the order proposed by his Honour for a new trial, I add to those authorities to which his Honour refers, that of Parker v. The Queen [1997] HCA 13; (1997) 186 CLR 494. It is my view that the evidence of and relating to the soliciting of Radwan or others to murder the deceased might be used other than merely as relationship evidence and that at least as far as potential liability as an accessory before the fact is concerned the ""four essential circumstances"" approach was too restrictive. Referring to the test for a new trial considered in Parker (supra), I am of the view that the order proposed by his Honour for a new trial would not compel the appellant to meet a ""quite different case to that presented against him"" originally. Such a trial could proceed with the evidence of the soliciting available to be used particularly to support the inference of procuring, on the basis of the appellant being liable as an accessory before the fact. I also consider the trial could proceed on the basis he was a principal, notwithstanding the view Dunford, J. takes, and I share, that it was not open to the jury to find certain of the four essential circumstances. There would still remain sufficient evidence for there to be a case against him as a principal. That evidence could include soliciting, which supports the motive personally to kill. I am of this view notwithstanding the views Dunford, J. has taken and with which I agree on the proof of the four circumstances. There is a difference between no evidence leading to no case and some evidence leading to what used to be called an unsafe and unsatisfactory case. That difference reflects the difference in the function between a trial judge and that of this court.  
    147    Even considering the matter from the ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" viewpoint, in my opinion, on the analysis made by Dunford, J., with which I agree, even if (putting aside the evidence of soliciting) it was not open to the jury to be satisfied the appellant was the actual assailant, or was present assisting, if those propositions required proof beyond reasonable doubt of all of the four essential circumstances, nonetheless it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had procured the killing of the deceased. 
    148    I have concluded generally that there need be no other change to the way the case was presented to the jury and that the form of indictment was entirely proper. From that statement I except the matters I have already referred to, the directions on the matters of which the jury had to be satisfied on each basis and the direction as to unanimity. 
    149    The direction that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the four essential circumstances for any finding of guilt, whether it was on either of the bases advanced by the Crown, was in my view at most only appropriate to the liability of the appellant as a principal since it is only to the appellant's presence at the killing those circumstances went and unlike presence for a principal, absence is not a necessary requirement for liability as an accessory. 
    150    For the reasons given by Dunford, J. when examining the evidence supporting the four essential circumstances for liability on the basis the appellant was a principal, for that basis to be left to a jury, consideration will need to be given to whether there is, in the evidence at the new trial, sufficient for a jury to find guilt if the case were that it would be essential the jury find those circumstances so that the appellant's presence, at least, at the killing would be, in their view, established. 
    151    It follows that if the case is to be left to the jury on the alternative basis of the liability of the appellant as a principal, a direction that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of such matters as would enable them to find his presence at the killing would be necessary in respect of that basis. It may be that an appropriate direction would be that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the four essential circumstances. In any event, whatever form a direction on that basis might take, it would be necessary, since an explanation exculpatory of the accused from liability on that basis is being advanced, for some such appropriate direction to be given. But its terms should limit its effect to the basis to which such exculpatory explanation might apply.  
    152    Should a new trial proceed on both bases, I consider that the jury should be directed that they need to be unanimous as to their verdict, and each juror needs to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all the necessary elements of the basis on which guilt is found. But they need not be unanimous as to the different bases for that verdict, provided that they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was at least an accessory before the fact. If they are unanimous as to that, the law's requirement for unanimity on verdict will be met. 
    153    In addition to those matters, it will be necessary for a trial judge to consider carefully how the evidence relating to the solicitation of Radwan and others might be used in the light of the evidence as it comes forward at any new trial. 
     
      
     The form of the indictment and the two bases 
      
    154    I turn now to that first ground of appeal. It is as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""1(a) His Honour, Barr, J. and the learned trial judge were in error in not requiring the Crown to plead the alternative methods for murder in two alternative counts, one charging the appellant as a principal and one charging him as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory before the fact. 
       
      
      
       
       1(b) His Honour the learned trial judge was in error in permitting the alternatives to be considered by the jury."" 
       
      
    155    Submissions of a like kind to those put in support of this ground were made and argued at and before the trial as well as before this court. In the light of what I have said about what is available to support both bases when discussing new trial orders, I will deal with those submissions on the basis that there is evidence to support both bases, and the position is unlike that in Regina v. Sparrow (1980) 51 CCC (2d) 443; Regina v. Cloutier (1980) 48 CCC (2d) 1 and Regina v. Rahman (1981) 59 CCC (2d) 323, which cases turned on an absence of sufficient evidence of one basis of liability which was, as a result, wrongly left to a jury. 
    156    The arguments in support of this ground, to a certain extent, impacted on the submission made at trial and here, that there was no case to answer, and that made here that the conviction was not supported by the evidence, in that it was put that the jury could not be or should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the four essential circumstances and it would follow that they could not be satisfied that the accused personally killed the deceased or, as a logical alternative, and having regard particularly to the possibility he was the actual murderer, that the accused was an accessory before the fact or principal in the second degree to the act of killing performed by another. 
    157    The point was raised before Barr, J. in advance of the trial and written submissions and further submissions in writing were provided both to Barr, J. and to the learned trial judge, both of whom delivered considered judgments rejecting the submissions of the appellant. 
    158    Although at one point resort was made to a suggestion the single count employed in the indictment ""did murder"" was bad for duplicity, the argument made really turned on the basis of the asserted incompatibility that I have described, the vice lying, so it was said, in the prospect that the jury might not be unanimous as to the basis of guilt, that the asserted evidentiary deficiencies of each case on each alternative basis might be obscured, that the law of indictments would preclude the two bases being asserted under a single count of murder or that sentence might proceed on a false premise. 
    159    The unattractive submission appears to be, that, where it is not possible to distinguish beyond reasonable doubt whether the accused killed, helped or procured the killing, he had to be acquitted even though there was a sufficiency of evidence to enable a jury to find those matters. 
    160    The challenge is not merely based on a technical point of pleading. It is contended that it was not open to the prosecution to make the alternative cases in the one proceeding. The submission is not merely put on a technical procedural basis but relies on the law of complicity and the requirements of law and practice as to the framing of indictments as defining the ambit of what cases might lawfully be made under them. It is contended that liability as an accessory in substance is incompatible with liability as a principal. It was contended that to proceed on both bases there should have been two counts and that the alternatives should not have been permitted to be left on one count. 
    161    Reliance was placed on s.346 and s.378 of the Crimes Act 1900 as showing the appropriate mode of charging, which it is submitted is inconsistent with the making of alternative cases as here. Those sections read:- 
     
      
       
       ""s.346 Every accessory before the fact to any such felony may be indicted, convicted and sentenced, either before or after the trial of the principal felon, or together with such felon, or indicted, convicted and sentenced, as a principal in the felony, and shall be liable in either case to the same punishment as the principal felon, whether the principal felon has been tried or not, or is amenable to justice or not."" 
       
      
      
      
       
       ""s.378 In an indictment against an accessory to murder, or manslaughter, it shall be sufficient to charge the felony of the principal in the manner hereinbefore specified, and then to charge the accused as an accessory in the manner heretofore accustomed."" 
       
      
    162    Although it was conceded these are enabling provisions, it was submitted that s.378 qualifies the more general provision to restrict its operation in the case of homicide or alternatively that the drafting of the two provisions indicates that the legislation never contemplated that, particularly in the case of homicide, the charge might embrace both bases of liability in the alternative and that a charge having that effect was otherwise unavailable at law. 
    163    Although it is accepted that the accused was aware of the nature of the cases the Crown proposed to make and that the Crown alleged either the accused was the principal or was accessory to an unknown principal, it is contended that there was still substantive prejudice to the appellant such that the task should not have been left to a jury of having to decide ultimate guilt on these inconsistent bases as they might not have been unanimous on the relevant basis and that they might have been confused as to the essential facts, further, a real problem it is said was presented to the judge in seeking to ascertain how to sentence consistently with the jury's verdict. 
     
      
     The case at trial 
      
    164    As the judgment of Dunford, J. makes clear, the case was left to the jury on both bases and in respect of both, the trial judge directed the jury that it was necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the four essential circumstances before a finding of guilt could be reached. As will appear, the trial judge's directions essentially encapsulated the legal bases on which the case was left to the jury as requiring them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused was the actual murderer or the procurer of his girlfriend's murder. 
    165    Prior to commencing the trial, the trial judge, in a considered judgment, severed a count of soliciting to murder from the indictment and ruled that the Crown could proceed on the alternative bases on the sole remaining count as pleaded and without any addition. 
    166    The Crown opened the case relevantly in the following passage, which is reproduced without attempting the obvious textual amendments:- 
     
      
       
       ""He was charged on 20 September with the matter now before the court. The Crown when charging him with murder puts its case a number of different ways. The Crown case is that the accused John Serratore was responsible for the murder of Frances Tizzone. Either he killed her himself or he procured, obtained, somewhat (sic) else to kill her for him, that person being unknown. 
       
      
      
       
       Providing the essential elements of the charge are established, the Crown says you can find the accused guilty of murder if you find beyond reasonable doubt that he procured an unknown person to kill Frances, whether he was present or not; and thirdly, if you are unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the (sic) killed her, or whether he procured her, but you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that is one or the other but you can't say which, then that would also be a basis upon which he would be guilty of murder. 
       
      
      
       
       So, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he killed her himself, which would involve the Crown proving the death of Frances Tizzone due to the act of the accused John Serratore, which was an unlawful act, that being not in self-defence, for example, and it was an act which was done with either intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. 
       
      
      
       
       The first leg is kill her himself which caused death by his own act, it being an unlawful act intending to cause grievous bodily harm or to kill her. 
       
      
      
       
       Secondly, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an unknown person murdered Frances Tizzone and John Serratore was present aiding and abetting the unknown killer - that means the crown would have to prove the murder of Frances Tizzone by the unknown person and John Serratore was present and assisting if necessary as previously agreed between he, Serratore, and the unknown person: or that unknown person murdered Frances Tizzone and John Serratore was a party to that agreement for that unknown person to murder Frances Tizzone so he arranged it, procured it. 
       
      
      
       
       So he did it himself, he procured someone to do it for him, and he was either present aiding and abetting or not, but if he simply procured the person to do it for him - if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to any of those three then the verdict is guilty. If you are not so satisfied you have to look to see whether you can come to the conclusion that you are satisfied he was responsible for her death in that he either killed her himself or arranged or procured someone else to do it. 
       
      
      
       
       His Honour will give you more detailed instructions at the end of the case, but that is in essence how the Crown puts its case."" 
       
      
    167    The trial judge directed the jury:- 
     
      
       
       ""However, the issue which is paramount in this case is whether the death of the deceased was caused as a result of any act of the accused or an act committed at his behest. That is the prime issue in this case. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       The question which emerges in this case is the one I have identified and one which has been clearly identified to you from go to whoa, namely was the death of the deceased the result of an act of the accused or an act committed on his behalf by another? That is the question in the case."" 
       
      
    168    In coming to sentence the appellant, his Honour referred to the Crown having put its case on alternative bases and described them as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""At the trial the Crown put its case on an alternative basis. The first of these bases was that on 29 March 1995 the prisoner left work early and met the deceased at Strathfield railway station. Somewhere between the station and where her body was found, he killed her either by strangulation or suffocation and dumped her body at the point where it was found. The vehicle he used was his Honda CRX. 
       
      
      
       
       The alternative allegation made by the Crown was that the prisoner had arranged for somebody else to kill her. That was either done in his presence or without his presence, but that arrangement of necessity involved the utilisation of the prisoner's CRX Honda motor car. The Crown case in this regard relied, inter alia, upon evidence that in November 1994, the prisoner had attempted to solicit one Bassam Radwan to kill the deceased and other evidence relating to the engagement of persons from Kings Cross to do such a deed. 
       
      
      
       
       In my view and I so find, that in fact the first of the bases is correct, namely that the prisoner himself killed the deceased. 
       
      
      
       
       In charging the jury, I directed them that in order to find the prisoner guilty they had to find, beyond reasonable doubt, four essential circumstances. They were:- 
       
      
      
       
       1. That on the evening of 28 March 1995 as a consequence of a telephone call, the prisoner and the deceased had arranged to meet. 
       
      
      
       
       2. That the prisoner left work between 3.45 pm and 4.00 pm on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       3. The deceased was killed on 29 March 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       4. That the deceased was in the prisoner's Honda CRX shortly before her death. 
       
      
      
       
       The jury's verdict of guilty indicates that they found those facts beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      
      
       
       On the basis of those facts which the jury must have found, I am of the view that the proper inference to draw is that it was the prisoner himself and not another but (sic) killed the deceased, and killed her either by strangling or suffocating her. His motive in so doing was jealousy which arose as a result of a situation where the prisoner was obsessively possessive in relation to the deceased."" 
       
      
    169    The inference his Honour drew accorded with the jury's verdict which, on his Honour's directions, must have resulted from a finding of the four circumstances. It illustrates how proof of the four circumstances point to immediate and personal involvement in the killing as a principal. If it was not open to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the four circumstances, it is difficult to see how the finding the appellant was the actual killer could be upheld. The drawing of this conclusion in these circumstances is said to illustrate the appellant's argument that the single count might cause such a result. The result was not caused by the single count, however, but by the four circumstances being left to the jury as necessary intermediate facts applicable to both bases. 
    170    Prior to his Honour's summing up, in addition to the submissions put on the applications to which I have already referred and that put at the close of the Crown case that the charge should not be left to the jury, defence counsel had sought a direction that the case should be left to the jury only on the basis that the accused himself had killed the deceased and a submission was further made that there was no evidence fit to go to the jury on the ""alternative basis of arrangement with someone else to do the deed"" (ie., principal in the second degree or accessory before the fact). 
    171    In response, the Crown made the following submission:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is not a case of the Crown saying either he did it or he got someone else to do it. The Crown says he was responsible for the murder in that he either committed the murder himself or had an assistant who either did the murder or simply assisted him. … It may well be the strongest position the Crown has is the jury could say that they cannot determine whether (he) killed her or whether he got an accomplice to kill her. But they could determine that he did one or the other, and that is really the basis of the judgment of Gleeson, CJ. in  
       Regina v. White 
       ."" 
       
      
    172    The Crown's case and submissions, as did the trial judge's directions to which I have referred above, embraced a liability contended for by the Crown on the basis of all recognised degrees of complicity in the crime charged, that is, both as principal and also as accessory. But that liability arose because of the one act causing death and postulated either a direct responsibility as principal or derivative responsibility as principal in the second degree or accessory for that act (see Osland v. The Queen (1998) 159 ALR 170 and particularly the discussion by McHugh, J.) and Surujpaul v. The Queen (1958) 42 Cr. App. R. 266 at 269). No question arose here but that a murder had been committed. No independent act or omission causing death as might have been appropriate for an additional or separate count of homicide was relied on (see Regina v. Gorman (CCA, unreported 15 May 1997). There was no question of duplicity. 
     
      
     The New South Wales position 
      
    173    In Regina v. White (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 237 on an indictment in the same form as that used in the present proceedings, the accused was charged in the alternative. Gleeson, CJ. noted:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown case against the accused was put in two alternative ways. One alternative was that it was the appellant who actually pulled the trigger that activated the gun that fired the shot and killed the deceased. Alternatively, it was alleged that, if he did not actually use the murder weapon that killed the deceased, he planned the murder and aided, abetted, counselled or procured the shooting of the deceased by some other person."" 
       
      
    174    Although there was, in that case, no argument challenging the form of the indictment or the appropriateness of a trial on such bases, there was equally no criticism by the court of the course taken. 
    175    In Regina v. Sourelos (CCA, unreported 6 September 1984) in relation to a misdemeanour (to which, at common law, all participants were equally complicit) it was argued that the case on the sole count was left on the alternative bases of principal and accessory without adequate instruction on unanimity. The appeal was dismissed without the court expressly concluding such a course was open or having to consider closely the unanimity direction. The court held that the charge embraced appropriately the personal acts of the accused and his assistance to others as proving his guilt of a statutory offence of cultivation and on that basis the direction eventually given was correct. That offence, by statute, could be committed in circumstances involving both direct and indirect participation. Similarly see the analysis of McHugh, J. in Davis v. The Queen (1991) 66 ALJR 22. 
    176    On the precise question before this court, we were informed that there was no authority in this State directly on point. It will therefore be necessary to consider the history and development of any relevant principles and to determine their content. 
    177    The pleading argument should be considered in the light of an examination of the history, principles and practice of criminal pleadings as adopted in this State or as inherited and then a comparison made with the position as revealed in texts and other decisions elsewhere. 
    178    The history of the development of the New South Wales practice and procedure in the regulation of criminal proceedings on indictment may be found in ""A History of the Supreme Court of New South Wales"" (J.M. Bennett, Law Book Company, 1974, 71-75). 
    179    In New South Wales, the forms of indictment required by the common law were mitigated by statute. Short forms were prescribed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883. Their history is reviewed in the judgment of Allen, J. in Regina v. Glynn (1994) 33 NSWLR 139. As his Honour points out, those short forms were rescinded on 31 December 1987. 
    180    The short forms that had been prescribed pursuant to s.461 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (46 Vic. No. 17) which by that section were ""sufficient for the purpose"" and ""deemed sufficiently to state the offence"" had been continued in force by s.2 of the Crimes Act 1900 until the rescission referred to in Glynn (supra). Those forms in respect of specific offences enabled the statement of the offence in a more concise manner than that required by the common law. The requirements of the common law are referred to in Glynn (supra) by Allen, J. in the extracts he sets out from the seventh edition of Archbold's Summary of the Law Relative to Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases by John Jervis (published in 1838). 
    181    The principles and particularly in relation to principals and accessories may be found discussed in ""A Treatise on Criminal Pleading with precedents of Indictments, Special Pleas & c. adapted to Practice"" (Vol. 1, 2 ed. by Thomas Starkie, Esq., London, 1822, pp.81-88 inclusive). 
    182    The relevant forms were prescribed by the judges of the court on 27 September 1884 and are to be found in McNaughton, ""A Synopsis of Indictable Offences"" published by the Government Printer in 1885. Those forms included Form 4 in which the indictment for murder is set out as charging that AB ""did feloniously and maliciously murder JN"". Such a form reflected s.318 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act which provided for the sufficiency of such a form in the special case of murder. That section continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""And it shall be sufficient, in any indictment against an accessory to murder, … , to charge the principal in the manner hereinbefore specified, and then to charge the accused as an accessory, in the manner heretofore accustomed."" 
       
      
    183    Section 303 of that Act provided:- 
     
      
       
       ""Every accessory before the fact to any such felony may be indicted, convicted, and sentenced, either before or after the trial of the principal felon, or together with such felon - or be indicted, convicted and sentenced, as a principal in the felony - and shall be liable, in either case, to the same punishment as the principal felon is subject to - whether the principal felon has been tried or not, or is or not amenable to justice."" 
       
      
    184    Section 302 of that Act provided that a principal in the second degree was liable to the same punishment as the principal in the first degree. 
    185    It was not necessary to provide by statute for any particular form of indictment distinguishing between the degrees of complicity for principals as the same form of indictment was appropriate at common law for principals generally. But in The King v. Gordon (1789) 1 Leach 515 the distinction between the appropriateness of an indictment for a principal, including a principal in the second degree and that appropriate for an accessory, is noted. 
    186    There are modern decisions where the immateriality of the distinction between degrees of complicity for principals is apparent, eg., Regina v. Smith & Kirton (CCA, unreported 15 February 1990) where the Crown restricted its case to that class of accessories present at the crime, ie., principals in the second degree and Davis (supra) where the majority of the High Court upheld the application of the proviso on the basis the applicant was a principal of one degree or the other. The remarks of Thomas, J. (with whom Shepherdson and Williams, JJ. agreed) in Regina v. Baynes (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 405 were apparently limited to co-principals (including principals in the second degree, ie. supporters or aiders present or constructively present at the crime). His Honour at 408 said:- 
     
      
       
       ""There is no doubt in any of the authorities that when two or more persons are charged with an offence in a single count, they may be criminally liable either as the principal actor or as a supporter under any applicable provision including ss.7 and 8. In that situation there is little difficulty in recognising that an accused should be convicted if the evidence showed either that he is guilty as a principal offender for his own separate acts or that he is liable (under s.7 or s.8) for the consequences of the acts of another. Both routes to conviction are available on the facts as they jury finds them to be. Even if the jury is unable to say whether the accused in question was the principal or the aider, it may convict if the evidence shows he must have been one or the other: ( 
       Downing 
        (1844) 1 Den. 52 [169 ER 146];  
       Salmon 
        (1880) 6 QBD 79;  
       Sperotto 
        at 342, 344;  
       DPP v. Merriman 
        at 593, 595, 596-697, 603, 607; 775, 778-779, 781, 790, 796;  
       Thompson 
        (1979) 22 SASR 12 at 16-17). A familiar example is a robbery involving two offenders where the evidence does not clearly establish whether a particular offender (A) committed the act of violence and stealing, or whether he was the one who assisted in the provision and driving of the vehicle. In such a case so long as the evidence shows that A must have been one or the other he may properly be convicted. These alternative routes to conviction remain open on the single count."" 
       
      
    187    The provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act caught up those of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 (24 and 25 Vict. C. 94) which had worked such a radical change avoiding the strictures of the common law in respect of the liability and charging of accessories before the fact to the extent that the Report of the Criminal Code Commission referred to the old law as being ""practically superseded"" by that enactment. (See the discussion in Stephens Commentaries, 9ed., Book IV at 44-48.) 
    188    Reflecting the adoption in New South Wales of those provisions, the form of indictment for an accessory before the fact in the particular case of homicide pursuant to s.378 and its predecessor, s.303, was to be found at Form 262 in the short forms of indictment:- 
     
      
       
       ""After charging the principal with the felony, charge the accessory, thus: and the Attorney-General aforesaid further charges that DC, before the said felony was committed in form aforesaid, to wit, on the _____ day of ________, in the year aforesaid at ___________ in the Colony aforesaid, did incite, move, procure, aid, counsel, hire, and command, the said AB to commit the said felony in manner aforesaid."" 
       
      
    189    It was a form appropriate to known degrees of complicity and a known principal. 
    190    Such or similar forms were found in successive editions of Hamilton & Addison, Criminal Law and Procedure New South Wales and Crawford's Proof in Criminal Cases, appearing particularly in the third edition by Tyson & McKay. They are also found in current texts and practice books. Since the rescission referred to in Glynn (supra), they have no statutory force however. 
    191    Section 17 of the Supreme Court Act provides for rules to be made under that Act (s.17(2)(a)) ""for regulating and prescribing the practice and procedure of the court …"". The Supreme Court Rules, Part 75 Rule 3D, prescribes a form of indictment. That form is as follows:- 
     
      
      ""( 
      Form of indictment 
      ) 
      
      
       
       ( 
       Under the description 
        INDICTMENT  
       on the form insert a statement of the nature of the offence, for example 
        for murder  
       and, if a statutory offence, insert under that statement 
        under s… of the Crimes Act 1900  
       or as the case may require 
       . 
       
      
      
       
       New South Wales 
       
      
      
       
       On 7 May 19… the Attorney General ( 
       or 
        Director of Public Prosecutions) on behalf of Her Majesty ( 
       or as the case may require: see ss.4 and 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       ) charges that ( 
       state the offence 
       ). 
       
      
      
      ( 
      signature, full name and capacity of signatory: see s.15 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      .)"" 
      
    192    Section 567 of the Crimes Act adds further statutory authority to the making of a rule under the Supreme Court Act prescribing forms of indictments and continues:- 
     
      
       
       ""Every such form, so prescribed, shall thereafter be sufficient for the purpose, and be deemed sufficiently to state the offence, or matter, for, or in respect of which, it is framed."" 
       
      
      
       
       The preceding is, however, the only form prescribed.  
       
      
    193    Section 346 provides for indictment as for a principal to be sufficient and it is apparent that s.378 continues so much of s.318 of the amendment Act as dealt with the sufficiency of an indictment against an accessory to murder or manslaughter. Both modern provisions remain to similar effect to those in the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861. 
    194    The present statutory modification of the common law position and the history is summarised in Gillies, The Law of Criminal Complicity (Law Book Company, 1980) pp.19-26. 
    195    Gillies (supra) points out that at common law a person charged as a principal in the first degree may be convicted upon proof of aiding and abetting without any obligation to amend the indictment - p.189 - and refers to authority in which, prior to the 1861 Act where there has been doubt as to the exact role of a participant, that participant has been charged in separate counts in the alternative as a principal in the first degree and as an aider. He expresses the view that such a course was unnecessary.  
    196    By statute, however, by virtue of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, s.1, if a person is charged as a principal in either degree and is proved to be an accessory, conviction is open (see Gillies, p.190). Gillies notes that the Crimes Act 1900 provision by s.346 (the effect of which is not cut down by s.378) is that an accessory may be indicted and convicted as a principal offender so that if there is doubt as to whether the defendant participated as a principal or as an accessory before the fact, it would seem to be prudent to charge him as principal (p.196) and refers to Glanville Williams, Criminal Law the General Part at pp.405-407 in a footnote. 
    197    Neither in the form prescribed nor in the legislation or rules is there any requirement that the form of charge referred to in s.378 is necessary nor does it appear that any impediment to charging, as here, remained after the adoption of the Accessories and Abettors Act provisions. 
    198    The mode of charging referred to in s.378 is in modern times unused. On its face, s.378 merely provides for another mode whereby in the special case of homicide, an accessory may be charged additional to that provided by s.346 or otherwise available. 
    199    Following the rescission of the short forms of indictment, it was no longer necessary that a person accused of murder be charged in the old form ""did feloniously and maliciously slay"". The form ""did murder"" has been used for many years as appropriate to charge the crime and as applicable both to principal and accessory, eg., as in Johns v. The Queen (1979-80) 143 CLR 108 and King v. The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423 and is authorised by the practice and procedure of the court. 
    200    The practice of the court has, until now, without challenge, permitted an indictment to contain, for these purposes, one count charging murder in the present form. There is nothing in the New South Wales history, legislation or practice which speaks against its use in the way it was here employed. Sections 346 and 378 merely prescribe what shall be sufficient. They do not restrict the available modes of charging but, as Gillies' discussion shows, provide means to overcome the deficits the common law had developed in practice. 
    201    There is overseas authority on the question, in particular in the United Kingdom and Canada which have similar statutory provisions to s.346 similarly derived from the United Kingdom provisions. Regrettably the relevant decisions were not cited to us in argument. 
    202    The Canadian Supreme Court in Thatcher v. The Queen (1987) 39 DLR (4th) 275 and the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in Regina v. Giannetto (1997) 1 Cr. App. R. 1, in decisions involving not dissimilar circumstances and arguments, have dealt with the same problems as the appellant's submissions raise here. Those cases have been considered, albeit in a somewhat different context, in the Queensland Court of Appeal in Regina v. Leivers & Ballinger (1998) 101 A. Crim R. 175, which was particularly concerned with provisions of the Criminal Code (Qld) involving liability on bases akin to that attracted by principals in the second degree. In dismissing the appeals, the majority of court (Fitzgerald, P. and Moynihan, J.) concluded:- 
     
      
       
       ""When more than one basis of criminal liability is relied on against an accused, it is, on our opinion, necessary for the jury to be unanimously satisfied that the requirements of at least one basis of liability are proved beyond reasonable doubt. It will not necessarily be sufficient for some members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of one basis of liability are established and for other members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of another basis of liability are established. However, that will be sufficient if the alternate bases of criminal liability do not involve materially different issues or consequences. The point is clearly explained in the judgment of Lamer, J. in  
       Thatcher 
       ."" 
       
      
    203    In reasoning to that conclusion, their Honours had reviewed extensive authority including Thatcher (supra) and Giannetto (supra). Pincus, J. was of the view, accepting the effect of the decisions in Thatcher (supra) and Giannetto (supra), that, provided the jury were unanimous as to the verdict, it would be good, even if some jurors had reached on one basis and others on the other. He so concluded, notwithstanding the views expressed in New Zealand in Regina v. Chignell (1991) 2 NZLR 257. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""Accepting that the jury must not only be unanimous as to verdict, but also be unanimous as to the identity of the offence to which the verdict relates,  
       Thatcher 
        tends to support a broad approach to the latter requirement; such an approach would not, in the present case, vitiate a verdict arrived at by some jurors on the basis of s.7 and on others on the basis of s.8."" 
       
      
    204    His Honour quoted as did the Canadian Supreme Court in Thatcher (supra) the following observations:- 
     
      
       
       ""… if an accused is to be acquitted in situations when every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on which of the two ways, 'it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute - and deservedly so'."" 
       
      
    205    Thatcher (supra) was a case in which the accused was charged with one count of murder arising out of the death of his ex-wife:- 
     
      
       
       ""The position of the Crown throughout the trial was that Thatcher had murdered Mrs. Wilson or alternatively that he caused someone else to do so and was therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to s.21 of the Criminal Code."" (at 279) 
       
      
    206    The grounds of appeal to the Supreme Court included a challenge to an asserted failure to direct that the jury must be unanimous in relation to one or other of the alternative means of committing the offence of murder, ie., that the jury had unanimously to find that he killed his ex-wife or alternatively to find unanimously that he aided and abetted another. A defence of alibi had been raised. Section 21, the relevant Canadian Code statutory provision had the effect of making both principals and accessories equally parties to the crime. 
    207    Dickson, CJC., with whom Wilson, Le Dain, Beetz and Estey, JJ. concurred, and with whom La Forest and Lamer, JJ. concurred with some qualifications, said at 304:- 
     
      
       
       ""… one of the principal policy arguments for not requiring jury unanimity as to which of the subsections of s.21 grounds the criminal liability of a particular accused: it would otherwise be open to co-accused to escape conviction by imbuing members of a jury with doubt as to which of the co-accused physically performed the criminal act, even if the jurors entertained no doubt that any individual co-accused either personally committed the crime or else aided and abetted in its commission. This policy concern was recognised long ago by Pollock, CB in  
       Regina v. Swindall & Osborne 
        (1846) 2 Car. & K. 230; 175 ER 95, a case which pre-dated the abolition of the distinction between principals and accomplices. 
       
      
      
       
       The court canvassed the authorities in considerable detail in  
       Regina v. Harder 
        (1956) 114 CCC 129; 4 DLR (2d) 150; [1956] SCR 489, and articulated the proposition that it was unnecessary for the Crown to specify in an indictment that an accused was being charged as a party rather than as a principal simpliciter."" 
       
      
    208    His Honour noted, at 310;- 
     
      
       
       ""The appellant's submission ignores the very reason why Parliament abolished the old common law distinctions: namely, they permitted guilty persons to go free. As Professor Peter MacKinnon points out in 'Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart', 51 CR (3d) 134 at 135 (1986), if an accused is to be acquitted in situations when every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on which of the two ways, 'it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute - and deservedly so'."" 
       
      
    209    At 305 at 306, his Honour reviewed the common law position and the effect of the statute:- 
     
      
       
       ""The common law did, however, draw a distinction between principals and accessories. Accessories were those who conspired with the principal in the first degree or who aided and abetted him but were neither actually nor constructively present at the scene of the crime: see  
       Regina v. Smith 
        (1876) 38 UCQB 218 at 227-228. Thus if Thatcher aided and abetted, rather than personally committed, I do not think it is contended that he was necessarily physically present at the murder. Therefore, his case might well not fall within the old common law rule permitted one charge but two different possible modes of participation in the offence. But this is precisely the distinction that disappeared when Parliament abolished the common law distinction between principals and accessories. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Thus, s.21 has been designed to alleviate the necessity for the Crown choosing between two different forms of participation in a criminal offence. The law stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability. The Crown is not under a duty to separate the different forms of participation in a criminal offence into different counts. Obviously, if the charge against Thatcher had been separated into different counts, he might well have been acquitted on each count notwithstanding that each and every juror was certain beyond a reasonable doubt either that Thatcher personally killed his ex-wife or that he aided and abetted someone else who killed his ex-wife. This is precisely what s.21 is designed to prevent."" 
       
      
    210    His Honour was of the view that:- 
     
      
       
       ""… it is no longer necessary to specify in the charge the nature of an accused's participation in the offence:  
       Harder 
       . Moreover, if there is evidence before a jury that points to an accused either committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding and abetting another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other, it is 'a matter of indifference' which alternative actually occurred … It follows, in my view, that s.21 precludes a requirement of a jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Why should the juror be compelled to make a choice on a subject which is a matter of legal indifference?"" 
       
      
    211    He continued (at 309):- 
     
      
       
       ""… and there is no injustice in his conviction on the indictment irrespective of whether the jurors shared the same view as to the most likely manner in which Thatcher committed the murder."" 
       
      
    212    Since His Honour considered there was no relevant distinction at law between the alternative bases, he analysed them from a factual view point considering the application to them of the evidence noting that the only difference lay in evidence of identification and alibi.  
    213    Lamer, J. qualified his agreement that the point on unanimity failed in the following passage (at 313):- 
     
      
       
       ""Depending on the nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise, the evidence will be taken into account by some jurors to convict the accused under one theory while the fact that the evidence exculpates the accused under the other theory is being disregarded by the other jurors who are taking the latter route. In effect, the jury would be adding against the accused the inculpatory elements of evidence which cannot stand together because they are inconsistent."" 
       
      
    214    La Forest, J. adopted a similar view. 
    215    If it were necessary (as it is not) to prove absence from the killing to show liability as an accessory before the fact, these remarks might have presented a problem. An attempt by the Crown to put forward under the one count such mutually exclusive bases as require proof of either presence or absence would require the direction Lamer, J. refers to.  
    216    In Giannetto (supra), the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, again in a wife killing case, in which, whilst there was powerful circumstantial evidence of the accused's guilt as a principal, there was also evidence of an attempted recruitment of a killer, considered the problem thus:- 
     
      
       
       ""In the context of the present case it seems to us that the starting point must be s.8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, as amended, which reads:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any indictable offence … at common law or by virtue of any Act passed or to be passed, shall be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.' 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The effect of that section is that even if the appellant did no more than encourage someone else to kill his wife he was liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender, and where, as here, the prosecution, for good reason, is unable to say whether the defendant did more than encourage, it must be open to the prosecution to invite the jury as a whole to find that at least the defendant encouraged. If the jury does convict it may do so with some jurors satisfied that the defendant was actually the killer, but all will be satisfied that if not himself the killer at least he encouraged and by reason of the statutory provision in the 1861 Act which we have cited no more is necessary to prove the offence. If that approach is correct, then this ground of appeal must fail."" 
       
      
    217    The court tested that approach by comparing it with various decisions including Thatcher (supra). Considering the 1988 Criminal Law Review Article by Professor Sir John Smith, examining the point, the judgment observed:- 
     
      
       
       ""If in any given case the factual basis of the crime charged is in reality coterminous with an essential element or ingredient of the offence then we can accept without difficulty Professor Smith's formulation, and in relation to the facts of the present case it was possible to say, plainly and the prosecution did say, that if the appellant was not himself the killer, then he instigated the offence."" 
       
      
    218    Regina v. Gaughan [1990] Crim. LR 880 and Professor Smith's commentary on it at 881 were cited for the rejection, with which the court agreed, of an asserted necessity for two counts as:- 
     
      
       
       ""That was rejected by this court, Lloyd, LJ. (as he then was) saying at p.7G of the transcript that 'committing an offence as a principal and committing an offence as an accessory are two different way of participating in the same offence. They are not separate offences'."" 
       
      
    219    The court accepted the practical reasons for not having two counts given by Dickson, CJC. in Thatcher (supra). The court concluded:- 
     
      
       
       ""Having considered the authorities with some care we are satisfied that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge was right not to direct the jury that before they could convict they must all be satisfied either that the appellant killed his wife or that he got someone else to do so. They were entitled to convict if they were all satisfied that he was not the killer he at least encouraged the killing, and accordingly this ground of appeal fails. 
       
      
      
       
       There are two cardinal principles. The first is that the jury must be agreed upon the basis on which they find a defendant guilty. The second is that a defendant must know what case he has to meet. When the Crown alleged, fair and square, that on the evidence, the defendant must have committed the offence either as principal or as secondary offender, and make it equally clear that they cannot say which, the basis on which the jury must be unanimous is that the defendant, having the necessary mens rea, by whatever means caused the result which is criminalised by the law. The Crown is not required to specify the means, because the legal definition of the crime does not require it; and the defendant knows perfectly well what case he has to meet. Of course, if (as will very often be so) the Crown nail their colours to a particular mast, their case will, generally, have to be established in the terms in which it is put. Our judgment should give no encouragement to prosecutors casting around for alternative possibilities where the essential evidence does not show a clear case against the defendant. But the facts of the present appeal are by no means an instance of that."" 
       
      
    220    The reference to ""bases"" in the commencing sentences of the second paragraph of that passage is to be understood in the light of what follows, ie., that it is necessary for the jury to be unanimous that the defendant, with the necessary mens rea, by whatever means, ie., as principal or procurer, caused the result. Indeed, on a classical analysis of the concept, that test would be too narrow. Mere encouragement without that act being a substantial and operative cause of the killing would attract liability. 
    221    The Court of Appeal however also extended the qualification proposed in Thatcher (supra) by Lamer and La Forest, JJ. to an alternative theory advanced by the defence. Clearly such a theory would be the availability of an alibi as striking at the possibility of the accused's presence at the killing and hence at his being a principal. 
     
      
     Conclusion 
      
    222    There is nothing in the legislation, practice or authorities which would prevent such a charge as this or the Crown proceeding as they did. It would be entirely strange that only one sub-class of those of complicit in a crime should have to be separately charged or that doubt as to the degree of complicity should produce an acquittal where all degrees would now in law be equally liable. 
    223    The United Kingdom and Canadian decisions are powerfully persuasive and have achieved acceptance in Queensland after detailed examinations. They accord with principle. 
    224    This is not a case where the second cardinal principle referred to in Giannetto (supra) has not been observed. The present is not a case of the kind to which Justice Dawson referred in Georgiani v. The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 477 and King (supra) nor to which the remarks of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v. Maxwell (1979) 68 Crim. App. R. 128; Regina v. Browne (1987) 38 A. Crim R. 278 referred to in The Queen v. Taylor, Harrison & Taylor (1998) Crim. Law Review 583, nor those made by Street, CJ. in Regina v. Lanteri (1985) 4 NSWLR 359 where reference was made to the necessity, of providing proper particulars and the advisability of charging accused appropriately where their true degree of complicity is known when the prosecution avails itself of some similar provision to the relevant provisions (including s.8) of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861. Here, the particulars were known from the outset and the degree of complicity was not known. 
    225    The vice contended for by the appellant that in such circumstances as this the unanimity requirement cannot be ensured, ie., the necessity to comply with the first cardinal principle, can be avoided by a proper direction accommodating the expansion noted in Giannetto (supra) to the views of Lamer and La Forest, JJ. in Thatcher (supra). The directions should also include a requirement that the jurors be unanimously satisfied that the accused was at least an accessory before the fact, a direction I have already noted, when considering at a new trial. I consider for these reasons the two bases are not lawfully incompatible and there was no error. 
    226    In my view the ground should be rejected.

      REGINA v. SERRATORE 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    227    SMART J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments, in draft, of Dunford J and Greg James J. They set out the facts and contentions of the parties. 
    228    I agree with the reasons and conclusions of Dunford J as to the admission of the hearsay evidence which he has identified. I agree that his judgment in R v. Dean, unreported 12 March 1997 and that of Sperling J in R v. Mankotia, unreported, 27 July 1998 may need to be reconsidered. 
    229    I agree with the reasons and conclusions of Dunford J that the judge did not err in refusing to admit into evidence a police running sheet recording information supplied by Mrs. Wiltshire. Even if it was technically admissible it added nothing to her evidence and the appellant’s case and he has suffered no prejudice. She gave evidence of reporting what she believed she had seen to the police immediately and that was not challenged. 
    230    I agree with the reasons and conclusion of Dunford J that the trial judge was not required to give a warning under s.165 of the Evidence Act 1995 or otherwise as to parts of the evidence of Patricia Tizzone, Antonella Tizzone and Damien Bower. I also agree that the warning given in relation to the evidence of Bassam Radwan was sufficient in the circumstances. I agree that the trial judge was correct in not directing the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence before them. The evidence was cogent. 
    231    While I agree with Dunford J that the conviction was supported by the evidence, I do so, on broader grounds. At the trial counsel for the appellant contended that it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following as essential intermediate facts: 
     
      
     1. On the evening of 28 March 1995 the deceased and the appellant arranged to meet on the following evening. 
      
      
     2. The appellant left work early between 3.45 and 4.00 o’clock on 29 March 1995. 
      
      
     3. The deceased was killed on 29 March 1995. 
      
      
     4. The deceased was in the accused’s Honda CRX motor car shortly before her death. 
      
      
     Reading the Crown’s submissions (T.1112 and following) it is not clear what attitude the Crown took to this contention. It was not directly challenged. The Crown Prosecutor appeared to concentrate on the facts relating to the various point and the overall way in which he wished to put the Crown case. He was strongly against it being compartmentalised. 
      
    232    In his Summing Up the judge treated proof of those four circumstances as essential to the two aspects of the Crown case on murder, namely the appellant killing the deceased and the appellant procuring and/or helping another to kill the deceased. During the Summing Up the Crown Prosecutor submitted that proof of circumstance 2 (the appellant leaving work early) was not essential. 
    233    I do not regard proof of each of those circumstances as essential to proof of the Crown case on the aspect of procuring and/or aiding and abetting another to kill the deceased. On this aspect I would only regard proof of circumstance 4 as essential. As to the aspect of the appellant killing the deceased, I do not regard circumstances 1 and 2 as essential but I do regard circumstances 3 and 4 as essential. I agree with Dunford J that circumstance 1 was not essential on either aspect of the Crown case if it were otherwise established that the deceased was in the appellant’s car on the evening of 29 March 1995 prior to her death. 
    234    I regard the question of whether the jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of circumstances 1 and 2 as a difficult one. As to circumstance 1, I would attach some weight to the mother of the deceased not telling the police at an early point of time about the meeting arranged between the deceased and the appellant, but, I would not regard it as being of great importance. The mother did attend Burwood Police Station about 8.30 p.m. on 29 March 1999 and told Const. Hall not only about her daughter not coming home but also their worries as to where she could be having regard to her previous relationship with the appellant. Const. Hall checked the computer and saw the details of the earlier apprehended violence order. Const. Hall telephoned the Serratore home and questioned John Serratore in the light of the material supplied by the Tizzone family. Const. Hall asked the appellant where he had been, whether he had seen the deceased and whether he knew where she could be. 
    235    As a lay person the mother would not necessarily have regarded telling the police about the intended meeting at an early point as important. Given her husband’s likely reaction and attitude to the appellant, the mother may not have wished to reveal to her husband that she knew of the intended meeting between the appellant and the deceased. This was a family with an Italian background and culture. The answers she gave in cross-examination as to why she did not tell the police at an early point of time of the intended meeting or raise the matter with the appellant were bland. She was in the witness box on three days. Much would have depended on the jury’s assessment of the mother. The critical point, of course, is whether the deceased told her mother of the intended meeting as she alleged. Her failure to mention that meeting at an early point is a subsidiary matter and should not be elevated in importance. In my opinion the jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the mother’s evidence that on the evening of 28 March 1995 the deceased told her mother of the intended meeting with the appellant in the late afternoon - early evening of 29 March 1999. 
    236    Dunford J has analysed the evidence of Antonella Tizzone and pointed out the difficulties with it. Antonella shared a bedroom with the deceased. That bedroom had a telephone and TV and enough room for Antonella to work on an assignment. She said that on the night of 28 March 1995 she was working on her assignment, the deceased was on the telephone and the TV was going in the background. Through the different versions given of whom she thought was on the other end of the telephone there was a common thread, namely, that the deceased was on the telephone and arguing with the person at the other end of the telephone. Antonella gave different versions as to whom she believed was on the other end of the telephone. The value of her evidence lies not in whom she thought was on the other end of the telephone but in the fact that there was a telephone call between the deceased and another between about 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on 28 March 1995 and that they were arguing. That provides some support for the mother’s evidence. The trial took place in October 1998 some 3½ years after the events of late March-early April 1995. It is not surprising that there would be discrepancies and a lack of recollection of some matters and details. 
    237    Dunford J has reviewed the evidence in detail as to circumstance 2. The documentary material produced by the Navy suggested that Damien Bower was seen by Dr. Gray on 27 March 1995 and was to be reviewed on 30 March 1995. There was a leave pass dated 28 March 1995 granting Mr. Bower leave from 28 March 1995 to 0800 on 30 March 1995. A blood sample was taken but the records are not conclusive as to when that was done. After having all the Navy documents put to him Mr. Bower remained adamant that it was on 29 March 1995 that Dr. Gray took a blood sample. The doctor’s hands were shaking. Further, later that morning Dr. Gray had a stroke and collapsed. That was not in dispute. The build up to the stroke and the collapse would explain the shaking hands. Mr. Bower remembered that it was on that day that he went to his wife’s place of employment and that the appellant left work about 4 p.m. The evidence of Dr. Cavanagh, the pathologist, in charge of the Navy Hospital at Balmoral was that blood tests occurred on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This would fit in with a review early on Thursday morning. The doctor, after reviewing all the records was unable to say when the blood sample was taken. Dr. Cavanagh agreed that all the documents implied that Mr. Bower was at the hospital on 28 and 30 March 1995 but not on 29 March 1995. She did not regard the documents as necessarily right. The critical documents were unsigned and undated. 
    238    There was evidence that the appellant left work early on the following day, 30 March 1995. He was going to see the police and did so. I think that the jury was entitled to rely on the evidence of Mr. Bower and Dr. Gray’s condition and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of circumstance 2 notwithstanding the documents produced by the Navy. 
    239    Some care needs to be taken when the question of time is being considered. It was suggested that unless the appellant left his place of employment about 4.00 p.m. he would not have had enough time to drive from Mascot to Croydon Park, from Croydon Park to Strathfield (or possibly Burwood) and from Strathfield to the Wakehurst Parkway, French’s Forest at a point 1.2 kms sought of Warringah Road and return to Croydon Park. There are many variables not the least of which was the amount of traffic in March 1995 and the speed at which it was travelling. This was a matter for the jury. My own view is that if the appellant collected the deceased at about 6.00 p.m. at Strathfield Station and everything went expeditiously he could have travelled to French’s Forest and returned to Croydon Park by just before 8.30 committing a murder or assisting at some stage. 
    240    In Const. Hall’s evidence this passage appears as to her conversation with John Serratore a little after 8.30 p.m. on 29 March 1995: 
     
      
       
       “Q. … and did you [Hall] say, ‘Where have you been this afternoon?’ and did he say ‘I came home from work and have been here all the time’. 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you say, ‘What time did you come home from work?’ and did he say ‘About 5 pm’. 
       
      
      
     That answer conveys that the appellant arrived at his home from work about 5 pm. Const. Hall was not cross-examined about that piece of evidence. His evidence was that he arrived home about 5.30 p.m. 
      
    241    The jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant left work at least a little early and had arrived home about 5.00 p.m. That would give him sufficient time to make the journeys involved. Further, when Luke Yatris telephoned the appellant at 6.30 p.m. his mother told Mr. Yatris that the appellant was not home. 
    242    The jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had sufficient time to commit the murder of the deceased himself or to be present assisting in her murder. This is so whether he left work about 4 p.m. and arrived home at 4.40 p.m. or whether he arrived home at 5.00 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. If the appellant procured somebody else to commit the murder the debate as to sufficiency of time would not arise. 
    243    In my opinion the verdict was well supported by the evidence. 
    244    Greg James J has dealt comprehensively with appeal ground 1(a) and (b). His judgment demonstrates that there is no substance in these grounds and I agree. 
    245    The conclusions which I have reached would lead to the dismissal of the appeal. My opinion is a minority one. 
    246    Upon the basis that I am in error in my view that the jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of circumstances 1 and 2 and that there is to be a new trial I express the following opinions: 
     
      
     (a) As appears earlier in these reasons I share the view of Dunford J that it was unnecessary for the Crown to prove the “four essential circumstances"" on the alternate basis of the Crown case of procuring the murder. I agree also that the direction that in order to convict on either basis of the Crown case the “four essential circumstances” had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt was incorrect in that it was unduly favourable to the appellant and unduly restrictive of the Crown. 
      
      
     (b) I do not share the view of Dunford J that absent proof of circumstances 2, 3 and 4 the appellant could not be convicted of himself murdering the deceased. There would have to be proof beyond reasonable doubt of circumstances 3 and 4 (that is, the deceased was killed on 29 March 1995 and was in the appellant’s Honda car shortly before her death) and of the soliciting to kill and his statement of intention. This provided ample evidence of intention and motive to kill. The evidence adduced at the trial of soliciting to kill was admissible on a wider basis than evidence of relationship. If it were admitted on a wider basis it would not involve the appellant meeting a different case. Other evidence of relevance was led. I would not wish to inhibit the way in which the Crown presented its case at the new trial nor trespass upon the way in which the judge conducts the trial and gives his rulings as to the admissibility and use of evidence and determines the legal questions which arise and the directions which should be given. The evidence in the second trial may differ from that in the first trial. 
      
    247    The Crown Prosecutor made it clear in his opening speech and when addressing the judge shortly before the Summing Up that “It may well be the strongest position the Crown has is the jury would say that they cannot determine whether (he) killed her or whether he got an accomplice to kill her. But they could determine that he did one or the other …”. Reliance was placed on the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R. v. White (1989) 41 A Crim R 237. There is much substance in the submission just quoted. It is the approach which I would adopt. 
    248    In other circumstances a more elaborate direction as to unanimity may be required but it was not necessary in this case because on either aspect of the Crown case the jury were directed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the four essential circumstances. 
    249    I would dismiss the appeal.

   IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSTUDDERT JTuesday 30 November 1999 
     
      
    070031/99REGINA v LMWJUDGMENT(On application for direction that the jury acquit the accused)1. HIS HONOUR: At the end of the Crown case Mr Zahra made an application that the jury should be directed to acquit the accused upon the basis that the Crown had failed to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. That application was refused and I now publish my reasons for such refusal. 
     
      
    2. The accused was only ten years and some three months of age when it is alleged his acts caused the drowning of the deceased, and in these circumstances the Crown must prove, as an element of his case, that when he committed the acts in question the accused knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong. 
     
      
    3. The relevant principles were stated by Lord Lowry in C v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 1 AC 1 at 38: 
     
      
       
        
       
      “A long and uncontradicted line of authority makes two propositions clear. The first is that the prosecution must prove that the child defendant did the act charged and that when doing that act he knew that it was a wrong act as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or childish mischief. The criminal standard of proof applies. What is required has been variously expressed, as in Blackstone, ‘strong and clear beyond all doubt or contradiction’, or in  
      Rex v Gorrie 
       (1918) 83 JP 136 ‘very clear and complete evidence’ or in  
      B v R 
       (1958) 44 Cr App R 1, 3 per Lord Parker CJ, ‘It has often been put in this way, that…”guilty knowledge must be proved and the evidence to that effect must be clear and beyond all possibility of doubt.”’ No doubt, the emphatic tone of some of the directions was due to the court’s anxiety to prevent merely naughty children from being convicted of crimes and in a sterner age to protect them from the draconian consequences of conviction. 
       
       
      The second clearly established proposition is that evidence to prove the defendant’s guilty knowledge, as defined above, must not be the mere proof of the doing of the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong that act may be. As Erle J said in  
      Reg v Smith (Sidney) 
       (1845) 1 Cox CC 260: 
       
        
       ‘a guilty knowledge that he was doing wrong - must be proved by the evidence, and cannot be presumed from the mere commission of the act. You are to determine from a review of the evidence whether it is satisfactorily proved that at the time he fired the rick (if you should be of opinion he did fire it) he had a guilty knowledge that he was committing a crime.’” 
       
      
    4. The above dicta have been much cited and applied in the courts since: see, for example, A v Director of Public Prosecutions (1997) 1 Cr App R 27; CC v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 1 Cr App R 375; L v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 2 Cr App R 501; Re F (a child) (1998) 101 A Crim R 113; DK v Rooney & Anor (unreported, McInerney J, 3 July 1996) and R v CRH (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 December 1996). 
     
      
    5. How is the presumption to be rebutted? It cannot be rebutted merely by reference to the essential elements of the offence: see the dicta of Lord Lowry cited above. In C per Lord Lowry said at 39: 
     
      
       
        
        “The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge. The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what the defendant said or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty mind. Running away is usually equivocal, as Laws J rightly said it was in the present case, because flight from the scene can as easily follow a naughty action as a wicked one. There must, however, be a few cases where running away would indicate guilty knowledge, where an act is either wrong or innocent and there is no room for mere naughtiness. An example might be selling drugs at a street corner and fleeing at the sight of a policeman. 
        
       
       
        
        The Divisional Court here, assuming that the presumption applied, would have reversed the youth court, rightly, in my opinion, because there was no evidence, outside the commission of the ‘offence’, upon which one could find that the presumption had been rebutted. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to obtain that kind of evidence, apart from anything the defendant may have said or done, the prosecution has to rely on interviewing the suspect or having him psychiatrically examined (two methods which depend on receiving co-operation) or on evidence from someone who knows the defendant well, such as a teacher, the involvement of whom adversely to the child is unattractive.” 
        
       
      
    6. Mr Zahra submitted that the issue of whether or not the Crown had rebutted doli incapax was a matter for the trial judge and not the jury. He submitted that on this issue the jury has no role to play. In support of that submission he relied upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v CRH (supra).  
     
      
    7. I do not accept that submission.  
     
      
    8. It seems to me that CRH is not to be read in the manner for which Mr Zahra contended, but consideration of the submission requires close attention to the judgment of Newman J in CRH. With his decision the other members of the court agreed. 
     
      
    9. In CRH, at the close of the prosecution case, the appellant made an application similar to that made here by Mr Zahra, namely that the jury be directed to return a verdict of not guilty upon the basis that the Crown had not rebutted the common law presumption that the accused was doli incapax. That application was rejected and on appeal it was argued that the trial judge was in error in his rejection. The case concerned the alleged sexual assaults upon a young female by a twelve year old male. The complainant child gave evidence as to the commission of the offences charged and the appellant gave evidence denying the misconduct alleged. He made no admissions to the police and essentially, on the analysis of Newman J, the evidence relied upon by the Crown to rebut the common law presumption of doli incapax was the evidence of the complainant as to the commission of the offence. Newman J referred to the decision in C and cited the passages I have already recorded. His Honour determined that the dicta from Lord Lowry stated the law in Australia. His Honour said then (at p 13 of his judgment): 
     
      
       
        
        
        “That being so…the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax having regard to the criminal standard of proof.” 
         
        
       
      
    10. It seems to me that what his Honour was saying in CRH was that upon analysis of the facts of that case all that the Crown had proved was in effect the doing of the act charged and this was not enough. Hence there was no evidence upon which the jury could act to find that the relevant presumption had been rebutted. I should add that there is authority for the proposition that “naughtiness” as a state of mind in child sexual cases has been expressed as not uncommon in children of the appellant’s age in CRH: see A v DPP (1997) 1 Cr App R 27 at 33. 
     
      
    11. It seems to me though that Mr Zahra’s submission that the decision in CRH has the consequence that the jury has no role to play in determining whether the presumption of doli incapax has been rebutted reads into the decision that which is not there. Nowhere do any of the members of the court in CRH express as a statement of principle that the jury has no role to play on this issue. What occurred in CRH was simply that there was no evidence available for the jury’s consideration upon which it could act to make a finding that the presumption had been rebutted. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not say that if there was evidence available for the jury’s consideration it nevertheless was not a jury question as to whether the presumption had been rebutted. 
     
      
    12. Mr Zahra was not able to draw my attention to any statement of principle to support his submission and I have been able to find no authority to support it either. In R v Gorrie (1918) 83 JP 136 Salter J directed the jury that the prosecution 
     
      
       
        
         “must satisfy the jury that when the boy did this he knew that he was doing what was wrong - not merely what was wrong but what was gravely wrong, seriously wrong.” 
        
       
      
    13. That direction was cited with apparent approval by Bray CJ in The Queen v M (1977) 16 SASR 589 at 593 and in The King v Brooks (1945) NZLR 854 it is clear that the Court of Appeal proceeded upon the basis that it was for the Crown to satisfy the jury as opposed to the trial judge, that a child under the age of fourteen years knew the act or omission charged against him was wrong.  
     
      
    14. In my opinion it is for the trial judge to determine whether there is evidence upon which the jury properly instructed could conclude that the presumption has been rebutted by the Crown. If there is such evidence, it is not for the trial judge to direct an acquittal, even it be the case that the judge himself, if left to determine the issue of doli incapax, would resolve it in the accused’s favour. It is well settled that a trial judge does not have the power to direct a verdict of acquittal simply because he assesses that the evidence is such that a verdict based upon it would be unsafe and unsatisfactory: see, for example, R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 and R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74. In the latter case, Gleeson CJ, with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed, referred to the decision of the High Court in Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 and to the observations made by Dawson J in that case at 675 as to aspects of trial procedure which restrict the extent to which a trial judge may intervene. The Chief Justice went on to say this (at 85): 
     
      
       
        
        “To the aspects mentioned by Dawson J I would add the role of the jury as the tribunal of fact. It is that consideration, rather than any point of legal technicality, which underlies the decisions in cases such as  
        R v Galbraith 
         (1981) 1 WLR 1039,  
        R v Prasad (supra) 
        ,  
        Attorney General's Reference 
         (No. 1 of 1983) (1983) 2 VR 410, and  
        Mezzo 
         (1986) 27 CCC 3d 97. The legal principles which underpin the narrower view in turn flow from, or are particular manifestations of, that basic aspect of criminal justice.  
        It is one thing to recognise in courts of criminal appeal a power to review a jury’s determination of fact. It is another thing altogether to permit a trial judge to pre-empt such a determination 
        .” 
        
       
       
        
        (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    15. In my opinion, to accede to the application made by Mr Zahra would have the consequence of pre-empting the jury’s determination of a factual issue which it is charged to determine. 
     
      
    16. If there was no evidence upon which the jury could properly conclude that the presumption was rebutted, then it would be proper for me as the trial judge to direct the jury to acquit the accused. However, Mr Zahra concedes that there is evidence available upon which a tribunal could act; his submission is that the court should not act upon that evidence so as to find that the presumption of doli incapax has been rebutted. That is a submission properly to be pursued with the jury and no doubt, as a consequence of my decision on this application, it will be vigorously pursued with the jury by Mr Zahra. 
     
      
    17. It seems to me that there are a number of features of the evidence available for the jury’s consideration on the issue as to whether the Crown has rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in the case of this accused. Mr Zahra has dealt with a number of these features in his submission, proceeding as he has done upon the basis that it was for me to make the evaluation of the evidence and for me to determine, as he submitted I should determine, that the Crown had not discharged its onus in this regard.  
     
      
    18. In C, Lord Lowry identified as possible sources of evidence to rebut the presumption the following: 
     
      
       
      (i) the surrounding circumstances of the commission of the offence  
       
        
       
      (ii) what the accused may have said or done; 
       
        
       
      (iii) evidence from teachers or others who know the accused well; 
       
        
       
      (iv) psychiatric assessment of the accused. 
       
      
    19. The Crown has here submitted that there is material available for the jury’s consideration in each of the above categories. 
     
      
       
      (i) Whilst the evidence does not reveal that there was anything untoward before the deceased and the accused reached the Big Rock area, there is the evidence that once there the accused picked up and carried a protesting and struggling child much smaller than himself to the edge of the rock before then pushing or dropping him into the water. There is the verbal exchange on the way to the edge of the rock referred to in (ii) below, culminating in the accused saying  
      “too bad”.  
      There are then the features of the rock face itself and of the river below. 
       
       
      (ii) There are the utterances attributed to the accused. It seems to me that it is for the jury to decide as a matter of fact whether what was said indicated the accused’s state of mind at the time he put the child in the water, and an appreciation of the seriousness of what he had done (see  
      C 
       (supra) and  
      L 
       (supra) at 505). 
       
       
      As he was forcing the deceased towards the edge of the rock, the latter protested  
      “Luke is going to chuck me in” 
       and the accused said  
      “No, we’re not.” 
       Then after the child entered the water the accused asserted he was going to get help. There is evidence contrary to his entertaining any such intention in what he said to the young girls he met after he left Big Rock. The accounts of GW1 and GW2 are not entirely consistent the one with the other. According to GW1 she asked the accused did he know where the deceased was and was told that he was down in the bush but that the whereabouts were none of her business. She said that the accused asserted that he did not know where the child was in the bush. 
       
       
       GW2 gave a different account and said that when the girls encountered the accused he called GW1 over and said Corey was down the river in the water. 
       
       
       Whilst there are discrepancies given by GW1 and by GW2 it is for the jury to determine what evidence it accepts from either source. It would be open to the jury to conclude that in what he said to GW1 he was concealing what had happened to the deceased. 
       
       
       Then there is the evidence of the conversation which the accused had with Constable French. I detailed this conversation when delivering an earlier judgment as to the admissibility of the evidence of Constable French and I will not repeat the relevant conversation here. There is evidence that in that statement the accused did not tell the truth concerning what happened in his encounter with GW1 shortly after the accused left the deceased in the water. 
       
       
       It is for the jury to assess the significance of all the above utterances by the accused in considering the doli incapax issue. 
       
       
      (iii) The jury has the evidence before it of three school teachers who taught the accused prior to March 1998, Ms Scott, Ms Calderon and Ms Robinson. Each of these teachers gave evidence as to the accused being behind intellectually and no doubt this is a matter upon which Mr Zahra will place much emphasis in addressing the jury. However, looking at the Crown’s case at its highest, and this is relevant in determining if there is evidence upon which a jury could find that the Crown has rebutted the presumption of doli incapax, the teachers all gave evidence concerning the behaviour of the accused at school. Ms Scott said that the accused presented no problem in observing classroom rules. Nor did he present a problem in relation to playground rules except for the out of bounds rule. This was a rule introduced during the course of the accused’s schooling that separated children of his age from those of kindergarten age. The accused was slow to conform with that rule. Ms Calderon gave evidence that the accused was well behaved. He did get into trouble but no more than she regarded as being normal. 
       
       
       Ms Robinson, who started to teach the accused only weeks before the death of the deceased, said that the behaviour of the accused was “perfect”. He followed the class rules and records were kept of any breaches of playground rules. There was no record of any such breach by the accused.  
       
       
       The evidence of the teachers assumes emphasis from the evidence of Dr Wotton. 
       
       
      (iv) Dr Wotton, a child psychiatrist, interviewed the accused’s mother once and the accused himself twice, these interviews taking place very shortly before the trial. The history that the mother gave the doctor was that the accused was an average boy who gave no particular trouble, and considering that history and the assessments of the teachers about the behaviour of the accused at school, Dr Wotton expressed the view that if there had been major problems in the accused understanding the difference between right and wrong then this would have shown up in his everyday behaviour at home and at school. Dr Wotton considered on this material that the accused probably understood the difference between right and wrong in the school setting and in the home setting. The significance of this in the present context is a matter for the jury. 
       
       
      There is further evidence of Dr Wotton which assumes particular relevant in the context of Mr Zahra’s submission. When asked about the significance of the accused, as it were, “running away” from Big Rock, Dr Wotton said it was possible that this was indicative of an failure to understand the consequences of his actions, but Dr Wotton’s further evidence was that to the effect that the behaviour reflected an anxiety about what happened and a perceived need by the accused to conceal his part in it. The jury could regard this as indicative of an awareness of serious wrongdoing, although as Lord Lowry observed in  
      C 
      ,  
      “running away is usually equivocal” 
      . 
       
      
    20. In my opinion as the evidence stands, there is evidence upon which the jury could find that the Crown has rebutted the presumption of doli incapax, and in these circumstances it is not appropriate for me to determine whether the jury should do so. 
     
      
    21. Hence the application failed and the trial has proceeded.

     60723/98 
     SULLY J IRELAND J BARR J Tuesday, 30 November 1999 
     
     REGINA v William Peter CRAMP 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    2   BARR J: The appellant William Peter Cramp was found guilty by a District Court jury of the manslaughter of Emma Jane Long (the deceased). He was sentenced to penal servitude for nine years and four months, comprising a minimum term of seven years and an additional term of two years four months. He appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    3   The facts on which the charge was based may be summarised in this way. The appellant, then 55 years old, owned land in Black Rock Road, Martins Creek, not far from Maitland, and visited it from time to time. His neighbours there were the Long family, whose children were the deceased, aged sixteen, Llewellyn, aged thirteen and Adam, aged ten years. The appellant and the Longs became friends. He kept horses on his property and let the children visit him and ride them. 
     
      
    4   On Saturday 23 September 1995 Mrs Long and her children accepted the appellant’s invitation to visit him for a barbecue. A friend of the Long children, Brett Cowan, aged fourteen, went with them. The deceased drove the Long family car to the appellant’s property. She was a learner driver and L-plates were affixed to the car. The appellant served food and drinks and asked Mrs Long whether the deceased might take a glass of wine. Mrs Long said that she might have a small one. Before long, Mrs Long had to leave in order to attend an appointment in Newcastle and the children remained with the appellant. 
     
      
    5   During the afternoon the appellant gave the deceased red wine and beer to drink. The deceased was heard to remark that the appellant was drunk, that she was not, and that she had had as much to drink as he had. 
     
      
    6   The appellant suggested that they all drive to Paterson to buy ice cream and the deceased asked whether she might be allowed to drive. The appellant said that he would think about it, then remarked that he was too drunk to drive and that the deceased would have to drive. He threw her his keys. She drove his car, a Saab turbo. The appellant sat in the front passenger seat. The three boys sat in the back. As the deceased drove through the front gate of the appellant’s property the car struck the gatepost but the appellant showed no concern. 
     
      
    7   The deceased began to drive fast and the appellant encouraged her to go faster, saying “floor it”. The speedometer reached 140 kilometres per hour. After slowing to negotiate an intersection the deceased again drove fast and the boys, frightened, asked her to slow down. 
     
      
    8   At Paterson the appellant took the deceased into a tavern and ordered a tequila for her. He drank beer. The bar attendant refused to serve alcohol for the deceased because she appeared too young, though she did not seem to be intoxicated. The appellant, on the other hand, was exhibiting several signs of drunkenness, tripping as he walked and loudly repeating himself. He said a number of times that the deceased had not yet got the car into fifth gear. 
     
      
    9   As they left the tavern the appellant took with him a case of beer, some red wine and some ice. 
     
      
    10   The deceased continued to drive the car. Near a bridge on Martins Creek Road the appellant again said “floor it” and the speedometer reached 130 kilometres per hour. On the encouragement of the appellant, the deceased overtook two other vehicles on that road. The speedometer reached 150 kilometres per hour. 
     
      
    11   They arrived at the appellant’s property and beer was taken from the boot for the appellant and the deceased. The deceased then drove along Black Rock Road. On three occasions the car stopped and beer was taken from the boot and consumed by the appellant and the deceased. Bottles were thrown through the window or the sunroof as the car went along. The appellant was lighting cigarettes and throwing them out through the sunroof. 
     
      
    12   For part of that journey the appellant himself drove. For a period of about twenty minutes Adam Long sat on the appellant’s knees and steered the vehicle. He did so not because he wanted to drive but because he wanted to prevent the deceased from driving, being afraid about the speeds the car was reaching. He tried to steer the car into a boggy place so as to disable it and bring the journey to an end. Sadly, he was not successful. 
     
      
    13   The party returned to the appellant’s property, where a conversation took place between Llewellyn Long and the deceased. I shall refer to it again later in this judgment. The car started off again with the deceased still driving. As before, the appellant was in the front passenger seat and the remaining children sat in the back seat. After about 2.5 kilometres, shortly after the car rounded a bend, someone passed the deceased a cap to stop her hair from blowing about. As she put it on her head she had only one hand on the steering wheel. The vehicle was swerving. A few seconds later the car left the road and hit a telegraph pole. The deceased and the appellant were thrown out because they were not wearing seat belts. The deceased was killed and the appellant received severe head injuries, one result of which is that he has no recollection of the events. 
     
      
    14   The blood alcohol concentration of the deceased was 0.167 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The appellant’s blood alcohol reading was 0.103 grams per 100 millilitres of blood some five hours after the collision and an expert thought the most likely range at the time of the collision would have been between 0.13 and 0.178. 
     
      
    15   More than three hours elapsed between the beginning of the drive to Paterson and the collision. Altogether the car travelled about thirty-five kilometres. 
     
      
    16   The Crown presented its case in a way that entitled the jury, should they be satisfied about the evidence, to conclude that the death of the deceased resulted from the appellant’s unlawful and dangerous act or from his gross negligence or from them both. 
     
      
    17   The first four grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. They assert that the trial miscarried because the Crown relied on the two bases of guilt, namely the appellant’s unlawful and dangerous act and his gross negligence, because his Honour failed to instruct the jury that they had to be unanimous about one basis or the other, because his Honour’s directions must have confused the jury and because the appellant ought not to have been convicted since the jury were not unanimous about the appellant’s guilt on either basis, as appeared from the answer to a question his Honour asked the foreman of the jury. 
     
      
    18   Early in the summing-up, his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        … I have told you that your verdict must be unanimous and in fact the old question that was asked of a jury after the verdict was taken from the foreman was “Is that the verdict of you all” and the rest of the jurors would sort of remain silent indicating that is was their verdict, but that is where the unanimity ends with the verdict. As long as you are unanimous about your verdict, your path to the verdict may differ, your paths to the verdict may differ. This case is put in several ways to you and if you arrive at a verdict, as long as it is the same verdict, how each of your got to that verdict, provided you do it according to the directions that I have given to you does not matter, I hope that is understood. The way to the verdict does not matter as long as the verdict itself is unanimous. 
        
       
       
        
         One of you may find that the accused is guilty on the basis of gross negligence and indeed even within that category or may find different acts to be more convincing than others. I hope it is clear what I mean, if there is any doubt about what I mean you can come back and ask me, I will try and explain it in more depth but I think it may be clear to you that what has to be unanimous is not your whole reasoning process but your conclusion, your verdict has to be unanimous. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury I mentioned to you that this crime charged against this accused is one of manslaughter. It is a very generic kind of offence, it can be committed in many different ways because it is a very old offence - is a very ancient offence on the criminal calendar, manslaughter. As I said to you it virtually is the unlawful taking of a life causing a life to be lost by some unlawful or dangerous conduct and I will define it for you more precisely, do not take that as a definition, and it can be committed in different ways … 
        
       
       
        
        Now the Crown has put this particular manslaughter case on two broad bases. … would you just hand these to counsel please - they are a suggested aide memoir that I have prepared for the jury … 
        
       
      
    19   The document referred to by his Honour was in the following terms - 
     
      
       
       MANSLAUGHTER BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE 
       
       
        
        On 23 September 1995 at Martins Creek, NSW 
        
       
       
        
        1. William Peter Cramp (the accused) engaged in conduct which included one or more of the following: 
         
        (i) Permitted Emma Jane Long (the deceased) to drive his car knowing that the deceased was affected by alcohol. 
         
        (ii) Permitted the deceased to drive his car at high speed. 
         
        (iii) Permitted the deceased to drive his car dangerously. 
         
        (iv) Permitted the deceased to drive his car while she was not wearing a seat belt. 
         
        (v) Permitted the deceased to consume alcohol while she was driving his car. 
        
       
       
        
        2. One or more of the foregoing acts of the accused occasioned the death of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The act or acts occasioning the death of the deceased was/were done with gross negligence and with reckless disregard for the safety of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The act or acts occasioning the death of the deceased showed such a serious disregard for the safety of the deceased as to amount to a crime. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the 4 constituent elements specified above you should find the accused guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long and no further deliberation is necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are not satisfied of any one or more of those 4 constituent elements you should then consider the following matters: 
        
       
       
       MANSLAUGHTER BY UNLAWFUL AND DANGEROUS ACT 
       
       
        
        On 23 September 1995 at Martins Creek, NSW 
        
       
       
        
        1. The deceased drove a motor vehicle on a public street: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) negligently, furiously, or recklessly; 
         
         (ii) at a speed or in a manner which was dangerous to the public; 
         
         (iii) while under the influence of alcohol; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Some or all of the conduct specified in sub-paragraphs 1(i) to 1(iv) (sic), above occasioned the death of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The accused  
        aided and abetted 
         such of the conduct of the deceased specified in sub-paragraphs 1(i) to 1(iv) (sic) as you have found to have occasioned the death of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The aiding and abetting by the accused of the conduct of the deceased referred to in paragraph 2, above, created a real risk of serious injury to the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the 4 constituent elements specified above you should find the accused guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are not satisfied of any one or more of those 4 constituent elements you should find the accused not guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long. 
        
       
       
        
        “to  
        aid and abet 
        ” an offence means any one or more of the following: 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        assist 
         the commission of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        instigate 
         the commission of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        encourage 
         the commission of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        promote 
         the commission of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        urge 
         the commission of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        to  
        permit 
         the commission of the offence where the commission of the offence would be either impossible or appreciably more difficult without the permission. 
        
       
       
        
        NOTE: In order to find that the accused aided and abetted the offence of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor by the deceased the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused expected that at the time of driving the motor vehicle on a public street the deceased would be under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
        
       
      
    20   Having handed copies of the document to the jury, his Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        I have put the manslaughter in this case into two broad categories as has been suggested by the Crown. The first category is what I have called manslaughter by gross negligence and the second category is what I have called here as manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. They are two different ways in which manslaughter can be committed and what the Crown says to you in this case is that in effect what the accused did in this case amounted to both kinds of manslaughter. What he did was both grossly negligent thereby occasioning the death of the deceased and what he did was unlawful and dangerous, thereby occasioning the death of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course he does not have to prove both those kinds of manslaughter it is sufficient to prove one of them to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. And it is not necessary for you to find more than one of them in order to convict the accused, you may in fact find both of them but the way I suggest you proceed through it would mean that at least some of you may not have to turn from one to another, depending on your state of mind at the end of considering one of them. That will become clear to you as I proceed. 
        
       
      
    21   His Honour dealt with the ingredients the Crown had to prove to obtain a verdict of guilty by gross negligence, referring as he did so to the contents of the document. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        Now members of the jury if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of those four constituent elements you should find the accused guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long, and no further deliberation would be necessary. That would be the end of your task apart from coming in and delivering your verdict. But if you are not satisfied of any one or more of those four constituent elements you should then consider further matters. 
        
       
       
        
        What you must then consider is whether the accused has been guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. Now I have had to put all these matters in a certain order, but you do not have to consider them in the order that I have put them in. I have put them in what I regard as a logical order that may appeal to you as an appropriate way of going through these matters. But you are free to consider these matters in any order you wish. 
        
       
      
    22   His Honour then dealt with the ingredients of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, referring again to the contents of the document. In doing so he gave a detailed and careful explanation of the meaning of aiding and abetting. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those four elements then the accused should be found guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long. If you are not satisfied of any one or more of those constituent elements you should find the accused not guilty of feloniously slaying Emma Jane Long. 
        
       
      
    23   Later, in dealing with the jury’s answers to the questions whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the ingredients set out in the document, his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        Your answer to that question in each case, you will realise, must be either yes or no, there is no middle ground to that question, you are either satisfied beyond reasonable doubt or you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. There is no middle ground, the answer must be yes or no and why I have described this as a check list is that you can ask yourself that question in relation to each element and if you answer any question no, then you must, in the case of the manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act because as soon as the answer to any question is no, that particular form of manslaughter is negated because one of the elements will not have been made out. 
        
       
       
        
        If you do answer any of the questions no, then you have decided by necessary implication that the accused is not guilty of that particular offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Manslaughter by gross negligence is, there is really only one offence, it is manslaughter but it can be constituted in different ways. If you find the answer to any one of the questions on page 1 to be no, then you will have by necessary implication found that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence, then you turn to consider manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
        
       
       
        
        If you come to any question which you answer in the negative there, then of course your verdict must be one of not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        … if you find that you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any one of the elements then it means that the accused, if you are considering one form of manslaughter first, and by the way you do not have to consider manslaughter by gross negligence first if you do not want to. If you want to consider manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act first you can do that but if you find that you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one of the elements of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act then you have to turn to consider manslaughter by gross negligence. And if at that stage you find that there is an element you are not satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt then you would have to find the accused not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        I will put the converse to you, so that I am not misunderstood. If you are considering either manslaughter by gross negligence or manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and you find that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the four elements then the accused is guilty of manslaughter and you do not have to consider the other form of manslaughter because there is only one crime. These are simply different ways in which it can be committed. 
        
       
      
    24   There followed an adjournment, during which defence counsel asked his Honour to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant unless they were unanimous about his gross negligence or about his unlawful and dangerous act. His Honour declined to do so but said that he would say something else to the jury. On resumption his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        There is only offence of manslaughter. There is only one crime known as manslaughter, but there are several ways of committing it. And the two ways which have been raised in this case are two of the ways it can be committed and they are distinct ways in which the crime can be committed. So quite obviously you cannot in any sense mix the elements up with one another. I mean the elements of manslaughter by gross negligence are different elements from the elements of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. And it is only if in respect of at least one of them you find all the elements proved beyond reasonable doubt that you find the accused guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        And whichever one you consider first, if you find one of the elements not proved beyond reasonable doubt you turn to consider the other one. You do not find the accused not guilty simply because when you are considering the first form of manslaughter that you happen to consider you find one of the elements not proved, or that you are not satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. You do not then say not guilty. You, of course, have got to go and consider the other one. I hope that is clear. 
        
       
      
    25   At the conclusion of the summing-up this exchange took place - 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, I’ll now ask you to go and consider your verdict. I will ask you Mr Foreman, when you come back. If you arrive at a guilty verdict, if you do, and I don’t know what verdict, if you do, I will ask you Mr Foreman, whether you have arrived at it, whether the whole jury have arrived at it by reference to one kind of manslaughter. If you say yes to that, I will ask you which kind of manslaughter it was, whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        If you have arrived at it by different paths, in other words if there is a mixture of those two things, you simply say to me no we cannot tell you. Do you understand, because I will not inquire into the individual decisions of jurors, you understand that? Do you understand what I mean? Perhaps I will go through it more slowly. 
        
       
       
        
        There are two kinds of ways in which manslaughter can be arrived at there. If the jury find the accused guilty, that will be in answer to a question my associate will ask you. I will then ask you, Mr Foreman, are you able to say whether it was, whether the verdict was based on gross negligence or unlawful and dangerous act. If you have been at least unanimous to that extent, that you have come to the verdict, all of you, by one kind of manslaughter. Do you understand me? 
        
       
       
        
        JURY FOREPERSON: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You can say (yes) to that. And I will ask you which one it is. That will assist any court that may have to review these proceedings, do you understand me? 
        
       
       
        
        JURY FOREPERSON: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: They will at least know what area you were (in). But if there is any, if some of you arrived at that conclusion by different paths, if some of you arrived at it by way of unlawful and dangerous act, and others by way of gross negligence, you only have to say to me no we cannot give you that information, we cannot answer that question, because it would mean that disclosing the matter which the jury have a right to keep to themselves. Do you understand me? 
        
       
       
        
        JURY FOREPERSON: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
      
    26   The jury returned in due course with a verdict of guilty and his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Foreman, did the jury arrive at the verdict through, unanimously through one of those paths, either gross negligence or unlawful and dangerous act? 
        
       
      
    27   The reply was - 
     
      
       
        
        We cannot say, your Honour. 
        
       
      
    28   It was submitted on appeal that where there are alternative bases of liability for a single offence charged, the jury ought generally to be told that they must all agree on one basis or another (or both or all). The only exception to this general rule will be where the Crown can prove that the accused must be liable on one basis or another but, because of the state of the evidence, cannot say which. This was not such a case because the Crown could point to the facts and assert alternatively that they proved guilt by gross negligence or unlawful and dangerous act. It could have conducted the trial on either basis alone. As the foreman’s answer to his Honour’s question showed, the jury were not unanimous about liability by gross negligence or unlawful and dangerous act, so the conviction should be quashed and a new trial should be ordered. 
     
      
    29   Counsel for the appellant relied on a passage in the judgment of Fitzgerald P and Moynihan J in R v Leivers & Ballinger (1998) 101 A Crim R 175. That was a case in which the prosecution could prove that each of the appellants was guilty of murder or manslaughter (the distinction between which is not relevant for present purposes) either as a principal because she or he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise, namely the beating that resulted in the death of the deceased, or as an accessory, having restrained or disabled the deceased before the beating or having encouraged others to beat the deceased. However, the prosecution could not prove that either appellant must have been a principal or an accessory. 
     
      
    30   It was held that the trial judge was not wrong in not directing the jury that they must all agree about the basis on which they found the appellant guilty. Their Honours said at 188 - 
     
      
       
        
        Where more than one basis of criminal liability is relied on against an accused it is in our opinion necessary for the jury to be unanimously satisfied that the requirements of at least one basis of liability are proved beyond reasonable doubt. It will not necessarily be sufficient for some members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of one basis of liability are established and for other members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of another basis of liability are established. However, that will be sufficient if the alternate bases of criminal liability do not involve materially different issues or consequences. 
        
       
      
    31   During the course of their judgment their Honours reviewed a wide range of cases decided in Australian and other common law jurisdictions, particularly R v Giannetto [1996] Cr App R 1 in which the English Court of Appeal itself reviewed much the same range of cases. Both judgments draw on the judgments of the members of the Court of Appeal of Canada in Thatcher v R (1987) 39 DLR (4th) 275 and refer to the opinion of Professor Sir John Smith who, in his paper Satisfying the Jury [1988] Crim LR 335 at 344, proposes a principle of general application that when the prosecution allege more than one factual basis for the crime charged and it is not possible to say “if it was not the one, then it must have been the other” the jury should always be directed that they must all be satisfied as to the one basis or all satisfied as to the other, or both. 
     
      
    32   There appears to be no difficulty in applying the principle to cases where the accused must have been principal or accessory but where it is impossible to say which. There are examples of such cases in several jurisdictions. 
     
      
    33   In Swindall v Osborne (1864) 2 Car. & K 230, the deceased was killed by one of two carts. The driver of one of them incited the driver of the other to kill the deceased. The defendant was the driver of one of the carts, but the prosecutor could not say which one had killed the deceased. 
     
      
    34   The defendant had been charged as a principal under the provisions of s 8, Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, which is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any indictable offence … at common law or by virtue of any Act passed or to be passed, shall be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender. 
        
       
      
    35   The conviction was held good, because if the defendant was not the principal, as driver of the cart that killed the deceased, he was an accessory because he incited the other driver. 
     
      
    36   In Du Cros v Lambourne [1907] 1 KB 40 the appellant was convicted of driving at a speed dangerous to the public, having contended at trial that another was driving and that he was in the passenger’s seat. The conviction was held good, because if he was not the principal he was liable as an accessory for inciting the driver. 
     
      
    37   In R v Giannetto the appellant was convicted of the murder of his wife. The Crown could not say whether he killed her himself or got somebody else to do so. The jury was held entitled to convict. Delivering the judgment of the Court, Kennedy LJ said at 8 - 
     
      
       
        
        There are two cardinal principles. The first is that the jury must be agreed upon the basis on which they find a defendant guilty. The second is that a defendant must know what case he has to meet. When the Crown allege, fair and square, that on the evidence, the defendant must have committed the offence either as principal or as secondary offender, and make it equally clear that they cannot say which, the basis on which the jury must be unanimous is that the defendant, having the necessary mens rea, by whatever means caused the result which is criminalised by the law. The Crown is not required to specify the means, because the legal definition of the crime does not require it; and the defendant knows perfectly well what case he has to meet. 
        
       
      
    38   In Thatcher v R the appellant was charged with the murder of his former wife. The Crown could not say whether he had killed her or whether he had aided and abetted someone else to do so. There was a local statute which had the same effect as s 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act. Dickson CJC observed at 306 that that statute had been designed to alleviate the necessity for the Crown to choose between the two different forms of participation in a criminal offence. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        The law stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability. 
        
       
      
    39   His Honour said at 310 - 
     
      
       
        
        The appellant’s submission ignores the very reason why Parliament abolished the old common law distinctions: namely they permitted guilty persons to go free. 
         
         
        As Professor Peter Mackinnon points out in “ 
        Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz And Stuart 
        ” 51 CR (3d) 134 at 135 (1986) if an accused is to be acquitted in situations where every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on which of two ways “it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute - and deservedly so.” 
         
        
       
      
    40   Of course, the accused would not be acquitted, but the same criticism may be made of the inability of a jury in those circumstances to return a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    41   In R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377 the appellant was convicted of murdering his girlfriend. The Crown asserted that he must have killed her or procured someone else to do so, but could not say which. S 346 Crimes Act was in terms similar to the English and Canadian statutes dealing with the indictment of principals and accessories. The trial judge refused to require the Crown to plead alternative counts, one charging the appellant as principal and one charging him as principal in the second degree or as accessory. That refusal was made the subject of a ground of appeal. In a related ground of appeal it was asserted that the trial judge erred in permitting the alternatives to be considered by the jury. Those grounds of appeal failed. 
     
      
    42   See also R v White (1989) 41 A Crim R 237, a New South Wales conviction of murder as principal or accessory, R v Sourelos, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 6 September 1984 and R v Gaughan [1990] Crim LR 880. 
     
      
    43   In R v Fitzgerald [1992] Crim LR 660 the prosecution asserted that the appellant himself set fire to the complainant’s scooter or was a party to a joint criminal enterprise another member of which did so. The trial judge told the jury that they had all to agree which before they could convict. The case is of no assistance because the point about unanimity was not decided in the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    44   Where the difficulty has not been in distinguishing whether the accused was the principal or an accessory, cases have typically involved a prosecution allegation that the accused committed a number of discrete acts, any of which would entitle the jury to convict, and an invitation to convict on all or any of them. 
     
      
    45   In R v Agbim [1979] Crim LR 171 the appellant was convicted of a number of counts of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. The case concerned claims made by a medical practitioner for financial aid in respect of monies he said that he had paid to certain employees. The prosecution contended that some of the claims were false because the appellant claimed higher wages than he had paid, some because he claimed that employees had worked longer hours than they had in fact and some because the alleged employees had never been employed. The jury were not directed to be unanimous that any of certain claim forms mentioned in the indictment was not true and correct. According to the short report, the appeal was dismissed because the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that so long as the jury were unanimous about guilt on any count they need not have agreed about the respects in which the claim was false. 
     
      
    46   The decision was criticised in a short commentary at 171-172. 
     
      
    47   In R v Brown (1984) 79 Cr App R 115 the Crown had to prove that the appellant had, by a statement which he knew to be false, misleading or deceptive, induced another to enter into an agreement. Evidence was tendered of several statements said to be false, misleading or deceptive. In answer to a question from the jury, the trial judge said that they would be unanimous even though they did not all rely on the same statement. Quashing the conviction, the Court of Appeal held that the jury had to be unanimous as to at least one of the statements. 
     
      
    48   The Court looked at the transcript in R v Agbim and distinguished it for reasons set out and criticised by Professor Smith at [1988] Crim LR 366, 367, but whether R v Agbim was distinguishable or wrong is not critical for present purposes. 
     
      
    49   In R v Flynn (1985) 82 Cr App R 319 the charge was possessing an offensive weapon. An offensive weapon was defined as made or adapted for causing injury to the person or intended for such use. The jury were told to decide unanimously whether the first part of the definition applied and, if not, to make the same decision about the second. That approach was approved in the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    50   The conviction in R v More (1986) Cr App R 234 stood because the House of Lords found it unnecessary to decide whether the trial judge was wrong in failing to give a unanimity direction where several independent representations were relied on, any of which might have been sufficient to convict. The House observed that there was no discernible risk of the jury being satisfied about one representation and not another because in the way the trial had been conducted all the representations stood or fell together. It would follow that the House must have thought that the jury were unanimous about all of them. 
     
      
    51   In R v Price [1991] Crim LR 465 there were two counts of deception for consideration on appeal, each based on alternative representations, any of which could prove guilt. On the first count the jury were not told that they must all agree about any representation but the verdict on another count showed that they must all have been satisfied about a particular representation. On the second count considered on appeal the trial judge in effect told the jury that they had to be unanimous as to a particular representation. 
     
      
    52   In R v Phillips (1988) 86 Cr App R 18 the prosecution asserted that the appellant had conspired with a number of persons to commit a criminal act. Conspiracy with any one of them would have been enough for a conviction. The Court of Appeal held that it was sufficient that the jury be satisfied that the appellant had conspired with at least one other person to commit the offence charged, no matter who. A submission that they all needed to agree on the identity of the co-conspirator was rejected. 
     
      
    53   In R v Mitchell [1994] Crim LR 66 the appellant had been convicted of the unlawful harassment of an occupier of premises. The Crown relied on a number of separate and different acts of harassment. The jury were not directed that they must all be satisfied that any particular act had been proved. The nature of the acts and of the evidence suggested that they did not stand or fall together. It was held on appeal that the jury should have been directed that they had to be unanimous about one or more particular acts. 
     
      
    54   In KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417 the appellant was convicted of maintaining an unlawful relationship of a sexual nature with a child. By a provision of the relevant criminal code a person could not be convicted of such an offence unless that person had done an act of a specified kind on three or more occasions. The Crown relied on evidence of more than three such acts. The jury were not told that they all had to agree about the commission by the appellant of the same three or more acts. It was held in the Queensland Court of Appeal that such a direction was necessary. The Court rejected a submission that the direction was unnecessary because in the way the trial had been conducted, all the alleged acts had been committed or none of them. The Queensland Court of Appeal nevertheless dismissed the appeal on another ground, which was the only one dealt with in the High Court. 
     
      
    55   In R v Beach (1994) 75 A Crim R 447, a decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant had been convicted of one count of causing the death of another by the culpable driving of a motor vehicle and one count of negligently causing serious injury. The first count was based upon s 338 of the Crimes Act (Victoria), which states, relevantly - 
     
      
       
        
        (2) … a person drives a motor vehicle culpably if he drives the motor vehicle - 
        
       
       
        
         … 
        
       
       
        
         (b) negligently, that is to say, if he fails unjustifiably and to a gross degree to observe the standard of care which a reasonable man would have observed in all the circumstances of the case; or 
        
       
       
        
         (c) whilst under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the motor vehicle; 
        
       
       
        
         … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A presentment for an indictable offence under this section shall specify which form of culpability within the meaning of sub-section (2) is charged but evidence of the whole of the circumstances shall be admissible on the hearing of the presentment. 
        
       
      
    56   On the first count the Crown charged that the appellant had driven his vehicle negligently or whilst under the influence of alcohol, relying on sub-s (2)(b) and (c). The jury were not directed that they must be unanimous that the appellant had driven negligently or that he had driven under the influence of alcohol. That was made the subject of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, Victoria. 
     
      
    57   The appeal was dismissed because the verdict on the second count showed that all members of the jury must have been satisfied that the appellant had driven negligently. However, the Court added at 453 - 
     
      
       
        
        In our view, a very different situation would exist where no such finding could be made. In that circumstance, we do not consider that a verdict of guilty could be properly sustained. … 
        
       
       
        
         We consider that the legislature cannot have intended the injustice involved in the acceptance of a verdict of guilt of an accused of the commission of a serious criminal offence, based upon quite disparate findings relating to the very foundation upon which the verdict rests. … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         … in our view if there existed any reasonable possibility that the jury may have divided as earlier indicated and agreed, for practical purposes, only in the result, no true unanimity could be seen to exist. 
        
       
       
        
         We should add that we are not unmindful and have taken heed when making these comments of what was said by the Court in  
        Clarke and Johnstone 
         (1986) VR 643 at 661; 21 A Crim R 135 at 154: 
        
       
       
        
         ‘It is sufficient that the law established by universal practice in this Court permits a jury to reach a verdict at the way the trial judge told the jury here. Homicide trials are a familiar example. The prosecution case of murder or manslaughter is often put in several ways involving different elements. It has never been the law that, before convicting, the jury must all be satisfied of guilt in the one way. The ordinary approach is consistent with the approach of this Court in  
        Power 
         (1960) VR 373 at 374. 
        
       
       
        
        …’ 
        
       
       
        
        We do not understand the members of the Court on that occasion to have been suggesting, in a case which did not require them to address the question, that at the end of the day the only matter about which the jury must be unanimous in a criminal trial is the result. 
        
       
      
    58   There is strong authority in this State for regarding as good a conviction, particularly for manslaughter, which might have been reached by alternative processes of reasoning even where the jury have not been instructed that they must all agree about one or other of them. 
     
      
    59   In R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 379 the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State enumerated reasons why, when a verdict of guilty has been returned and there are alternative bases for arriving at it, the jury should not in an ordinary case be asked about the basis for the verdict. Acknowledging the possibility of a good verdict where the jurors are not unanimous as to the alternative grounds upon which it might be reached, the Court said this at 379 - 
     
      
       
        
        Second, the jury’s response to any such question may be unclear. A response that indicated two grounds of decision might, depending upon the circumstances, indicate that the jury were unanimous on both grounds, or that some jurors adopted one ground, and the remainder adopted another. The response may create more uncertainty than previously existed. 
        
       
      
    60   The Court noted the opinion to the same effect of Roden J in R v Petrov (1980) 2 A Crim R 101 at 134-139. 
     
      
    61   The statement previously referred to in R v Clarke & Johnstone has been applied in R v Levidis (1990) 51 A Crim R 216; R v Eades (1991) 57 A Crim R 151 at 156. See also R v Muto & Eastey [1996] 1 VR 336 at 339. 
     
      
    62   In Alternative Elements and Included Offences [1984] Cambridge Law Journal 290, Professor Glanville Williams says at 291 - 
     
      
       
        
        Alternative elements may be called jurors’ alternatives; they do not present a choice between offences, for the jury as a whole, but relate to the ingredients of the offence. Jurors’ alternatives occur when jurors are presented with different paths by which they may collectively arrive at a single verdict. The most important example is manslaughter. Although theoretically a single offence carrying a single conviction, manslaughter can be committed in a variety of ways, and the jury need not, it seems, agree on any particular way. Six jurors may think the case is one of manslaughter by provocation and six may think that it is manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, but the conviction of manslaughter will be good. 
        
       
      
    63   These cases do not establish the principle for which the appellant contends. It states the relevant principle too widely to say that jurors who are trying a case of alleged manslaughter must be directed that, insofar as the Crown case relies upon suggested alternative bases for a finding of guilt, the jurors must be unanimous as to some one or more of the suggested bases before they can return a verdict of guilt based upon that basis or those bases. The relevant principle is still too widely stated even if there be added a rider that such unanimity is not required in a case where the accused must be liable on one or other of the suggested alternative bases, and it is impossible to say which. 
     
      
    64   The English, Canadian, Queensland and Victorian cases accord with those that bind this Court. They are highly persuasive and should be followed in this State. 
     
      
    65   A distinction is to be made between alternative factual bases of liability and alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts. The cases to which I have referred speak about the former. This appeal is about the latter. 
     
      
    66   The jury were obliged to consider the whole of the conduct of the appellant for the purpose of considering whether he caused the death of the deceased by his unlawful and dangerous act or by his gross negligence. Each process of reasoning invited by the Crown rested on substantially the same factual basis. 
     
      
    67   Of course, there were differences between the ways the Crown put the case factually on each basis. The main one was that the appellant was said for the purposes of his gross negligence (but not for the purposes of his unlawful and dangerous act) to have permitted the deceased to drive the car whilst she was not wearing a seat belt. But that fact was not irrelevant to the jury’s consideration of the appellant’s unlawful and dangerous act. Whether the deceased was wearing a seat belt was relevant to the questions whether she drove negligently, furiously or recklessly or in a manner dangerous to the public or whilst under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    68   It follows from what I have said that the jury must have agreed upon the basis upon which they found the appellant guilty. Using the terminology of Leivers & Ballinger, the alternative bases did not involve materially different issues or consequences. The appellant knew the case he had to meet. 
     
      
    69   This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    70   The fifth and ninth grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. By the fifth ground it was asserted that the trial miscarried because his Honour’s directions about the use the jury might make of the evidence of the speed and the manner in which the deceased drove the car were confusing and contradictory. By the ninth ground it was asserted that his Honour erred in failing to exclude from the jury’s deliberations evidence of the appellant’s encouragement of the deceased and of the manner in which she drove on journeys not temporally connected with the one during which she was killed. 
     
      
    71   It was submitted on appeal that there were a number of journeys, separated by rests, that took place over a period of hours, and that it was necessary for the jury to distinguish between them. 
     
      
    72   Several passages of his Honour’s summing-up were criticised. After dealing with evidence about the speed of the car at stages of the afternoon earlier than that at which the fatal collision occurred, and the appellant’s encouragement of the deceased to drive faster, his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        The only possible relevance the urging by the accused “Faster, faster” could have on that journey is that it may have signified to the deceased that she could drive fast without incurring the displeasure of the owner of the car. I am not quite sure what you will make of that, remember you have to look at the elements of the offence strictly and the material time is the time in that journey leading up to the collision with the pole.  
        But nevertheless when you are considering whether the accused aided and abetted Emma it is possible for you and I am not suggesting you should or you should not but it is possible for you to look at the way he conducted himself earlier in relation to those things because they may, in your mind, continue to amount to an encouragement for her to drive in that manner later on 
        . That is a difficult matter, that is one you will have to think about, but if you are considering for example the aiding and abetting of her driving at a speed dangerous you have to consider her driving at the time just leading up to the collision with the pole. (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
       
        
        Now you have to ask yourself did he aid and abet her if there was any speed then and I am just not sure what my recollection of the evidence is that nobody says she was speeding at that time. You see that is where, I allowed the Crown to introduce that earlier evidence, I am not completely sure now whether that was right or not because I - there is no evidence that I can recall, we will come to it I guess, that suggests that Emma was speeding in that short journey just before the collision. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words was speed a factor in the collision at all, you really have to consider those matters very seriously. It is one thing to say that the speeding was taking place earlier but the strict question you have to ask yourself is was she speeding at the relevant time and did the accused aid and abet her to speed at the relevant time. If she was speeding at the relevant time and did the accused aid and abet her to speed at the relevant time. If she was speeding at the relevant time it is a matter of fact for you, not for me, but if she was, if you think there was evidence that she was speeding just before the car hit the pole. We will come to that, I myself cannot remember evidence of speed on that journey, indeed I think the witnesses that were asked said that the car seemed to be moving at a normal speed then. And I am talking about speed now, I am not talking about manner or driving under the influence, I am talking about speed only for the moment. But it there is evidence of speed just in the drive leading to the collision, then it is probably - it is possible and it is again a matter for you to ask yourselves whether the urging to go faster, faster that occurred earlier might have been still operating on her mind knowing that that is the way Bill like me to drive, fast. I mean I do not want to tell you what to think about this, I am simply tossing these thoughts around so that they are matters you do think about. 
        
       
      
    73   Later on, dealing with the evidence of Brett Cowan, his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        After the hat incident he said “The car ran off the road and rolled over. It happened seconds after Llewellyn gave her the hat, I do not know how many seconds. He could not remember L plates. He said that Bill look intoxicated to him at Bill’s property before they left. He said “Bill was drunk when he came out of the hotel, he was tripping”. He said the car was in the process of overtaking when Bill said “Faster, faster”, well you have to consider that. We do not know what happened we were not there but it is suggested, I take it, by the defence that Emma had got to a point of no return perhaps and being told to go faster, faster. I do not know but I am just saying these are the sorts of things you have got to think of because that seems to be the only point in the accused, through his counsel, suggesting through the witness too that the process of overtaking had already started when Bill said “Faster, faster.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        And remember that the relevant driving for the purposes of this case is the driving at the time of the collision, and sufficiently proximate to it to be regarded as the same driving episode. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        … if you put aside the alcohol and just consider speed and manner dangerous, and look at what evidence there was of speed and manner dangerous in that at the time of the collision, and before it, you may find very scanty evidence in the facts of this case. I may be wrong, you heard the evidence, but I have just been through it again, and the evidence of speed or manner dangerous, or furious driving, or anything of that kind, at the time of the collision and the moments proximate to that, which are the relevant time, that evidence is, evidence of that sort of driving at that time is, it seems to me, almost non existent. 
        
       
      
    74   It was submitted that the evidence showed that any speeding was substantially earlier than the stage of the journey during which the fatal collision occurred. Not only was there no evidence of speed at the critical time, there was evidence that there was no excessive speed at that time. It was submitted that his Honour’s directions suggested that the appellant might be regarded by the jury as having continued to encourage the deceased to speed, a direction that was confusing because she was not speeding. 
     
      
    75   This submission is not borne out by an examination of the evidence. At the conclusion of the second-last journey the party returned to the appellant’s property. The deceased had been speeding. Adam Long had steered whilst sitting on the appellant’s lap and Llewellyn Long as he sat on the deceased’s lap. According to the evidence of Llewellyn Long in chief, when the party arrived at the appellant’s property he got out of the car and said - 
     
      
       
        
        This is far enough. You’ve nearly crashed and you’ve been drinking. 
        
       
      
    76   The deceased then said that they were going for a drive and the appellant proposed a journey that would bring them back to the starting point after twenty or thirty minutes. Llewellyn Long said - 
     
      
       
        
        I’ll get back in, but keep it under a hundred. 
        
       
      
    77   The deceased drove the car the 2.5 kilometres or so until it crashed. 
     
      
    78   In cross-examination there were these questions and answers - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. There was a discussion between you and Emma before you went further on in the journey wasn’t there? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you asked her to keep the speed under a hundred? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And she agreed to it? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And certainly from that point on there was no - you’re not suggesting that-- 
         
        A. There was no drinking after that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No drinking but no Bill telling her to go faster? 
         
        A. No he didn’t say anything on that part. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And as far as you were aware she seemed to be keeping to her word didn’t she? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is under a hundred? 
         
        A. I didn’t check the speedo after I told her to do that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But as far as you were aware from your being in the car? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it the situation that she seemed to be sticking with what she’d promised, that is under a hundred? 
         
        A. Well I can’t really can’t remember, I didn’t look at the speedo after that, I just gathered - I just presumed Emma would’ve kept it under a hundred, I didn’t bother checking again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So there was nothing about the way she was driving that caused you to want to check? 
         
        A. No there was no comments from Bill either that made me want to check. 
        
       
      
    79   Brett Cowan said that at the appellant’s property Llewellyn got off the deceased’s lap and sat in the back of the car. The deceased started driving again. He continued - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Did her manner of driving change after she’d got back into the car and started driving again, speed-wise, the way she drove, anything like that? 
         
        A. I think she drove faster. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You think she drove faster? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
      
    80   In cross-examination he said that he could not remember any conversation about keeping the speed under one hundred. He could not remember whether the appellant said anything to the deceased about driving faster. He was not asked about the speed at which the deceased drove. He said that she lost control of the car because she was swerving. 
     
      
    81   Adam Long said that at the end of the stage during which he had tried to bog the car the appellant suggested a drive to a village called Vacy. These questions and answers followed - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Well can you tell us what happened after you left Bill’s property? 
         
        A. We started driving along Martins Creek Road and we got, I’m not sure how far in, when we came around a curve and we just started tumbling and turning all over the road. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On this trip between Bill’s property and the accident site did you notice anything about the driving, first of all speed? 
         
        A. It was about the same all around the trip when we were on the main tarred roads. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Between Bill’s place and the accident were you concerned about the speed the car was being driven? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it that’s because it was fast? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    82   In cross-examination he said this - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Do you remember Llewellyn asking Emma to keep it under 100? 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember Emma saying she would, words to the effect “I will I’ll keep it under 100”? 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think your actual memory of the accident is only that you went around a corner is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then the accident occurred? 
         
        A. At the speed we were going it was within seconds. 
        
       
      
    83   If they accepted the evidence of Brett Cowan and Adam Long, the jury were entitled to find that on her last journey the deceased drove at least as fast as she had done before. 
     
      
    84   His Honour made clear to the jury that they should not use evidence of the speed at which the deceased drove before going to the tavern to show the speed at which she drove immediately before the collision. The speed at which the deceased was driving the car at various times and the appellant’s encouragement were significant matters for the jury to consider on the issue whether the appellant aided and abetted the deceased’s illegal acts or was grossly negligent. In my opinion the evidence was relevant in the way his Honour indicated in the passage of the summing-up emphasised earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    85   In my opinion these grounds of appeal have not been made good. 
     
      
    86   The seventh ground of appeal complains about his Honour’s directions about the duty of care owed by an owner of a motor vehicle to a person driving it. 
     
      
    87   The passage complained of is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Now negligence is a concept which I have to explain to you. Negligence only arises where there is a duty of care. Negligence arises where there is a duty of care and a breach of that duty of care and a duty of care can arise in all sorts of situations in our lives. When we drive a motor car we have a duty of care to the other users of the road or people in the proximity of the road, not to injure them or cause anything to happen to their detriment in the way we drive our motor car. 
        
       
       
        
        So if we drive our car so carelessly that we run off the road and run over a pedestrian, we would be guilty of negligence because we failed in our duty of care towards that pedestrian. Those people to whom we owe a duty of care are those people who may be adversely affected by the way we do something. It is very hard to see how I would have a duty of care to someone today walking on an Auckland street in New Zealand, there is not that proximity, not that relationship between us that could create a duty of care but there are all sorts of relationships including relationships of proximity which may give rise to a duty of care. 
        
       
       
        
        That is background information to you, what I tell you is that the owner of a motor vehicle who allows someone else to drive that vehicle has a duty of care towards that person which may be breached in a number of ways. And I can tell you that if the accused did permit the deceased to drive his motor vehicle whilst he was in it he had a duty of care towards her that may have been breached in a number of ways, that it was possible to breach in a number of ways and it would be open to you to find, it is a matter for you, that the owner of a vehicle who allows another person to drive it at excessive speeds on the public road is in breach of a duty of care to that person, may be to other people as well, of course duty of care may not end with that person it may include other users of the road and pedestrians, it may include passengers in the car. But the duty of care, you might think, would extend to withdrawing his permission to drive the car, but it might extend to withdrawing his permission to drive the car if the person refused to comply with basic safety rules, such as driving at a reasonable speed. I am not talking about speed limits now, they are technical things, I am talking about driving at dangerous speeds. I am talking about not wearing a seat belt. It is a question for you to decide whether you think there was a breach of the duty of care. What I am saying to you is that there was a duty of care, that is a matter that I, as the trial judge, have to determine. There is a duty of care on the part of the owner of a motor vehicle with someone else driving his motor vehicle, a vehicle over which he has authority, a vehicle which he can give permission to drive or refuse permission to drive. 
        
       
      
    88   It was conceded on appeal that a mature adult who permits a learner driver of the age of sixteen years and nine months to drive his car owes that driver a duty of care. The complaints in respect of this portion of the summing-up were that his Honour put the rule too broadly and that, insofar as his Honour spoke of the duty to withdraw permission to drive where the driver was not wearing a seat belt, the direction was inappropriate because there was no evidence that the appellant knew that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt and no evidence that could have satisfied the jury that the failure to wear a seat belt was a cause of the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    89   I do not think that the direction was put too broadly. Presumably defence counsel also thought the direction appropriate, because the point was not taken at trial. 
     
      
    90   In the way the trial was conducted the failure by the deceased to wear a seat belt was much less important than the evidence of the speed and the manner in which she drove the car and the appellant’s encouragement of her to do so, the while plying her with alcohol. 
     
      
    91   It is not correct to say that there was no evidence that the appellant knew that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt. He was seated beside her in the car and the jury were entitled to infer that he saw that she was not wearing a seat belt. 
     
      
    92   This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    93   The eighth ground of appeal complains that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In written submissions filed before the hearing of the appeal it was submitted that there was no evidence of excessive speed at the time of the collision and no direct evidence that the appellant knew that the deceased was a learner driver. The first submission was factually incorrect and there was no substance in the second. 
     
      
    94   Senior Counsel arguing the appeal submitted that there had been a miscarriage of justice because of the generally unsatisfactory nature of the summing-up. No particular part of the summing-up was referred to other than those dealt with in the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    95   In my opinion, on a reading of the summing-up as a whole, the jury were adequately directed. No further directions were sought by trial counsel. This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    96   By ground 10 it was asserted that because of the way it put its case the Crown was not entitled as a matter of law to rely on the unlawful and dangerous act of the appellant. The argument was put in this way. Insofar as the appellant acted unlawfully it was because he was an accessory to the unlawful act of the deceased. It was therefore as an accessory that the appellant was convicted. The principal offence was manslaughter. However, since it was not an offence under the law of New South Wales for the deceased to kill herself - Crimes Act s 31A - no one had committed the principal offence. There could therefore be no accessorial liability. 
     
      
    97   It may be accepted that there can be no conviction of an accessory unless it is proved that the principal offence has been committed. Cain v Doyle (1946) 72 CLR 409; R v Anthony [1965] 1 All ER 440; Giorgianni v The Queen (1984-1985) 156 CLR 473; R v Demirian [1989] VR 97. 
     
      
    98   However, I think that the appellant’s submissions misconceive the nature of the Crown case. The Crown asserted that the appellant brought about the death of the deceased by any or all of his acts of permitting, assisting and encouraging the deceased to drive the car negligently, furiously or recklessly, too fast or under the influence of alcohol. As well as being dangerous, those acts were unlawful because they made him liable as an accessory to the offences he thereby permitted, assisted and encouraged the deceased to commit. 
     
      
    99   Although in order to prove unlawful the acts of the appellant upon which it relied the Crown wished to prove that they constituted accessorial offences, that was the only way in which the Crown relied upon his accessorial liability. The Crown never asserted that the appellant was responsible as an accessory to manslaughter. He was charged and convicted as a principal. Neither was it asserted that the deceased was guilty of the crime of manslaughter. The only offences alleged against her were the driving offences to which I have referred and they were proved, as I have said, in order to prove that the acts of the appellant in permitting, assisting and encouraging their commission were unlawful. 
     
      
    100   In my opinion this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    101   In the application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour it was submitted that the appellant was fifty-five years old at the time of the commission of the offence and fifty-eight years old when sentenced. He suffered brain damage in the accident and remembered none of it. Business colleagues gave evidence suggesting that his commission of the offence was out of character, though he had convictions for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in 1976 and 1989. 
     
      
    102   The Court was referred to what were said to be comparable cases which demonstrated that the sentences were outside the permissible range. The first one was R v Youssef, Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 December 1991. The applicant swerved onto the wrong side of the road, mounted the footpath and struck a young girl, killing her, and injured another. The applicant had a bad driving record. The driving conditions were normal. A possible mitigating factor was that the applicant may have suffered an epileptic seizure at the time of the offence. This was a Crown appeal against a sentence of four months’ periodic detention. The appeal was dismissed. 
     
      
    103   The facts of that case were entirely unlike those in this appeal and I find it of no assistance. 
     
      
    104   The second case was R v Stevens, Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 August 1993. The applicant was stealing a car when the owner tried to stop him. The owner was killed as the applicant drove away. The applicant pleaded guilty, was eighteen years old, was of good character and was remorseful. On appeal his sentence was reduced to eight years, comprising a minimum term of five years six months and an additional term of two years six months. 
     
      
    105   In my opinion the objective facts of that case were far less serious than the present. It is difficult to imagine a more serious course of conduct than that followed by the appellant. What took place happened over a period of about three and a half hours and over a distance of thirty-five kilometres. The appellant was the only adult having the care of four children. He was aware that he was too drunk to drive and, in order to avoid the consequences to himself of drinking and driving, encouraged the deceased to drive. It was he alone who supplied alcohol and encouraged her to drink it. Three young children as well as the deceased were put at risk. Very high speeds were reached on the direct encouragement of the appellant to drive faster. All this was done in the face of the fear of the three boys, their entreaties and efforts to bring the career to an end. 
     
      
    106   As his Honour observed, the appellant exercised a strong moral influence over the deceased by virtue of his long experience and mature age and her inexperience and youth. The apparent careless attitude of the appellant to the matter of driving was especially dangerous. 
     
      
    107   In fixing the sentence his Honour referred to the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, provided for in s 52A(2) Crimes Act, the maximum sentence for which is fourteen years’ imprisonment. His Honour observed that that was the crime which in his opinion most closely resembled the crime for which he was punishing the appellant and took fourteen years’ imprisonment to be a general guide to the current opinion of the Parliament concerning the maximum sentence for motor vehicle manslaughter. 
     
      
    108   His Honour erred in making that observation and that comparison. The offence for which his Honour was sentencing the appellant was manslaughter, a much more serious offence than aggravated dangerous driving causing death. The maximum penalty was penal servitude for twenty-five years. His Honour’s error favoured the appellant. 
     
      
    109   In my opinion this case was of such a serious nature as to be seen as falling into the worst category of cases of its kind. The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    110   I propose the following orders - 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
      2. Leave granted to appeal against sentence; appeal against sentence dismissed.

     REGINA v Benjamin KITIONA 
      
       
      
       
     JUDGMENT 
    1    JAMES J: The first judgment will be given by Sperling J. 
     
      
       
      
    2    SPERLING J: The applicant was born on 7 June 1977. He is a tall man of some six feet two inches and, at the time of the offence with which this appeal is concerned, he weighed something in excess of 100 kilograms. 
     
      
       
      
    3    On 25 September 1997, when the applicant was 20 years of age he and another man accosted two women in Marshall Avenue, St Leonards at 9.30pm. The women were both 52 years of age. They had just finished work and were walking towards their cars. Both were carrying bags. The bag carried by one of the women was taken by one of the men without a significant struggle. The other man pulled the second woman to the ground. She was dragged along and was screaming for help. A bag was then taken from her also. The women ran to one of the cars. The two men were sighted in another vehicle. The women's car was positioned in an attempt to block their escape. They got away, scrapping the side of the women's vehicle. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The applicant was charged with robbery in company to which he pleaded guilty on 1 May 1998 and adhered to that plea before Gibson DCJ on 16 September 1998, when he was sentenced. At the applicant's request, the judge also took into account offences of stealing from the person and negligent driving, which related to the same incident, and an offence of receiving, which was an earlier matter. 
     
      
       
      
    5    Section 97 of the Crimes Act 1900 prescribes a maximum penalty of penal servitude for robbery being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument, or being in company with another person. The same section prescribes a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 25 years for such an offence if the person is armed with a dangerous weapon as distinct from a weapon or instrument which is only offensive. By s 94, a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude is prescribed for robbery without any of the additional elements referred to in s 97. These penalties show the seriousness with which the law regards robbery of any kind. Bag snatching is robbery. It is robbery of a more serious kind if it is committed in company. It represents a serious breach of the peace and a callous disregard of the property rights of others which cannot be tolerated in a civil society: Hall (NSW CCA, 28 September 1995, unreported). Members of the public, particularly women who have no chance of defending themselves and who are more liable to injury on that account, ought to be able to move through the streets without the threat of this kind of offence. It is important that judges reflect in their sentence the need to deter others from committing offences of this kind insofar as the courts are capable of doing so. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The applicant had committed serious other offences of a similar kind on prior occasions. In November 1995, he was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aggravated robbery. In relation to the assault, he was required to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 2 years and to accept the supervision of the Probation Service. For the offence of aggravated robbery, the applicant was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment, to be served by periodic detention. The aggravated robbery consisted of robbing a man of his wallet with violence. The recognisance had not expired when the present offence was committed. Additionally, at the time of the present offence the applicant was on bail for the charge of receiving to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ was a total sentence of penal servitude for 4 and a half years, consisting of a minimum term of 3 and a half years and an additional term of 12 months. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The sentencing judge is said to have erred in two respects. First, it is submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Secondly, it is submitted that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances, and - it is implied - in failing to fix a longer additional term at the expense of the minimum term imposed. 
     
      
       
      
    9    On behalf of the appellant, certain subjective features of the case are emphasised. The applicant was only 20 years of age at the time. He pleaded guilty to the offence. He was poorly educated and unemployed. He had expressed remorse and was actively seeking employment at the time of the sentence. After immigrating to Australia from New Zealand with his family, the applicant had fallen into delinquent company at the age of 14. His family remained supportive. He did not use drugs. According to the psychological report of Doctor Lennings, tendered at the sentencing hearing, the applicant was in the average to low average range of ability, was reactively depressed and suffered from an anxiety disorder. There were longer standing problems with his thinking, and there appeared to have been a significantly delayed area of development in social and inter-personal reasoning. The applicant was operating at an adolescent level of maturity.  
     
      
       
      
    10    The applicant gave evidence that he was pressured into committing the offence by the other person involved. The sentencing judge was unimpressed by that protestation in view of the applicant's unwillingness to identify his co-offender. His Honour's scepticism is not called into question on appeal, nor could it be. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The Crown, points to the following features of the case. The offence was committed while the applicant was subject to a recognisance and barely 2 days after the applicant had been granted bail for the receiving offence. There were really two separate offences involving two victims in which both of the co-offenders were complicit. Although there was no threat of actual violence, one of the women fell to the ground and was dragged along. The crime was discussed by the co-offenders beforehand so there was premeditation and planning. This was the second of two offences of a similar kind committed by the applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    12    On behalf of the applicant, reference has been made to the guideline judgment of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It was laid down in that case that for an offence under s97 of armed robbery, with certain characteristics, the total sentence should generally fall between four and five years. That range applied to offences where a weapon such as a knife was used by a young offender, who pleaded guilty, with little or no criminal history, limited actual violence but a real threat of violence, and the victim being in a vulnerable position. It is submitted that the present sentence is out of step with that decision. I disagree, bearing in mind the features of the present offence to which I have referred, including that there were two victims, and two robberies in which both co-offenders were complicit. 
     
      
       
      
    13    The sentence imposed was a heavy sentence but it was not, in my opinion in excess of the proper exercise of judicial discretion. 
     
      
       
      
    14    As to special circumstances, counsel for the applicant has calculated that the minimum term actually exceeded the statutory ratio by some six weeks. It is acknowledged, however, that, although this is unusual, it is not unlawful. The main complaint is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances and, accordingly, failed to go the other way, enlarging the additional term at the expense of the minimum term relative to the statutory formula. 
     
      
       
      
    15    I see no reason to find that the sentencing judge was bound to find special circumstances in this case. In particular, the sentencing judge was not bound to find that a longer additional term was required for supervised rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The material placed the before the court on appeal indicates that the applicant has been a cooperative prisoner and is making earnest efforts to rehabilitate himself. The applicant is to be commended for those efforts and is to be encouraged in his endeavours. If I could encourage him further by reducing of the present sentence, I would be strongly tempted to do so. However, no ground has been demonstrated for disturbing the sentence imposed. 
     
      
       
      
    17    The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
       (1) Grant leave to appeal. 
        
        
       (2) Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
     18    JAMES J: I agree. The orders of the court will be as proposed by Sperling J.

     MONDAY 6 DECEMBER 1999 
     
     REGINA v. SHARON MICHELLE HORNE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   MASON, P: I will ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: An appeal against an asserted inadequacy of sentence has been brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions from the sentence imposed upon Sharon Michelle Horne in the District Court of New South Wales at Campbelltown following her plea of guilty to one count of armed robbery under s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
    3   The respondent was sentenced to a total sentence of 25 months and seven days penal servitude to commence on 12 November 1998 and comprising a minimum term of seven months and seven days and an additional term of 18 months. 
    4   The short facts appear in the remarks of the sentencing judge as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""At about 11.06 pm on 11 November 1998, the respondent together with her co-offender, Daniel Willy Marks, drove to the vicinity of the BP Service Station at 930 King Georges Road, South Hurstville. They were travelling in a Holden Kingswood sedan registration number LFU 783. 
       
      
       
      
       
       After observing the service station for some time, they parked their car some 300 metres down a side street and walked to the service station. 
       
      
       
      
       
       At the service station, the respondent maintained a position at the door to the shop area while Marks approached the victim, Nigel Cameron Goghlan, who was standing behind the counter. Marks was armed with a large chef's knife which he pointed and waved towards the victim when demanding money and cigarettes. 
       
      
       
      
       
       An approximate sum of $44 was handed over to Marks, together with some four packets of Horizon cigarettes. 
       
      
       
      
       
       Both the respondent and Marks then left the service station. 
       
      
       
      
       
       At the time of the robbery, Marks had on a back balaclava and the respondent had on a beige coloured one. 
       
      
       
      
       
       At about 12.05 am on 12 November 1998, police observed a Holden sedan parked on Heathcote Road, Heathcote. Upon approach, they observed the respondent seated in the driver seat and Marks seated in the passenger seat. Police located a large quantity of coins, three kitchen knives, four packets of horizon cigarettes, two balaclavas - one black and one beige coloured and a Triple M black backpack. 
       
      
       
      
       
       Police were at this stage unaware that a robbery had been committed at the BP Service Station. Marks was arrested in relation to another matter and conveyed to Sutherland Police Station. The respondent followed them in the Holden sedan. 
       
      
       
      
       
       At the police station following certain enquiries having been made, police became aware of the robbery at the BP station and consequently both the respondent and Marks were charged. 
       
      
       
      
       
       The respondent participated in an electronic record of interview wherein she made full admissions. She asserts that both she and Marks drove past the BP station. It was Marks' idea to rob the station and that she was not keen to do so. She stood just outside the BP shop door while Marks went in with the knife and demanded money and cigarettes. The money was put into Marks' Triple M black backpack. The large quantity of coins found in the console of the car were part of the proceeds from the robbery, as were the Horizon cigarettes. 
       
      
       
      
       
       From where she stood, she heard the conversation between Marks and the victim. At the time, Marks was wearing a black balaclava and she had a beige beanie on her head. They had used part of the proceeds of the robbery to purchase amphetamines. All the knives, bar one (which belonged to Marks) were hers for use in her work as an apprentice chef."" 
       
      
    5   There had been some delay, not the respondent's fault, in dealing with her plea and indeed she had admitted the offence at the earliest possible occasion, co-operated with the authorities, afforded valuable assistance to them and his Honour went so far as to describe her conduct since arrest as ""at the top of the ladder as these things go"". She had been an ideal prisoner and, with the assistance of her family, who are deeply religious, she had returned to the church and had embarked upon evangelising activities. She had stayed completely clean of the drugs, the abuse of which had underlain the commission of the crime and has attempted to commence the rehabilitation process. She had reconciled with her family and her parents were eager to receive her back into the home. His Honour accepted her account that she attempted to dissuade her co-offender from committing the crime and put herself in the middle of the door of the service station when they went there, telling him not to do it, but eventually she went along with it at his instigation. 
    6   His Honour properly held that although she was equally liable for the offence with her co-offender, her role was sufficiently distinguishable from his that she ought to be regarded as having a materially lower level of culpability. He accepted the exceptionally strong subjective case she made. He noted that she had only one prior entry in her record and had been only 19 at the time the crime was committed; that her drug abuse had led to a breakdown of her relationship with her family and the breakdown of a promising career, a career that she has resumed, so we are told, since having been liberated at the conclusion of the minimum term. If the appeal were upheld a return to custody would be necessary. 
    7   Submissions had been put before his Honour that in all the circumstances she should not be required to serve actual imprisonment beyond the date of his Honour's passing sentence. She had been in custody for more than seven months prior to his Honour passing sentence. Those submissions were put in the context of the assistance she had furnished to the authorities, the prospects of rehabilitation and the desirability to avoid the deleterious effects of imprisonment on the prospects of rehabilitation that might have been occasioned and which would have been adverse to the community's interests. 
    8   The Crown conceded that it is necessary that there be shown error in the course taken by the trial judge below, either in principle or by way of manifest inadequacy. It is not necessary to review the numerous cases on the exercise of the court's power on an appeal by the Crown in these circumstances. In Regina v. King [1999] NSWCCA 16; Regina v. Menzies [1999] NSWCCA 222 and Regina v. Chmait [1999] NSWCCA 217, Newman J and I had identified the relevant principles. 
    9   In Regina v. Henry, Barber, Tran, Silver, Tsoukatos, Kyroglou & Jenkins [1999] NSWCCA 111 this court gave a guideline judgment in respect of six Crown appeals and one severity appeal on the offence of armed robbery. In particular, it had regard to armed robberies committed by young persons under the influence of drug addiction. That judgment and the consequent individual judgments dealt with a range of sentences to which regard should be had on a policy basis when sentencing by trial judges. It was not intended that that decision should prescribe rigid limits or a tariff but a guideline to which sentencing judges should have regard to avoid untoward inconsistency. That this was so was clearly made out when, in the exercise of discretion, the Crown appeal in respect of the particular appeal in the matter of Kyroglou was dismissed. A most important factor in that regard was that it would have been necessary to return the respondent to custody in the event the appeal were upheld. 
    10   The cases establishing the discretion not to interfere with a sentence which might otherwise be inadequate in a Crown appeal in those circumstances are too well known to require repetition here. 
    11   His Honour made no reference to the guideline judgment in Henry (supra), nor specific reference to the principles in it in this case. In this respect his Honour appears to have failed to apply this important decision of this court. Absent the particular circumstances of this case and the double jeopardy considerations underlying the discretion on Crown appeals, I would regard this as a serious error of principle which, except for the matters to which I later refer, would warrant interference by this court. 
    12   It is submitted that both the total sentence and the minimum term were manifestly inadequate. The criticism of the sentence and the assertion of particular errors is powerful, however in this case, in my view, it is not necessary to determine whether that submission on the overall sentence, or the submissions asserting particular errors of principle, including an assertion of excessive judicial focus on the matter of assistance and an untoward reduction of the minimum term, are well founded when one considers whether the discretion to intervene should be exercised in the peculiar and special circumstances of this case. 
    13   In various of the judgments in Henry (supra) including in the judgments of the Chief Justice and the Chief Judge at Common Law appear examinations of the relevance of drug addiction to the commission of the offence. Insofar as it shows that the real weakness of character that led to the offence is that of a drug addict rather than a robber, and where rehabilitation appears to have been undertaken, and where that addiction arose, at least to a substantial extent, from circumstances for which the prisoner was not primarily responsible (for example as here, where she had been introduced to drugs by another during relationships in which she was physically abused) it is open to a trial judge to consider that the prospective rehabilitation of the offender in the community's interests is a matter which should receive great weight. Particularly that matter is one which would weigh heavily with a court concerned to consider whether a Crown appeal should be entertained in discretion. 
    14   Having regard to those matters, the limited role of the respondent in the offence and particularly to her assistance to the authorities and the prospects of rehabilitation, in the peculiar and special circumstances of this case where, if the appeal were to succeed, a return to custody would be required, in my view the discretion should be exercised to allow the sentence to stand. I would, in those circumstances, propose the appeal be dismissed. 
    15   MASON, P: I agree. Judges who turn the blind eye to an applicable guideline judgment must realise that a Crown appeal is very likely to succeed, with the consequence that the offender is placed into custody or returned to custody. The hardship that this imposes upon a young offender is manifest, yet it is a necessary consequence of giving effect to proper sentencing principles. Misguided judicial kindness thus becomes unintended cruelty. 
    16   I have considered anxiously whether this is such a case. In my view Judge Moore erred in his approach to the task before him. He should have addressed the recently published sentencing guidelines in Regina v. Henry [1999] 46 NSWLR 346. 
    17   The sentence was unduly lenient, notwithstanding the comparatively limited and reluctant role adopted by the respondent. 
    18   However, the objective and subjective circumstances of this particular offence, and this particular offender, the so-called double jeopardy principle and the favourable signs of rehabilitation lead me to the view that it is a proper case to exercise the discretion not to uphold the Crown appeal. 
    19   The respondent must realise that she is treading on eggshells as she serves the lengthy additional term of her sentence. She has had an experience of imprisonment which, I trust, will be salutary. She must not think that the court would look with any favour upon relapse to drug dependence or associated criminal activity. 
    20   I agree with the orders proposed. 
    21   NEWMAN, J: I also agree with the orders proposed and I agree with the remarks of my brethren, particularly those of the President. 
    22   MASON, P: The appeal is dismissed.

      J C T WONG and Anor v Francis Ivor KELLY 
      
     
     
      
     The appellants, Mr J Wong and Rizoli Pty Ltd, were declared guilty by Carruthers AJ of a number of offences under the  
     Customs Act  
     1901 (Cth) (the Act) regarding, among other things, importation and smuggling of goods and evading payment of duty. The offences related to three container shipments of furniture from Hong Kong, which arrived by sea at Port Botany between January and March 1987 where each container were said to contain furniture but in fact each contained a considerable quantity of clothing secreted in the containers for the purpose of evading payment of duty. The appellants, after abandoning various grounds of appeal, limited their appeal to the following issues: 
      
      
     (a) in the context of an examination of all the documents advanced by the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) as justifying the institution of proceedings, especially the retainer, no authority was ever given to the AGS by the respondent, Mr F Kelly, being the Comptroller-General of Customs, to bring the current proceedings against Mr J Wong. Alternatively, there was either no or ineffective ratification by the respondent; 
      
      
     (b) the trial judge erred in finding Rizoli Pty Ltd held itself out to be the owner of the goods; 
      
      
     (c) documents produced by Mr J Wong to Officer Davies on 27 April 1987 were illegally obtained as the Notice given under s 214 of the Act only permitted production to the Collector;  
      
      
     (d) trial judge erred in failing to strike out certain averments contained in the Further Amended Statement of Claim as they were evidence and impermissible; and 
      
      
     (e) proceedings were criminal proceedings for the purposes of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , 1995 and the trial judge was in error in not so concluding. 
      
      
     Held 
     : dismissing the appeal 
      
      
     (1) ‘Retainer’ is a word used to describe a contract between solicitor and client for the provision of legal services for a fee. It is not required to be in writing and may be implied from conduct. Here the course of dealings over nine years makes it plain beyond argument that the AGS was retained by the Comptroller-General of Customs to institute and conduct the proceedings against the appellants in the Supreme Court. No question of ratification arises. No question of authority to institute proceedings arises, given the finding on retainer, since the Comptroller-General needed no authority under the Act to institute the proceedings in his own name; 
      
      
     (2) On the facts disclosed, along with a definition of ‘owner’ in s 4, read together with ss 36(1) and 153 of the Act, it was open to the trial judge to make the finding that the documents effectively asserted that Rizoli Pty Ltd was the owner of all the contents of the container knowing it included the secreted goods; 
      
      
     (3) As the Collector signed the s 214 Notice and officer Davies was doing his duty in the matter, Mr Davies was deemed to be the Collector for the purposes of s 214(1). This construction would promote the object and purposes underlying the legislation and is to be preferred to the appellant’s submissions, which does not. 
      
      
     (4) The submission that the trial judge erred in failing to strike out the averments cannot succeed on the facts; 
     
     
     (5) The trial judge was correct to treat the proceedings as civil and not criminal and apply the standard of proof in

     Introduction 
      
    4    This is an appeal against a judgment by Carruthers AJ declaring the appellants, John Chu Ting Wong and Rizoli Pty Ltd, guilty of a number of offences under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (the Act). On 10 July 1998 his Honour declared that the appellants were guilty of a total of 18 offences under the Act.  
    5    The first appellant, John Wong was convicted on nine charges relating to the smuggling of goods in contravention of s 233(1)(a); evading payment of duty in breach of s 234(1)(a) and making a false entry in a material particular in breach of s 234(1)(d) of the Act, the offences being committed on or about 8 January, 4 February and 23 March 1987 respectively.6    On the three smuggling offences, Mr Wong was adjudged to pay a penalty of $353,632. A similar penalty was adjudged to be paid by him in respect of the three offences of evading payment of duty. A penalty of $1,000 was imposed with respect to the offences of making a false entry. Mr Wong was also ordered to make reparations to the Commonwealth in the sum of $594,507, in respect of the evaded duty. 
    7    The second appellant, Rizoli Pty Ltd, was convicted of nine offences relating to being concerned with the smuggling of goods by Mr Wong; being concerned with the evasion of payment of duty by Mr Wong and being concerned with the making of a false entry in a particular by Mr Wong, on the dates mentioned above, pursuant to s 236 of the Act. The same penalties were adjudged to be paid by Rizoli Pty Ltd as in the case of Mr Wong. The appellants were each ordered to pay 50% of the costs of the respondent, the Comptroller-General of Customs (the C-G). 
    8    The offences relate to three container shipments of furniture from Hong Kong, which arrived by sea at Port Botany between January and March 1987. While each container was said to contain furniture, in fact each contained a considerable quantity of clothing secreted in the containers. The clothing was not disclosed to Customs officers at the time of submission of customs entry documentation, thus evading customs duty. The clothing, largely T-shirts and like garments, was imported as part of a scheme by the appellants whereby the clothing was secreted in shipments of furniture for the purpose of evading the payment of duty. The aggregate duty evaded with respect of the three shipments was $594,507, hence the order for reparation made against Mr Wong. 
     
      
     Notice of Grounds of Appeal 
      
    9    The Notice of Appeal contains 29 grounds. However, sensibly in my view, counsel for the appellants, Mr Graham QC, has limited the dispute by abandoning grounds 6, 7, 10, 11 and 25 to 28. In addition, he did not press ground 5. Mr Graham has also confined his oral submissions to the ground in para 29 wherein Mr Wong challenges the retainer of the respondent’s solicitor and the grounds concerning the finding of his Honour that Rizoli Pty Ltd held itself out as owner of the goods in question (grounds 14 - 23). Thus the challenge to the retainer went only to the orders made by Carruthers AJ against Mr Wong, whereas the second argument went to the orders made concerning Rizoli Pty Ltd.10    As to the remaining grounds of appeal, Mr Graham relied on his written submissions. Grounds 1 and 2 concern the failure of his Honour to strike out certain averments contained in the respondent’s Further Amended Statement of Claim. Grounds 3 and 4 concern the admission into evidence of documents claimed to have been unlawfully obtained. Grounds 8 and 9 claim that his Honour should have held that the proceedings were criminal proceedings for the purposes of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and accordingly rejected evidence of verbal admissions in the record of interview with Mr Wong. Grounds 12 and 13 also depend upon the proceedings being considered criminal proceedings. 
     
      
     The retainer issue (ground 29) 
      
    11    It is convenient to first consider the challenge by Mr Wong to the retainer of the respondent’s solicitor, the Australian Government Solicitor (the AGS). The challenge to the retainer by the appellant followed his Honour’s reserving judgment on 8 May 1998. It arose in the following circumstances. By letter dated 4 June 1998 the AGS wrote to the solicitor for the appellants enclosing a copy of a document entitled ‘Authority to Prosecute’ signed by T.P. Hayes, Comptroller-General and dated 25 September 1987. The letter stated that the records of the AGS indicated that the solicitors may not have been provided with a copy and that it may be of relevance to the defendants. The document is in the following form: 
     
       
       
     Australian Customs Service 
      
       
     Authority to Prosecute 
       
      
       
        
       I, THOMAS PLUNKETT HAYES, Comptroller-General of Customs, pursuant to Section 245(1), do hereby authorise and instruct the Australian Government Solicitor to institute Customs Prosecutions in my name, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against: 
       
      
      
       
        Rizoli Pty Ltd 
       
      
      
       
       for alleged offences against the Customs Act 1901, and for the condemnation of the goods seized as forfeited. 
       
      
      
       
       I further authorise the Australian Government Solicitor to act on my behalf, and to do all things he considers necessary to safeguard my interests, and the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia in these proceedings and in any other proceedings whatsoever arising therefrom.  
       
      
      
       
       (T.P. Hayes) 
        
       Comptroller-General of Customs 
        
       25 September 1987  
        
        
       
      
    12    Just why the AGS provided this document is not clear, but the motives of the writer may have been laudable. By further letter dated 23 June 1998 the AGS argued that the document was sufficient to authorise the prosecution of both defendants (the Authority document referred only to the company as defendant). Further documents were enclosed which were said to be relevant to the institution of the proceedings against the defendants.  
    13    By Notice of Motion dated 26 June 1998 Mr Wong sought an order that the proceedings be struck out as against him or permanently stayed. The motion also sought an order that the AGS pay his costs on an indemnity basis. At the hearing of the motion, which was between Mr Wong and Francis Ivor Kelly, Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Paul Roberts of Counsel appeared for the respondent to the motion, instructed by the AGS. The AGS was not a party nor was it represented, notwithstanding that an indemnity costs order was sought against it.  
    14    Carruthers AJ recorded that counsel for Mr Wong submitted that the motion represented a challenge to the retainer of the AGS in the proceedings. As his Honour observed, it was more complicated than that because two things were involved which may have become confused. One was the authority to commence the proceedings and the other was the retainer of the AGS. Mr Wong’s counsel relied on the admission of the AGS that it was unable to locate any authority to prosecute Mr Wong in relation to the proceedings analogous to the one dated 25 September 1987 to prosecute the company. 
    15    His Honour noted that the original Statement of Claim filed in June 1989 identified Mr Wong as the sole defendant. It was endorsed by the AGS and nominated the C-G’s address for service as the AGS. It was also verified by a Mr Sams, a customs officer, who deposed that he had knowledge of the facts and believed them to be true. An amended Statement of Claim was filed in March 1990 which joined Rizoli Pty Ltd as a defendant. This and all subsequent pleadings of the C-G were verified by Mr Sams. The defendants admitted that the plaintiff was the C-G at all relevant points of time. His Honour accepted the submission that the earlier authority of 25 September 1987 was not relevant to the proceedings.  
    16    Carruthers AJ said that the structure of the legislation at the time the proceedings were commenced in 1989, and the repeated admissions by the defendants, meant that no question arose of any lack of authority in the C-G to commence the proceedings. He added that neither was there any question as to the retainer of AGS to act in the proceedings. Because of the admissions on the pleadings, the question of power to initiate the proceedings was never an issue. Through the lengthy course of the proceedings, described by his Honour as a ‘tortuous history’, the AGS had acted for the C-G and the same firm of solicitors acted for the defendants. Throughout this period no issue had ever been raised as to retainer. It seems that his Honour may have been saying that there had been a ratification or acquiescence by the defendants. 
    17    His Honour mentioned the factor of delay in the application citing Danish Mercantile Co Ltd v Beaumont (1951) 1 Ch 680 at 687. Carruthers AJ also raised the need to give notice to the plaintiff personally, Forestreet Warehouse Co v Van de Linder (1919) 3 Western Weekly Reports 1056. No notice had been given to the plaintiff. Giving notice to the AGS was not to be treated as notice to the plaintiff. The Notice of Motion was dismissed by his Honour. 
    18    Counsel for the appellants submitted that in the context of an examination of all the documents advanced by the AGS as justifying the institution of proceedings, no authority was ever given to the AGS to bring the current proceedings against Mr Wong. The admission by the defendants conceded nothing regarding the authority to prosecute or the retainer of the AGS. Without an appropriate authority, the AGS was without power to initiate the proceedings against Mr Wong. Nor was there any evidence of ratification by the respondent. In any event, any purported ratification would have been ineffective because the time limit for the prosecutions against Mr Wong expired in 1992. If his Honour was correct in holding that notice had to be given to the respondent personally (and this was disputed) the respondent had notice by reason of counsel’s appearance on his behalf and no more was required. 
    19    On behalf of the respondent, Mr Robberds QC submitted that when the documents tendered on the hearing of the Notice of Motion by the first appellant are examined, it is clear that the proceedings were authorised and the AGS properly retained. The C-G relies on these documents, on the history of the proceedings and the preparation for hearing and hearing. 
    20    All of this, it is contended, demonstrates that the proceedings were authorised and the AGS retained by the respondent. Moreover, the C-G maintains (and the appellants dispute) that the onus of proving the absence of authorisation and retainer is on the appellants and has not been discharged. Alternatively, Mr Robberds submits that the retainer was ratified on 1 July 1998 when counsel appeared for the respondent (instructed by the AGS) and opposed the relief sought. 
    21    Of course, a solicitor’s retainer need not be in writing. It may be implied by conduct. This is one of the questions which arises given the lengthy history of the litigation and the additional documents provided by the AGS and tendered to Carruthers AJ on the motion. 
    22    His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       There has been a constant exchange of correspondence; there has been discovery of documents; there have been interlocutory applications; there has been an application to the Court of Appeal, amendments to the pleadings, innumerable submissions on questions of law, and no issue has been raised as to retainer.  
       
      
      
     and 
      
      
       
       It seems to me inconceivable, in view of the history of this matter, that any real question of the Australian Government Solicitor’s retainer can arise.  
       
      
      
    23    His Honour did not find it necessary to refer to the detail on the additional documents but since they may bear on the retainer, it is useful to examine them. 
    24    The first observation to be made is that the documents give context to the document entitled ‘Authority to Prosecute’ dated 25 September 1987. The documents commence with a minute dated 23 June 1987 attaching a submission for the signature of the Collector of Customs addressed to the C-G for approval to commence proceedings in the Supreme Court against ‘the above parties’, who are described as ‘Rizoli Pty Ltd’ and ‘J and D Wong’. It appears that this document was signed by the Collector on 24 June 1987. It purports to seek the C-G’s general authority to proceed against Rizoli Pty Ltd, John Wong and possibly Diana Wong. 
    25    On 21 July 1987 the Assistant C-G wrote to the Collector about the minute and asked about proceeding against Mrs. Wong. The document noted advice from the AGS referring to evidence of a breach of the Crimes Act. 
    26    In August 1987 officers took this advice on board and on 21 August the Collector wrote to the AGS ‘Re: Prosecution of Rizoli Pty Ltd and J and D Wong’. The letter noted the advice received from AGS of 21 May 1987 and that an authority to proceed in the Supreme Court against the company was being sought from the C-G. The letter also referred to the prosecution brief and indicated that it proposed to proceed against the Wongs under the Crimes Act. 
    27    As a result the C-G signed the ‘Authority to Prosecute’ dated 25 September 1987. This instructed the AGS to initiate proceedings against Rizoli Pty Ltd in the Supreme Court for offences against the Customs Act. This document was forwarded to the AGS on 22 October 1987. 
    28    The evidence does not disclose what happened between then and 1 September 1988. However, on that date the Chief Inspector wrote to the Director Investigation. He referred to the proposed criminal proceedings handled by the DPP. The minute noted that customs prosecutions could be run concurrently with the criminal matters and that the AGS should advise on this. The writer recorded that he had discussed the matter with a Mr Peter Swinton of the AGS, who advised that they would have no objection to reconsidering the evidence and, if sufficient, initiate proceedings. The writer proposed to resubmit the brief to the AGS. The Director Investigation agreed and on 2 September 1988 the Customs Service advised the DPP of its instructions regarding the criminal proceedings, indicating that it proposed to submit the brief to the AGS to consider ‘pecuniary penalty proceedings’ under the Customs Act. The brief was forwarded by the Collector to the AGS on 21 October 1988. The brief included the Record of Interview with Mr Wong of 27 April 1987. 
    29    Criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr Wong and Rizoli Pty Ltd in November 1988. These were dealt with by the District Court in June 1989 and Mr Wong and Rizoli Pty Ltd was each fined $60,000. 
    30    On 19 June 1989 the subject originating process was lodged in the Supreme Court. It was a verified Statement of Claim against one defendant, Mr Wong. The plaintiff was described as Francis Ivor Kelly, the Comptroller-General of Customs. The pleading was under the endorsement of the AGS, which described itself as the ‘Solicitor for the Plaintiff’ and gave its address as the address for service. 
    31    On 2 February 1990 the plaintiff, again per the AGS, sought to join Diane Wong and Rizoli Pty Ltd as additional defendants. The Prothonotary granted leave to amend on 9 March 1990. On 21 May 1990 an Amended Statement of Claim was filed by consent. On 29 August 1990 a Further Amended Statement of Claim was filed with the consent of the defendants. By this time the plaintiff had discontinued against Mrs Wong. The date of this pleading is unclear since one document refers to it as 4 September 1990 and this may be the more correct date. 
    32    It seems that the remaining defendants (the present appellants) pleaded to the Statement of Claim in May 1991. Thereafter it is unclear what happened to the litigation until early 1997. Apparently, it had been fixed for hearing to commence on 1 September 1997 but counsel for the defendants was unavailable and a new date was allocated for hearing commencing on 9 March 1998. 
    33    However, a few days beforehand the defendants sought an order that the plaintiff’s pleading be struck out. This lead to the first judgment of Carruthers AJ on 10 March 1998 wherein his Honour noted that further and better particulars had been sought and supplied in 1990. His Honour’s judgment also noted that all relevant documents had been served by the plaintiff on the defendants. His Honour took the view that the proceedings should not be struck out and the trial proceeded. 
    34    On 29 April 1998 his Honour gave an interlocutory judgment on admissibility of evidence. I need make no further reference to this on the issue of retainer except to observe that it is apparent that the AGS was purporting to act for the C-G in the proceedings and had frequent contact with the defendants’ solicitors, especially in the period leading to the hearing. 
    35    It seems that his Honour continued to hear the trial until 8 May 1998, when he reserved judgment. The next matter which occurred was the AGS letter to the defendants’ solicitors of 4 June 1998, referred to earlier, which enclosed the ‘Authority to Prosecute’. This in turn lead to the Notice of Motion by Mr Wong which sought that the proceedings against him be struck out or stayed on the basis that the AGS was not retained by the plaintiff in the proceedings. As I have recorded, costs were sought against the AGS. His Honour’s decision on the Notice of Motion was given on 1 July 1998. The final judgment was delivered on 10 July 1998. 
    36    ‘Retainer’ is a word used to describe a contract between a solicitor and client for the provision of legal services for a fee. As mentioned, it is not required to be in writing, and may be implied from conduct. Here the course of dealings over nine years makes it plain beyond argument that the AGS was retained by the C-G to institute and conduct the proceedings against the appellants in the Supreme Court. No question of ratification arises.  
    37    Nor is the ‘Authority to Prosecute’ of 25 September 1987 of any real relevance. It probably became stale when the proceedings were originally instituted against Mr Wong rather than Rizoli Pty Ltd, the entity named in the document. However, in my view it matters not. I do not see it as necessary to discuss the cases raised in argument on the question of who carries the onus of proving retainer. The course of dealings relied on by Carruthers AJ and the documents discussed above, make it more than abundantly clear that the AGS was retained by the respondent in the proceedings from their institution, indeed prior thereto. No question of authority to institute the proceedings arises, given the finding on retainer, since the C-G needed no authority under the Act to institute the proceedings in his own name. 
     
      
     Ownership of the secreted goods (grounds 14 to 23) 
      
    38    Grounds of appeal 14 to 23 cover the issue of who was the legal owner of the secreted goods. It is contended that the trial judge erred in finding that Rizoli Pty Ltd held itself out to be the owner of the goods. It is submitted that his Honour should have found that the respondent had failed to prove that Rizoli Pty Ltd had authorised a customs agent, Renown Customs, to enter imported goods on its behalf or appointed Renown as its agent. It is argued that the House of Teak Furniture Pty Ltd should have been found to be the owner of the goods. His Honour should have had regard only to the consignment note and bill of lading as determinative of ownership of the goods. Put simply, Mr Graham submits that the respondent prosecuted the wrong defendant. Alternatively, Rizoli Pty Ltd had only held itself out as owner of the furniture and not the secreted goods. 
    39    In my opinion, none of the above contentions of the appellant Rizoli Pty Ltd should be accepted. Evidence was given by Patrick Louie, the managing director of Renown Customs Pty Ltd, a licenced customs broker under the Act. Mr Louie said that in 1982 Mr Wong told him that he had established a new company, Rizoli Pty Ltd. He told Mr Louie that he had started importing goods, mostly furniture, and would like him to act as customs broker to clear his imports. 
    40    According to the evidence of Mr Louie, the first appellant asked him to enter the name of the second appellant, Rizoli Pty Ltd, in the customs documents as owner of the goods.  
    41    Mr Louie said that after the initial conversation with Mr Wong, he personally received shipping documents from Mr Wong on a number of occasions - invoices, bills of lading etc. and was asked by him to clear the shipments. In accordance with his instructions, the customs entry document for each of the shipments in question nominated the owner as Rizoli Pty Ltd. 
    42    Mr Wong never asked Mr Louie to change the name shown as owner on the entry documents and Rizoli Pty Ltd was the only company ever mentioned to him by Mr Wong. After each shipment had been cleared, Mr Louie said that he issued an invoice to the first or second appellant for Renown’s fees and was paid by cheque.43    It was suggested that Mr Louie’s evidence was equivocal. I do not think so. Reading it as a whole and fairly, it clearly established that Mr Wong asked Mr Louie to enter the name of Rizoli Pty Ltd as owner of the goods in the customs entry documents. 
    44    The first appellant, and his wife, were the directors of Rizoli Pty Ltd. There was ample evidence that Mr Wong was the directing mind and will of Rizoli Pty Ltd. Mr Wong made the arrangements from Australia for the clothes to be secreted in the containers shipped from Hong Kong to Port Botany. As I have said, it was Mr Wong’s instruction to Mr Louie to enter Rizoli Pty Ltd as the owner in the customs documents. In my view, that constitutes some evidence that the second appellant was the owner of the secreted goods within the meaning in the Act. 
    45    The smuggling of the secreted goods under s 233(1)(a) of the Act was effected by the delivery to customs of the entry document which showed Rizoli Pty Ltd as owner and which falsely described the contents of the container. The same may be said in relation to the charge under s 234(1)(a) of evasion of duty and in relation to the making of a statement false in a material particular under s 234(1)(d) of the Act. 
    46    When the evidence of Mr Louie is read in the context of the very wide definition of ‘owner’ in s 4 of the Act - which includes any person holding himself out to be the owner or importer or person having any control or power over the goods - it is clear that the evidence of ‘ownership’ of the secreted goods was sufficient for his Honour to make the finding that he did. The finding was well open to his Honour. It matters not that the invoice and bill of lading were in favour of the House of Teak Furniture Pty Ltd. On one basis it may be said that this only dealt with the furniture and not the secreted goods. But the facts disclose, along with the definition of ‘owner’ in the Act, that the second appellant was the importer or held itself out to be the owner. It matters not that it may not have been the ‘true’ owner and the bill of lading etc. may be seen to be irrelevant. The combination of the definition of ‘owner’ in s 4 read together with ss 36(1) and 153 of the Act lead to the conclusion that the submission of the second appellant should be rejected. 
    47    There is a further argument made that the customs entry document to the effect that the company was the owner of the furniture declared to be in the container could not extend to the secreted clothing. However, Carruthers AJ was right to conclude that the documents effectively asserted that Rizoli Pty Ltd was the owner of all of the contents of the container knowing that it included the secreted goods. 
     
      
     Production of documents under s 214 (grounds 3 and 4) 
      
    48    On behalf of the appellants it is contended that the documents produced by Mr Wong to officer Davies on 27 April 1987 were illegally obtained. It is submitted that the Notice given under s 214(1) of the Act, upon which the documents were produced, was defective because it required production to Mr Davies whereas the section only permitted production to the Collector. 
    49    The ruling in relation to the admission of the documents into evidence was made by Carruthers AJ on 29 April 1998. 
    50    Given that s 8(1)(a)(ii) of the Act provides that a reference to the Collector should be construed as a reference to ‘any officer doing duty in the matter to which the expression is used’, the submission is a bold one. 
    51    The Collector signed the s 214 Notice and officer Davies was doing his duty in the matter. Accordingly, he was deemed to be the Collector for the purposes of s 214(1). Such a construction would promote the object or purpose underlying the legislation and is to be preferred to the appellant’s submission, which does not. 
    52    Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address the argument based on s 138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
     Failure to strike out averments (grounds 1 and 2) 
      
    53    The appellants submit that his Honour erred in failing to strike out certain averments contained in the Further Amended Statement of Claim. It is contended that the averments, specified in the written submissions of Mr Graham, were not averments of fact but evidence and were impermissible. His Honour dismissed a motion to strike out the averments on 29 April 1998. His Honour was not persuaded that the averments were pure law, as opposed to mixed questions of fact and law, nor were they averments of evidence or intent contrary to s 255(4) of the Act. In any event, when he came to make the ruling, his Honour indicated that the respondent had established a prima facie case without reliance upon the averments. 
    54    His Honour deliberately deferred ruling on the application until he was satisfied that there was no prejudice to the appellants and the respondent indicated that it would establish his case from direct evidence. In these events, it is difficult to see how the submission can succeed. Assuming that some of the averments were impermissible, and I do not so find, there was no harm done in not striking them out.  
    55    Since his Honour found a prima facie case without reliance on any of the averments, there was no prejudice apparent to the appellants. 
    56    I would dismiss this portion of the appellants’ appeal. 
     
      
     Are Customs’ prosecutions criminal proceedings? (grounds 8 and 9) 
      
    57    The appellants contend that the proceedings were criminal proceedings for the purposes of the Evidence Act and his Honour was in error in not so concluding. The effect of this submission, if upheld, is that the records of interview with Mr Wong made on 27 April 1987 ought not to have been admitted because of the operation of s 86 of the Evidence Act. 
    58    The Dictionary to the Evidence Act defines ‘criminal proceeding’ to mean ‘a prosecution for an offence’. The respondent argues that the proceedings are not a prosecution for an offence but proceedings for the recovery of a civil penalty. This latter type of proceeding is expressly recognised in a number of provisions in the Evidence Act in contradistinction to the commission of an offence, see eg. ss 125(1)(a), 130(4)(d) and 131(2)(j). 
    59    Whether customs prosecutions are criminal or civil has been a vexed question for the courts. The preponderance of authority is that they are proceedings of a civil nature. Carruthers AJ so found in his ruling on 29 April 1998. 
    60    In Evans v Button (1988) 13 NSWLR 57 the court held that the purpose of s 247 of the Customs Act was to assimilate customs prosecutions to proceedings of a civil nature. The section provides: 
     
      
       
       Every Customs prosecution in a court referred to in sub-section 245(1) may be commenced prosecuted and proceeded with in accordance with any rules of practice (if any) established by the Court or Crown suits in venue matters or in accordance with the usual practice and procedure of the Court in civil cases … 
       
      
      
       
      
    61    Mahoney JA, with whom Priestley and McHugh JJA agreed said: 
     
      
       
       It was, in my opinion, the purpose of that provision relevantly to assimilate customs prosecutions to proceedings of a civil nature: cf  
       State v Judge Fawsitt  
       [1945] IR 183 at 193 and  
       R v Justices of the Appeals Committee of the Country of London Quarter Sessions  
       (at 184). It was, in my opinion, the legislative purpose that Customs prosecutions, when brought in the Supreme Court, should be subject, inter alia, to the powers of amendment appropriate to such proceedings. [at 74] 
       
      
      
       
      
    62    I agree with Carruthers AJ that Jack Brabham Holdings v Minister (1998) 85 ALR 640 did not disturb the authority of Evans v Button, which has been applied on a number of occasions. See Kelly v JRA Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 651 and Comptroller-General of Customs v Kingswood Distillery Pty Ltd (Sully J, unreported, NSW Supreme Court, 11 February 1997). In addition, the judgment of Byrne J in Comptroller-General of Customs v Jayakody (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, 9 November 1993) and Pearce v Button (1985) 8 FCR 388 (Pincus J) are also very helpful. 
    63    Notwithstanding the passage of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) Evans v Button is still good law. If there be any inconsistency, and I am unpersuaded that there is, the Federal statute prevails and the Evidence Act needs to be read so as to accommodate any inconsistency. This follows from the provision in s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). 
    64    In my opinion, Carruthers AJ was right to treat the proceedings before him as civil and not criminal proceedings and apply the standard of proof in Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336. 
    65    It follows, and I understand Mr Graham to so concede, that grounds 12 and 13 also fail. 
    66    The appeals should be dismissed with costs.

     REGINA v JUSTIN MATTHEW CHILD 
      
     REGINA v PAUL CHARLES MORRISON CHILD 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     1   JAMES J: Paul Child and his son Justin Child have applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on them. 
     
      
    2   After a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Job and a jury, Paul Child was found guilty of three counts of fraudulent misappropriation, that is offences under s 178A of the Crimes Act, and one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    3   On each count of fraudulent misappropriation, Judge Job sentenced Paul Child to a sentence of penal servitude for five years four months, consisting of a minimum term of four years to date from 30 April 1998, which was the date of sentencing, and an additional term of one year four months, the sentences to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    4   On the charge of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, Paul Child was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 30 April 1998. 
     
      
    5   At the same trial Justin Child was found guilty of three counts of aiding and abetting the fraudulent misappropriations by his father. On each count he was sentenced to a sentence of penal servitude for three years four months, consisting of a minimum term of two and a half years to date from 30 April 1998, the date on which he was sentenced, and an additional term of ten months. 
     
      
    6   The maximum penalty for fraudulent misappropriation and for aiding and abetting fraudulent misappropriation is penal servitude for seven years. The maximum penalty for obtaining a financial advantage by deception is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    7   Each of the applicants was legally represented at the trial. However, each applicant has appeared in person on these applications for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    8   The facts of the offences were stated by the sentencing Judge in his remarks on sentence and the following is a brief summary of what his Honour said: 
     
      
    9   The applicant, Paul Child, was a superannuation consultant and was the director of a company called Directors Dividends, which carried on the business of assisting clients to set up self-managed superannuation funds. The company Directors Dividends failed, owing a large sum of money. Paul Child was made bankrupt. As a bankrupt he was disqualified from acting as a director of any company. 
     
      
    10   Two companies, International Fund Managers, to which I will refer as ""IFM"", and Self Managed Superannuation, to which I will refer as ""SMS"", were set up. 
     
      
    11   Paul Child's two sons, the applicant Justin Child and his other son Adam Child, became the directors of the companies. At the time they became directors Justin was only 21 years old and Adam was only 20 years old. Neither of them had had any real business experience. At the trial Paul Child claimed that, although he had acted as a consultant, he had taken no part in the running of the two companies. 
     
      
    12   The three counts of fraudulent misappropriation by Paul Child and the three counts of aiding and abetting fraudulent misappropriation committed by Justin Child were based on similar events. In each case moneys were paid by a client of IFM or SMS. These moneys, instead of being paid into a special account, were paid into a general bank account of IFM or SMS and were then disbursed in various ways, otherwise than in accordance with the terms on which they had been received. 
     
      
    13   In the first case a company Thermaline Scientific Equipment caused two cheques totalling $210,655.33 to be sent to IFM. Instead of the cheques being deposited into two bank accounts which had been opened specifically to receive the cheques, Justin Child deposited the cheques into the general account of IFM. After a representative of IFM had made inquiries about what had happened to the cheques, Paul Child, after initially denying that the cheques had been received, admitted that the cheques had been wrongly paid into the account of IFM. 
     
      
    14   Arrangements were entered into to repay Thermaline. $132,587 was repaid by the applicants. The balance of $78,068.33 was repaid by the bank at which the IFM account was conducted, the bank acknowledging that the cheques from Thermaline should not have been credited to IFM's account. 
     
      
    15   In the second case a company Master Ceilings Pty Ltd caused a cheque for $152,079.65 to be sent to SMS for the purposes of a superannuation fund. The cheque was paid into a general account of SMS. At the time the cheque was deposited, the balance of the account of SMS was only $14. An amount of $20,000 was ultimately repaid to Master Ceilings Pty Ltd, leaving an amount of $132,079.65 outstanding. 
     
      
    16   In the third case, 18 cheques totalling $463,228.47 payable to a Combined Trade Unions Retirement Fund were paid into the bank account of SMS. 
     
      
    17   In the case of the charge of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, Paul Child had advised a doctor about the rolling over of the doctor's existing superannuation fund. The sum of $80,328.48 was paid to SMS for the purposes of the roll over. 
     
      
    18   The total effect of the various transactions was summarised by Judge Job as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The total amounts of money received by IFM and SMS subject to the charges was $906,291. Moneys repaid by the prisoners amounted to $152,587. The balance, if there is a balance, of $753,704 banks had refunded $541,296 due to the fact that they had wrongly allowed cheques to be deposited into the IFM and SMS accounts. However, the loss to the banks and to the clients of the companies amounted to over three-quarters of a million dollars."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    19   The sentencing Judge devoted part of his remarks on sentence to making findings about how the moneys paid into the bank accounts of IFM and SMS had been applied. Large amounts had been paid out of the SMS account to other superannuation funds and his Honour concluded that those payments had been made because previously amounts belonging to those superannuation funds had been wrongly paid into SMS's account and had been spent. 
     
      
    20   At least $92,487 had directly or ultimately been received from SMS by a company called Esperanza Lodge Pty Ltd. Paul Child gave evidence at the trial that Esperanza Lodge Pty Ltd was a discretionary trust of which he was not a beneficiary and that Esperanza Lodge did not trade in any way. He gave evidence that he could not explain why Esperanza Lodge had received money from SMS. He said that he had not been involved in those transactions. An investigation of the affairs of Esperanza Lodge disclosed that substantial moneys had been paid by Esperanza Lodge out of moneys received from SMS for the purchase, upkeep, training, transport and agistment of show horses. 
     
      
    21   It was the Crown case at the trial that, although Justin Child was a director of IFM and SMS and did all the banking for the companies, it was Paul Child who had controlled the activities of both companies. 
     
      
    22   As I have already indicated, Paul Child gave evidence at the trial that, although he had acted as a consultant to both companies and had given advice to clients of both companies, he had taken no part in the administration of the affairs of the companies, that being left entirely to Justin Child. Paul Child claimed that he was unaware that Justin Child had deposited clients’ funds in the bank accounts of IFM and SMS or how the moneys deposited in those accounts had been spent. 
     
      
    23   At the trial, Justin Child gave evidence supporting his father's version, to the effect that after he had become a director of the companies he had been responsible for carrying on the affairs of the companies. He said that he had done all the banking and had written all the cheques. He was unable to account for where the money had gone. 
     
      
    24   Paul Child maintained the position he had taken at the trial when he was interviewed by a probation officer for the purposes of a pre-sentence report. The sentencing Judge quoted extensively from the pre-sentence report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Child absolves himself from any involvement in the offences, maintaining he ‘withdrew’ after being declared bankrupt and spent two years staying at home, working on his computer. He claims he did not wish to get involved at all with the company his son was operating. On the occasions when he did act as a consultant to prospective clients, he maintains he did so reluctantly. Mr Child is adamant he had no involvement in the clerical/administrative affairs of the company. 
        
       
       
        
        When discussing the impact on the victims, Mr Child indicated that he believed all the people involved had been reimbursed by the appropriate financial institutions, aside from Dr Rodgers. As a result, he minimised the anguish the victims had suffered. 
        
       
       
        
        Assessment and Sentencing Alternatives: 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Child portrays himself as a benevolent individual with strong Christian values, whose long-term goal is to establish a Ministry where people can access support and respite. It is difficult to correlate Mr Child’s offending behaviour with his stated personal values. Whilst the offender tends to place particular emphasis on his medical condition and related emotional difficulties as mitigating factors in his offences, this Service finds it difficult to accept. 
        
       
       
        
        Through the establishment of his Ministry, Mr Child is actively seeking donations, bequests and gifts of materials, provisions or equipment, which illustrates the offender’s lack of insight into the community’s perception of his offences”. 
        
       
      
     25   It is obvious from the jury's verdicts of guilty that the jury did not accept, and it is obvious from the sentences Judge's remarks on sentence that the sentencing Judge did not accept, the evidence given by Paul Child at the trial that he had taken no part in administering the affairs of IFM and SMS and that he did not know that the clients' funds had been deposited in the companies' accounts or how those funds had been spent. The sentencing Judge concluded that Paul Child was the dominant party in the commission of the fraudulent conduct. 
     
      
    26   A factor of some importance in the sentencing of both applicants was that each suffered from an hereditary brain condition known as multiple cavernous haemangioma. Justin Child also suffered from frontal lobe damage resulting from brain surgery he had undergone when he was 15 years old. 
     
      
    27   A consultant psychiatrist, Dr Bennett, had provided a report about Paul Child, part of which was quoted in the sentencing Judge's remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Child has multiple cavernous haemangiomata in his brain and these have been associated with a life long anxiety and mood disorder. He became increasingly dysfunctional and eroded by the interaction of these with life circumstances in the 1980’s and 90’s, ending up with a major depression and panic disorder. These contributing majorly to business failure and a failure to supervise, assist his also damaged son Justin, who has a frontal lobe syndrome, in running the business when Justin tried to help. Like Justin he must be regarded as impaired, not criminal, e.g. his role in the business failure and mess. Afterwards the use of appropriate medication in adequate doses as well as the major change in life style to a quiet rural spiritual one has resulted in essential remission control of his disorders, that he has always the Sword of Damocles hanging over him as his haemangiomata could haemorrhage and cause death or major cerebral disability”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    28   Dr Bennett had also provided a report about Justin Child, part of which was quoted by the sentencing Judge in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly, Justin Child has had frontal lobe damage (as well as other areas of damage) since the age of 15 years and this has marred his development and personality with consequent multiple defects in behaviour, state and cognition and compensatory/adaptive attempts to cope/function despite these. The nature of his impairments and personality were such as to make inevitable the disaster he made of his role as director etc. when he tried to assist in the family business owing to his father’s decline and Depression. In my view, it is impossible to exclude his impairments as major causal factors in the business issues that have led to charges of fraud etc. It is unfortunate that neither he nor his family had a proper knowledge or understanding of his impairment and that he can present so well on the surface to others. Thus, I found him adroit at one liners and this can give a false impression of his total intellectual function. Many times in my professional career of 35 years I’ve met superficially impressive/not unimpressive persons with frontal lobe damage/impairment who turn out disappointing in all their proposed changes in self, new starts, enterprises, relationships etc. basically owing to the lack of being able to sustain long-term stable behaviour, sequences of tasks/following through a (planned) course of action, living in a way that shows more than the superficial verbal insight expressed into the implications and consequences of their actions: full of apparent promise, scarce on delivery. There is more depth in Justin Child than many and he has improved even in the 8 months of my knowledge of him but he will have to live within the severe limitations his brain damage means”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      With respect to Dr Bennett's reports, Judge Job said: 
       
        
        ""I accept that Justin Child has suffered significant brain damage. However, I am sure that had Dr Bennett sat through the evidence given by both the prisoners at their trial, his opinion as to their responsibility for their actions would have been greatly modified."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29   As regards the other subjective circumstances of the applicants, the sentencing Judge noted that Paul Child was 49 years old at the time of sentencing, that Justin Child was 28 years old at the time of sentencing and that both applicants had no previous criminal convictions. His Honour found that Paul Child had not demonstrated any contrition. 
     
      
    30   His Honour decided to impose lesser sentences on Justin Child than on his father, because of his conclusion that Paul Child was the dominant party in the commission of the frauds and because of the significant brain damage which Justin Child had. 
     
      
    31   As I have already stated, each applicant appeared in person on the hearing of these applications. Each applicant referred to his medical condition. Each applicant informed the Court that since he had been imprisoned, he had gained greater insight into his conduct and now felt contrition for what he had done. Each applicant referred to various misfortunes which had befallen the family since the two applicants were sentenced. Each applicant also referred to a number of courses which each applicant has successfully completed while in custody. The courses have been courses in such subjects as computer studies, horticulture and, in the case of Justin Child, music. 
     
      
    32   The applications to this Court for leave to appeal against sentence cannot be upheld, unless some error in the sentencing process engaged in by Judge Job can be demonstrated. In general, in order to determine whether a sentencing Judge has erred, it is not legitimate to refer to events occurring after the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    33   In the present case the sentencing Judge was very conscious of the unusual medical condition from which both of the applicants suffered and referred to that medical condition at length in his remarks on sentence. As I have already indicated, his Honour incorporated into his remarks on sentence lengthy extracts from the reports by Dr Bennett. 
     
      
    34   Although it is commendable that each of the applicants has obtained greater insight into his conduct and that each of the applicants has undertaken a number of courses of study while in custody, I am unable to see how any of these matters can show any error by Judge Job in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    35   I have already referred to the objective facts of the offences and to the subjective circumstances of the applicants. 
     
      
    36   In my opinion, no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing decisions made by Judge Job and the sentences cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive. I would propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted to each applicant but that the appeals against sentence be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      SPERLING J: I agree. 
       
       
      JAMES J: The order of the Court will be as proposed by me.

     WEDNESDAY 8 DECEMBER 1999 
      
     
     REGINA v HEINZ GEORGE WEGENER 
      
     
     JUDGMENT 
     1   JAMES J: Heinz George Wegener has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Flannery on 10 May 1999, after the applicant had pleaded guilty to one charge of supplying cannabis leaf. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing from 21 May 1999. 
     
      
    2   The facts of the offence were stated by Judge Flannery in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The short facts are that about 5.50pm on 28 January 1998 at Kingsford Smith Domestic Airport the prisoner Mr Wegener was at that place and the drug detection dogs reacted to a suit carrier as containing illegal narcotics. The carrier had been booked under the flight from Adelaide to Sydney by Mr Wegener. The carrier was placed on to the conveyor belt and went on to the baggage carousel. Mr Wegener removed the carrier from the carousel. He was carrying a black coloured briefcase. 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the Australian Federal Police approached him and he was conveyed to the baggage office. He conceded that the suit carrier contained cannabis and that the briefcase also contained cannabis. From inspection of both the carrier and the briefcase 17 parcels of what turned out to be cannabis leaf were located, weighing an estimated 7.5 kilograms. The estimated street value being $75,000”. 
        
       
        
       
      
    3   In short, the applicant, for a promised reward of $1,700, acted as courier of seven and a half kilograms of cannabis leaf on a flight from Adelaide to Sydney. 
     
      
    4   The quantity of cannabis leaf, 7.5 kilograms, was greater than the trafficable quantity for cannabis leaf, which is 300 grams, but less than the commercial quantity, which is 25 kilograms. The supply alleged by the Crown was a deemed supply under section 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Under section 32 of that Act, the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of supplying a quantity of cannabis leaf which is less than the commercial quantity is ten years. 
     
      
    5   In his remarks on sentence Judge Flannery noted the most outstanding subjective characteristics of the applicant. The applicant was 47 years old at the time of sentencing. He had no previous convictions. He had a wife and two children and resided in Adelaide. He had spent two weeks in custody before being granted bail. He had pleaded guilty to the offence. 
     
      
    6   His Honour found that the applicant had suffered an emotional breakdown at the beginning of 1998. His father had died, his wife was ill and his wife's father was ill and his daughter had been injured in traffic accidents. He had entrusted money to a man who had defrauded him of $200,000. 
     
      
    7   His Honour found that the evidence of the good character of the applicant was compelling. References favourable to the applicant had been provided by a member of the clergy, by members of Rotary and by other business people. 
     
      
    8   In the proceedings on sentence the applicant gave evidence that he was involved in a business venture in the Pacific, which required him to make periodical journeys to Vanuatu. 
     
      
    9   Near the conclusion of his remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have come to the view that everything piled up on the prisoner about this time, that this offence was committed. Illness and death in the family, the financial loss through a man in whom he trusted his investments and that he foolishly, very foolishly, undertook the task which involves him being charged here. And it is for those reasons that I have imposed the sentence that I have”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    10   In written submissions lodged on behalf of the applicant it was not submitted that the sentence imposed by Judge Flannery was outside the range of sentences within a sound exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. The argument which was advanced on behalf of the applicant was based on something said by his Honour in court on 10 May 1999, shortly before he delivered his formal remarks on sentence. His Honour is recorded as saying that he proposed imposing a sentence of periodic detention for three years. His Honour is then recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “I know what Mr Laffan (the Crown’s legal representative) may be thinking, that I shouldn’t give that much, perhaps because if I was giving him full time imprisonment it wouldn’t be that much. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        ..but as I said the other day it’s been mine (ie my experience) that some people would prefer to serve a full time sentence of a shorter period. He does realise that, if he does breach it, that he runs the risk of serving the balance unserved in full time. Did you explain that to him?” 
        
       
      
    11   Mr Rumore, the applicant's legal representative in the proceedings on sentence, replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have indeed your Honour and I will reinforce that if your Honour wishes by just outlining it to him once again very briefly. But that is of course the benefit that he seeks your Honour as an alternative to a full time custodial sentence, even though that’s a lengthy period your Honour has in mind. Certainly, if he was to be incarcerated on a full time basis he wouldn’t have the opportunity to see his family at all. He wouldn’t have the opportunity to conduct any business or to try and finalise his affairs at all. So it’s in that respect that even though it’s a lengthy period your Honour has in mind, if not indeed the maximum period of periodic detention, that at least he could conduct some affairs and have some ongoing contact with his family, who would otherwise not be able to visit him”. 
        
       
      
    12   There may be a question whether it is legitimate to refer to what was said in argument by way of supplementing or interpreting a sentencing judge’s formal remarks on sentence. However, it has frequently happened in this Court that resort has been had to parts of the record of the proceedings on sentence to explain or supplement a sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence, which are often fairly brief. 
     
      
    13   It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that by what the sentencing Judge had said on 10 May, the sentencing Judge had made it clear that, if he had been sentencing the applicant to full-time imprisonment, he would have sentenced the applicant to a shorter term of imprisonment than three years. It was submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In adjusting the sentence upwards from that which he would have passed, had his Honour imposed a sentence of full-time imprisonment, his Honour fell into error."" 
        
       
      
    14   It was submitted that his Honour should first have determined what would be the appropriate term of imprisonment and only then should he have decided whether the term of imprisonment should be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    15   Even if it is not legitimate to refer to what his Honour said in the proceedings on sentence, I consider that it is abundantly clear, having regard to the objective and the subjective circumstances of the offence and the range of the sentences usually imposed for this kind of offence, that his Honour did not intend to impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment for as long as three years. 
     
      
    16   If the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Act had not been amended by the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Amendment Act No 43 of 1998, I would have rejected the submissions made by counsel for the applicant. See, for example, the decisions of this Court in R v Sadebath (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 May 1992), and R v Bang (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 September 1992). 
     
      
    17   In R v Sadebath Allen J, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, said at pp7-8:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless it (periodic detention) is severe punishment. Insofar as the severity of the hardship caused by it during the time it is being served is less than it is in the case of a full-time custodial sentence, that disparity can be dealt with by increasing the length of the periodic sentence. It is not as if one cannot, by adjusting the length of the term to be served by way of periodic detention, end up with a sentence every bit as onerous for the recipient of it than if he had received a substantially shorter sentence of full-time custody”. 
        
       
      
    18   In R v Bang Badgery-Parker J said at pp17-18 (the other members 
     
      
      of the Court delivered separate judgments but would not appear to have disagreed with Badgery-Parker J on this point): 
       
       
        
        “A literal interpretation of the provisions of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981, might be thought to require a sentencing judge to engage upon a two stage process: first, to determine the appropriate sentence of imprisonment, and then, having reached a conclusion about that, to undertake examination of the question whether in the circumstances of the particular case that sentence ought be served by way of periodic detention. Indeed, I think it is correct to say that that approach was regularly adopted by judges of the District Court and of the Supreme Court over a period of years without criticism from the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, there were also occasions when, equally without criticism by this court, sentencing judges refused to avail themselves of the option of periodic detention, first because as the law used to stand that option was only available in respect of a sentence not exceeding 18 months, and secondly because of a recognition of the element of leniency obviously involved in an order that a sentence be served by way of periodic detention. The combination of those two circumstances often produced a situation where a judge was compelled to take the view that the resulting sentence would be manifestly inadequate. The adoption of such a view involved some blurring of the two stage approach. 
        
       
       
        
        However, the two stage approach has now been held by this court to be invalid:  
        Duroux 
         (CCA, unreported 11 April 1991),  
        Pangallo 
         (CCA, unreported 13 August 1991). In each case the leading judgment was delivered by Lee CJ at CL, in  
        Duroux  
        with the concurrence of Mathews and Sharpe JJ and in 
         Pangallo 
         with the concurrence of McInerney and Sharpe, JJ”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    19   However, the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Act was amended by the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Amendment Act No 43 of 1998, which commenced on 1 February 1999 and which would accordingly have applied to the sentence passed by his Honour. By the Amendment Act, section 5 of the principal Act was very substantially amended. Section 5 as amended now provides in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “5(1) This section applies to a person on whom a court has imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) A fixed term of imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a minimum and an additional term that do not in the aggregate exceed 3 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (1A) A court that has sentenced a person to whom this section applies may by order direct that the minimum term of the sentence concerned (or, in the case of a fixed term sentence, the whole of the fixed term) be served by way of periodic detention. 
        
       
       
        
        (1B) Such an order may not be made unless the court is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that it is appropriate in the circumstances of the case that the person serve the sentence by way of periodic detention….”  
        
       
       
      
    20   These amendments to section 5 of the principal Act were made by clauses 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 to the Amendment Act. The effect of the amendments made by schedule 1 (3) and (4) was stated in the explanatory note to the bill which became the Amendment Act as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “Schedule 1[3] and [4] amend section 5 so as to replace existing subsection (1) with new subsections (1), (1A) and (1B) and to add a new subsection (7). The effect of the amendments are: 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        (b) to remove any doubt as to the requirement for a court to have sentenced a person before it considers whether or not to make a PDO (a periodic detention order) in respect of the person, and to ensure that such a sentence will be either a fixed term of imprisonment or a minimum and an additional term of imprisonment…” 
        
       
       
      
    21   In his second reading speech on the bill which became the Amendment Act the Minister said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
         “The bill makes it plain that those who abuse the relative leniency of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention face full-time imprisonment. The periodic detention scheme was originally introduced to be a real alternative to full-time imprisonment. This intention is currently reflected in section 5(1) of the Act, which provides that when a person is convicted of an offence and sentenced upon that conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than three months and not more than three years, the court may order that the person’s sentence be served by way of periodic detention.  
        
       
       
        
        The intention of section 5(1) is that the sentence of imprisonment should be determined first, and only then should consideration be given to whether the person serves the sentence in full-time imprisonment or by way of periodic detention. Despite the wording of section 5(1), interpretation of the section by the courts has been variable, thereby reducing the diversionary effect of periodic detention. The bill repeals section 5(1) and inserts new sections, including new section 5(1A), which requires a court to set a fixed term or a minimum and an additional term before making a periodic detention order. Offenders sentenced to periodic detention will therefore be in no doubt, from the outset, as to the term they face in full-time custody if they fail to attend periodic detention”. 
        
       
      
    22   Having regard to the terms of the Amendment Act and to the purposes of the Amendment Act as stated in the explanatory note and in the Minister's second reading speech, I consider that the decisions of this Court in such cases as R v Sadebath and R v Bang are no longer applicable. So much was conceded by counsel for the Crown on this application. 
     
      
    23   As a result of the amendments to the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Act, it is only after a sentencing Judge has imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising a fixed term of imprisonment not exceeding three years or a minimum term and an additional term that do not in the aggregate exceed three years, that the sentencing Judge can then give consideration to whether he or she should order that the minimum term of the sentence imposed or, in the case of a fixed term, the whole of the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    24   The provisions of the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Amendment Act No. 43 of 1998 were not drawn to the attention of Judge Flannery in the proceedings on sentence. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that “Mr Wegener is convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention”. His Honour clearly did not impose a sentence comprising a minimum term and an additional term. I have already stated my conclusion that it is clear that his Honour did not intend to impose a fixed term of imprisonment of three years. It was ultimately accepted by the Crown on the hearing of this application that his Honour had not complied with the requirements of section 5(1) of the Act as amended. 
     
      
    25   It follows that in the present case, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal against sentence should be allowed. 
     
      
    26   The question then arises whether this Court should proceed to re-sentence the applicant or whether the proceedings should be remitted to Judge Flannery to re-sentence the applicant in the light of this judgment. 
     
      
    27   Counsel for the applicant submitted that the matter should be remitted to Judge Flannery. I consider that this would be an appropriate course. As I have already said, his Honour sentenced the applicant on 10 May 1999, without the provisions of the Amendment Act having been drawn to his attention. We have been informed by counsel for the applicant that he would wish to adduce further evidence in the re-sentencing of the applicant but that that further evidence is not available to-day. 
     
      
    28   I would propose that leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Flannery on 10 May 1999 be granted; that the appeal against that sentence be allowed; that the sentence imposed by Judge Flannery be quashed and that the matter be remitted to Judge Flannery for re-sentencing in accordance with this judgment and, insofar as periodic detention may be involved, in accordance with the provisions of the Periodic Detention Of Prisoners Act as amended and particularly section 5. I am not to be taken as expressing a view one way or the other as to whether the sentence to be imposed by his Honour on a re-sentencing should be a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    29   SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by James J.  
     
      
    30   It does not seem to me to be necessary to refer to what was said in the course of argument before the sentencing judge commenced his remarks on sentence. For the reasons otherwise given by James J, it is clear that the condition precedent for an order for periodic detention - the imposition of a sentence for a fixed term or for a minimum and an additional term - was not fulfilled in this case, and the sentence which was imposed must therefore be set aside. 
     
      
    31   I add the following observations. The statute, as amended, now requires that the court impose a sentence in the ordinary way before consideration can be given to whether the sentence should be served by periodic detention. That leads to a difficulty in implementing the statute as amended. Periodic detention is substantially more lenient than full time custody for the same period. That is self-evident. Full time custody is custody for seven days a week continuously. Periodic detention is custody for two days a week periodically (which converts to community service after one third of the term has passed). The difference has been recognised in the authorities cited by James J in this case. It was also recognised by the sentencing judge when he said in the course of argument that he was imposing a longer sentence than he would otherwise have fixed because it was to be served by periodic detention. 
     
      
    32   It follows that, speaking generally, a term of imprisonment which is appropriate if served by full time custody would be much too lenient to be appropriate if served by periodic detention. There may be cases where that would not be so but they would be exceptional. In the result, I do not see how a court could, in the ordinary case, conscientiously make an order for periodic detention in relation to a sentence imposed in the usual way. Yet that is what the statute now contemplates will happen. The statute, as amended, seems to me to be unworkable. 
     
      
    33   I would propose a scheme along the following lines: 
     
      
       
      (1) The court to determine an appropriate term to be served by periodic detention (x). 
       
       
      (2) In the event of serious and repeated breach, the offender to serve a period of full time custody under a prescribed formula (say, x divided by 3.5, with credit for days of periodic detention served). 
       
       
      (3) The Parole Board to have power to vary (2) above in special circumstances and/or grant parole. 
       
       
      JAMES J: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by me.

       REGINA v AIDELYN RAMIREZ 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1   JAMES J: Aidelyn Ramirez has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on her on 16 April 1999 in the District Court by his Honour Judge Viney. She had pleaded guilty to eight counts of using a false instrument, three counts of making a false instrument, and three counts of making a false statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage. The applicant was sentenced on each count of using a false instrument to a fixed term of penal servitude of three months to date from 8 February 2000 and on each count of making a false instrument or making a false statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage to a fixed term of penal servitude of six months also to date from 8 February 2000. Judge Viney made the sentences imposed commence from 8 February 2000, because on 10 October 1997 Judge Johnston had sentenced the applicant to sentences of four years, including minimum terms of two years six months commencing on 8 August 1997 and expiring on 7 February 2000. 
     
      
    2    In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney concisely summarised the facts of the offences. The applicant had passed valueless cheques to Coles and K-Mart, and had given false information in applications for credit at Grace Bros. The offences had been committed at various times between 18 August 1993 and 22 March 1997. 
     
      
    3    In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney rejected a claim made by the applicant, which was recorded in certain documents before his Honour, that the applicant had a gambling problem. His Honour found that the applicant is ""simply a crook, she uses whatever pretext is available to excuse her blatant dishonesty."" 
     
      
       His Honour commented; 
       
        
        ""This woman seems to write cheques on closed accounts and manipulates bank accounts and credit accounts with a flamboyance which is quite bizarre. She seems able to convince people that she has immense wealth at her disposal and creates fantasies of grandeur that take people in."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    4    His Honour noted that the applicant had a criminal history which included convictions for offences of dishonesty. 
     
      
    5    On 26 October 1993, his Honour had himself sentenced the applicant to terms of imprisonment on three charges of making a false statement. The applicant had committed the first three offences for which she was sentenced by his Honour on 16 April 1999, while she was on remand for the sentences which were pronounced by his Honour on 26 October 1993. 
     
      
    6    As I have already indicated, Judge Johnston sentenced the applicant on 10 October 1997 to sentences of penal servitude for four years, consisting of minimum terms of two years six months and additional terms of one year and six months, on two counts of obtaining a benefit by deception and two counts of fraudulent misappropriation. In sentencing the applicant on 10 October 1997 Judge Johnston took into account a total of twenty-nine further offences.7   A number of submissions were made by counsel for the applicant in either written or oral submissions. 
     
      
    8    1. It was submitted that his Honour had taken into account an irrelevant consideration or had made a finding that was not reasonably open, when he stated in his remarks on sentence, ""she has conned innocent people out of huge amounts of money."" It was pointed out that the amounts involved in the present charges could not be described as “huge”. 
     
      
    9    I do not consider that this submission, which was made in the written submissions, should be upheld. His Honour was not suggesting that in committing the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant, the applicant had deprived innocent people of huge amounts of money. If that had been his Honour's view, then his Honour would have imposed much heavier sentences than the quite modest sentences he in fact imposed. In other parts of his remarks on sentence his Honour stated the amounts involved in the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant and commented that the amounts involved were mostly relatively small amounts. 
     
      
    10    His Honour’s statement was probably based on some of the amounts involved in the offences for which the applicant was sentenced by Judge Johnston. His Honour made the statement in the course of explaining why he had concluded that he could not rely on anything the applicant said being truthful. 
     
      
    11    2. It was submitted that the sentencing judge had failed to give proper weight to a concession made by the Crown. In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney said; 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown concedes that if the paperwork had been available, all of these matters would have been included in the Form 1 or Form 2 when Johnston J dealt with her, so Mr Carter argues that I should impose sentences that would allow her the same date for release to parole as his Honour did. After all there were twenty-nine matters on the Form 1 in that case, what difference would another fourteen make? They are mostly relatively small amounts."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    12    It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that by having sentences imposed on her, over and above the sentences imposed on her by Judge Johnston, the applicant had been subjected to a kind of double jeopardy. 
     
      
    13    I do not consider that these submissions should be accepted. I see no error in the response Judge Viney himself made in his remarks on sentence to the submission made by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence. His Honour said; 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am afraid I cannot totally accept that approach. Surely, if there were these additional fourteen matters, the sentence would have had to have been higher. In my view something extra is called for."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14    The sentences imposed by Judge Viney were sentences of three months or six months, and could not, on any view, be described as heavy sentences. In my view, his Honour did not commit any error in taking the course that he did. 
     
      
    15    3. It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in not giving weight to the applicant's serious gambling addiction. 
     
      
    16    In my opinion, this submission should not be accepted. The applicant did not herself give any evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The evidence that the applicant had a gambling problem was in a report by the psychiatrist Dr Lewin, who recorded in his report, as part of the history provided to him by the applicant, that the applicant had experienced difficulties in controlling her gambling. Judge Viney also had before him Judge Johnston’s remarks on sentence in which reference was made to a claimed gambling problem. Judge Viney did not accept that the applicant had a gambling problem. His Honour noted that, when the applicant had appeared before him in 1993, she had given a different excuse for having committed the offences for which she was then being sentenced; namely, that she had purchased a boutique in a shopping centre, which had failed. It was in this context that his Honour said that he could not rely on the truthfulness of anything the applicant said. 
     
      
    17    In any event, even if the history of the alleged gambling problem was accurate, Dr Lewin did not consider that it explained the applicant's conduct. In his report Dr Lewin said; 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mrs Ramirez attempted to explain her problems in terms of a gambling addiction. It seemed to me that this did not accurately explain her current predicament, rather there appeared to be a life long pattern of dependency in relationships and a failure to learn from experience."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    18    Even if the commission of the offences was attributable to a gambling problem, that in my opinion would have attracted little by way of mitigation of penalty. 
     
      
    19    4. It was lastly submitted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. It was said that the offences were minor. 
     
      
    20    In my opinion, the quite modest sentences imposed by Judge Viney cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive. The sentences of up to six months imposed by his Honour would have the effect of entrenching on the additional terms of the sentences imposed by Judge Johnston to the extent of six months but would still permit the applicant to be eligible for release on parole during the last 12 months of the sentences imposed by Judge Johnston. 
     
      
    21    I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      SPERLING: I agree.

     REGINA v Peter Francis MATO 
      
     REGINA v Monica Charis RUSU 
     
     
      
    Ms Rusu was found guilty of larceny from a bank while being employed by that bank. Mr Mato was found guilty of aiding abetting and assisting Ms Rusu to commit larceny. Both were sentenced to penal servitude for six years, with a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. The evidence was that Ms Rusu, being the last employee left in the bank one evening, entered the safe and stole $476,500. She then left the bank and went to a car parked outside the bank in which Mr Mato was waiting. There was evidence that Mr Mato had previously picked Ms Rusu up from work whenever he was able.Mr Mato appealed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that he was present assisting Ms Rusu when she stole the money from the bank. It was argued that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that he had prior knowledge of Ms Rusu’s intention to steal from the bank. Mr Mato argued that the jury could not have rejected as a rational inference from the evidence the possibility that Mr Mato was not a party to Ms Rusu’s offence. The Crown submitted in reply that if the Court were to quash the conviction against Mr Mato then it should, pursuant to s7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, substitute a verdict on the terms of count 3 of the indictment, that Mr Mato was an accessory after the fact to the larceny. Mr Mato’s spending of large sums of money after the robbery was evidence to support this verdict.Ms Rusu made an application to have her sentence reduced on the ground that it was on its face so excessive as to demonstrate error in the sentencing process. In addition it was argued that the trial Judge focused so heavily on Ms Rusu’s failure to return the money or to assist the police that he overlooked or gave insufficient consideration to her clean record and her youth. Held:By Sheller JA, Barr and Bell JJ agreeing:Mr Mato’s Appeal(1) It was open on the evidence for the jury to find that Mr Mato knew nothing of the robbery until after he drove Ms Rusu away from the bank. If Mr Mato knew nothing of Ms Rusu’s intentions or what she had been doing in the bank safe, earlier evidence showing Mr Mato’s financial difficulties did not support an inference that he learnt about it during the period they were driving away. The trial Judge, in the language he used, left it open to the jury to convict on the basis of such an inappropriate inference. It followed that the conviction was unreasonable and could not be supported and should be quashed.(2) It was not possible to substitute a verdict of guilty as an accessory after the fact because the Court could not say that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved Mr Mato guilty of being an accessory after the fact. Ms Rusu’s application(1) The penalty imposed by the trial Judge was severe, but was within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion. The Court was not persuaded that the trial Judge did not give appropriate weight to the subjective considerations about the applicant’s age and background. These had to be weighed with her lack of contrition in determining the sentence. There was no basis to interfere with the trial Judge’s discretion and extend the additional term.

     REGINA v Peter Francis MATO 
      
     REGINA v Monica Charis RUSU 
     
     
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: Monica Charis Rusu and Peter Francis Mato were indicted on three counts to which they pleaded not guilty. By the first count Ms Rusu was charged that on 17 June 1996 at Campbelltown, she being then a clerk to the National Australia Bank, stole $476,500 the property of the bank, the bank being her employer. By the second count Mr Mato was charged that on the same day he was present aiding abetting and assisting Ms Rusu to commit the felony charged against her. Alternatively, by the third count Mr Mato was charged that between 16 June 1996 and 24 August 1996 at Campbelltown or elsewhere in New South Wales, knowing Ms Rusu to have committed the felony he received harboured maintained and assisted her. 
     
      
    2    Their trial took place before Acting Judge Ford QC and a jury between 9 and 26 June 1998 when the jury returned with a verdict of guilty against Ms Rusu and guilty against Mr Mato on the charge of aiding and abetting. Ms Rusu was sentenced to penal servitude for six years with a minimum term of four and a half years commencing on 25 June 1998 and expiring on 24 December 2002 and an additional term to expire on 24 June 2004. Mr Mato was sentenced to penal servitude for the same term similarly apportioned between the minimum and additional term. 
     
      
    3    Ms Rusu seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on her. Mr Mato appeals against his conviction on the ground that it was unreasonable and cannot be supported. The written submissions filed for Mr Mato foreshadowed a further ground of appeal. 
     
      
    4    The essential facts are not in dispute. In June 1996 Ms Rusu was employed by the National Australia Bank as a bank teller at its Campbelltown Branch. Ms Rusu was one of a small number of persons responsible for the safe custody of excess or “reserve” cash accumulated at that branch of the bank. Each Tuesday the reserve cash was collected from the branch and conveyed to the Reserve Bank. On Monday, 17 June 1996 Ms Rusu and another staff member tallied the reserve cash and prepared it for collection the next day. In the process Ms Rusu came to know that $476,500 reserve cash was on hand.  
     
      
    5    The reserve cash was kept in a compartment in the safe. Ms Rusu had the key to the compartment. The safe was secured by two combination dials, right and left, each of which was in turn secured by a key. The left dial combination was known to the manager, Mr Ahmet, and the assistant manager or second in charge, Ms Robinson. The right combination was known to Ms Rusu and another staff member. There were two copies of the one key to the combination dials. Ms Rusu held one of the keys, Ms Robinson the other. The safe was fitted with an alarm which was linked to the control room of Chubb Electronic Security. Bank staff knew the six digit number for activating the alarm. Obviously Ms Rusu was a person in whom her employer placed trust to act honestly and loyally. 
     
      
    6    There was evidence that the left combination dial could remain open even when the two dials were supposedly locked with the key. Moreover, Ms Robinson had the number of the left combination dial written on a card in her purse. Further, Ms Rusu had many opportunities to watch Ms Robinson operate the left combination dial.  
     
      
    7    On the afternoon in question, the bank alarm was placed in night mode at 5.17pm. At approximately 5.30pm Mr Ahmet left the bank premises. Other staff members apart from Ms Rusu had left earlier. After Mr Ahmet left Ms Rusu was in the bank premises alone. At 5.34pm the alarm was put into open mode and at 5.43pm into night mode again. The Crown case was that Ms Rusu had switched off the alarm, used her knowledge of the combinations and possession of the key to the combination dials and the key to the compartment to gain access to the reserve cash which she stole before turning the alarm back to night mode. She then left the bank with the money in a bag and went to a car parked in the road outside the bank in which her fiance Mr Mato was waiting for her, as he had done on other occasions before, to take her home. They drove away together.  
     
      
    8    The Crown contended that Ms Rusu needed either to have surreptitiously discovered the combination of the left dial or to have taken advantage of the dial not locking correctly. Her mistake was not realising when she turned the alarm system off and then on again that a computer at Chubb Electronic Security kept a record. Thus it was quickly determined that it was likely the safe had been opened and the cash taken when there was nobody on the premises but Ms Rusu. 
     
      
    9    Ms Rusu compounded this mistake by embarking with Mr Mato on a spending spree in the weeks after 17 June 1996. Most of the money spent was spent for Mr Mato’s benefit. Of the $476,500 stolen, $125,000 approximately was traced as having been spent in the period after 17 June 1996 up to the time of Ms Rusu’s and Mr Mato’s arrest on 24 August 1996. The disposition of the balance of about $350,000 remains a mystery. 
     
      
    10    Some of the evidence of expenditure can be summarised as follows. On 18 June 1996 $2,850 in cash was deposited in Mr Mato’s account at the Advance Bank and on 2 July 1996 there was a further cash deposit of $5,500. On 18 June 1996 he paid a shop $3,200 cash for tyres and wheels and on the same day and later $3,297 cash for insurance policies. On 18 June 1996 he also paid cash of $1,201 for fuel and on 24 June 1996 $1,225 cash for truck tyres. Between 24 June and 19 August 1996 six payments totalling $35,800 were made on Mr Mato’s account to Avco Financial Services Limited (Avco). Between 1 July and 19 August 1996 five payments totalling $16,500 were made on Mr Mato’s account to Esanda Finance Corporation Limited (Esanda). These were repayments of money borrowed in February 1995 by Mr Mato to purchase a motor vehicle. On 21 July 1996 Mr Mato purchased a boat, outboard motor and trailer for $30,000 which was reduced by a trade-in of $3,000 and a cheque of the same date for $2,000. On 30 July 1996 Mr Mato repaid $15,000 of the balance in cash and on 3 August 1996 the balance of $10,000 in cash. On 2 July and 29 July 1996 Mr Mato made cash payments to Endeavour Credit Union on his own account of $4,000 and $5,000. On 10 July 1996 he paid $8,000 in cash for a new engine for his concrete pumping truck.  
     
      
    11    Mr Mato sought to explain this expenditure on the basis that he had saved a large amount of money in cash from his business and had chosen to spend it. His parents gave evidence to support this. However, there was evidence that for some time before 17 June 1996 he had been in dire financial difficulties. 
     
      
    12    On 25 November 1994 Mr Mato and his parents had borrowed $115,000 from Avco to enable Mr Mato to buy a cement truck business. Since October 1995 payments under the loan arrangements had been in arrears. In March and April 1996 Ms Rusu made an application to National Australia Bank to borrow $170,000. She spoke to Mr Ahmet about this. According to him in the course of this conversation she said words to the effect that Mr Mato’s parents “wanted the money off Peter desperately”. The loan application which was made by Ms Rusu more than once was refused. On 29 April 1996 Ms Rusu took the tenancy of an apartment. On 8 May 1996 a solicitor, Mr David Scutts, on the instructions of Mr Mato’s parents, wrote to Mr Mato in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On our instructions, you borrowed $115,000 from Avco Financial Services at 14% interest and utilised approximately $75,000 of this loan in purchasing a new truck for your business. As security for the loan, your parents gave a first mortgage over their home at 81 Woodcourt Street, Ambarvale and which is valued at $140,000. The basis of the loan arrangement was that you would meet all of the payments of the loan. 
        
       
       
        
        You have defaulted on the loan and the finance company is entitled to enforce its security by exercising its right to sell your parents’ property as mortgagee exercising power of sale. In such circumstances, your parents would be forced to move out of their home and would lose most of their equity in it. 
        
       
       
        
        The situation is completely intolerable from your parents’ point of view and needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency. 
        
       
       
        
        Your parents have instructed us that unless the matter can be satisfactorily resolved by 5 pm on Monday next, 13 May 1996, we are to institute legal proceedings against you out of the appropriate court without further notice.” 
        
       
       
      
    13    Mr Scutts received no reply from Mr Mato and wrote another letter to him on 16 May 1996 advising that legal proceedings were being instituted against him as a matter of urgency. The letter went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have placed your parents in the position where they have no option other than to sell their home to repay the debt to Avco. They simply cannot afford the monthly payments. Your failure to keep to the arrangements to make payments to Avco will force your parents to suffer not only the loss of their home but also substantial financial loss. The property is worth about $130,000 and the debt to Avco (with penalty interest) is about $122,000. After paying selling commission and legal expenses on the sale, your parents will be left with virtually nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        When the total financial loss to your parents is quantified further legal proceedings will be taken against you to recover this money.” 
        
       
       
      
    14    On 21 May 1996 Mr Mato told Mr Scutts that his parents owed him $30,000.  
     
      
    15    Mr Mato was in arrears in paying on the car loan from Esanda on various occasions before 17 June 1996.  
     
      
    16    In April 1996 Mr Mato and Ms Rusu bought household goods on credit from Harvey Norman. To do this they borrowed $4,168.66. The Crown submitted that Mr Mato’s inability to keep up payments on loans and the borrowing of money to purchase household goods was inconsistent with his having substantial cash savings. After 17 June 1996 payments, mostly cash, were made to Harvey Norman as follows; on 1 July 1996 $2,000, on 18 July 1996 $2,000, on 1 August 1996 $4,000, on 12 August 1996 $3,500 and on 19 August 1996 $5,000. 
     
      
    17    In July and August 1996 renovation work was done on the house of Mr Mato’s parents. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    18    The essence of Mr Mato’s appeal was that there was insufficient evidence that the appellant was present assisting Ms Rusu when she stole the reserve cash from the bank. He did not dispute that he had picked up Ms Rusu at some time between 5.30 and 5.45 on the afternoon in question. But, counsel submitted that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that he had prior knowledge of Ms Rusu’s intention to steal the money from the bank. 
     
      
    19    The Crown case against Mr Mato was circumstantial. In summing up Judge Ford said that the case for the prosecution as he understood it was that there was an arrangement for Mr Mato to call for Ms Rusu after he work in the afternoons. He did not always go because sometimes he had to work but it was not unusual for him to park outside the bank and wait there for Ms Rusu to come out of the bank and come over to his car. The prosecution argued that Mr Mato was waiting in his car, by analogy, like the driver of the getaway car after a bank hold up. He was there waiting ready to meet Ms Rusu and carry away the proceeds of the theft. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prosecution as I understand it says it would be unrealistic to suppose that if Ms Rusu was bent upon stealing the money that Mr Mato would be unaware of that. The submission is made to you that he was well aware that she was going to steal the money and he was there ready to drive away, to assist her in carrying away the money that had been taken out of the reserve cash compartment. 
        
       
       
        
        I remind you of what I said before, that theft or larceny involves the taking and carrying away of property. And here it is alleged by the prosecution that Mr Mato given that he was aware that she had taken the money, he was there waiting to assist her in the task of carrying it away. In other words, he was giving her very able assistance to carry out the theft of the money. 
        
       
       
        
        Now is it unrealistic? Is it unrealistic to suppose that he did not know that Ms Rusu was going to take the money on this afternoon? It is only if he was well aware that she was taking the money and was there present willing and able to assist her in carrying the money away from the scene that he could be treated and regarded as an accessory to the commission of the offence, her accessory to the commission of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        But says the prosecution, in the unlikely event that he did not find out about the stolen money until subsequently, then he was an accessory after the fact, after the commission of the crime and gave assistance to Ms Rusu in supporting her, keeping the money and using the money. This much is perfectly plain of course, that if you are not satisfied, according to the criminal standard, that Ms Rusu is guilty of the offence of theft, then you must of necessity acquit Mr Mato of the offence in which he is alleged to have been the accessory to the commission of the offence and acquitted also of the offence that is count 3 in the indictment which says that he was an accessory after the event, after the commission of the theft of the money.” 
         
        
       
      
    20    Mr Mato’s counsel submitted that, to adapt the language of Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 503, the jury could not have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that Mr Mato was not a party to Ms Rusu’s offence. In Knight at 503 their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, then it ought to have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance.” 
        
       
       
      
    21    The trial Judge gave directions about circumstantial evidence in that part of his summing up dealing with the case against Ms Rusu. That direction was not repeated when he turned “to the question of the case against Mr Mato”. No complaint was made about this though I regard it as significant. The pivotal sentence in the passage I have quoted is that which begins with the words “It is only if he was well aware that she was taking the money”. If by that the trial Judge was speaking of the time when Ms Rusu was in the bank safe physically taking the money from its place in the bank, Mr Mato’s dire financial circumstances, the pressure upon him to repay money, particularly the money borrowed with his parents from Avco, and his borrowing more money for household furniture in that situation, were indicators that he knew that Ms Rusu intended to steal cash from the bank and was doing so on 17 June 1996 and that he was waiting in the car to take her and the money away. But the Crown’s submissions exposed another way in which this passage in the summing up might reasonably have been understood by the jury. The jury might have understood it to include knowledge derived at the time Ms Rusu came to the car or entered or was in the car with the money, presumably in a bag and weighing something in the order of 14 kilograms, and might have reached the conclusion that Mr Mato was party to the larceny for that reason, even though not satisfied that Mr Mato knew in advance or at the time Ms Rusu was taking the money in the safe that she intended to do this or was doing it. What the Crown said was based on the proposition that, when considering Mr Mato’s liability, the act of larceny continued until Ms Rusu deposited the money in some place she regarded as safe; see for example R v McDonald (1992) 2 QdR 634 at 645. In the Crown’s written submissions it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The terms in which his Honour directed the jury permitted them to find the appellant guilty as a principal in the second degree on finding, inter alia, that he rendered assistance to Ms Rusu in carrying away the money. …… His Honour put the case as one in which the actual assistance in the form of helping to carry away the money was the basis of liability. 
        
       
       
        
        If it can be said that this was an appropriate basis upon which liability as a principal in the second degree could be established then there is no question that the appellant was ‘present assisting Ms Rusu’. That is, if the activity of ‘carrying away’ extended beyond the removal of the money from the reserve cash compartment in the safe and continued until Ms Rusu and the money were safely away from the bank, then the appellant was ‘present’ (actually) during part of that activity. He assisted by driving her and the money safely away. 
        
       
       
        
        It is submitted that in the circumstances of this case that was an appropriate manner in which to regard the theft. That is, it was not fully achieved until the perpetrator left the scene with the proceeds. The appellant’s actions assisted her in the latter respect.” 
        
       
       
      
    22    Later in the written submissions it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From all of this it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew, at least by the time he was driving Ms Rusu and the money away from the bank, that she was stealing the money. Given his desperate need for money and the lack of any apparent similar need by Ms Rusu, the more likely conclusion is that he knew beforehand and encouraged her (although the latter, of course, is not a matter which needed to be established).” 
        
       
       
      
    23    If the Crown accepts that the jury might have understood that it was sufficient, even if Mr Mato had no prior knowledge of Ms Rusu’s intentions, that Mr Mato learned at a point of time after Ms Rusu emerged from the bank that she had stolen the money, then it seems to me an inference or hypothesis consistent with Mr Mato’s innocence was open on the evidence. 
     
      
    24    Mr Mato had gone to collect Ms Rusu after she finished her work. This he did regularly if he could. Ms Rusu emerged from the bank one may suppose carrying a bag with contents which weighed about 14 kilograms. She got into the car and drove away with Mr Mato. It is quite open on the evidence that he remained innocent of the contents of the bag or what Ms Rusu had done until a time beyond the period described as driving Ms Rusu and the money away from the bank. If Mr Mato knew nothing about Ms Rusu’s intentions or what she had been doing in the bank at the time she was in the safe, the fact of earlier financial difficulties or obtaining credit does not support an inference that he learnt about it after she emerged from the bank and during the period they were driving away presumably to their home. 
     
      
    25    Since his Honour in the language he used left it open to the jury to convict on the basis of such an inappropriate inference it follows that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported and should be quashed. It is therefore unnecessary to consider a further ground of appeal that Mr Mato’s counsel foreshadowed.  
     
      
    26    The Crown submitted that if the Court were to quash the conviction on aiding and abetting it should pursuant to s72 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 substitute a verdict on the terms of count 3 of the indictment, namely that Mr Mato was an accessory after the fact to the larceny. Section 7 (2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence, and the jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.” 
        
       
       
      
    27    Mr Mato’s spending of large sums of money was evidence to support a verdict that he was an accessory after the fact. 
     
      
    28    A good example of the intention behind s7 (2) is found in its application by this Court in R v Browne (1987) 30 A CrimR 278. The appellants were charged, inter alia, with armed robbery and wounding under s98 of the Crimes Act 1900 before its amendment in 1994. All were found guilty on this charge. On behalf of the appellant Browne it had been submitted (see 305-6) that because the only evidence against him was the alleged identification of him as the driver of the getaway vehicle, and because that vehicle had not been used to take the two principal offenders to the scene of the robbery, or for the purposes of carrying out the actual robbery itself, even if the evidence of identification was such as the jury might properly accept, there was nonetheless no evidence upon which Browne could be convicted of an offence involving the use of arms. The Court was of opinion that the totality of the evidence relied upon by the Crown against Browne was not sufficient to enable the jury to determine beyond reasonable doubt that he was a party to a common purpose of armed robbery and accordingly set aside his conviction on that count. The Court said that it was plainly open to the jury to conclude that the identification of Browne as the driver of the getaway vehicle was safe and accurate and that in consequence he did drive such car. But the evidence would not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the common purpose to rob to which, in such circumstances, Browne would plainly have been a party, extended to the use of weapons.  
     
      
    29    It was on that basis that the Court was satisfied that the case was one in which it was appropriate and proper pursuant to the provisions of s7 (2) to substitute for the verdict of guilty of an offence under s98 a verdict of guilty of an offence under s94 which relevantly provided that whosoever robs or assaults with intent to rob any person should, except where a greater punishment is provided, be liable to penal servitude for 14 years.  
     
      
    30    Their Honours referred to R v Kyriakou (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 August 1987 where Street CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, pointed out that an alternative charge must be found to be available either within the terms of the statute itself or by virtue of some principle of the common law and that, in the case there under consideration, because the statute did not make the necessary provision, it was necessary to examine whether the common law permitted it. After referring to Archbold Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice, (24th ed), p228 where it was said that at common law a defendant might be convicted of a less aggravated felony or misdemeanour on an indictment charging felony or misdemeanour of greater aggravation, provided that the indictment contains words apt to include both offences, Street CJ said that applying that principle to s97 (robbery being armed) and s98 he considered that the enunciation in s98 of the precise ingredients that comprised the entirety of s97 adding in s98 the further ingredient of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm rendered it open on an indictment under s98 for the jury to consider an alternative convicting under s97.  
     
      
    31    In Browne the Court was of opinion that these words applied for the case in hand. They concluded by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The consequence is that the first ground, which argued that the convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory, except in so far as the question of common purpose is concerned, should be rejected. There is no reason why, pursuant to the powers conferred by this Court by s7 (2) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912, there should not be substituted a verdict of guilty of an offence under s94.” 
        
       
       
      
    32    In the present case, in my opinion, it is not possible on this line of reasoning to substitute a verdict of guilty as an accessory after the fact. First the conviction for aiding and abetting is not quashed simply because as in Browne it was not open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about one element of the offence and secondly, even if this had been so, in the language of Street CJ, aiding and abetting is not a crime of the same character as being an accessory after the fact escalated by adding one further or further ingredients. In short, this Court cannot say that the jury “must have been satisfied of facts which proved” Mr Mato guilty of being an accessory after the fact. As a matter of common sense I would think that the jury would have been so satisfied in light of the clear evidence of spending after 17 June 1996, but that is not enough. In any event, Mr Mato said that the source of the funds used for that spending came from his own legitimate cash resources. In my opinion, the Court cannot substitute a verdict of guilty of being an accessory after the fact.  
     
      
    33    This leaves the question of whether rather than directing a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered on the count of aiding and abetting (s6 (2)) we should order a new trial pursuant to s8 (1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I do not think that it was seriously suggested there should be a new trial on the count of aiding and abetting and I would not so order. Mr Mato has served 17 months of his sentence which inclines me against ordering a new trial on the charge of being an accessory after the fact. If convicted the penalty would in the circumstances be considerably less than that imposed on him for aiding and abetting. In my opinion, it is not appropriate to order a new trial on the charge of being an accessory after the fact. Accordingly, on Mr Mato’s appeal I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The appellant’s conviction on the second count in the indictment is quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered. 
        
       
       
        
       
       
      Ms Rusu’s Application 
       
      
    34    Ms Rusu was born on 21 April 1975. She was 21 when she committed the crime of which she has been convicted and 23 at the time of sentencing. According to the pre-sentence report she came to Australia with her parents when she was aged 2. When she was 8 her parents separated and she was subsequently raised by her father and step-mother. About two weeks before the offence she began regular contact with her natural mother who, it was said, remained supportive. She was said to have entered into a relationship with Mr Mato approximately 4 weeks before the offence. This was her first adult relationship and she continued to verbalise what was regarded as a naive faith in Mr Mato’s ability to assist her to extricate herself from the situation she found herself in.  
     
      
    35    She left school at the age of 18 after completing her Higher School Certificate and then began employment with the bank. On 28 July 1998 a specialist psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, made a report. From that it appears that Ms Rusu had known Mr Mato for about 2 years. She described her father as being very strict and said that he was “very physical” in the manner in which he disciplined her, that he would beat her for the littlest thing, that he had also beaten her mother and that she had recollections of her mother bleeding as a result of the beatings inflicted upon her by her father. On an occasion of Ms Rusu going out aged 20 her father responded in a violent aggressive manner and split her lip. Dr Roberts said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The content of her account suggested a long-term submissive relationship to significant others and in the case of her father, submission in the context of a violent, controlling relationship.” 
        
       
       
      
    36    Dr Roberts said her involvement with Mr Mato, her first serious involvement, appeared to have occurred in the context of a situation in which she was deprived of kindness, companionship and support. Dr Roberts’ impression was that Ms Rusu’s overall mode of functioning was that of a dependent personality disorder. People with this disorder fear losing support or approval and individuals with dependent personality disorder often have difficulty in expressing disagreement with other people especially those on whom they are dependent. In summary Dr Roberts said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Rusu comes from a background in which initiative, individuality and self-assertion were seriously compromised by a physically violent father who was an extreme disciplinarian and highly controlling. The environment in which Ms Rusu grew up, in my view has made her a dependent person who will tend to become involved with a significant other and maintain a degree of loyalty to that person regardless as to how she is treated. She will tend to be able to be dominated by that person and will accept domination, humiliation and even physical and mental hurt in order to maintain that relationship with a person to whom she transfers he dependence.” 
        
       
       
      
    37    She was a person who potentially could be manipulated and influenced to undertake a course of action contrary to her usual character and personality because of her need to form a relationship with a person regardless of how that person treated her. 
     
      
    38    In his remarks on sentence, Judge Ford noted the large amount of money stolen and the betrayal of trust involved. He also noted that a substantial part of the money taken remained within the reach of Ms Rusu and Mr Mato. After the jury returned its verdict his Honour had extended to counsel the suggestion that it would be substantially in Ms Rusu’s interests if she could return or at least indicate the means by which the outstanding money could be returned to the bank. Counsel informed his Honour that he had no instructions in that regard. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And it seems to me that you simply persist and impose upon yourself, the very serious hardship that necessarily is involved for you in being in prison.” 
        
       
       
      Judge Ford had no doubt whatsoever that Ms Rusu was strongly influenced in the enterprise by her co-accused, who was older and of a stronger personality. He added: 
       
       
        
         “But nonetheless you are obstinate and you say that you have no knowledge of this offence, no knowledge of the whereabouts of any of the money and consequently you must suffer the regrettable consequences.” 
        
       
       
      
    39    His Honour went on that Ms Rusu’s deprival of the support that she would have from friends and relations to be replaced by “harder characters” in prison had been put as a reason for finding special circumstances and substantially reducing the period of full-time custody. However, his Honour said that the long term supervision and hardship that Ms Rusu would experience was something she had brought on herself “by reason of the fact that no offer whatsoever has been made to return any of the money”. He noted various matters of evidence which the jury had obviously not believed and said that the case against Ms Rusu was very strong and he had no reason to doubt the correctness of the jury verdict. The remarks on sentence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “But then what am I to do to give you a relatively minor sentence? A smack on the wrist because you are the person who will suffer severely in prison. I do not think I can do that because the remedy for reduction of your sentence lies with you. If you have the good sense to indicate where the funds are, that would be so much better for you, but you persist in denying that you committed this offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The maximum sentence for this offence is one of penal servitude for a term of ten years, so you will appreciate that it is regarded as a very serious offence. Taking into account all those matters that have been put to me on your behalf, those subjective matters, I nonetheless am required to impose a salutary condign sentence which in your case will be a minimum term of four years and six months and an additional term of one year and six months. I impose that sentence taking into account the one day which you served in custody after your arrest. Now that minimum term will expire on 25 December 2002 and the sentence will commence of course on 25 June 1998.” 
        
       
       
      
    40    The principal submission made on Ms Rusu’s behalf was that the sentence was on its face so excessive as to demonstrate error in the sentencing process. In addition, it was submitted that his Honour emphasised Ms Rusu’s failure to return the money stolen or assist the police to the point where he overlooked or gave insufficient account to subjective considerations such as Ms Rusu’s youth, her clean record and that the present was a first offence. We were shown statistics which indicated that the sentence imposed was, so far as the statistics showed, at the top of the range. It was also submitted that there were special circumstances which his Honour failed to take into account to increase the additional term and to that extent reduce the minimum term. An argument based on parity to suggest that there would be a reasonable grievance that the sentence imposed was as great as that imposed upon Mr Mato has, in my opinion, no substance whatever. In this regard it must be remembered that it was Ms Rusu who used her position of trust to steal from her employer a very large sum of money. 
     
      
    41    In support of the submissions that the sentence was excessive, counsel for Ms Rusu referred us to the decision of the Court in R v Vidler (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 November 1993. In that case the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to twenty counts of fraudulent conversion laid under s71 (1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and two counts of larceny as a clerk laid under s156 of the Crimes Act. The District Court Judge imposed a sentence on the first of two counts under s156 of 7 years comprising a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 3. Fixed terms were imposed in respect of the remaining charges to be served concurrently with the minimum term imposed for the count under s156. The offences had been committed over a period beginning in about 1982 and finishing with the applicant’s arrest in January 1992 and involved the applicant using her position of employment with the Commonwealth Bank to appropriate money fraudulently. The ultimate deficiency came to a sum of nearly $922,000. Counsel for Ms Rusu submitted that in the present case the sum involved was much less, the act was a single act on one day, the applicant was much younger and the scheme of taking money far less sophisticated. 
     
      
    42    However, I find Vidler gives little, if any, support to an argument that the sentence imposed on Ms Rusu was excessive. In Vidler the applicant had pleaded guilty at the committal stage thereby avoiding a long and complicated trial. She came grudgingly to give some assistance to the Crown. Reparation was made out of her superannuation entitlements and other payments due to her by way of leave and salary. Badgery-Parker J, with whose judgment Mahoney JA and Ireland J agreed, said that the case was not one of a person who was mentally ill in such degree as to make it inappropriate to visit upon her a sentence formulated to give weight to principles of general deterrence.  
     
      
       
        
        “This was at most the case of a person whose criminality, substantial as it was, might reasonably be seen to be mitigated by her neuroticism. In my view, the sentence imposed was by no means at the top of the range through which his Honour’s legitimate discretion extended and it is so far below what might otherwise have been regarded as appropriate that it is only explicable on the basis that his Honour gave a great deal of weight, more perhaps even than the language of his judgment would suggest, to the sad neurotic state of the applicant.” 
        
       
       
      
    43    In that case the sentencing Judge recognised that there was a special circumstance which required that there be a lengthy period of counselling and supervision once the prisoner regained her liberty.  
     
      
    44    In the present case there is no sign of contrition, which is perhaps the most significant feature of the refusal to give any assistance in finding the proceeds of the crime. The penalty imposed was severe, perhaps higher than I would myself have imposed, but I have come to the conclusion that it is within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion. As must be acknowledged, the case is a very sad one because a young woman setting out on her career with an unblemished record and having survived the not inconsiderable hardships of her childhood has quite literally ruined her prospects. Moreover, as the trial Judge found, she did so under the influence of a man who probably encouraged her to do what she did. I am reminded of the statement in the judgment of Wood J in R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330: 
     
      
       
        
        “The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences …..” 
        
       
       
      
    45    It was urged upon us that the present was not a sophisticated crime which would produce any great difficulty in detection. However, it seems unlikely that Ms Rusu was aware that the times of opening and closing the safe alarm were recorded at the Chubb control centre. But for this information detection would, at the least, have been more difficult. Although in one sense not sophisticated, what Ms Rusu did must have been carefully planned so as to enable her to take money which was, presumably, unidentifiable, and which was at its maximum amount for the week of reserve cash. Clearly she planned what she did. It is true that the trial Judge emphasised, perhaps reading it, with a degree of hyperbole, the importance of Ms Rusu’s failure to reveal what had become of the proceeds of the larceny; compare R v Phelan (1993) 66 A CrimR 446 at 448. But I am not persuaded that his Honour did not give appropriate weight to the obvious subjective considerations about the applicant’s age and background. These had to be weighed with her lack of contrition in determining the sentence. No error emerges from anything his Honour said. 
     
      
    46    The period of additional sentence of 18 months is significant and it seems to me appropriate. I can see no basis upon which this Court can interfere with his Honour’s discretion and extend the additional term. In my opinion, the application for leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal against sentence dismissed. 
     
      
    47    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      Mr Mato’s Appeal No. 60427/98  
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed; 
         
         
        2. The appellant’s conviction on the second count in the indictment is quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered.

     REGINA v. MAXWELL ROBERT WALTON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: This appeal is brought from the appellant's conviction in the District Court of New South Wales on one count of indecent assault of a girl under the age of 16 years. This offence is provided for under s.61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and is punishable by a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The appellant was in respect of that conviction placed on a recognizance for three years with a supervision component. 
    2   The appellant had gone to trial on two counts of indecent assault upon the same complainant. The jury acquitted him of one count. 
    3   The first count, that of which the appellant was convicted, related to an occasion on which the complainant asserted the appellant had fondled and kissed her breasts after having, with her consent, squeezed her pimples. 
    4   The second count related to an alleged touching of the complainant's vagina when she was sharing a bed with the appellant and his daughter whilst on holidays. 
    5   Three grounds of appeal are asserted:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. That his Honour erred in admitting evidence of complaint to Ms. Amanda Klein; and 
       
      
      
       
       2. That his Honour erred in his directions concerning the evidence of the appellant's daughter."" 
       
      
    6   A further ground was added at the hearing by amendment:- 
     
      
       
       ""3. The address to the jury by the learned Crown Prosecutor gave rise to a miscarriage of justice."" 
       
      
    7   On the first ground, the complainant, in chief, gave evidence of the events and also that ""a long time after I found out what happened to Amanda"" she told her ""how he touched my boobs"". She said that she had told Amanda Klein that he had touched her breasts but could not remember telling her about the incident in the bed although she referred to an incident she had mentioned to Ms. Klein about the appellant walking in on her and his daughter in the shower. At the close of evidence in chief, his Honour, at the Crown's invitation, gave a direction in general terms that the conversation was led to show consistency of the complainant's conduct with her evidence. 
    8   In cross-examination, it was put to her that the events central to her account of the matters giving rise to the charges had not occurred. She rejected that assertion as she did the assertion of various other events said to have occurred at or about the same times. She did accept that immediately following the relevant occasion she had the opportunity to speak to her grandmother and aunt and that the conversation with Ms. Klein was in September, hence about four to five months after the events. 
    9   Ms. Klein gave evidence that on 4 September she had been told by the complainant that whilst she was sharing the appellant's bed, he started feeling her breasts and between her legs. On another occasion she said the complainant referred to the appellant walking in on her in the shower. 
    10   No objection is noted as having been taken to the admissibility of the complaint evidence, nor any application by the Crown for leave to adduce it. 
    11   The trial pre-dated the decision of the High Court in Graham v. The Queen (1998) 157 ALR 404. 
    12   In the summing up, the jury were again directed in general terms that the complaint was admitted to assist them consider the consistency of the complainant's conduct and ""to answer any argument that the absence of complaint would suggest that the offence did not take place"". 
    13   That direction was given in the context of his Honour directing the jury as to the necessity to be satisfied of the events and the elements of the offences on the evidence of the complainant, notwithstanding the sworn denial of the appellant and the corroboration of his account by his daughter. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
       ""Do you accept the complainant's evidence? Are you satisfied what she has told you occurred over the Easter period in 1996? Or do you reject what she says?"" 
       
      
    14   He went on:- 
     
      
       
       ""Now in this case the (sic), you also heard evidence from Linda that in about September 1996 she spoke to her girlfriend or a school friend Amanda Klein. That evidence was led by the Crown as evidence of complaint. It was not led to support or corroborate what the complainant said but it was led to establish consistency of conduct on her part between what she complained of and her evidence before you. Evidence of complaint was admitted in those circumstances to assist you in deciding whether the complainant's conduct was consistent with she (sic) says happened over Easter 1996 and to answer any argument that the absence of complaint would suggest that the offence did not take place. Here the evidence is, from Amanda Klein, and the complainant, that the conversation which the Crown relies upon as evidence of complaint, took place, I think, on 4 September or early in September 1996, and does show such consistency of conduct, even though the complainant is not sure whether she mentioned the bed incident on which the Crown relies in this case. The Crown says that she certainly did mention the incident about the fondling of the breasts, and she cannot remember whether she mentioned to Amanda Klein the other, what happened in the bed. 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown says that when you look at what she said to Amanda Klein and what you hears Amanda Klein say, while (there is) difference in some small detail (it) does constitute consistency of conduct, that (is) her version of events is, that time is consistent with the version of events that she described to you in the witness box. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused, on the other hand, contends that that delay is, of itself, is inconsistent with what she now alleges took place and it particularly is inconsistent when you look at what she told Amanda Klein about the incidents, and when you compare what she told with her evidence given in these proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       Well those are matters for you to determine in your role as judges of the facts in this case. Why the complainant did not say anything before September might be another question that exercises your mind. Well no evidence was led which will help you come to an answer to that question. We did hear evidence about Linda's mother going to be taken to hospital but it seems to me to be too vague as to what. We know that her mother and father were separated from what her father told you in evidence. There may be of (sic) good reason Linda said nothing until September. The question for you to determine is whether, in this case, the complaint, the alleged complaint and the circumstance in which was it (sic) made is consistent with her evidence given in these proceedings. Even if it is not that does not resolve the real issue for your determination, and that is, whether you can accept Linda as a reliable witness in regard to the evidence that she has. (Given) The Crown contends that you can, the accused clearly joins issue with that contention and says you cannot."" (Words in parentheses added) 
       
      
    15   At the conclusion of the summing up, the submission was put on behalf of the appellant that failure to complain at the earliest reasonable opportunity could operate to reduce credibility and that a direction to that effect should be given. It was opposed by the Crown Prosecutor and reference was made to s.405B of the Crimes Act and the recency of the complaint. He referred his Honour to Regina v. Crofts (1996) 186 CLR 427. He sought a direction that there may be good reasons for delay in or refraining from complaining. His Honour rejected the Crown submission because the Crown had not elicited any evidence which might provide any basis for the direction he sought. His Honour referred to the matter of complaint when the events were fresh in the memory but received no relevant assistance on that matter and subsequently re-directed the jury that delay in complaint is a matter that reflects on credibility. No specific direction dealt with absence of complaint. 
    16   Notwithstanding the lack of objection, there has been in this court since Graham a consistent line of authority that where, as here, before Graham was decided, the Crown has led complaint and it is not shown to be admissible under the principles in Graham nor has leave been sought under s.108(3) of the Evidence Act 1995, an appeal would generally be successful. In Regina v. Gillard[1999] NSWCCA 21; Regina v. Dwyer [1999] NSWCCA 47; Regina v. RNS [1999] NSWCCA 122; Regina v. Whitmore [1999] NSWCCA 247; Regina v. DWH [1999] NSWCCA 255 and the cases cited in them the issues are discussed. 
    17   It is submitted by the Crown that the evidence of complaint here was such as might only have had an effect on the jury on the count to which Ms. Klein's evidence was apparently relevant and of which the appellant was acquitted but that submission disregards the complaint evidence from the complainant and the specific directions on her evidence of complaint I have set out. Notwithstanding Ms. Klein did not support the complainant's evidence in this respect, it cannot be said that the jury must have disregarded it. 
    18   No express direction was given that the complaint was or was not evidence of the facts but it was clearly left to the jury, insofar as it was not inconsistent with the complainant's account in evidence, as bolstering the acceptability of her evidence of the commission of the offence. It is not clear to me an application for leave to lead it for that purpose would in all the circumstances necessarily have succeeded. The cross-examination did not expressly put the matters referred to in s.108(3). Indeed, the challenge merely took the form of suggesting the events had not occurred, foreshadowing to the witness in fairness, the appellant's denials. I refer to the question that raises in Whitmore (supra) at para.38. Here, I do not accept that the evidence would inevitably have been admitted nor do I consider that it can properly be said that it made no real difference in the result. 
    19   I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
    20   Turning to the second and third grounds of appeal, according to the complainant's account of the two episodes which gave rise to the charges and of the shower incident, Jamie, the daughter of the appellant was present on each occasion. When she was in bed with the appellant, the daughter, she said, was in bed with them but on the other side of the appellant. The daughter was said by her to be in the shower with her when the appellant walked in and had the conversation to which she referred. The complainant asserted that in relation to the events referred to in the first count, she was present in the kitchen with the daughter when the appellant asked her if she had pimples on her back and sought that he look at them. She asserted that in the daughter's presence he lifted up her shirt over her head, undid her bra, squeezed the pimples on her back, asked if she had pimples on her breast, requested a look and started feeling her breasts. She described how he felt her breasts and kissed both of them, saying, ""Don't worry I do this to Janie all the time"". Janie was present at the time. She says that he then did the same to the daughter as he had done to her. 
    21   The appellant, in his record of interview, had denied squeezing the complainant's pimples, but in his evidence at trial admitted that he had squeezed the pimples whilst at Gosford. He contended that the complainant had undone her own bra, leaving her breasts in the cups of the bra while the appellant squeezed the pimples on her back. He had asked her whether she would like her front done. She said ""yes"", turned around and laid her bra across her legs while he did her upper chest area and her face. He said that at no time did he touch her breasts or kiss them. According to his account, Jane was present in the kitchen. He denied touching the breasts of either girl but admitted squeezing the pimples on both. He was strenuously cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor and by leave after the completion of the cross-examination, when matters had been raised by the appellant's counsel objecting to further questioning by the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor elicited the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
       ""Q. Mr. Walton, I suggest to you that you changed your story in relation to the squeezing of the pimples incident in the kitchen of your son's home because you learned that your daughter Jane made a statement to the detectives on the day that you were interviewed and she told them that you had squeezed pimples on the complainant? A. No sir that's not right. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You knew that your daughter Jane made a statement indicating that there had been an incident where you had squeezed pimples on [the complainant] and pimples on herself in the kitchen of your son's home at Gosford didn't you? A. Well actually to be quite truthful really I've never seen my daughter or my wife's statement. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You have discussed the matter with your daughter Jane haven't you? A. Only to tell her that when she got on the stand to tell the truth and that's all. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You discussed the trip with your daughter Jane after Detective Keen spoke with you didn't you? A. No. There was nothing to discuss. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Didn't discuss the incident in the shower with your daughter Jane? A. No. I haven't discussed the case with Jane or my wife and as I said I've never seen their statements. I've only ever told them to get up here and to do exactly what I'm doing and that's tell the truth. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You I suggest Mr. Walton have not told the truth? A. Well I'm sorry sir but I have told the truth."" 
       
      
    22   At the commencement of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor raised with his Honour the anticipation that the appellant's daughter would be called in the Crown case and that ""she would say that such an incident occurred although it wasn't entirely in a way in which the complainant says it occurred"", with reference to the events concerned in the first count. 
    23   His Honour's attention was drawn to s.18 of the Evidence Act 1995 and a statement by the appellant's daughter was handed up. There was discussion as to whether the witness might be brought into court to identify the statement. The witness was called, confirmed that she had made a statement concerning the events that had occurred on the Central Coast at Easter of 1996 and that she was willing to give evidence although she was aware that she could object to doing so. The Crown posed no questions to her, although invited to cross-examine. His Honour delivered a short judgment in which he detailed what had occurred and his satisfaction that the provisions of s.18 had been complied with. He referred to the statement that she had given as possibly being of assistance both for the accused and to the Crown in that, whilst it might support the Crown case in some respects, it also supported the defence case in other respects. 
    24   There was no suggestion of her evidence being the subject of any application by the Crown on the basis that it might be unfavourable or inconsistent with the statement. Nor was there any indication by the Crown Prosecutor of any other basis on which the witness should have been treated differently to any other. When, however, the witness was called for the Crown, the prosecutor asked her, her name, address and occupation and nothing more. 
    25   The account she gave in cross-examination was materially inconsistent with the complainant's as to the sleeping arrangements underlying the events giving rise to the second count. The version she gave of the pimple squeezing incident at Gosford was directly confirmatory of the account given later in evidence by the appellant and contradictory of that given by the complainant. Similarly, her evidence confirmed the version of the shower incident her father later gave. 
    26   His Honour referred to the defence counsel's address, which emphasised to the jury that the defence case was supported by the evidence of the daughter. He summarised the submissions:- 
     
      
       
       ""… that even allowing for the fact that a daughter might tend to support her father in a situation such as this, there was no evidence that what she was doing but was to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and that she was telling you of events that did occur and that you will be satisfied from her evidence that no such events as the complainant described did take place. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Of course the reverse would apply, while there is no evidence from the accused to prove anything if you are satisfied what he said, what he has told you and what his daughter Jane has told you then that would be the end of the matter because that would clearly indicate that you reject what the complainant says and your only result that would follow is that you must return a verdict of not guilty."" 
       
      
    27   His Honour had already referred to the evidence from Detective Senior Constable Keen that the appellant had consented to the police interviewing and speaking to his daughter and that they had done so. His Honour had summarised the evidence of Jane Walton and in his summing up dealt with the Crown submissions concerning it as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown then called Jane Walton. The Crown did not ask Jane Walton any questions at all, and the Crown has, in effect, asked you to disregard the evidence of Jane Walton because of her, she is the daughter of the accused. The Crown (sic) that she was called in on the aspect of fairness in that the Crown had a statement from her, that she purported to be an eye witness of an event that occurred in the kitchen of her brother Darryl on the Central Coast but that it did not add anything to the evidence the Crown relies upon in these proceedings and he produced that so that the defence could cross-examine her."" 
       
      
    28   At no stage did the statement itself go into evidence. The oblique reference to the contents as not adding anything to the Crown's case was not a sufficient or permissible explanation of the Crown's conduct. 
    29   Prior to the summing up, and following addresses, defence counsel complained that the address of the learned Crown Prosecutor had become over-emotional and that he had said to the jury that he hadn't questioned the daughter ""because he knew she wasn't telling the truth"". This was denied by the Crown Prosecutor. The transcript records ""discussion ensued"". 
    30   In its submissions here, the Crown has conceded that the Crown Prosecutor impugned the credit of the witness in circumstances where he had not put the matter about which criticism was to be made to the witness. That submission understates what the Crown Prosecutor put to the jury. 
    31   We have been provided with a transcript of the Crown Prosecutor's address. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown didn't question Jane Walton, bluntly, members of the jury because the Crown says Jane Walton hasn't told you the truth. She's no part of the crime case. She's given a version of the events you'd deduce and accept from the evidence of her mother which put the accused in a position where he had to resile from what he previously said and then say 'Oh yes well look something did happen in the kitchen. There was a squeezing of the pimple incident'."" 
       
      
    32   He had referred to the complainant as a ""kid who was surrounded by the Waltons"". He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""That's what the Crown submits to you members of the jury will find to be the facts. Jane Walton's got a somewhat different version of the events, namely, 'mine were done first. I exposed myself by taking my shirt and I took my bra off'. Where was the need to take her bra off if this was an act of picking pimples. 
       
      
      
       
       It's a version of the event given to support a cock-and-bull story made up by a father you might think members of the jury."" 
       
      
    33   He went on:- 
     
      
       
       ""What's the accused say about that version? The accused says he's never discussed the evidence that his daughter's given and he's never discussed the evidence that his wife has given with them. Looked at alone at first blush you might've thought that was possible but having heard from his wife you'll reject that won't you. His wife says she was present when the accused was discussing the evidence with Jane, that the shower incident was mentioned and so on. Both of them can't be right can they members of the jury. Either the accused is right about that or his wife's right about it. Piece it all together members of the jury, you'll have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the accused is lying when he says he didn't discuss statements. 
       
      
      
       
       But wasn't it word perfect? Jane says and the accused says that the accused approached the bathroom door and said something. Jane is able to hear, have herself heard from the inside and says 'Open the door'. Consistent with all his inventions it's always someone else wants him to do it. He's never asked himself to touch pimples. They've always asked him. He's never opened the bathroom door unless he was invited in, so the accused can't make him heard from outside but he's a big man with a big voice if he wanted to use but it was Jane who called out and made herself plain to him 'Come in'. Having been invited in, because he's not a sexual assaulter, he's an invitee, he comes in, there's the discussion about pies and he goes so he says. 
       
      
      
       
       Have a look at the picture that would be before you members of the jury, that's to say the diagram that the accused drew. In the way in which he's got the relationship to the swinging door entry of that bathroom and the shower curtain it was unnecessary for him to look around the door at all. If hearing was a problem over the flowing water he merely had to open the door a foot or so and look to the private end of the bathroom and say 'What do you want for tea?'. But he's got this almost precisely the same story as Jane has. 
       
      
      
       
       The modest Jane who strips the clothes from the top part of her body including her brassiere and has no difficulty in exposing all to her father while the pimples are being picked, is somewhat modest when she's in the shower and she takes great care only to pop her head out from the shower and speaks with her father. They'd had a chat about it and got it, got their heads together have they not members of the jury. It was unnecessary when you look at the diagram, the accused to put his head around the corner of the door at all, if hearing was the problem. 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown submits to you members of the jury that the accused is lying and he's supported in that lie by his daughter who is helping him out."" 
       
      
    34   Further he says:- 
     
      
       
       ""Well why did he change his story? On the one hand he says confusion, that he was confused, that he hadn't been into a police station. The Crown submits to you though members of the jury it's for this reason the evidence of Mrs. Walton is that her daughter Jane made a statement to the police in which she said that there was an incident in the kitchen in which the pimples on herself and the pimples of [the complainant] were squeezed. Faced with that half truth by his daughter the accused really had to change his story didn't he?"" 
       
      
    35   He continued further:- 
     
      
       
       ""It's a story that the accused in his desperation has invented, supported by his daughter Jane who is in, you might think, an extremely embarrassing situation. I mean if Jane had told the truth that her father in demonstrating to the young - bear in mind [the complainant] is below the age of 16 years, Jane is above the age of 16 years, that's the significance in the charges before you might think. You might think Jane's sorely embarrassed by what her father did to her that day and to cover her embarrassment she's told a story which supports the story that her father invents."" 
       
      
    36   The assertion that the appellant and his daughter had agreed to present joint lies in evidence was apparently based on his denials of discussing the events with his daughter and evidence obtained from the appellant's wife that she had discussed Jane's statement with her husband and had overheard the two referring to certain of the incidents. The content of what was said was not sought by the Prosecutor in his cross-examination. 
    37   The address powerfully built on the assertion that the jury could find support for the complainant's account in the asserted lies of the appellant and sought to nullify the daughter's account. It followed that the attack on the credibility of the daughter was essential to the line of advocacy employed. That attack was not merely casual but integral to the way in which the Crown submitted its case to the jury. 
    38   In the absence of an opportunity being afforded to rebut the attack, this address was completely indefensible. See the discussion of the necessity for fairness to witnesses by Hunt, J. in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty. Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 1 NSWLR 1. Regard should also be had to the New South Wales Barristers' Rules:- 
     
      
       
       ""35. A barrister must, when exercising the forensic judgments called for throughout the case, take care to ensure that decisions by the barrister or on the barrister's advice to invoke the coercive powers of a court or to make allegations or suggestions under privilege against any person:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) are reasonably justified by the material already available to the barrister; 
       
      
      
       
        (b) are appropriate for the robust advancement of the client's case on its merits."" 
       
      
    39   Rule 41:- 
     
      
       
       ""A barrister must not allege criminality, fraud or other serious misconduct against any person in the course of the barrister's address on the evidence unless the barrister believes on reasonable grounds that the evidence in the case provides a proper basis for the allegation."" 
       
      
    40   The Director of Public Prosecutions New South Wales Prosecution Policy and Guidelines (Rev. March 1998) which apply specifically to prosecutors incorporate the following Bar Rules:- 
     
      
       
       ""63. A prosecutor must not press the prosecution's case for a conviction beyond a full and firm presentation of that case. 
       
      
      
       
       64. A prosecutor must not, by language or other conduct, seek to inflame or bias the court against the accused."" 
       
      
    41   The Rules and Guidelines inform the more general ambit of the prosecutor's duty of fairness I referred to in my judgment in Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279 to which I shall refer later. 
    42   It is submitted by the Crown, that it must have been clear that the Crown contended that the version given in evidence by the daughter was incorrect. But the address went well beyond this. The Crown Prosecutor asserted the witness was party to an agreement to give false evidence and on that submission was based an argument that because of that, guilt could be inferred, yet the prosecutor stood back from allowing the correctness of the contention to be subjected to the acid test of putting it to the witness. Here, on appeal, it was not sought to defend that address. 
    43   A number of complaints were made in the submissions on these grounds of appeal. Specifically, it is raised that his Honour erred in his directions concerning the witness. In essence, it is put that his Honour's directions allowed the evidence of the witness to be left before the jury without the Crown's submission that it should be disregarded or discounted being the subject of an appropriate direction. It is submitted that notwithstanding there was no application for re-direction, the error was fundamental and that insofar as leave is required, it should be granted. 
    44   It seems clear enough, however, that the way in which the Crown sought to deal with the evidence in addresses had been the subject of sufficient complaint. In any event, I consider that this address and the course of conduct regarding this witness was so unfair and the directions so inadequate to deal with that unfairness that, in my view, the trial was fundamentally flawed. The Crown's submissions that his Honour adequately directed the jury on the witness' evidence must be rejected. 
    45   The trial judge did not even direct the jury that the Crown's submission that her evidence should be disregarded because she was the daughter of the accused was a submission to which they should not accede. 
    46   In Regina v. Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279, I made examination of the duties of a Crown Prosecutor and in particular, in the context of failing to call or lead evidence which did not accord with the ""game plan"" of the Crown Prosecutor although it came from an eye witness whom proper enquiry had not shown to be unreliable. In that case, the court had the benefit of the submissions on behalf of the Crown by the Crown Advocate and those submissions conceded the necessity that there be a proper basis for a determination by a Crown Prosecutor of unreliability such as not to call the witness. In that decision, I specifically made reference to the responsibility of the Crown Prosecutor to ensure that the Crown case is properly presented and presented with fairness to the accused and the court. I noted that the Prosecutor does not perform that duty by seeking to avoid having placed before the court evidence which he or she is not entitled to regard as unreliable and yet which ill accords with a theory of the accused's guilt. Similarly, it does not accord with that responsibility of the Crown Prosecutor to attack a witness in addresses after simply tendering the witness for cross-examination without affording an opportunity to the witness to deal with the matter of the attack. 
    47   In Kneebone (supra), Smart, AJ. had referred to the passage in The Queen v. Apostilides (1983-84) 154 CLR 563 at 576 in which the practice of calling a witness to permit cross-examination by the accused is referred to. In that passage it is suggested that the practice might be resorted to where a Prosecutor does not wish to lead evidence from a person named on the indictment who is able to give material evidence. 
    48   There is nothing in Kneebone (supra) or in the cases cited in the various judgments of Smart, AJ. and myself to justify what was done here to attack the witness without a proper basis. Neither that passage in Apostilides (supra) nor what was said by Smart, AJ. is to be understood as affording any imprimatur for a Crown Prosecutor to disregard evidence not, on proper enquiry, unreliable or to take a course designed to avoid putting an appropriate challenge to adverse evidence when it is elicited. Resort to that practice is not supported by the views of the majority comprising the Chief Justice and myself in Kneebone (supra). 
    49   The propositions enunciated by Smart, AJ. in that case should not be understood otherwise than in the context of the general obligation imposed upon a Crown Prosecutor to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he or she performs. 
    50   I am of the view that there was a serious irregularity in the conduct of the trial and that his Honour's directions were entirely inadequate to deal with it. His Honour did not administer the appropriate antidote. 
    51   I would uphold the remaining grounds of appeal also. 
    52   The appropriate order to be made in these proceedings should be considered from the starting point that the course adopted by the Crown both in relation to the tendering of the evidence of complaint and in relation to the evidence of the daughter has given rise to serious defects in the trial. 
    53   The jury has acquitted on one count and found guilt on the other in circumstances which I find very difficult satisfactorily to explain. The acquittal certainly does indicate a degree of lack of satisfaction with the evidence of the complainant even where evidence of her complaint from an independent source has been admitted. The complainant's evidence itself was the subject of some degree of intrinsic unlikelihood and some inconsistencies. Having regard to the decision in The Queen v. James [1999] NSWCCA 191 and the principles in Jones v. The Queen (1997) 149 ALR 598, the verdict on this count may well have been unable to be supported but considering all the circumstances to which I have referred and in the light of the principles in King v. The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423 and in Parker v. The Queen [1997] HCA 13; (1997) 186 CLR 494, particularly because the Crown Prosecutor's conduct at trial lay at the foot of the miscarriage established by the second and third grounds of appeal, I am of the view that no new trial should be ordered.  
    54   I would propose that the appeal be upheld; the conviction and sentence quashed and a verdict and judgment of acquittal entered. 
    55   BEAZLEY, JA: I agree 
    56   NEWMAN, J: I agree.

     REGINA v Phillip John SCOTT 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    3   SULLY J: Mr. Phillip John Scott, [“the applicant”], applies for leave to appeal against the asserted severity of sentences imposed on him on 16 April 1998, and by his Honour Judge McGuire sitting in the District Court at Gosford. The application was heard by the Court in conjunction with the hearing of the Attorney-General’s application which has resulted in the issue this morning of a guideline judgment in respect of offences contravening s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
    4   The relevant objective facts are within a small compass. They commence on 12 February 1996 when the applicant broke and entered premises in Orange Grove on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The applicant stole from those premises a number of items, being a cassette recorder, some power tools and some cash.  
    5   The applicant was arrested on 2 December 1996, and was charged with having broken, entered and stolen from the premises to which I have referred. The applicant denied that he had committed the offence charged against him; and in due course he was tried upon indictment in connection with that alleged offence. He pleaded not guilty; but he was found guilty by the verdict of a jury.  
    6   Upon his initial arrest on 2 December 1996 the applicant sought and was granted bail. He was released to that bail on 2 December 1996. Within an hour or thereabouts of his release on bail, the applicant committed a further offence which involved his breaking, entering and stealing from certain premises at Woy Woy. On this occasion, the defendant collected, with the obvious intention of wrongfully taking away, a number of items of electrical equipment, some items of personal jewellery, and some alcohol. The occupiers of the particular premises happened to return home before the applicant had made good his getaway. With the assistance of their Rottweiler dog, they were able to apprehend the applicant, and to keep him where he was until the police were able to attend and to arrest him. This particular offence is obviously aggravated by reason of its having been committed at a time when the applicant was at liberty on bail, and very recent bail at that. 
    7   Following his arrest on 2 December 1996, the applicant remained in custody until 24 March 1997. On that day he was granted, by a Supreme Court Judge, conditional bail. The conditions of bail required, put simply and so far as is now relevant, that the applicant go to, reside at, and otherwise take advantage of the programmes available to him at, the William Booth Centre. The applicant did in fact attend the Centre; but only for about a week. He then absconded.  
    8   In due course, and on 3 October 1997, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence committed on 2 December 1996. 
    9   The applicant failed to attend the District Court for trial on 8 April 1997, on which day both of the offences to which I have previously referred had been listed for trial in that Court. A bench warrant for the applicant’s apprehension was issued by the presiding District Court Judge. 
    10   On a date between 9 June 1997 and 24 June 1997 the applicant broke, entered and stole from a home at Umina on the Central Coast. The property then stolen included a bicycle, some power tools and some clothing. 
    11   On 10 September 1997 the applicant was arrested upon the District Court warrant. Bail was refused; and the applicant has continued in unbroken custody since that time.  
    12   On 8 April 1998 the applicant was presented for trial upon indictment in connection with the Umina offence. The indictment contained three counts. The first count charged a contravention of s.112(1) of the Crimes Act, that is to say, an offence of breaking, entering and stealing. The second count was charged in the alternative, and was a count of receiving. The third count was an additional one of breaking, entering and stealing. The applicant pleaded not guilty to each count. He was found guilty on the first count; it was therefore unnecessary to take a verdict on the second count; and he was acquitted by direction on the third count. The offences of which the applicant was thus convicted were further instances of offences committed by him while at liberty in breach of bail conditions. These particular offences breached the applicant’s obligations to be of good behaviour while at liberty on bail, being obligations imposed upon him by the two separate grants of bail made respectively by the Local Court in December 1996 and by the Supreme Court in March 1997. 
    13   On 16 April 1998 the applicant stood before his Honour Judge McGuire for sentence upon each of the three matters of which he was guilty, in one case upon his own plea, and upon each of the other two cases upon the verdict of a jury. 
    14   His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
     (a) In relation to the offence committed on 12 February 1996, his Honour passed a sentence of penal servitude for 5 years and 9 months divided between a minimum term of 3 years and 9 months and an additional term of 2 years. The minimum term was dated to commence on 10 September 1997, being the date of the applicant’s arrest on the District Court bench warrant to which I have earlier referred. 
      
      
     (b) In relation to each of the other two offences, his Honour passed a sentence of penal servitude for a fixed term of 2 years, to be served concurrently with the minimum term referred to in (a) above. 
      
    15   Upon the hearing of the present application for leave to appeal, the applicant accepted by counsel, that the aggregate sentence of 5 years and 9 months was not erroneous; but submitted that the minimum term as fixed by his Honour was so excessive as to warrant the intervention of this Court. 
    16   The objective facts as they have been recounted herein speak, essentially, for themselves. The applicant stood for sentence as a repeat offender with a very bad record. Of the three individual matters for which he thus stood for sentence, two had been committed in what can only be described as flagrant breaches of bail conditions then current. As to each of the offences, the case against the applicant was overwhelming.  
    17   The learned sentencing Judge made, in his Honour’s remarks on sentence, extensive observations concerning the objective gravity of offences of the kind committed by the applicant. I quote them at length for the reason that they are, as I respectfully think, both correct in principle, and appropriate to the individual circumstances of the present applicant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “The incidence of break, enter and steal throughout the State, but in particular on the Central Coast of New South Wales, is such as to cause grave disquiet in the community. 
       
      
      
       
       In the course of the first trial, a fingerprint expert gave evidence to the effect that he attends some ten locations a day in the course of investigating burglaries. The burglar seems to act with impunity, such as the frequency of this crime, which is carried out with brazen contempt for the law and the rights of innocent householders. 
       
      
      
       
       Right thinking members of the community are understandably angry and frustrated at the seeming immunity enjoyed by the burglar. Their dwellings are ransacked. Their goods spirited away where they will be inevitably received by some Cash Converter, loan office or pawn broker. The operators of such businesses deal with vast volumes of stolen goods on a daily basis. The fact that successive governments neglect to pass efficacious laws which might tend to hinder the daily conversion of stolen goods into money is of great comfort to the burglar and of no assistance whatsoever to the victim. 
       
      
      
       
       It is a notorious fact that householders face huge premiums, as well as the vast expense of endeavouring to make their homes secure, against those who apparently consider it their right to break into households and take whatever goods suit their purposes. 
       
      
      
       
       Clearly the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will act responsibly and impose meaningful penalties on the rare occasion when the burglar is apprehended and convicted. 
       
      
      
       
       Other would-be burglars just might be deterred when it is learnt that the crime of break, enter and steal is regarded as being grossly serious and will attract serious punishment.”  
       [Remarks on Sentence at 6-7] 
       
      
    18   The learned sentencing Judge had before him, and seems to me to have adverted correctly to, various matters subjective to the applicant. 
    19   The applicant was aged about 24 years when he stood for sentence. He is now aged a little more than 26 years. He had at all relevant times, and appears to retain, the support of parents who were described by the sentencing Judge as “loving and caring”. The applicant has very little in the way of educational or vocational skills. He has only ever had intermittent employment; although it is fair to say that he seems to have been a reasonably diligent employee whenever he had work; and that he has lost employment by reason of retrenchment rather than by reason of fault on his own part. The applicant had, when sentenced, and has, a partner and a dependent child. 
    20   The principal matter urged in support of the present application has to do with the applicant’s prior history of drug abuse. The sentencing Judge noted that his Honour had not heard any particular evidence from the applicant as to the applicant’s history of drug abuse. His Honour took note of the contents of a report which had been prepared by a Drug and Alcohol worker in connection with the applicant’s Supreme Court bail application to which I have earlier referred. His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
       “Presumably the Supreme Court Judge who granted him bail was influenced by this report but as I have stated, he demonstrated his contempt for the leniency which was granted to him, the opportunity that he was given to address any drug problems.”  
       [Remarks on Sentence at 8] 
       
      
    21   It is, of course, clear from the terms of the sentences passed upon the applicant, that the learned sentencing Judge found “special circumstances” in the sense contemplated by s.5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW); and that his Honour adjusted accordingly the minimum term and additional term components of the aggregate sentence of 5 years and 9 months. 
    22   It was submitted for the applicant that the minimum term set by the learned sentencing Judge was manifestly excessive in the sense that it manifestly failed to give any, or any sufficient, attention to factors of mercy and rehabilitation. 
    23   As to mercy, the learned sentencing Judge appears to have taken the view that the applicant had been shown plenty of mercy in the course of his repeated appearances before Courts; and that the applicant had, in effect, chosen to throw away the chances that had been thus given to him. That such a view is austere does not mean that it is wrong in law. In my opinion, the learned sentencing Judge was entirely justified in taking a severe view of the applicant’s conduct.  
    24   As to rehabilitation, the learned sentencing Judge does not seem to me to have disregarded such evidence as there was before his Honour upon that topic. Indeed, the finding of “special circumstances” entails, in the circumstances of the applicant’s case, an acknowledgment of likely benefit to the applicant from a sensibly extended additional term, and a correspondingly reduced minimum term. 
    25   Were I to deal with the present application without reference to the guideline judgment published this morning, I would be wholly unpersuaded that the learned sentencing Judge has been shown to have fallen into error requiring correction by this Court. The newly published guidelines seem to me to strengthen, rather than to weaken, the appropriateness of the course taken by the learned sentencing Judge, and the process of reasoning by which his Honour reached the findings of fact made by his Honour and the sentences imposed by him. 
    26   In my opinion, the Court should order: 
     
      
     1) that leave be granted to appeal against the sentences imposed upon the applicant; 
      
      
     2) that the appeal against those sentences should be, in the case of each sentence, dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
      
    3   SULLY J: Mr. Jason Lisle Johnson, [“the applicant”], applies for leave to appeal against the asserted severity of sentences imposed on him on 4 February 1999, and by his Honour Judge Ford QC, sitting in the District Court at Campbelltown. The application was heard by the Court in conjunction with the hearing of the Attorney-General’s application which has resulted in the issue this morning of a guideline judgment in respect of offences contravening s.112(1) of Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
    4   On 13 November 1998 the applicant was arraigned before Judge Ford. He entered pleas of guilty to seven counts, each of which charged him with a contravention of s.112(1) of the Crimes Act. He was remanded in custody for sentence. 
    5   On 4 February 1999 the applicant again appeared before Judge Ford. On this occasion, the applicant asked his Honour to take into account in connection with his sentencing upon the seven pleas of guilty earlier entered, eighteen further offences. Of those further offences, twelve were offences of breaking, entering and stealing; two were offences of breaking, entering and stealing with intent; one was an offence of entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse; one was an offence of having in custody goods reasonably suspected of having been stolen; one was an offence of possessing a prohibited drug; and one was an offence of driving a motor vehicle whilst unlicensed. 
    6   Of the seven offences to which the applicant originally pleaded guilty, one occurred in June 1995, a second in August 1995, and the remaining five offences were committed at various dates in March and April of 1997. Of the eighteen additional matters which the applicant asked to be taken into account, one occurred in December 1996, and the remaining seventeen occurred on various dates in April, May and December of 1997. 
    7   Each of the seven offences of breaking, entering and stealing to which the applicant originally pleaded guilty carried, upon conviction, a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for 14 years. The sentences in fact passed were structured as follows: on one count of the seven, the applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for 6 years, divided equally between minimum and additional terms. In respect of that sentence, his Honour Judge Ford took into account the eighteen additional matters to which reference has previously been made. On each of the remaining six of the seven original counts, his Honour imposed a fixed term of penal servitude for 3 years. All sentences were dated so as to be served concurrently. The sentences took into account pre-sentence custody; and it was not submitted to this Court that the sentencing Judge had made any error in that respect. 
    8   In terms of the relevant objective facts, the criminality of the applicant was substantial. The applicant was aged 26 years and some 5 months when he stood for sentence; and he is now aged a little over 27 years. The applicant has a very extensive criminal record, extending back to September 1988 when he was just a little over 16 years of age. The record contains a number of entries for offences of breaking, entering and stealing. Over the years, the applicant has been dealt with in various ways for offences of that kind; and on some such occasions has served sentences of imprisonment or penal servitude. 
    9   The applicant, when he stood for sentence, had a very strong subjective case. It is not necessary to detail the applicant’s past sad and dysfunctional personal and familial background. A fair overview of the applicant’s situation is contained, I think, in the following extract from the learned sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
       “Now ordinarily the great number of offences which you have committed would require that I impose a substantial period of full time custody. However, it seems to me that what is absolutely imperative at this stage is to impose a sentence which will not only inflict some penalty upon you but would also give you a fair chance of rehabilitating yourself given that you are willing to enter a rehabilitation unit such as the centre known as the Lindon Community at Canowindra. If you were to enter that sort of community you would no doubt have a much better prospect of regaining sufficient stability to live in open society and perhaps obtain gainful employment rather than carry on the sort of thefts, the break and enters which you have committed now over a period of some years.” 
        [Remarks on Sentence at 3] 
       
      
    10   It was submitted for the applicant that the learned sentencing Judge had fallen into error “in not assessing the eligibility of the applicant for entry into the ‘Drug Court’ when requested”. It will be necessary to return presently to that particular submission. 
    11   Before doing so, it is expedient to consider, first, whether the sentences imposed have been shown, that one particular ground of appeal set aside for the moment, to have been manifestly excessive so as to warrant the intervention of this Court. If that question be tested according to proper principle which is not referred particularly to the guidelines established in this morning’s guideline judgment, I am of the opinion that the sentences have not been shown to be so manifestly excessive. Given the pattern of the offences; their obvious objective criminality; the applicant’s antecedents; and the statutory maximum penalty applicable in the case of each of the seven indicted offences; I would not accept that a totally effective sentence of penal servitude for six years, being a sentence imposed in respect of, effectively, twenty-five separate offences, could fairly be regarded as calling for the intervention of this Court. 
    12   If, in addition to the foregoing considerations, there be brought to account the sentencing guidelines which are established by this morning’s guideline judgment, then the sentences imposed upon the applicant are, in my opinion, even more sustainable. 
    13   Turning, next, to the particular ground of appeal earlier mentioned, it is expedient to begin by noting the relevant provisions of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW). That Act is described, in its long title, as being:  
     
      
       
       “an Act to provide for the establishment of the Drug Court of New South Wales, for the referral of drug offenders to the Drug Court, and for the supervision of drug programs by the Drug Court:……………….” 
       
      
    14   The Drug Court Act came into operation, relevantly, on 5 February 1999; that is to say, on the day following the day upon which sentence was passed upon the applicant.  
    15   The statutory objects of the Drug Court Act are defined as follows in section 3: 
     
      
       
       “(1) The object of this Act is to reduce the level of criminal activity that results from drug dependency. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) This Act achieves that object by establishing a scheme under which drug dependent persons who are charged with criminal offences can be diverted into programs designed to eliminate, or at least reduce, their dependency on drugs. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Reducing a person’s dependency on drugs should reduce the person’s need to resort to criminal activity to support that dependency and should also increase the person’s ability to function as a law abiding citizen.” 
       
      
    16   Section 6 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “Courts may refer persons to Drug Court 
       
      
      
       
       (1) This section applies to such courts and proceedings as are prescribed by the regulations. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) It is the duty of a court before which a person is charged with an offence: 
       
      
      
       
        (a) to ascertain whether the person appears to be an eligible person, and 
       
      
      
       
        (b) if so, to ascertain whether the person is willing to be referred to the Drug Court to be dealt with for the offence, and 
       
      
      
       
        (c) if so, to refer the person to the Drug Court to be dealt with for the offence. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) The power conferred on a court by this section is to be exercised as soon as practicable after the person is charged with the offence.” 
       
      
    17   The reference in s.6(2)(a) to “an eligible person” is a reference to such a person as defined in s.5 of the Act. That section provides, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “(1) A person is an eligible person if: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the person is charged with an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection (2), and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) the facts alleged in connection with the offence, together with the person’s antecedents and any other information available to the court, indicate that it is likely that the person will, if convicted, be sentenced to imprisonment, and 
       
      
      
       
       (c) the person has pleaded guilty to, or indicated that he or she intends to plead guilty to, the offence, and 
       
      
      
       
       (d) the person appears to be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs (within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) or other drugs prescribed by the regulations, and  
       
      
      
       
       (e) the person satisfies such other criteria as are prescribed by the regulations. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) A person is not an eligible person if the person is charged with: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) an offence punishable under Division 2 of Part 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, not being an offence that (under Part 9A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) is capable of being dealt with summarily, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault, or 
       
      
      
       
       (c) any other offence of a kind prescribed by the regulations.” 
       
      
    18   Regulations have been prescribed under the Act. Regulation 6 provides that, for the purposes of s.6(1) of the Act, “the District Court, in respect of all criminal proceedings brought before it in its sittings at Campbelltown, Liverpool, Parramatta or Penrith” is a prescribed Court. 
    19   Regulation 5 establishes criteria as contemplated by s.5(1)(e) of the Act. Those criteria are, relevantly: 
     
      
       
       “5. For the purposes of section 5(1)(e) of the Act, the following criteria are prescribed as criteria that a person must satisfy in order to be an eligible person within the meaning of the Act: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the person’s  
         usual place of residence 
          must be within one of the following local government areas, namely, Auburn, Bankstown, Baulkham Hills, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Holroyd, Liverpool, Parramatta or Penrith, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) …..” 
         
        
       
      
    20   Consideration can now be given to what actually occurred, within the foregoing statutory context, at the hearing on 4 February last. 
    21   Both the applicant’s legal representative, and the Crown Prosecutor, made submissions to the sentencing Judge. In each case, the submissions were brief; but they were clear and to the point. His Honour was asked to give particular weight to the matter of the applicant’s rehabilitation from a well-entrenched heroin addiction. It was explained to his Honour, and in the words of the actual submission: 
     
      
       
       “This period of time in custody, Mr. Johnson has done quite difficult - with some difficulty, he has spent approximately three months in the psychiatric ward at Long Bay institution. He spent a further six months in the Crisis Support Programme at Long Bay and he’s currently doing his time in protective custody.” 
       
      
    22   His Honour, having heard all the submissions on sentence, said that he had “just been wondering whether it may not be feasible to refer this matter to the new Drug Court that has been established”. It appears from the relevant transcript that the proceedings were then let stand in the list while everybody concerned gave some thought to that tentative suggestion of his Honour.  
    23   In due course the Court reconvened; and his Honour invited submissions concerning his previous suggestion. It is clear from what followed that both the Crown Prosecutor and the applicant’s representative were not well informed about the structure and operation of the newly legislated scheme. The applicant’s representative was particularly concerned about the eligibility of the applicant in so far as that eligibility was conditional upon his being able to fulfil the requirements of Regulation 5(a) as to his “usual place of residence”. 
    24   What then ensued is best explained by reference to the relevant transcript. 
     
      
       
       “HIS HONOUR: Tell me, briefly, do you agree with the suggestion or not? 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: Well your Honour, if I was more clear on what the criteria were for usually live in the area, then if in fact he fit those criteria, yes I would be making such an application. 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: I am perfectly willing to deal with him now, if you wish me to do so. 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: Perhaps your Honour, I could make such an application and the determination of usually live in could be decided at this stage. 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: Would you say that again? 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: I am sorry your Honour. Perhaps I could make the application at this stage and perhaps then it would be to your Honour to decide whether or not he met the criteria of usually live in Western Sydney. 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: You think that it maybe a good idea? 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: I think, if in fact he fit -- 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: No please, don’t move away from the speaker. Yes, go on. 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: If he were to fit the criteria, yes I would be willing to make such an application and wishing to have such an application. However, I am uncertain and have no guidelines as to what is usually live in the Western Sydney region and I’d be misleading the court to suggest that he did. 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: All right, well you do not adopt the suggestion? 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: I do adopt it your Honour, yes or make such an application your Honour, however I don’t mean to -- 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: Please move back. 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: I don’t mean to be saying to your Honour that I am putting to the court that Mr. Johnson usually lives in the Sydney Western Region, because it is my understanding that that is probably not the case.. 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: Yes, very well, I will proceed then to deal with the matter. 
       
      
      
       
       HAMILTON: Thank you, your Honour.” 
       
      
    25   Before this Court, learned Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that the effect of what happened at the relevant hearing was that the applicant was wrongly “deprived of assessment for the opportunity of availing himself of the Drug Court as an appropriate sentencing option”. 
    26   The short answer to that submission is, in my opinion, that it is not a fair rendering of what in fact took place on the relevant occasion. The legislation in question was novel; had only recently been enacted; and was not yet in force. Nobody had any idea of how the legislation might turn out in practice. I think that it is a fair inference from what is recorded that both the applicant’s then representative and the Crown Prosecutor were taken by surprise by the suggestion made by his Honour. In that situation, it would have been entirely proper and appropriate for the applicant’s legal representative to have sought a short adjournment to a date after the coming into operation of the Drug Court Act. It is, in my opinion, a fair inference from what took place on 4 February that his Honour, had such an application been made, would more probably than not have granted it in order that some proper information might be put together and presented in connection with the eligibility of the applicant for consideration in terms of the provisions of the Drug Court Act. 
    27   No such application was in fact made. My reading of the relevant transcript has left me with the impression, (although I acknowledge that I can put the point no higher), that the applicant’s then legal representative got what information she could; discerned, correctly as I think, that there appeared to be real problems in fitting the applicant’s “usual place of residence” into the relevant provisions of Regulation 5; and decided thereupon that it was probably better, from the applicant’s own point of view, to bring his sentencing to finality, rather than to put it off. I do not imply any criticism of either that judgment or that decision. I do no more than observe that, in my opinion, it is a reasonable inference that the applicant’s legal representative did in fact consider his Honour’s suggestion; and did in fact decide, for what I think were understandable reasons, to have the sentencing proceedings finalised without further delay. 
    28   In those circumstances, I do not think that it has been demonstrated that the learned primary Judge fell into error at all in connection with what was, as I think, nothing more than speculation on his Honour’s part that it might possibly be worth the applicant’s while to consider the availability of a reference under the Drug Court Act, after that legislation had come into operation. 
    29   In my opinion, therefore, the applicant has not demonstrated such error as would warrant the present intervention of this Court. 
    30   In my opinion the Court should order: 
     
      
     1) that leave be granted to the applicant to appeal against the sentences passed upon him in the District Court; 
      
      
     2) that the appeal against such sentences be dismissed.

        REGINA v Janice Margaret FREEMAN aka KELLY 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
         
        
       
      
    1     SPIGELMAN CJ: I have read the judgment of Hidden J in draft. The facts and issues appear therein. 
     
      
       
      
    2     Section 165 of the Evidence Act requires a trial judge to make a finding of fact, relevantly whether, pursuant to s165(1)(d), a witness “might reasonably be supposed to be criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”. 
     
      
       
      
    3     Upon such a finding, s165(2) requires the judge to give a warning and provide information to the jury unless, in the exercise of a discretion conferred on the trial judge, he or she finds under s165(3) that “there are good reasons for not doing so”. 
     
      
       
      
    4     There are significant restrictions on the ability of this Court to intervene with a finding of fact, or the exercise of a discretion, of this character. (See Regina v Flood [1999] NSWCCA 198 at 9-19 and 22). 
     
      
       
      
    5     It is not enough that this Court would have come to a different conclusion as to whether a witness “might reasonably be supposed to be criminally concerned in the events.” This Court’s jurisdiction is found in s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which requires, relevantly, “wrong decision of any question of law” or “a miscarriage of justice”. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The former will rarely be applicable to findings of the character under consideration. “There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact”. (Waterford v The Commonwealth (1986-87) 163 CLR 54 at 77. 
     
      
       
      
    7     I agree with Hidden J that there was evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred that Mr Johnson was criminally involved. If, as Hidden J concludes, the finding of the trial judge was that there was no such evidence, then that finding does involve a question of law. I agree that the trial judge’s remarks in the present case are consistent with such a finding, although it is not clear. In a case in which a trial judge holds that there is evidence but it is insufficient to satisfy the statutory test, no question of law is involved. This Court will not interfere merely because it would have come to a different conclusion. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Whether, alternatively, there has been a miscarriage of justice depends on a consideration of all the circumstances. In the present case, the issue can be determined on the basis of the inadequacy of the reasons given by the trial judge. 
     
      
       
      
    9     The entirety of his Honour’s finding and reasons appear to be encompassed in the following statement during exchange with counsel: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Well I don’t reasonably suppose that Mr Johnson was concerned in the events, do you?”. 
         
        
       
      
    10     This statement, is, in my opinion, an inadequate statement of reasons for the finding. The inadequacy is such as to constitute legal error in the decision and a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      
    11     The evidence of Mr Johnson, as Hidden J shows, was an important part of the Crown case against both Appellants. His Honour’s peremptory dismissal of the submission made on behalf of one of the Appellants in which, for the reasons explained by Hidden J, the other Appellant should be taken to have joined, was not appropriate in view of the significance of the evidence in the case against both Appellants. 
     
      
       
      
    12     In R v Beattie [1996] 40 NSWLR 155 at 160, James J with whom Grove J and Hamilton AJ agreed said, with respect to s165: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In declining to give the directions asked for, the trial judge did not state any reasons for declining to give the direction. It may be that it is not essential that in all cases in which a judge is of the opinion that there are good reasons for not complying with s165(2) the judge should expressly state what he considers those reasons to be. There is no express requirement in the section itself that the reasons be stated. It may, for example, be quite obvious, in the particular circumstances of an individual case, but evidence which happens to fall within one or other of the paragraphs of subs (1) and is therefore evidence to which s165 applies, is not unreliable. However, in most cases at least, a trial judge should, in my opinion, state what he considers to be the good reasons for not complying with subs (2)”. 
         
        
       
      
    13     I would add to the reference by his Honour to the need for reasons with respect to the exercise of the discretion under s165(3), that a similar approach is required with respect to a finding of fact that any paragraph of s165(1) relied on by an accused is not established.  
     
      
       
      
    14     In many circumstances it will be obvious as to the reasons for the rejection of a submission with respect to such a matter. It was not obvious here.  
     
      
       
      
    15     Elaborate reasons are not required. However, sufficient must be said, particularly with respect to evidence that was as central to the Crown case as the evidence of Mr Johnson in these proceedings, so that an independent fair-minded observer would accept that the accused had a fair trial according to law. A dismissive conclusory assertion, merely repeating the words of the statute, does not satisfy such a test. 
     
      
       
      
    16     For this reason, I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J that the appeal should be allowed and that there should be a new trial. 
     
      
       
      
    17     In view of my conclusion with respect to this ground of appeal, it is not necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal.

     R v Graham John TARANTO 
      
     R v Janice Margaret FREEMAN aka KELLY 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    18     DUNFORD J: In this case I have had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgments of Spigelman CJ and Hidden J. I agree with Hidden J that in the present case there was evidence capable of raising a reasonable supposition that Mr Johnson was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charge and therefore the trial judge was required to comply with a party's request under s 165(2) to warn the jury about that witness' evidence unless, in the circumstances of the case, there were good reasons not to do so: subs (3). I agree that as he failed to do so the trial miscarried and there must be a new trial.  
     
      
       
      
    19     I also agree with Spigelman CJ that a trial judge who refuses a request to give a warning under the section should state his reasons for so doing whether such reasons be that any of the relevant paragraphs of s 165(1) have not been established or be discretionary grounds under subs (3).  
     
      
       
      
    20     In the circumstances I find it unnecessary to express a view on any of the other grounds argued before us. I agree with the orders proposed.

     Judgment 
    21     HIDDEN J: The appellants, Graham John Taranto and Janice Margaret Kelly (aka Freeman), were tried with a jury in the District Court upon an indictment charging wounding with intent to murder and, in the alternative, malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr Taranto was found not guilty of wounding with intent to murder but guilty of the alternative charge. Ms Kelly was found guilty of malicious wounding simpliciter, which is a statutory alternative verdict in respect of the count of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr Taranto was later sentenced to penal servitude for fourteen years, comprising a minimum term of ten years and an additional term of four years. Ms Kelly was sentenced to penal servitude for three and a half years, comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of eighteen months. Both appeal against their convictions and seek leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
        
       The evidence 
        
       
      
    22     It was common ground that in the early hours of Saturday, 17 August 1996 the complainant, Ms Deborah Kerr, was shot in her town house at Mt Pleasant. The two appellants believed that an associate of her’s had stolen jewellery belonging to Ms Kelly from their home at Kingswood the previous afternoon. They went to the complainant’s home in the belief that she knew the whereabouts of the jewellery or, at least, the suspected thief, and it was on that occasion that the shooting occurred.  
     
      
       
      
    23     They went to the premises in company with several other people, including Mr Mark Johnson, who was an important Crown witness. Mr Johnson had earlier gone to their home for the purpose of making inquiries about an armed robbery perpetrated at the home of a friend of his. Ms Kelly told him about the theft of her jewellery, and the effect of his evidence was that he believed that the complainant might be able to provide information leading to the identification of the offenders in the armed robbery. It is at this point that the cases for the Crown and the appellants part company.  
     
      
       
      
    24     According to Mr Johnson, when he arrived at the appellants’ home Mr Taranto was holding a pistol, which he tucked into the back of his trousers underneath his shirt. Later, Mr Taranto was seated at a table in the kitchen, cleaning the magazine of the pistol and the bullets in it. He replaced the loaded magazine into the weapon and again concealed it under his shirt. Mr Johnson’s evidence was to the effect that Ms Kelly must also have seen this. When they left to go to the complainant’s home, Mr Taranto placed a ·303 rifle, wrapped in a blanket, on the back seat of the car in which he and Ms Kelly were travelling.  
     
      
       
      
    25     The complainant’s evidence was that she opened her front door to see the appellants at the door and two men standing at the gate of the property. After some initial conversation, she invited Ms Kelly in but Mr Taranto also forced his way inside and hit her on the head with a metal object. The front door gave onto the lounge room and the force of the blow knocked her to the floor of that room, some distance from the door. She got to her feet and spoke briefly about the jewellery to Ms Kelly, who was standing in front of her. Mr Taranto was standing to her right, very close to her. She heard “a pop sound”, smelt gun powder, and felt the sensation of being shot. However, she did not see a weapon at any stage.  
     
      
       
      
    26     Mark Johnson gave evidence that he was standing at the gate to the premises when the complainant opened the front door. There was a scuffle between her, Ms Kelly and Mr Taranto, whereupon he walked up to the doorway (although, apparently, not into the lounge room). From that position, he saw Mr Taranto produce his gun and fire it at the complainant. Asked where Mr Taranto was in relation to the complainant, he said that he was “within a foot away from her, he was right on her”. 
     
      
       
      
    27     The appellants left the premises, as did Mr Johnson. The complainant sought help from neighbours and later was conveyed by ambulance to the Nepean Hospital. She had sustained gunshot wounds to the sub-mandibular region and the area of the left shoulder. The entry wound occurred on the right side of the jaw, the exit wound was on the left side, and there was a secondary entry wound in the left shoulder. There was evidence, to which it will be necessary to return, that there were powder burns around the entry wound to the jaw.  
     
      
       
      
    28     Ms Kelly was arrested on 18 August 1996. She told police that she was at home with Mr Taranto and other people at the time of the shooting, and she maintained that account in an electronically recorded interview. However, on 26 August, she took part in a second recorded interview, in which she admitted having gone with the others to the complainant’s home. She said that Mr Taranto shot the complainant and she claimed not to have been aware that he had a gun.  
     
      
       
      
    29     Mr Taranto was not arrested until 12 November 1996. After the incident he stayed for some time with his brother at Sutherland, and when police attended his home at Kingswood on the day of his arrest he ran away and hid inside the roof space of a garage. It will be necessary to return to this evidence also. He declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
      
    30     At trial, Mr Taranto gave evidence in which he denied having shot the complainant or, indeed, having had a gun in his possession. The effect of his evidence was that it was Mr Johnson who shot the complainant. According to Mr Taranto, Mr Johnson had also come into the complainant’s lounge room and was standing a few feet from the front door at the time of the shooting. (In her second police interview, Ms Kelly also claimed that Mr Johnson was in the room at that time. It seems that this was also the observation of another witness, Darren Henderson, whose statement to police was received in evidence.) Mr Taranto said that he heard a loud bang and saw a flash, whereupon he saw Mr Johnson leaving the premises. He observed that the complainant was injured but, he said, his own reaction was to leave as he did not want to get involved in whatever was happening.  
     
      
       
      
    31     The Crown case against Ms Kelly was that she was party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Taranto to assault the complainant, knowing that Mr Taranto had a gun and contemplating the possibility that he might use it. She did not give evidence at trial. Her case was in accordance with her second police interview, that is, that Mr Taranto shot the complainant but she did not know that he was carrying a gun. Accordingly, it was her case that she did not take part in a criminal enterprise in which she contemplated the use of a firearm.  
     
      
       
        
       The Appeal 
        
       
      
    32     A number of grounds of appeal were argued, some of them common to both appellants. None of counsel who appeared in this Court had appeared at the trial. 
     
      
       
        
       The evidence of Mark Johnson 
        
       
      
    33     Both appellants complain that the learned trial judge failed adequately to warn the jury that the evidence of Mr Johnson might be unreliable. I have already referred to the importance of his evidence in the Crown case. He claimed to have seen Mr Taranto shoot the complainant, and it was from his evidence that it might have been inferred that Ms Kelly knew that Mr Taranto was armed. Obviously, his credibility loomed large. 
     
      
       
      
    34     He was cross-examined about his substantial criminal record, which included offences involving the use of firearms. He was also a registered police informer, and he acknowledged having gained a benefit on penalty for a charge which he faced as a result of his willingness to give evidence against the appellants. His Honour dealt with these matters in summing-up. It was submitted that these directions were insufficient but, in the light of the matter to which I am about to refer, I do not find it necessary to decide this. 
     
      
       
      
    35     The major argument in support of this ground was that his Honour declined to give what might be loosely described as an accomplice direction: s165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act, and gave no adequate reasons for that decision. Section 165 requires a trial judge, upon the request of a party, to warn the jury about evidence which may be unreliable unless he or she considers that there are good reasons for not doing so. Without purporting to be exhaustive, subs(1) sets out certain categories of evidence which may be unreliable, including:  
     
      
       
        
         
         (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding… 
         
        
       
      
    36     In the course of the summing-up, a direction was sought by counsel then appearing for Mr Taranto on two occasions. The first occasion is recorded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         SEGAL : … perhaps more controversially your Honour I ask your Honour to give a direction in the nature of an accomplice direction. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In relation to who? 
         
        
        
         
         SEGAL: With respect to Mark Johnson. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well I won’t. 
         
        
       
      
    37     On the second occasion the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
         SEGAL: But another shorthand word I’ve mentioned earlier your Honour, when I asked for an accomplice direction that was a shorthand way of referring to the s165D (sic) direction where a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to - - 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes. Well I don’t reasonably suppose that Mr Johnson was concerned in the offence, do you? 
         
        
        
         
         SEGAL: It’s because the accused has given evidence that he didn’t (sic) raise as the reasonable hypothesis, or the reasonable examination (sic) that Mark Johnson did. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: As I said earlier Mr Segal we are concerned with facts, we are not concerned with fantasy. 
         
        
        
         
         SEGAL: Well, your Honour I only just wanted to clear up any terminology that I may have used. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I knew what you meant, and I think the lawyers know that there’s a requirement, when an accused asks for it, that there be a direction. What do you say Mr Crown, should I give a direction under 164 (sic) concerning the unreliability of Mr - - 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: No, I don’t think I should either. 
         
        
       
      
    38     It would be a matter for the trial judge in any case to determine whether there was evidence capable of raising a reasonable supposition that a Crown witness was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charge. If so, the judge would be required to comply with a party’s request under s165(2) to warn the jury about that witness’ evidence unless, in the circumstances of the case, there were good reasons not to do so: subs(3). Ordinarily, a judge exercising the discretion under subs(3) should state what those reasons are: R v Beattie (1996) 40 NSWLR 155, per James J at 160. Whether the witness was in fact criminally concerned in the relevant events, of course, would be a matter for the jury to determine. In many cases, that might not be in dispute. 
     
      
       
      
    39     In the present case, it would appear from the second exchange with counsel quoted above that his Honour did not consider that there was any evidence which might raise a reasonable supposition that Mr Johnson was criminally involved in the incident. With respect, I do not consider that the matter could be so easily disposed of. In the first place, there was the evidence of Mr Taranto suggesting that Mr Johnson himself was responsible for the shooting. Whatever his Honour might have thought of it, that was evidence for the jury to evaluate. 
     
      
       
      
    40     However, the matter does not end there. There was evidence from which it might be inferred that, in any event, Mr Johnson was criminally involved in the affair upon much the same basis as that alleged against Ms Kelly. His own evidence was that, when he first arrived at the appellants’ home, he said that something had to be done about the robbery committed at his friend’s home and Mr Taranto agreed. It is clear that they set off in search of the perpetrators of the robbery and the theft from the appellants’ home and, if they had found them, it seems unlikely that they would have allowed them the benefit of normal legal process. Equally, it is unlikely that much patience or courtesy would have been extended to anyone from whom they sought information about the culprits.  
     
      
       
      
    41     Mr Johnson said that he wished only to make enquiries of the complainant and intended her no harm. However, he acknowledged that he was aware that Mr Taranto was armed. It was open to the jury to find that he foresaw that there might be a confrontation with the complainant in which a firearm was used. It is true that, although cross-examination touched on this issue, it was never squarely put to him. Nevertheless, there was sufficient in the evidence fairly to admit of that conclusion.  
     
      
       
      
    42     Accordingly, it appears to me that there was material capable of founding a reasonable supposition that Mr Johnson was criminally concerned, on one basis or the other, in the events giving rise to the charges. At the very least, if his Honour thought otherwise, it was incumbent upon him to give reasons for that view.  
     
      
       
      
    43     It seems that counsel for Mr Taranto at the trial sought a direction only on the basis of his client’s evidence to the effect that it was Mr Johnson who shot the complainant, and he did not argue that Mr Johnson might also have been criminally liable as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. The fact that he did not do so might be explained by the somewhat peremptory manner in which his Honour dealt with the matter. 
     
      
       
      
    44     No direction was sought by counsel for Ms Kelly at the trial, but in an affidavit in this Court he explained that he saw no point in doing so in the light of the fate of his colleague’s application. In any event, a request under s165(2) by any party to the proceedings is sufficient to raise the prima facie duty of a trial judge to give a warning.  
     
      
       
      
    45     This was an important matter bearing upon the reliability of Mr Johnson’s evidence, and one which affected the case of both appellants. In my view, his Honour’s failure to give the direction sought, without expressing any adequate reasons for doing so, constitutes a miscarriage of justice necessitating a new trial. That being so, it is unnecessary to determine the other grounds of appeal. However, as there must be a new trial, I think it appropriate to express my view about two matters relating to the admissibility of evidence raised by counsel for Mr Taranto.  
     
      
       
        
       Admissibility of evidence of flight 
        
       
      
    46     I have referred to evidence that Mr Taranto sought to avoid apprehension by police. The Crown relied upon this evidence as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt on his part. Similar reliance was placed upon evidence that Ms Kelly lied to police when she was first interviewed. Grounds of appeal concerning the adequacy of his Honour’s directions about this evidence are among those which I find it unnecessary to decide.  
     
      
       
      
    47     In evidence at the trial Mr Taranto put forward reasons for his desire to avoid apprehension. He said that he left the scene of the incident because he “panicked”. He was later informed that Mr Johnson had told police that he was responsible for the shooting and he believed that, as Mr Johnson was a police informer, “his word would go stronger than my own”. Later again, he received information which led him to believe that there would be “a shoot out” if police found him.  
     
      
       
      
    48     As it happens, there may have been another reason for Mr Taranto’s desire to evade the police. In the absence of the jury, his Honour was told that he faced unrelated charges of goods in custody, possessing a prohibited drug and possessing an unlicensed pistol. Clearly, Mr Taranto would not have wished to reveal that matter as an explanation for his conduct. This led to an objection to the evidence, apparently on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice: s137 of the Evidence Act. His Honour admitted the evidence, saying that it was a matter for Mr Taranto how he dealt with it and intimating that, if he chose to reveal those outstanding charges, any prejudice would be remedied by appropriate directions. 
     
      
       
      
    49     I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in this regard. Mr Taranto gave evidence of other reasons for his flight. The situation is materially different from that considered by White J in The Queen v Bridgman (1980) 24 SASR 278, where the only explanation the accused could give for his flight was his fear that his parole in respect of another offence might be revoked if he were found guilty of the offence for which he stood trial. Similarly, there is no parallel between this case and The Queen v Hartwick (Court of Appeal of Victoria, unreported, 20 December 1995). In that case, evidence of flight was held to have been wrongly admitted in the appellant’s trial for armed robbery because the same evidence had been used in an earlier trial of the appellant for a different armed robbery, of which he had been convicted. Again, it seems that the only reason that the appellant could have advanced for his conduct was his involvement in the other offence. 
     
      
       
      
    50     That evidence of flight might properly be admitted in circumstances such as those in the present case was recognised in R v Melrose (1987) 30 ACrim R 332, per Connolly J at 335, 337 and Shepherdson J at 338. If the same objection should be taken at the appellant’s re-trial, it would be a matter for the trial judge to determine it in the light of the circumstances as he or she finds them. I say no more than that, on the material before him, it was open to his Honour to have admitted the evidence. 
     
      
       
        
       Admissibility of evidence of powder burns 
        
       
      
    51     I referred earlier to evidence that there were powder burns around the entry wound on the complainant’s jaw. In evidence was an ambulance service patient report, which noted an entry wound to the right side of the throat with “? powder burns to area”. Also in evidence was the operation record from the Nepean Hospital, referring to the entry wound in the right sub-mandibular region and adding, “Powder burns surrounding entry point”. The authors of those documents were not called. The doctor who attended the complainant in the emergency department of the hospital did give evidence, but it seems that he was not present in the operating theatre and he said nothing about powder burns. 
     
      
       
      
    52     On the face of it, both documents were admissible as business records: s69 of the Evidence Act. Nevertheless, they were objected to, again on the basis that their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. To understand the objection, it is necessary to examine the significance of the evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    53     The Crown relied upon the powder burns as evidence that the complainant was shot at very close range. This was said to confirm the proposition that it was Mr Taranto who shot her, as he was standing very close to her at the time. The difficulty is that, for the purpose of the science of ballistics, the term “powder burns” lacks precision. 
     
      
       
      
    54     Snr Const Wise of the forensic ballistics section was called in the Crown case. Mr Francis Lawton, a consultant in ammunition, weapons and explosives, was called in the defence case. Both experts recognised that the interpretation of powder burns on a victim’s skin was subject to a number of variables, including the nature of the weapon, the length of the barrel, the type of ammunition and the propellant used. More importantly, both experts explained that there are three types of injuries which a layman might describe as powder burns. 
     
      
       
      
    55     “Searing” is the burning of the flesh around the entrance to the wound caused by burning propellant emitting from the muzzle of the weapon. The weapon would need to be quite close to the skin to cause searing: according to Snr Const Wise, no more than twelve inches away. “Sooting” is the deposit of fine particles of carbon, a by-product of the burning propellant, on the skin. Snr Const Wise said that this could occur when the weapon was held up to two feet from the victim. “Tattooing” is an injury of coarser appearance, caused by unburnt propellant particles striking the skin. This could occur, said Snr Const Wise, from a distance of up to a metre. 
     
      
       
      
    56     It is apparent, then, that one would need to know exactly what type of powder burns the complainant had sustained before any reliable conclusion could be drawn about the distance of the weapon from her when it was fired. There were photographs of the complainant in evidence, but it seems that they were not clear enough to enable the experts to determine the type of injury. The range of possible distances was such as to embrace the possibility that Mr Johnson had shot the complainant, certainly if he were in the room at that time. 
     
      
       
      
    57     Accordingly, I think that it would be desirable for the authors of the ambulance report and the operation report to be called, so that the precise nature of the powder burns they observed could be examined. Of course, it may well be that they now have no adequate recollection, in which case there may be little point in calling them. In that event, the documents would still be admissible but their weight would be diminished. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    58     I would propose that the appeals be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.

     The respondent had a significant criminal record including many offences of breaking entering and stealing and allied crimes. He was arrested in possession of loot from like offences and after charging, released on bail. He failed to appear. A year later he was again arrested virtually red-handed after another breaking entering and stealing. A pre-sentence report stated that non-custodial options could not be recommended in the absence of demonstration that drug problems had been overcome. The respondent sought a long adjournment so as to be able to show his endeavour at rehabilitation. At the final sentencing hearing, favourable information was presented. The respondent was released on recognizance on two counts and sentenced to 500 hours community service on a third. 
      
       
      
     HELD: The orders failed to reflect the objective circumstances of the offences and represented manifestly inadequate sentence. The respondent’s efforts towards rehabilitation should be encouraged but a custodial sentence was demanded by the circumstances followed by an extended period of parole.

     SPIGELMAN CJ : 
       
      I agree with Grove J.

     GROVE J: This appeal was heard in conjunction with applications by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions for a guideline judgment in connection with offences of breaking, entering and stealing punishable pursuant to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The respondent Ponfield pleaded guilty in Wollongong District Court to three counts of breaking entering and stealing and asked to be taken into account on Form 1 an offence of possessing implements capable of entering and driving a conveyance and an offence of failing to appear. J.B. Phelan DCJ deferred passing sentence in respect of counts 1 and 2 upon the respondent entering a recognizance himself in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for a period of eighteen months on the condition that he continue under the supervision of the Probation Service and in particular except such direction as it gives in relation to drug rehabilitation “including full time rehabilitation” if that is considered necessary and on the third count his Honour imposed 500 hours community service. 
      
       
      
     4     
     In relation to counts 1 and 2 the facts were that at about 8 pm on 3 June 1997 the attention of police was drawn to the respondent whose motor car was being towed away. A search of his vehicle revealed two pillowcases hidden under a jacket in the rear seat, each of which contained a quantity of jewellery, jewellery cases, purses and cash. The respondent admitted breaking into houses in the nearby area. In the first premises the respondent had broken the rear bedroom window with a screwdriver and taken a pillowslip from the bedroom to carry away items. All of the property was recovered with the exception of two small purses, a necklace, an earring and $310 in cash. The total value of unrecovered property was assessed at just over $1,250 and there was some damage to a blind and a jewellery box as well as the broken window. The respondent had cut his finger in the course of his activity and there were apparent bloodstains on the pillowcases. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The premises in relation to the third count were entered by removal of a fly screen at the rear kitchen window preparatory to using the screwdriver to break the window. A bedside lamp was also broken. Inside cupboards and wardrobe drawers were opened and clothing scattered around the bedroom. Most of the property from these premises to the approximate value of $2,000 was recovered but miscellaneous pieces of jewellery and a leather case to the value of $486 were unrecovered. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The respondent, as I have stated, admitted his offences but was vague in recalling details. He claimed he had taken thirteen Serapax tablets earlier in the evening. In respect of these charges the respondent was bailed to appear in due course. 
      
       
      
     7     
     At about 2.45 pm on 5 June 1998 the respondent was observed by police walking along the road carrying a floral pillowcase. There were outstanding warrants for the arrest of the respondent relating to his failure to appear in respect of the charges which became counts 1 and 2 and the respondent was stopped by police and searched. The respondent had placed jewellery, money and documents taken from premises in the pillowcase. He had also removed a video cassette recorder but found it awkward to carry and had placed it under a neighbouring house. 
      
       
      
     8     
     After arrest he directed police to the location where he had broken in and made admissions in relation to his offence. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The respondent was twenty eight years of age when he appeared for sentence. His record contained eighteen separate entries many of which involved multiple offences. There were eight convictions for breaking and entering and stealing; three convictions for breaking and entering with intent and one conviction for attempting to break enter and steal. In 1992 he was sentenced to sixteen months penal servitude (twelve months minimum term) for robbery in company. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The respondent appeared before Mitchelmore DCJ on 7 December 1998 when he was arraigned and pleaded guilty to the counts in the indictment. An adjournment was granted in order for a pre-sentence report to be provided. On 19 February 1999 the respondent appeared before J.B. Phelan DCJ. The pre-sentence report was available and the solicitor then representing the respondent asked for “an adjournment of sorts” in relation to the matter. In response to his Honour’s enquiry it was revealed that the pre-sentence report disclosed that the respondent was not suitable for non-custodial options because there was no confirmation that he no longer had a problem with non prescription or illicit drugs. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the converse was not demonstrated either. The solicitor continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “It would be my application that it be the subject of a relative (sic) lengthy adjournment period in which he would submit himself to urine analysis at the Probation and Parole Service in order to demonstrate his instructions to me that he is completely clean of both prescription and elicit (sic) drugs.” 
         
        
       
      
     11     
     Counsel for the Crown responded to enquiry from the presiding judge that there was no opposition to that application. 
      
       
      
     12     
     On the adjourned date (21 May 1999) the respondent gave evidence that at the time of the offences he was taking multiple prescription drugs which he had acquired by consulting different medical practitioners. He testified that at the time he had a depressive illness and was suffering from a back injury. He was currently on a methadone program. 
      
       
      
     13     
     It can be observed that as of 22 September 1999 the respondent had completed 96¼ hours of community service. A letter was forwarded by the Legal Aid Commission to the Registrar conveying information from the Probation and Parole Service that, as at 31 October 1999, the respondent had completed 137.5 hours and was working satisfactorily. Urine results for the period 26 February 1999 to 4 September 1999 indicated the presence of methadone only. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the remand was “clearly” of the type discussed in  
     Griffiths v The Queen 
      1977 137 CLR 293. The argument was developed to contend that the lengthy adjournment was to give the offender an opportunity to make good his promises “with a view to imposing a non-custodial sentence at the end of it”. It was argued that if there was no prospect of a non custodial outcome there was no point in the adjournment. As the extract above shows, the adjournment did not arise from any indication emanating from the presiding judge but rather was a specific application on behalf of the respondent in order to enable him to demonstrate a matter which it was desired to advance in mitigation particularly his adherence to seeking rehabilitation. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The absence of objection by the Crown and the granting of the application by the Bench do not to my mind indicate any foreshadowing of the prospect of non custodial sentence. In essence the respondent was being given the opportunity to prove a matter which he desired to raise. 
      
       
      
     15     
     In the event the respondent was successful in demonstrating his adherence to his desire to pursue rehabilitation and the presiding judge did impose non custodial sentences. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The issue for this Court is whether those sentences were manifestly inadequate and if they were, whether the discretion of this Court to dismiss the Crown’s appeal notwithstanding that inadequacy should be invoked. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Five aspects can be noted. There were multiple offences; the offence specified in the third count was committed whilst he was on bail, there was damage to property; there were matters taken into account on Form 1 and the respondent had a considerable prior record including offences of identical nature. These are instances of matters of a kind to be taken into consideration in accordance with the guideline judgment delivered today. They are, however, circumstances of aggravation well recognized prior to that judgment and the account to be taken of them is not dependent upon evidence (in the sense elaborated in s29A of the Criminal Procedure Act) used in giving the guideline judgment or upon evidence which was not given in the trial court. 
      
       
      
     18     
     The respondent is entitled to consideration for his pleas of guilty and ready admissions of offence. The benefit is rendered somewhat less valuable, however, by the circumstances that he was virtually caught redhanded and the cases against him were overwhelming. In respect of the first two counts despite his admissions, he failed to appear to be dealt with in respect of pleas of guilty. His steps, indeed strides, towards rehabilitation have been commendable and it is in the interests of both prisoner and the community that he achieve his apparent goal. 
      
       
      
     19     
     Nevertheless given all matters, including the very favourable matters available to the respondent, I have concluded that the decision of the learned sentencing judge to impose wholly non custodial sentences so completely failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences that the sentences must be assessed as manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
      
     20     
     In my view the jurisdiction of this Court should be invoked to correct the error. Having regard to the express terms of s29A(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, I should record that my view is no different from that to which I come if no guideline judgment were to be promulgated. 
      
       
      
     21     
     However, as I have said, there is importance not only to the respondent but to the community in the continuance of the respondent upon the path to rehabilitation, and the achievement of what appear to be good prospects of achieving his goal. The conditions of the deferred sentence are matters which should be reimposed during an extended additional term during which the respondent should continue under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The need for this extended term amounts to special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 
      
       
      
     22     
     I propose that the Crown appeal be allowed and the orders made in the District Court quashed. In lieu thereof on each count the respondent be sentenced to penal servitude for a total of two years to be served concurrently. Those sentences to consist of a minimum term of six months commencing today, 16 December 1999 and to expire on 15 June 2000 together with an additional term of eighteen months to commence on 16 June 2000. The respondent be ordered released to parole on 15 June 2000 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and that it be a condition of parole that he report to that service within forty eight hours of release from custody. It be noted that the matters on Form 1 are taken into account in respect of the sentence imposed upon the first count.

     REGINA v Patrick HUDD 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    2   BARR J: The appellant was convicted by a District Court jury of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment. His co-accused, who was also convicted and sentenced, was Julianne Kay Dufty. The appellant’s appeal to this Court against the conviction was dismissed on 9 December 1994, though his sentence was reduced. On 9 March 1999 the appellant applied under the provisions of s 474D Crimes Act for an inquiry into his conviction and on 18 June 1999 an order was made in accordance with s 474E(1)(b) that the proceedings be referred to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. There was one ground for the application, and that became the sole ground of appeal, namely that the conviction of the appellant constituted a miscarriage of justice due to the unavailability at the trial of certain fresh evidence concerning a Crown witness, Sergeant Nomchong. 
     
      
    3   The Crown case was that on 27 May 1989 the appellant was stopped by police in Lamb’s Lane, Goulburn. They carried out a search but found nothing. They took him to his house, which was nearby, and there found a considerable quantity of heroin, among other things. They charged the appellant with the supply of the heroin. 
     
      
    4   The appellant, who knew that he had no answer to the charge, set about recruiting people to give false evidence at his trial in order to make his activities at the time of his arrest and at other relevant times appear innocent and to make it look as though the police had falsely accused a man they knew was innocent. In doing so he engaged the assistance of Ms Dufty. One prospective witness they recruited was Darren Worthington, a man the appellant met in gaol. 
     
      
    5   During their endeavours the appellant produced and he and Ms Dufty distributed a number of typed and handwritten documents containing model witnesses’ statements and draft questions and answers for use in court, together with much written explanatory material. 
     
      
    6   It was important for the Crown to put such documents before the jury and to prove that the writing in them was the appellant’s. It set about doing so in various ways, one of which was to have a handwriting expert look at documents proved to have been written by the appellant and to say whether the conspiratorial documents were in the same hand. 
     
      
    7   For this comparison the expert used two sets of documents said to be in the appellant’s handwriting. One was a series of letters identified by Sergeant Nomchong as having been written by the appellant some years earlier than the events giving rise to the trial. 
     
      
    8   The appellant denied that any of the documents were in his handwriting. At the trial the credibility of police officers was strongly attacked. It was put to Sergeant Nomchong that he had had the opportunity himself to write the letters he attributed to the appellant. 
     
      
    9   The fresh evidence concerning Sergeant Nomchong is as follows - 
     
      
       
      1. On 28 June 1996 he was convicted of attempting in November 1994 to influence a member of the New South Wales police force in the exercise of his function as a member of that force with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice. 
       
       
      2. During the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service one, Trevor Haken, gave evidence that on an unspecified day before May 1989 Sergeant Nomchong received a share of a $3,000 bribe paid to police to secure the dropping of charges against a defendant. 
       
      
    10   The submission was that the evidence that would establish these things would discredit Sergeant Nomchong and was capable of bearing on his probity at the time he prepared and gave his evidence in the appellant’s trial. So there is a reasonable possibility that a jury having the benefit of the evidence might have acquitted the appellant: Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259. 
     
      
    11   It is necessary in order to determine whether there is such a reasonable possibility to assess the importance of the evidence of Sergeant Nomchong to the Crown case and the effect, if any, the fresh evidence might have on a jury’s assessment of Sergeant Nomchong in particular and on the Crown case in general. 
     
      
    12   The events the Crown relied on and the evidence for their occurrence was as follows. I will summarise first the evidence apparently independent of Sergeant Nomchong. 
     
      
    13   Detective Inspector Casey, Detective Sergeant Edlund and Detective Senior Constable Whatmough were in Lamb’s Lane, Goulburn when the appellant was arrested and searched. They and other police officers were present when the appellant’s house was searched. A number of other police officers were engaged in the search but were not named in the evidence. A notebook called Judges Notes was found in a briefcase at the house. A firearm was found as well. The appellant was taken to Goulburn police station, where Detective Sergeant Edlund spoke to him in the presence of Detective Senior Constable Whatmough. The appellant was asked about entries on certain pages of the notebook and said that he had written or drawn diagrams on pages 72, 105 and 106. According to Detective Senior Constable Whatmough the appellant said that he had written numbers which appeared in entries throughout the notebook. 
     
      
    14   Detective Sergeant Edlund gave evidence about an event that happened as the appellant’s committal hearing concluded in the Local Court Goulburn on 21 July 1989. The notebook was in Court, though not in evidence. The appellant’s barrister, Mr McCrudden, applied to the magistrate for its return. It was not returned but remained in the custody of the police. 
     
      
    15   Mr Worthington said that in August 1989 he was arrested and charged with a number of property and other offences. He obtained a grant of bail, but it required his surety to deposit $2,000 in cash, and he could not find anyone who could meet that condition, so he was held in custody. One day he was in the dining room at the Metropolitan Remand Centre when the appellant went up to him, introduced himself as Pat and asked him whether he were interested in giving evidence at his trial. Only the two men were present at the conversation. Mr Worthington said that he was interested but that he needed bail, and had to go to court to have the conditions of bail changed so that his security need only promise to forfeit money, not deposit it. 
     
      
    16   The appellant had a bag, out of which he took papers, maps, typed copies of papers and photocopies of written documents. The documents contained plans of Lamb’s Lane, Goulburn and a photograph of Inspector Casey. The appellant said that that was the detective who had “busted” him at Goulburn. 
     
      
    17   The appellant showed Mr Worthington questions and answers on a typed paper and said that he would have to learn them because the prosecution would probably ask him those questions. 
     
      
    18   In evidence, Mr Worthington identified the document the appellant had as the one that had been marked 2 for identification during the evidence of Constable Garth, to which I shall refer. The document became exhibit E. It comprised a two-page, typed, draft statement, a set of fifteen typed questions and answers and a set of identical handwritten questions and answers, followed by four additional questions and answers. Following the last question and answer were instructions to Mr Worthington to write out the questions and answers himself, to photocopy them and to destroy the original and that document, exhibit E. On the reverse of the last page was a sketch representing bags of heroin and silver packages and showing how far they were supposed to have been filled. 
     
      
    19   The appellant told Mr Worthington that he would receive $5,000 after he had given his evidence. He said that it would be good if he could have his bail condition changed so that the surety might promise to forfeit a sum of money rather than lodge it in cash. 
     
      
    20   On the following morning the appellant saw Mr Worthington again. Only the two were present when they spoke. The appellant showed him some more papers and said that he would have to remember all they contained. There was a picture of a firearm the police had said they had found at the appellant’s house. There were further facts for Mr Worthington to study and a photograph of Lamb’s Lane, Goulburn. In evidence, Mr Worthington recognised the document marked 28 for identification. It became exhibit F. It contained a sketch showing the positions of police cars and officers at the time of the arrest of the appellant. 
     
      
    21   Mr Worthington said the same about a document marked 26 for identification, which became exhibit G. It contained a more closely annotated diagram of Lamb’s Lane, showing the position of cars and personnel. 
     
      
    22   The documents exhibits E, F and G were all later found in Ms Dufty’s car. 
     
      
    23   Broadly, the appellant asked Mr Worthington to tell a false story that he had missed a turnoff during a journey between Griffith and Wollongong and happened to be driving along Lamb’s Lane when he saw a number of police cars and officers and a man, the appellant, under arrest. One of the officers was holding a bag containing something like sugar. The purpose of the evidence was to give the Court the impression that the police had the heroin before they went to the appellant’s house, enabling the appellant to assert in his defence that they had planted the heroin there. 
     
      
    24   The appellant told Mr Worthington that an advertisement would be placed in a newspaper asking for the person who was driving a yellow Cortina station sedan in Lamb’s Lane to come forward. Mr Worthington would answer the advertisement and his story would thereby come to the notice of a solicitor retained by the appellant. 
     
      
    25   By the end of their conversation they had made an arrangement by which the appellant would try and obtain bail for Mr Worthington. 
     
      
    26   The appellant and Ms Dufty were in frequent contact with each other at relevant times. According to Mr Patrick Farrell, Senior Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Correctional Services Internal Investigation Unit, Ms Dufty visited the appellant at Goulburn Training Centre and the Remand Centre at Long Bay Prison one hundred and eighteen times between 30 May 1989 and 4 September 1991. 
     
      
    27   According to Mr Worthington, he applied successfully for an order varying the condition of his bail which required the deposit of $2,000. Instead, the surety had to promise to forfeit a similar amount. Mr Worthington returned to his custody to await developments. 
     
      
    28   He received a telephone call to say that he was going to be released on bail and that there was someone waiting to pick him up. He went to the prison office and was handed a form of undertaking to sign. He did so. Present in the office was Ms Dufty, who was calling herself Toni Gibson. She was Mr Worthington’s surety. He only ever knew her by the name she had given. 
     
      
    29   Formalities completed, they left the prison and went to Central railway station. Ms Dufty paid Mr Worthington’s fare and they took a train to Goulburn and travelled to Ms Dufty’s house in Faithfull Street. Mr Worthington then described the house otherwise shown in evidence to have been Ms Dufty’s house. 
     
      
    30   At the house they spoke about the exercise in which they were taking part. Ms Dufty asked Mr Worthington whether he thought that they would get away with it and he said that he thought they would. Ms Dufty said that the appellant’s son would come on the following day and take them to Lamb’s Lane. 
     
      
    31   On the next morning the appellant’s son came to the house and took Ms Dufty and Mr Worthington to a point on the Hume Highway where he was supposed to have missed the turnoff. After that they went to Lamb’s Lane where Ms Dufty pointed out particular spots on the map. Various points of reference were noted as Mr Worthington’s story was rehearsed. 
     
      
    32   They left the area and eventually returned to Ms Dufty’s house. There Mr Worthington met Wayne, the appellant’s son. He stayed the night there and on the following morning asked Ms Dufty for $500, which the appellant told him she would give him. She did so. He and Ms Dufty caught the train back to Sydney. 
     
      
    33   Ms Dufty told Mr Worthington that there would be an advertisement in a newspaper then being published and that he was to telephone the solicitor at the number listed in the advertisement. He returned to Wollongong, bought the newspaper and found the advertisement. He spoke by telephone to someone he thought was called Turkey and told him that he was the person who had been driving in Lamb’s Lane. They had a conversation. Mr Worthington identified a Daily Telegraph advertisement, exhibit K. 
     
      
    34   Mr Peter Turvey gave evidence that he was a law clerk employed by his wife, who was the solicitor practising under the name Dollin Wong and Turvey. On 19 November 1989 he took instructions from the appellant at the Metropolitan Remand Prison. On 9 December 1989 somebody told him on the telephone that there was going to be an advertisement in the Daily Telegraph on 11 December 1989. He purchased a copy of the newspaper. On 12 December he received a telephone call from a young man calling himself Darren Worth. He told Mr Turvey that he had been in Goulburn on his way home from visiting friends in Griffith. He said that he was in the area of Lamb’s Lane when he saw a blue utility and some unmarked police cars. There were eight or nine people there and he saw a man handcuffed near the rear of one of the cars and a plain clothes policeman, who waved him through. He described one of them as a big man with black hair, about six feet tall, who had a plastic bag over his right arm. (Detective Inspector Casey was of that general build.) There was something that looked like white powder in the bag. It could have been sugar or something like that. That was the only conversation he had with the man. Shortly afterwards the appellant withdrew his instructions from the firm. His firm had nothing to do with the placing of the advertisement. 
     
      
    35   About one month after his conversation with Mr Turvey Mr Worthington was at his father’s residence at 5/4 Allen Street, Port Kembla when the appellant and Ms Dufty arrived in a yellow Datsun car. The appellant said he would give Mr Worthington a large map which showed the route he was supposed to have taken from Griffith to Wollongong. The appellant and Ms Dufty had a map already drawn and Ms Dufty screwed it up and rubbed it on the ground to make it look used and dirty. They left after half an hour and took it with them. Mr Worthington identified the map as the document marked 1 for identification, one of the car documents. It became exhibit L. 
     
      
    36   Mr Worthington said he had previously given the appellant his grandmother’s, grandfather’s and girlfriend’s addresses in Warrawong and Port Kembla. He was shown one of the car documents, marked 24 for identification, and identified on it those addresses as well as his grandmother’s telephone number. That document became exhibit JJ. 
     
      
    37   About one month later the appellant and Ms Dufty called on Mr Worthington again and collected all documents they had left with him. By that time he had decided to take no further part in the scheme. 
     
      
    38   On 18 January 1990 Ms Dufty’s car broke down on the Hume Highway. Mr Nicastri, the manager of a tow truck business, saw her stranded on the road and towed her car back to his yard at Marulan. On the following morning an off-duty police officer, Senior Constable Garth, who was stationed at Marulan, called in at the yard and looked inside the car. There were papers on the dashboard and in the glove box, some in the names of Ms Dufty and Toni Gibson. He began to read them and saw references to Detective Senior Constable Edlund, who was then stationed at Goulburn, and who was known to Senior Constable Garth. Senior Constable Garth became interested in the contents of the documents and took some of them away. 
     
      
    39   He went to Goulburn, spoke to Constable Trevallion and showed him the documents he had found. Constable Trevallion went to the yard at Marulan and searched Ms Dufty’s car. In the glove box he found a bankbook in the name of Julianne Dufty. In the boot he saw envelopes containing letters and photocopies of letters relating to various police stations at Goulburn. 
     
      
    40   On 19 January 1990 Detective Sergeant Edlund went to Marulan and spoke to Constable Garth. He examined documents that Senior Constable Garth showed him. He placed them in plastic envelopes and tagged them. They became known as the car documents. Ms Dufty was arrested. 
     
      
    41   On the following day Detective Senior Constable Whatmough and Detective Senior Constable Murray went to the appellant’s cell at the remand unit at Long Bay Prison with a search warrant. They took possession of a number of documents which became known as the cell documents. 
     
      
    42   On 9 April 1990 Detective Inspector Casey and Detective Senior Constable Whatmough went to Maroubra police station and spoke to the appellant. They showed him some of the cell documents and the car documents. The appellant said that he did not wish to speak to police and that his solicitors were going to send them a letter to that effect. Detective Inspector Casey asked him if he would like to look at any of the documents. The appellant said that he did not and that he knew what documents the police had. Detective Inspector Casey said that it looked like the appellant’s handwriting and he replied - 
     
      
       
        
        Well, you know it’s my handwriting but I am not going any further with this. 
        
       
      
    43   Constable Boak took the appellant’s fingerprints. Constable Mooney took Ms Dufty’s fingerprints. Constable Arroyo took Mr Worthington’s fingerprints. 
     
      
    44   Sergeant John Smart was stationed at Goulburn police station and was attached to the New South Wales Fingerprint Bureau. He was an expert in the identification of fingerprints. He identified prints of the appellant’s left and right ring fingers on cell document number 12, his left middle fingerprint on cell document number 11, his left palm print on cell document number 9, his left middle and ring fingerprints on cell document number 8 and his left thumbprint and right ring fingerprint on cell document number 5. 
     
      
    45   He examined a number of the car documents but did not find any of the appellant’s fingerprints on them. He found prints of Ms Dufty’s right thumb on car document number 6 and of her left index finger on car document number 36. 
     
      
    46   He found prints of Mr Worthington’s left and right thumbs on car document number 21. 
     
      
    47   Sergeant Eastman was a handwriting expert. As at 1990 he had been attached to the Document Examination Unit of the Physical Evidence Section of the police service for about eight and a half years. He had received training in the examination and comparison of handwriting, comprising a program of approximately five years during which he worked with four accredited experts. He was constantly assessed during the course. During that time he worked under the personal direction of Detective Inspector Chivers, a handwriting expert with about twenty-seven years’ experience. Sergeant Eastman had been accredited to give evidence about the comparison of handwriting and had given such evidence in the courts of New South Wales. 
     
      
    48   Sergeant Eastman studied the handwriting and figures on pages 72, 105, 106,115, 117 and 127 of the Judges Notes notebook, marked 7 for identification. He concluded that four of the car documents, exhibits F, JJ, NN and UU, were written in the same hand. 
     
      
    49   Exhibit F comprised two sketch plans, one of roads in the vicinity of the Hume Highway and the other of Lamb’s Lane, showing vehicles and other features. On the first was the notation - 
     
      
       
        
        YOU WILL HAVE TO 
         
        DRAW A MAP 
         
        FOLD IT AND DIRTY IT 
         
        SO IT LOOK (SIC) LIKE IT WAS 
         
        KICKED AROUND THE FLOOR 
         
        OF A CAR FOR AWHILE. 
        
       
      
    50   Exhibit JJ was a handwritten memorandum bearing the name “Darren” and the telephone number of Mr Worthington’s grandmother as well as the address 5 Allen Street and the addresses of Mr Worthington’s girlfriend and grandmother. The text included the following - 
     
      
       
        
        We have to go to Wollongong tomorrow. Will see him as we have the notes with us for him. 
         
         The Solicitor needs to see him but not till we put the add in the paper and he’s had time to go over the notes again. 
        
       
      
    51   Exhibit NN was a partly typed, partly handwritten document. The typed part rehearsed events of Friday 26 May 1989. In the handwritten part of the document, under the heading - 
     
      
       
        
        If these people do this at the trial I have to pay them after the trial 
        
       
       
      appeared a list of names of persons and sums of money. There were two columns, one totalling $11,000 and the other $8,000. The persons’ names were Vicki, other chick, Scotty, Theo and McFarlane. Under the last name appeared the words - 
       
       
        
        If we have to use Darren for ½ 
        
       
       
      opposite the figure $2,500. 
       
      
    52   Underneath the column of figures totalling $8,000 appeared the words - 
     
      
       
        
        These might be enough if they will do it. The (sic) don’t talk (?) about being paid for it. 
        
       
      
    53   Then appeared the words - 
     
      
       
        
        unless you can get them cheaper but if we go too low Scotty might not be in it. 
        
       
      
    54   Exhibit UU was a two-page typewritten document with handwritten insertions. It included the following. The handwriting is shown in italics. 
     
      
       
        
        Theo. 
         
        Detective Edlund arrested me on  
          
         for  
          
         
        When we arrived at the Goulburn Police Station he said “Do you know a guy called Patrick Hudd”. I said “No”. 
         
        Edlund said “If you make a statement claiming you do know him, and that he sold you heroin, even if it’s only a $50. shot, I won’t charge  
        you 
         with this”. I said “No, I won’t be in it”. 
         
          
        
       
       
        
        Edlund always says PATRICK. 
         
          
        
       
       
        
        Explain to the others that the ones named in the police statements, the cops are trying to get us together. Once they write it out and sign it, the cops are up for harrassment if they try to question them on it, as they are defence witnesses. 
         
        Explain how Regie got charged after giving Miro up. Charged on his own addmissions.  
        HE GOT 6 MONTHS. If not signed up they leave it open for police to subpoena them and if one slip up, charge them. Once signed up they are my witnesses and can’t be questioned on this by Police. It’s Harrassment.

    55   There were attempts to recruit others into the conspiracy. Mr Allan Dell said that in August 1989 a woman calling herself Julie visited his flat in Goulburn. He identified her as the accused Dufty. She handed him a document which he identified as one of the car documents, marked 3 for identification. It became exhibit N. 
     
      
    56   It comprised a handwritten account of an alleged meeting between Mr Dell and Detective Sergeant Edlund in Goulburn on 21 July 1989. In the account Detective Sergeant Edlund asked Mr Dell whether he knew the appellant and Mr Dell said that he did not. Detective Sergeant Edlund said that the appellant had upset a colleague of his, who wanted him gaoled. He offered to give Mr Dell a ten-weight bag of heroin and get a certain detective off his back if he would make a statement saying that the appellant had sold him heroin. The letter contained considerable detail about what was supposed to have happened. 
     
      
    57   Mr Dell told Ms Dufty that he wanted nothing to do with it. 
     
      
    58   In August 1989 Ms Diane Miller had been visiting her cousin Mr Thorn at Goulburn prison for some time. During her visits there she had met the appellant and a woman who called herself Julie. She identified Julie as Ms Dufty. There was an occasion when Julie came to the front door of her house and asked whether if she were placed under subpoena she would be willing to give evidence for them. She said that she would not. 
     
      
    59   Julie called at her house again in November 1989. She had papers and told Ms Miller that she would fill her in on how the case was going. Ms Miller identified the document marked 27 for identification as a paper shown her by Julie. That document, which came from the car documents, became exhibit 0. It was a two-page handwritten draft, the first page of which set out the movements of someone who met the appellant at a particular place in Goulburn at 10.08 am on 23 May 1989 and at 11 or 11.10 am on 25 May 1989, four and two days respectively before the appellant’s arrest. It is not altogether clear how, but the document may have had something to do with what the appellant thought the police might say he was doing at those times. The draft states and repeats that the person it concerns never bought drugs from the appellant and did not know him to be involved with drugs. 
     
      
    60   Ms Miller said that she was not interested. 
     
      
    61   The woman Julie made a final attempt about six weeks afterwards and asked her if she had changed her mind. Ms Miller said that she had not. 
     
      
    62   The appellant called no evidence and gave an unsworn statement. Dealing with evidence in the Crown case other than that of Sergeant Nomchong, he denied knowing or ever speaking to Mr Worthington. He denied making any admissions to police officers. He admitted that he had picked up papers that Detective Inspector Casey had handed him because he was curious and wanted to know what police were trying to frame him with. That explained how his fingerprints got onto the cell documents. He denied typing or writing any of the conspiratorial documents. He admitted that there was a typewriter in his cell, denied ever having touched it and commented that there was no evidence of his fingerprints on it. He denied that documents were taken from his cell. He denied that the Judges Notes notebook was his but he did not deny that Mr McCrudden had asked for its return. 
     
      
    63   Notwithstanding the warning the jury would have to be given about the caution with which they should treat the evidence of Mr Worthington as a co-conspirator, the Crown case was overwhelming, even without the evidence of Sergeant Nomchong. There was a consistent correspondence between the documents tendered. The jury would be entitled to regard them as having common authority because the writing on them looked the same and because they carried common themes. They were linked to the appellant in several independent ways. Some were shown by the appellant to Mr Worthington. Others bore the appellant’s fingerprints. Others were written in the same hand as the selected pages of the Judges Notes notebook, which was found at the appellant’s house. The appellant admitted writing others. 
     
      
    64   The evidence independent of the documents showed that the appellant and Ms Dufty systematically tried to recruit whoever they could to concoct evidence by supplying them with draft statements of evidence and offering them money. 
     
      
    65   There was no sworn evidence to contradict the evidence adduced in the Crown case, so it might be the more readily accepted. 
     
      
    66   Counsel for the appellant was invited in this Court to analyse the evidence independent of Sergeant Nomchong so that it might be ascertained to what extent, if at all, the Crown case might be weakened if he were discredited. Counsel submitted instead that there was no contested evidence that could be regarded as independent of Sergeant Nomchong because he had contrived and conspired to have the appellant falsely accused by devising a scheme, recruiting police officers and other witnesses and forging such documents as were necessary to support the charge of conspiracy. It was acknowledged that such a submission required that Sergeant Nomchong had not only recruited and organised the witnesses whose evidence was likely to be contentious and persuaded them to give false evidence, but had also himself written all the documents said to be in the hand of the appellant. 
     
      
    67   Of the documents tendered, forty-six comprised handwritten pages, and there were in addition typed pages bearing handwritten insertions, annotations and emendments. Besides, there were twenty-four car documents and twenty-three cell documents that were not tendered. 
     
      
    68   None of the pages of the Judges Notes notebook was tendered. The book itself was not tendered. It is not known how many pages it contained, but it is known that pages 72, 105, 106, 115, 117 and 127 contained handwriting. There seems no reason why blank pages should have been left in the book as it was filled up. 
     
      
    69   The Judges Notes notebook was in court at trial. Given that it was connected to the appellant because it came from his briefcase, defence counsel would have been at pains to reveal, if it were the fact, that it contained handwriting apparently different from that on the pages selected for comparison with other documents. That was not done. The proper inference is that at least 127 pages of that book were apparently written in the same hand. 
     
      
    70   The forty-six handwritten pages tendered and the typed pages which bear handwriting all appear to bear the same handwriting. 
     
      
    71   Altogether over two hundred pages were identified, and it fairly appears that one person apparently wrote them all. 
     
      
    72   It seems an extraordinary proposition that Sergeant Nomchong was that person. If an experienced police officer like him wished to concoct evidence and have the appellant falsely convicted and sentenced, there must have been many easy ways for him to do so. The appellant suggested no reason why Sergeant Nomchong should have gone to such lengths or how he might have been capable of producing so many documents of such apparent consistency. Heracles himself could not have laboured longer. 
     
      
    73   There was no evidence that Sergeant Nomchong was at the centre of the case, forging all the documents and organising and corrupting the many witnesses he would have had to influence. All there was was a bare submission from the bar table about his alleged role. In my opinion there is no proper basis for a submission that the jury’s impression of the evidence other than that of Sergeant Nomchong should rise or fall according to their impression of him. 
     
      
    74   It seems to me in any case that there are sound reasons for regarding Sergeant Nomchong’s evidence as reliable. He was not stationed at Goulburn and had nothing to do with the investigation which gave rise to the arrest of the appellant. 
     
      
    75   He said that his mother and the appellant lived together as though married between 1970 and 1980 and that he used to visit them during that time. Most of the visits were to a property near Boorowa which they were managing. When he visited he would stay with them. Sergeant Nomchong’s younger brother Anthony was living with them for part of that time, as was the appellant’s son Wayne. 
     
      
    76   When Sergeant Nomchong visited them, he would spend time with the appellant. He saw him writing on a number of occasions. The appellant would make notes in a notebook. He would leave notes for Sergeant Nomchong’s mother, sometimes to indicate his comings and goings to and from Boorowa and sometimes concerning the management of the property. Sergeant Nomchong used to read those notes and in that way became able to recognise the appellant’s handwriting. 
     
      
    77   The relationship between the appellant and Sergeant Nomchong’s mother came to an end in 1980 and she moved away from the district. She wanted nothing more to do with him and did not give him her address. The appellant knew the address of Sergeant Nomchong’s brother and began to send him letters intended for his mother. He handed them unopened to Sergeant Nomchong. Sergeant Nomchong opened the envelopes and read the letters. He recognised from the writing that they were from the appellant. He did not pass the letters on to his mother but kept them. 
     
      
    78   Five envelopes became exhibit CC. The five letters which they had contained became exhibits DD, EE, FF, GG and HH. Two of the envelopes bore 1980 postmarks. A third bore an advertisement for Australian National Stamp Week 1980. It was not suggested on appeal that the date stamps were not genuine or that the Australian National Stamp Week stamp was not genuine. 
     
      
    79   If the appellant’s argument were correct it would follow that Sergeant Nomchong must have received the envelopes in 1980, kept them by some fortunate chance and used them again in 1989 in order to concoct evidence against the appellant by copying the writing on them and forging more than two hundred handwritten pages. Alternatively, he must have forged the envelopes themselves in 1980 and posted them. Both propositions are untenable. 
     
      
    80   There are other reasons why the letters produced by Sergeant Nomchong appear authentic. They, their envelopes and the other two hundred or so documents appear to have been written in the one hand, something a reasonable jury would probably conclude. Sergeant Eastman said nothing to the contrary. He said that two of the letters, exhibits DD and EE, could have been written by the person who wrote exhibits E, F, G, N, O and UU, which were car documents, and exhibits XX and ZZ, which were cell documents, as well as cell documents numbers 12 and 28. 
     
      
    81   Nor do I think that the proposed fresh evidence would be capable of informing a jury’s view about the credibility of Sergeant Nomchong. If he trumped up a case against the appellant he must have decided to do so in 1989, for that is when many of the police officers prepared their statements and took other steps which could not be changed. The offence of which Sergeant Nomchong was found guilty was committed in November 1994, about five years later. In a judgment of this Court in a Crown appeal against his sentence McInerney J remarked that when he committed the offence Sergeant Nomchong had been a police officer for some thirty years and that the material before the sentencing judge indicated that in many respects his police service had been outstanding and meritorious, with the exception of one minor episode, which had been dealt with administratively. A number of senior police officers gave evidence at the trial testifying to his good character, about which there was no dispute by the Crown. 
     
      
    82   This Court has previously remarked on the difficulty that arises when a jury is asked to infer dishonesty in a witness at one time by reference to later events, especially where the witness appears generally to have been of good character. R v Robinson [1999] NSWCCA 186; R v Johns [1999] NSWCCA 206. In my opinion it would not be open to a jury to infer from Sergeant Nomchong’s dishonest conduct in 1994 that he was dishonest in 1989. 
     
      
    83   Counsel for the appellant conceded that Mr Haken’s allegations had little substance taken by themselves. I think that that was a proper concession to make. It is not easy to see how the evidence could be adduced from Mr Haken, since it would go not to any issue at the trial but only to the credibility of Sergeant Nomchong. There was some suggestion that it might be admissible as tendency evidence. However, I think that the material has such little weight as not to justify a resolution of such evidentiary problems. 
     
      
    84   In my opinion it is not reasonably possible that a jury having the benefit of the fresh evidence might acquit the appellant. I would dismiss the appeal.

     REGINA v Nelson Tak Fat WONG 
      
     REGINA v Jackie Kai Chu LEUNG 
      
    Held:A. Guideline Judgment1. Jurisdictional challenge(a) The formulation of principles and guidelines, including the identification of quantitative aspects of sentence decisions, falls within the express statutory authority stipulated by s5D and s12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).Appellate courts by their nature may lay down guidelines for the exercise of discretions. (See Norbis v Norbis (1996) 161 CLR 513; R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 107, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, at [13] - [21]; R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 217-220).(b) The Court, exercising its discretion under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, is empowered to “impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper”. The identification of what is a “proper” sentence for the offences under consideration necessarily, or at least permissibly, involves the identification of what is, or should be, the appropriate pattern of sentencing for this offence. Where it is of such direct applicability to the case before the Court, the identification of an appropriate sentencing guideline satisfies the conception of a “matter” within s75 and s76 of the Constitution.Obiter. It may be that a more teuous association between a guideline judgment and the facts and matters in issue in a particular case would be sufficient to establish the requisite constitutional connection. The reasoning in Mellifont v the Attorney General (Qld) (1991) 173 CLR 289 at 304-305 suggests that reference to materials, including crime statistics and victim surveys is permissible even if it does not impinge directly on the case or cases before the Court.(c) There is no relevant inconsistency between Part 1B, specifically s16A, of the Crimes Act (Cth) and the Criminal Appeal Act. The guidelines promulgated by the Court are indicative only. They do not restrict the ability of the sentencing judge to implement any aspect of Pt 1B, or to otherwise give full force and effect to the Commonwealth statutory scheme. (See Jurisic at 220; Henry at [25]-[30], [42]).2. Sentencing patternThis Court set out a guideline for this offence in R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 ACrimR 231.The material before the Court supports the conclusion to which this Court came in both R v Lawson (1997) 98 ACrimR 463 and Bernier, to the effect that the range suggested in Ferrer-Esis has tended to be imposed for low range commercial quantities, rather than for high range trafficable quantities, although there is an overlap between the two ranges.The outcomes from Courts of Criminal Appeal in other States are broadly confirmatory of the position in New South Wales, although there may be some need for firming up of sentences at the top of the low commercial quantity range. It is desirable that the respective State courts invested with federal jurisdiction to hear prosecutions for Commonwealth offences, approach the sentencing task with an element of harmony. This is required by Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth). (See Medina v The Queen (1990) 108 FLR 288 at 292-293; Krasnov & Shlakht (1995) 82 ACrimR 92 at 95). Absent the operation of permissible local factors, similar result should follow from the application of “uniform sentencing principles”: Leeth v The Commonwealth (1991-92) 430 at 476.Neither the Judicial Commission’s report, Sentencing Drug Offenders (August 1999), which analysed sentences imposed in higher courts of NSW, from 1 January to 31 December 1997, nor the Commission’s Sentencing Information System statistics regarding drug offences under s233B of the Customs Act, finalised in higher courts, for the period of January 1990 to December 1998, identify a pattern of inconsistency of approach in sentencing drug offenders which would justify correction by an appellate court.The statistics kept by the Judicial Commission show that non-custodial sentences are, appropriately, truly exceptional and that there are very few short custodial sentences. The statistics do not suggest manifest inadequacy in the sentences imposed by the courts. The terms set for offences involving trafficable and commercial quantities of heroin and cocaine, show that the length of the terms of imprisonment actually imposed by trial judges do accord with the seriousness of these offences. The judges of this State are aware of the exceptional threat to our society that is posed by large scale drug use. In the case of drug importers and their accomplices, who are motivated by greed, the judiciary speaks with one voice.In such circumstances, the considerations relating to inconsistency and to systematic inadequacy of sentences to which reference is made in Jurisic and Henry as justifying a guideline judgment, do not arise.3. Promulgating a guidelineIt is appropriate for the Court to promulgate a comprehensive quantitative guidelines for an offence for which a relevant guideline has long existed and, it appears, has proved to be of utility to sentencing judges throughout Australia. This is the Ferrer-Esis guideline.There are two additional reasons for promulgating a quantitative guideline. First, by providing guidance to trial judges it is less likely that sentences will be imposed which suggest a need for appellate review. Secondly, the clear promulgation of likely actual sentences will assist the objective of general deterrence. Guideline judgments are a mechanism for increasing the efficiency of the transmission of knowledge about actual sentencing practice. (See Henry at [41], [205] - [211]; Police v Cadd (1997) 94 ACrimR 466 at 511; Spigelman “Sentencing Guideline Judgments” 11 CICJ 5 at 10-11; 73 ALJ 876 at 880-881). See also R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 399.The quantity of drugs involved is an exceptionally importance aspect of the objective seriousness of the crime. However, it is not determinative of the appropriate sentence. Other aspects of the crime, including objective and subjective considerations, remain relevant in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. One such factor is the role of the accused in the organisation, if any, which imports the drugs into Australia.The importance of quantity, as confirmed in the structure of the statutory scheme, indicates that any guidelines should be structured by levels of quantum. As there are other relevant considerations, sentencing ranges for successive quantity ranges will necessarily overlap. In the present case, it is appropriate to adopt a ‘bottom up’ system of guidelines which does not contain any significant prescriptive element. The judgment of trial and appellate judges, in the absence of any apparent inadequacy of outcomes, and insofar as a discernible pattern has emerged, should be validated by the Court.The following guideline is promulgated. It is intended to be apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. It is not intended to apply to a person high in the hierarchy, to whom an increment should be applied. 
     
      
    Low level trafficable quantity - 5 - 7 years (2gms - 200gms)Mid level trafficable quantity - 6 - 9 years (200gms - 1kg)High range trafficable quantity - 7 - 10 years 1kg - 1.5kgs (heroin) 1kg - 2kgs (cocaine)Low range commercial quantity - 8 - 12 years 1.5kgs - 3.5kgs (heroin) 2kgs - 3.5kgs (cocaine)Substantial commercial quantity - 10-15 years (3.5kgs - 10kgs)B. Individual AppealsThe sentences his Honour imposed were lower than the least sentence that could properly have been imposed in each case. Wong and Leung were major participants in a very large importation. The head sentences and the non parole periods of twelve years are manifestly inadequate. In each case the least sentence that should have been imposed is an additional two years on both the head sentence and on the non-parole period.

     REGINA v Nelson Tak Fat WONG 
      
     REGINA v Jackie Kai Chu LEUNG 
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
      
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Court has before it two appeals by the Crown against the alleged leniency of sentences for the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import, namely heroin, contrary to the provisions of s233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). A third appeal in the case of Law abated when the Respondent died after judgment was reserved. 
     
      
    2    The Respondents Leung and Wong appealed against their conviction. By judgment of 15 September 1999 that appeal was dismissed by three members of this Court (R v Leung & Wong [1999] NSWCCA 287). Wong sought leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence. However, no submissions were directed to that application. Senior counsel who appeared for Wong confined himself to responding to the Crown appeal on sentence. 
     
      
    3    In the context of the appeal against the alleged inadequacy of the three sentences, the Director of Public Prosecutions has submitted that it is appropriate for this Court to issue, with respect to s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act, a guideline judgment in accordance with the current practice of the Court. (See R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 107; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346). The Attorney General for New South Wales intervened to submit that the Court may consider the formulation of sentencing guidelines in the course of determining these appeals. 
     
      
    4    The starting point of the Crown submissions was the decision of this Court in R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 ACrimR 231 in which Hunt J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed, set out a form of sentencing guideline for the offence presently under consideration. 
     
      
    5    In Bernier v R (1998) 102 ACrimR 44, this Court, in a joint judgment of Smart, Studdert and Hidden JJ, made some observations about the continued applicability of the form of guideline suggested in Ferrer-Esis. The reasoning in Bernier has been subject to commentary and subsequent decisions of the Court, to which I will presently refer. Those decisions suggest a difference of approach within the Court which, the Crown submits, should be resolved by a guideline judgment. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Regime 
       
      
    6    Subsection 233B(1) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Any person who:

          (aa) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon the person) brings, attempts to bring, or causes to be brought, into Australia any prohibited imports to which this section applies; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) imports, or attempts to import, into Australia any prohibited imports to which this section applies or exports, or attempts to export, from Australia any prohibited exports to which this section applies; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him) has in his possession, or attempts to obtain possession of, any prohibited imports to which this section applies which have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (caa) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him) conveys, or attempts to convey, any prohibited imports to which this section applied which have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ca) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him) has in his possession, or attempts to obtain possession of, any prohibited imports to which this section applies which are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (cb) conspires with another person or other persons to import, bring, or cause to be brought, into Australia any prohibited imports to which this section applies or to export from Australia any prohibited exports to which this section applies; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation, or bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies, or the exportation from Australia of any prohibited exports to which this section applies; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) fails to disclose to an officer on demand any knowledge in his possession or power concerning the importation or intended importation, or bringing or intended bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies or the exportation or intended exportation from Australia of any prohibited exports to which this section applies; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        shall be guilty of an offence. 
        
       
      
    7    Subsection 233B(3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) A person who is guilty of an offence against subsection (1) of this section is punishable upon conviction as provided by s235.” 
        
       
      
    8    Section 235 distinguishes between trafficable quantities and commercial quantities. In a Schedule to the Act, a number of narcotic substances are listed, specifying in respective columns the amount of a “trafficable quantity” and the amount of a “commercial quantity”. In the case of cocaine, trafficable quantity commences at 2.0 grams and the commercial quantity commences at 2.0 kilograms. In the case of heroin, trafficable quantity also commences at 2.0 grams, however the commercial quantity commences at 1.5 kilograms. 
     
      
    9    Subsection 235(2)(c) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “235(2)(c) Where the court is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) that the narcotic goods in relation to which the offence was committed 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (A) are a narcotic substance in respect of which there is a commercial quantity applicable; and 
           
           
          (B) consists of a quantity of that substance that is not less than that commercial quantity; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) that the narcotic goods in relation to which the offence was committed consists of a quantity of a narcotic substance that is not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to that substance and also that, on a previous occasion, a court has: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (A) convicted a person of another offence, being an offence against a provision referred to in par (a) that involved other narcotic goods which consisted of a quantity of narcotic substance not less than the trafficable quantity that was applicable to that substance when the offence was committed; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (B) found, without recording a conviction, that the person had committed another such offence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          imprisonment for life or such period as the court thinks appropriate.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10    It is plain that the Parliament intended that sentences for this offence should have a deterrent effect. This appears from the severity of the maximum sentence of imprisonment for life. It also appears from the equation in subpar 235(2)(c)(ii) of a second offence for the lower quantity with a first offence for the higher quantity. 
     
      
    11    Subsection 235(2)(d) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “235(2)(d) Where the court is satisfied that the narcotic goods in relation to which the offence was committed consist of a quantity of a narcotic substance that is not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to the substance but is not satisfied as provided in par (c): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) if the narcotic substance is a narcotic substance other than cannabis - a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          …” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The subsection goes on to make provision for the case of cannabis. 
       
      
    12    In other cases, including with respect to amounts less than a trafficable quantity, the offence carries a fine not exceeding $2,000, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years (subs 235(ii)(e)).  
     
      
    13    Furthermore in the case of a first offence for a trafficable quantity, if the court is satisfied: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that the offence was not committed by the person charged for any purposes relating to the sale of or other commercial dealing in, those narcotic goods.” 
        
       
       
      then the punishment is also a maximum of $2,000 or imprisonment for two years (subs 235(3)). 
       
       
      Jurisdictional Challenge 
       
      
    14    The Respondents challenged the jurisdiction of the Court to issue a guideline judgment with respect to Commonwealth offences on three different bases: 
     
      
       
      (i) Section 5D of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912 does not authorise the promulgation of a sentencing guideline. 
       
       
      (ii) The judicial power of the Commonwealth does not extend to the promulgation of a sentencing guideline, because there is no “matter” within s75 and s76 of the Constitution. 
       
       
      (iii) There is an inconsistency between s16A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914 (Cth) and this Court’s power to promulgate a guideline, within the meaning of s109 of the Constitution. 
       
      
    15    The first submission focused on the position of this Court as a statutory court of specified jurisdiction. Part 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act identifies a number of different circumstances in which appeals lie to the Court. In the three cases now before the Court, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has invoked s5D. This section falls to be construed in its context which, relevantly, is the creation of a court of criminal appeal. The nature and purpose of such a court encompasses the identification of sentencing principles and formulation of guidelines about the exercise of the sentencing discretion by trial judges.  
     
      
    16    There is a significant body of authority for the proposition that appellate courts may lay down guidelines for the exercise of discretions, both statutory and non-statutory. I refer in particular to Norbis v Norbis (1996) 161 CLR 513. A range of other cases, including decisions of the High Court, are summarised in Henry at [13] - [21]. It is unnecessary to repeat that analysis here. Furthermore, as indicated in Jurisic (at 217-220), courts of criminal appeal have frequently stated principles of general application with respect to appropriate sentences for particular offences. The step of promulgating a guideline in quantitative terms is a logical development of what such courts have long done. 
     
      
    17    The words of s5D, construed in their context, are reinforced by the express words of s12 of the Criminal Appeal Act, which confer additional powers on this Court, including: 
     
      
       
        
        “12 The court may, if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice … 
        
       
       
        
        exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the Supreme Court on appeals or applications in civil matters …” 
        
       
      
    18    The formulation of principles, including the identification of quantitative aspects of discretionary decisions, for the guidance of first instance judges who exercise a discretion, falls within this express statutory authority. 
     
      
    19    The second jurisdictional submission on behalf of the Respondents focused on the concept of “matter” within s75 and s76 of the Commonwealth Constitution. By s68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), this Court has a federal jurisdiction “with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals” in relation to offences against Commonwealth statutes being a “like jurisdiction” that it has with respect to State offences. (Section 38 may also be applicable with similar effect). The construction of s5D in its context, to which I have referred with respect to the first jurisdictional submission, would apply to the exercise of federal jurisdiction, unless that jurisdiction was limited in some manner which was not applicable to State jurisdiction. 
     
      
    20    It has long been accepted that the concept “matter” within s75 and s76 of the Constitution means that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is a narrower concept than judicial power in its natural and ordinary meaning. (See eg Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995-96) 189 CLR 51 at 136-137 per Gummow J; Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 73 ALJR 839 at [10] per Gleeson CJ).  
     
      
    21    Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said, in a recent articulation of what is encompassed within the concept of a constitutional “matter”, in Abebe v The Commonwealth (1999) 73 ALJR 584 at [25]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A ‘matter’ is therefore ordinarily concerned with ‘some immediate, right, duty or liability to be established by the determination of a court’ [ 
        In 
          
        Re Judiciary & Navigation Acts  
        (1921) 29 CLR 257 at 265]. … Since  
        O’Toole v Charles 
          
        David Pty Limited 
         (1991) 171 CLR 232 it is clear that proceedings may involve a ‘matter’ even when they are not determinative of the rights of the parties, provided the proceedings concern the determination of what their rights were if the law had been properly applied. Nevertheless, the determination of rights, duties and liabilities by reference to legal rules, principles or standards in curial proceedings is at the heart of the notion of a ‘matter’ for constitutional purposes.” 
        
       
      
    22    In the present proceedings, the Court has before it two (originally three) appeals by the Crown against the leniency of sentences for offences under s233B(1) of the Customs Act (Cth). In exercising its jurisdiction under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court is empowered to “impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper”. The identification of what is a “proper” sentence for these offences necessarily, or at least permissibly, involves the identification of what is, or should be, the appropriate pattern of sentencing for this offence. Where it is of such direct applicability to the case before the Court, the identification of an appropriate sentencing guideline plainly satisfies the constitutional conception of a “matter”. 
     
      
    23    It may be that a more tenuous association between a guideline and the facts and matters in issue in a particular case would be sufficient to establish the requisite constitutional connection. 
     
      
    24    In Mellifont v The Attorney General (Qld) (1991) 173 CLR 289 the Court upheld the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear an appeal from a decision under s669A of the Criminal Code (Qld) pursuant to which the Attorney General of the State could refer a point of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an expression of an opinion. It was submitted that no “matter” within the constitutional conception of that term arose, by reason of the fact that the expression of that opinion would not, pursuant to the statutory provision, affect the outcome of the trial. In its joint judgment, the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The questions referred all relate to the correctness of the trial judge’s ruling on materiality and his interpretation of the provisions of the Order in Council of 24 June 1987 relating to the time frame of the Inquiry and are asked in the context of the charge laid on the indictment against the applicant. The Crown sought the reference in order to establish that the trial judge’s ruling was wrong in various respects. In this situation, the decision on the reference was made with respect to a ‘matter’ which was the subject matter of the legal proceedings at first instance and was not divorced from the ordinary administration of the law. The decision is therefore to be distinguished from the abstract declaration sought by the Executive Government in  
        In Re Judiciary & Navigation 
          
        Acts. 
         That opinion was academic, in response to an abstract question, and hypothetical in the sense that it was unrelated to any actual controversy between parties. 
        
       
       
        
        True it is that the purpose of seeking and obtaining a review of the trial judge’s ruling was to secure a correct statement of the law so that it would be applied correctly in future cases. However, in our view, in the context of the criminal law, that does not stamp procedure for which s226A(2) provides as something which is academic or hypothetical so as to deny that it is an exercise of judicial power. The statutory procedure, which has counterparts in other Australian jurisdictions, is a standard procedure for correcting error of law in criminal proceedings without exposing the accused to double jeopardy. It is a procedure which was designed to enable the Crown to secure a reversal of a ruling by a trial judge without infringing the common law rule that the Crown cannot appeal against a verdict of acquittal, a rule which precluded a review of a trial judge’s ruling at the instance of the Crown in the case of acquittal. The fundamental point, as it seems to us, is that s669A(2) enables the Court of Criminal Appeal to correct an error of law at the trial. It is that characteristic of the proceedings that stamps them as an exercise of judicial power and the decision as a judgment or order within the meaning of s73.” (at 304-305) 
        
       
      
    25    This passage may, in an appropriate case, have application to the formulation of sentencing guidelines for Commonwealth offences. It is not necessary, however, to rely on that passage in the present case, where the issue of the appropriate sentencing range does arise with respect to the appeals directly before the Court.  
     
      
    26    In these appeals the Crown indicated that some of the materials which it presented to the Court in the form of crime statistics and victim surveys were not relied upon with respect to the individual cases. The Court has determined that crime statistics are not “evidence” within the proviso of s12(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (see Henry at [49] - [85]). The fact that a State statute restricts the use to which such material may be put is not determinative of whether or not the admission of such material is consistent with dealing with a “matter” in the course of any exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    27    The reasoning in Mellifont would strongly suggest that reference to such material is permissible even if does not, either by statute or, as in the present case, by Crown concession, impinge directly on the cases before the Court. Nevertheless it is not necessary to finally determine this issue. As will appear below, this additional material is of no assistance in the formulation of a guideline in the circumstances of this case. The applicability of s29A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to the exercise of federal jurisdiction does not arise in the present case. 
     
      
    28    I should note in this context, that the Respondents indicated expressly that there was no objection to the Court having regard to the schedules of sentencing outcomes for this offence, in this and other States, provided to the Court by the Crown. Nor was there any objection to the Court considering the Judicial Commission’s sentencing statistics. As will appear further below, it is only this material which has proved to be of significance for the formulation of the guidelines in the present case.  
     
      
    29    The third basis for a jurisdictional challenge invoked s109 of the Commonwealth Constitution which, it was submitted, rendered inoperative the Criminal Appeal Act insofar as it permitted the Court to promulgate a sentencing guideline. This was said to arise by reason of an inconsistency between Pt 1B, specifically s16A, of the Crimes Act (Cth), and the Criminal Appeal Act in this respect. 
     
      
    30    Section 16A is relevantly indistinguishable from s79 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth), specifically the list of considerations identified in subs 79(4), which “the court shall take into account” in making orders with respect to the property of parties to a marriage, which the High Court decided in Norbis was consistent with the formulation of guidelines by an appellate court. 
     
      
    31    The Respondents’ submissions were based on a misconception. No guideline promulgated by this Court restricts the ability of a sentencing judge to implement any aspect of Pt 1B, or to otherwise give full force and effect to the Commonwealth statutory scheme. 
     
      
    32    As was explicitly stated in both Jurisic and Henry, a sentencing guideline is indicative only. A guideline may be departed from and it is not binding in any formal sense nor does it constitute a rule of law (see Jurisic at 220; Henry at [25] - [30] and [42]). There is no inconsistency of any character. 
     
      
       
      The  
      Ferrer-Esis 
       Guideline 
       
      
    33    In Ferrer-Esis, the Court had before it a Crown appeal against sentence for an importation of 1,819.8 grams of cocaine, i.e. in the high trafficable range. The case involved a courier who had pleaded guilty. The trial judge had imposed a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. The maximum sentence for the offence, as noted above, was imprisonment for twenty-five years. In the course of his reasons Hunt J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The recognised pattern of sentencing for couriers of substantial quantities of heroin … produced head sentences of between twelve and sixteen years, with minimum terms generally fixed within the order of approximately 60-75% of the head sentence.” (at 236) 
        
       
      
    34    Although his Honour expressly referred to the maximum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, the formulation of this frequently cited passage - “substantial quantity of heroin” - does not use the language of “trafficable quantity”. His Honour may have had in mind an overlap with sentencing practice for low range commercial quantities. 
     
      
    35    His Honour also noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account the adjustment required by s16G the previous pattern translates into a head sentence of between eight and a half and eleven years.” (at 237) 
        
       
      
    36    In Ferrer-Esis, the Court identified a number of errors in the exercise by the trial judge of the sentencing discretion. The Court noted that the head sentence of only six years represented a “departure from the recognised pattern of sentencing” (at 239). The Court imposed a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years.  
     
      
    37    Hunt J referred to the fact that there had been, during the relevant period, significant changes in the principles of sentencing. First, the new Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) applied to Commonwealth offences for a short period. Thereafter, Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth), as still in existence, was introduced. Of particular significance for the purpose of comparing the prior sentencing pattern was the loss of remissions under the new New South Wales sentencing practice, for which an adjustment was required under s16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.  
     
      
    38    It is relevant to note the following comments of Hunt J: 
     
      
       
        
        Since Part 1B of the  
        Crimes Act 
         commenced, there does appear to have been a slight, but hardly any significant downturn, in the periods thought to be appropriate before the adjustment is made for the loss of remissions in accordance with s16G of that Act. What difference there does appear to have been seems to me to have been a result mainly of the absence of the previous rigid 75% rule in the ratio between the minimum term and the total sentence. Certainly it could not be said that the previous pattern of sentencing has continued (subject to that adjustment) without alteration. It is still too early to tell, and in any event caution needs to be exercised in translating such sentencing patterns into actual decisions after the two changes which have now occurred in the sentencing legislation: cf 
         Maclay 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 112 at 126; 46 ACrimR 340 at 354.” (at 237) 
        
       
      
    39    It appears that his Honour had detected a change in sentencing practice which had occurred over such a short time as to make it difficult to determine whether or not a new pattern had developed. 
     
      
    40    The guideline of a quantitative character contained in Ferrer-Esis purported to be a distillation of actual sentencing practice by first instance judges. In this respect it was a “bottom up” guideline rather than the prescriptive “top down” guideline, recently developed as the practice of this Court. (See my address “Sentencing Guideline Judgments” (1999) 11 Current Issues in Criminal Justice 5 at 11; and (1999) 73 ALJ 876 at 881). 
     
      
    41    It is, however, of some significance that even in Ferrer-Esis the Court identified a change in the sentencing pattern occurring after the statutory modifications with respect to sentencing. Of particular relevance, in this regard, was Hunt J’s reference to the decision in Maclay in the above quoted passage. In that case the Court had emphasised the caution that needed to be exercised in translating sentencing patterns established under the previous legislative regime. Reference was made, for example, to the possibility that judges had responded to what the Court described as a “fictional element” in the sentences “by increasing non-parole periods in a way that to some extent ‘took account’ of the remission system” ((1990) 19 NSWLR 112 at 126).  
     
      
    42    In the joint judgment of the Court in Maclay, Gleeson CJ, Hunt and Loveday JJ identified the need for caution before making a comparison between pre Sentencing Act patterns and those appropriate under the new legislation. Although this was not, in terms, directed to the new regime for which the Commonwealth Crimes Act subsequently made express provision, nevertheless similar caution is appropriate in this context. This is particularly so because the s16G adjustment, which Hunt J had computed in Ferrer-Esis, is not an adjustment that is determined by the application of a mathematical formula, notwithstanding the frequent reference to a reduction of about one third. (See eg R v El Karhani (1990) 51 ACrimR 123 at 136-137). Indeed, the adjustment by Hunt J of a twelve to sixteen year sentence range to a eight and a half to eleven years range, is itself not a precise one third adjustment. 
     
      
    43    El Karhani involved a courier with 447 grams of pure heroin. The Court noted that a “tariff’ for like cases” appeared to lie between seven to twelve years (at 138), before any s16G adjustment. This coincides with the lowest point identified in Ferrer-Esis. It is by no means clear whether the “like cases” to which the Court was referring encompassed all trafficable quantities involving couriers, or was further qualified by quantity of the order of magnitude there under consideration (which could be regarded as “mid level”). 
     
      
    44    In both Ferrer-Esis and El Karhani, this Court provided an estimate of the “tariff” customarily imposed by trial judges. A change in sentencing patterns was first noted in this Court in R v Lawson (1997) 98 ACrimR 463 where James J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Levine J agreed, referred to the range identified in Ferrer-Esis and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is of course clear that where an offender has provided assistance to the authorities and has received a discount for that assistance, the resulting sentence may be below the lower limit of the range of sentences indicated by his Honour. However, since  
        Ferrer-Esis 
         the pattern of sentences which have been imposed on couriers who have not provided assistance has tended to be rather lower than the range of sentences indicated by his Honour. … Statistics provided by the Judicial Commission show that in the higher Courts between January 1990 and December 1996 the great majority of sentences for offences under s233B of the  
        Customs Act 
         involving a trafficable quantity of heroin, where the offender had pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions, were less than eight years.” (at 477) 
        
       
      
    45    In that case Hunt CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where this court refers to a range of sentences which have been imposed for a particular offence, it is doing no more than recording, as an historical fact, that that is the general pattern of sentencing at that particular time, so that sentencing judges will have regard to that general pattern when imposing sentences in the particular case. Such patterns are not immutable; this court has at times said that some sentencing patterns have been too low and that more severe sentences should be imposed. A range of pattern of sentencing does not imply that every case within that range is of precisely the same type: some of the cases within the range will have more serious objective circumstances than others; some will have more impressive subjective considerations than others. It is for the sentencing judge to determine where the facts of the particular case fit within that pattern.” (at 465) 
        
       
      
    46    His Honour went on to note that there were factors which would justify a departure from the range of sentences which had been identified in Ferrer-Esis. Indeed his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even in relation to the range referred to in  
        Ferrer-Esis,  
        this court has said that the age of a particular offender will justify a departure from the range of head sentences for couriers of substantial (but nevertheless still trafficable) quantities of heroin referred to in that case. A plea of guilty will often be a significant factor permitting such a departure, depending on the extent of mitigation attaching to that plea.” (at 465) 
        
       
      
    47    In R v Doan (unreported, NSWCCA, 27 September 1996), Hunt CJ at CL annexed to his judgment a schedule of cases in which this Court had considered sentences for importation of trafficable quantities of heroin. The head sentences were in the range of five years to nine years. None of the cases involved more than 1 kilogram. They were all in the low or mid range trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    48    In Lawson, James J referred to the schedule in Doan for the proposition that the pattern of sentences “has tended to be rather lower” than the range suggested in Ferrer-Esis. However, this should be understood in a context that the schedule did not involve high range trafficable quantities. 
     
      
    49    In Lawson, Hunt CJ at CL emphasised that the cases in the Doan schedule were almost all cases in which there was a plea of guilty. In Ferrer-Esis itself there was a plea of guilty, however, the circumstances of that case did not warrant any particular discount for that plea. (See Ferrer-Esis at 238). 
     
      
    50    In Bernier, Smart, Studdert and Hidden JJ, in a joint judgment, referred to the observations of James J in Lawson. The Court noted that the schedule of cases in Doan was for low and mid level trafficable quantities. A schedule of cases handed up to the Court by the Crown in Bernier was described in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “None of the heroin cases involved an amount towards the top of the trafficable range, but several of the cocaine cases do. They resulted in sentences ranging between eight and ten years. In respect of cases in that upper trafficable range, those figures lend some support (albeit limited) to the observation of James J that the pattern of sentencing in recent years is somewhat lower than that expressed in  
        Ferrer-Esis 
        .” (at 47) 
        
       
       
      The Court went on to note: 
       
       
        
        “We have examined these cases dealing with trafficable quantities only in so far as they might be of some assistance in determining a range for low commercial quantities, of which there are fewer cases. Inevitably, there will be some overlap between the top of the trafficable range and the bottom of the commercial range.” (at 48) 
        
       
      
    51    The Court went on to refer to an earlier decision of Hunt J in R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427 at 435; 49 ACrimR 142 at 149-150, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hunt J recognised the ‘tariff’ for couriers of commercial quantities of cocaine as sixteen years prior to the section 16G adjustment, resulting in a sentence of a little over ten years after that adjustment.” (at 48) 
        
       
      
    52    The Court went on to note a number of cases involving low commercial quantities of cocaine or high range trafficable quantities, in which the role of the offender was greater than that of a courier. A schedule was also handed to the Court with sentences for couriers of commercial quantities some of which were decisions of this Court but most of which were decisions of the District Court. The Court said about the sentences on this schedule: 
     
      
       
        
        “They range from six and a half years to eleven and a half years, where in some cases allowance is made for assistance to authorities, and in one case the sentencing judge indicated that, but for the assistance, a sentence of twelve years would have been appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        The views of judges of the District Court, whose daily task is to determine the appropriate sentencing matter such as these, must command great respect. We are mindful of the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Lawson 
         … that the specification of a range or pattern of sentence is no more than an observation of sentencing practice. Nevertheless, given the paucity of such cases in this court and in the absence of the detailed reasons of the District Court judges in the cases referred to in the schedule, we are not confident that any reliable range can be arrived at. However, what can be said is that the pattern of sentence for substantial quantities of drugs identified by Hunt J in  
        Ferrer-Esis 
         (eight and a half to eleven years) should now be seen as more appropriate for the importation by couriers of drugs in quantities of the lower range of the commercial range. We doubt that twelve years is within that range but, if it is, it is right at the top of it.” (at 48-49) 
        
       
      
    53    It is this passage which has been criticised by the Crown in this appeal. In general terms, the Crown advocates the affirmation of the Ferrer-Esis range as an appropriate range for high level trafficable offences. Low range commercial quantities, up to 3.5 kilograms, should be proportionately higher. 
     
      
    54    The analysis in Lawson and Bernier has been the subject of further notice in judgments of this Court. 
     
      
    55    The identification in Lawson and Bernier of an apparent change in sentencing patterns was referred in R v Wai Tung Chu (unreported, NSWCCA, 16 October 1998) per Spigelman CJ, with whom McInerney and Sperling JJ agreed. 
     
      
    56    In R v Robertson (unreported, NSWCCA, 6 November 1998), Dunford J, with whom Beazley JA and Wood CJ at CL agreed, referred to Bernier but noted that the case then before the Court was concerned with supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), not s233B of the Customs Act. Nevertheless by way of obiter his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted that as a result of  
        Bernier 
         the range of sentences for couriers of a substantial range of cocaine and heroin has been reduced from what it was said to be at the time that  
        Ferrer-Esis 
         was decided (see also  
        R v Lawson 
         12 December 1987 and  
        R v Doan 
         CCA 27 September 1996). In my view this is not the case.  
        Bernier 
         was a particular case decided on its peculiar facts to which I have referred, and when these three cases are read as a whole, they should not be taken as indicating a lowering of the range. In my view the range for couriers involved in the importation of substantial quantities of heroin or cocaine, ie at the upper end of the trafficable or at the lower end of the commercial range under the  
        Customs Act 
         is as stated in  
        Ferrer-Esis 
        , which remains an appropriate benchmark, ie of eight and a half to eleven years after adjustment on account of s16G of the  
        Crimes Act 
         (Cth).  
        Bernier 
         and other cases referred to should not be understood by sentencing courts as indicating otherwise.” (p8) 
        
       
      
    57    I note that Dunford J did not adopt the Crown’s proposition that the Ferrer-Esis guideline applies to the upper trafficable range. His Honour adopted the reference to “substantial quantities” in Ferrer-Esis itself, which suggested an overlap between that range and the lower commercial range. 
     
      
    58    The issue arose again in R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1, where Abadee J, with whom Sheller JA agreed, quoted the above passage from Robertson and added at [28] - [29]: 
     
      
       
        
        “On one view it might be thought that this passage is inconsistent with the statement of this court in  
        Bernier 
         that the range of eight and a half to eleven years is appropriate for the importation by couriers of drugs at the lower end of the commercial range not the upper end of the trafficable range, with the court making a careful distinction between the lower commercial and upper trafficable ranges. 
        
       
       
        
        This said, it is not necessary to determine whether there is conflict between  
        Bernier 
         and  
        Robertson 
        , so that  
        Bernier 
         no longer reflects the law in the area in which it operates. My reason for so concluding may be further summarised. As I have said the remarks of Dunford J in  
        Robertson 
         appear to be obiter and here accepted by the parties as such. Second, there is nothing in the decision in  
        Robertson 
         that demonstrates that the reasoning process or the statement of the applicable range in  
        Bernier 
         is wrong. In fact in  
        Robertson 
        ,  
        Bernier 
         was distinguished on its own facts … In any event  
        Robertson 
         is not a decision on s233B of the  
        Customs Act 
         and the court did not, as did the court in  
        Bernier 
        , analyse the pattern of sentences imposed under that provision.” 
        
       
      
    59    In Barrientos, Hulme J, who referred to a number of authorities in this Court, said he was prepared to assume that the analysis in Bernier was correct but, casting some doubts on that assumption, emphasised that the court in Bernier had in mind couriers who had pleaded guilty (at [72]). 
     
      
    60    On 24 February 1999, this Court handed down three judgments in cases which had been argued together. These were R v Spiteri [1999] NSWCCA 3; R v Yu [1999] NSWCCA 6: and R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7. In these cases Hulme J, in dissent, concluded that Bernier was wrong. Hidden and Greg James JJ said that they were not prepared to depart from Bernier, inter alia, because the point had not been argued by counsel. Their Honours indicated that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had expressly refrained from challenging the authority of Bernier in the way that has now been done before the Court in these proceedings. Hidden and Greg James JJ emphasised that the Director did not concede the correctness of Bernier in taking the stand that he did for purposes of determining the three cases then before the Court. 
     
      
    61    Hulme J took a different view on this issue. In each of the three cases his Honour came to the view that the reasoning in Bernier as to the inappropriateness of the range from Ferrer-Esis for high level trafficable quantities was not correct. His Honour gave a detailed exposition of his conclusions in this respect in the case of Spiteri, where he considered a large number of decisions of this Court and other Courts. 
     
      
    62    Subsequent consideration of these cases in this Court in R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121 at [24] emphasised the special factors in Bernier itself, in particular the allegation of duress with an attendant possibility of an acquittal if such a defence had been raised. This gave the guilty plea significant weight. However, the relevance of Bernier for present purposes is not in the particular sentence which the Court decided was appropriate in that case. Rather, it is as to the qualification that the reasoning in Bernier has made to the range identified earlier in Ferrer-Esis. 
     
      
    63    In this respect Wood CJ at CL said in Blanco at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true to say that some different views have been expressed in this Court, concerning the analysis undertaken in  
        Bernier 
         in respect of the pattern of sentencing since  
        Ferrer-Esis 
        . The divergence of opinion seems to me to point towards the desirability of the Court reconsidering the matter by way of a guideline judgment.” 
        
       
      
    64    It is desirable that these differences, to which Wood CJ at CL referred, should be resolved by a five judge bench. The Court of Criminal Appeal cannot perform its function of ensuring consistency in sentencing on the part of trial judges, if it does not manifest consistency in its own decisions. There is a range of permissible opinion on matters of this character at an appellate, as well as at trial, level. Nevertheless there are limits to the permissible range of variation (Jurisic at 221). 
     
      
    65    The divergence has become manifest in terms of a difference of approach to what has been regarded as a guideline for sentencing for this offence in Ferrer-Esis. It is appropriate to resolve that divergence by considering that guideline and, if appropriate, clarifying and/or reformulating it. 
     
      
       
      Crown Submissions 
       
      
    66    The Crown case presented to this Court was, in essence: 
     
      
       
      (i) The  
      Ferrer-Esis 
       guideline is appropriate for high range trafficable quantities of heroin and cocaine. 
       
       
      (ii) An appropriate increment should be applied to the  
      Ferrer-Esis 
       guideline in the case of low range commercial quantities (up to 3.5 kilograms). 
       
       
      (iii) An appropriate increment schedule should be applied to the  
      Ferrer-Esis 
       guideline in the case of persons whose level of criminality is higher than that of a courier. 
       
       
      (iv)  
      Bernier 
      , by applying a range appropriate for high range trafficable quantities in the case of a courier to low range commercial quantities in such a case, either reduced the actual current sentencing levels or, alternatively, validated lower sentencing levels. 
       
       
      (v) The nature and prevalence of the offence did not warrant any such reduction or validation. 
       
      
    67    The judgment of Hulme J in Spiteri contained a schedule of cases of charges under s233B of the Customs Act for importation of both heroin and cocaine, covering the spectrum of trafficable and commercial ranges. The cases listed were heard in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, and corresponding courts in other States. The role of the offender is not limited to that of ‘courier’. Rather, his Honour’s schedule includes cases that involve different degrees of participation; from ‘below/above courier’, ‘possessor’ and ‘minder’, to ‘distributor’, ‘principal’ and ‘entrepreneur’. 
     
      
    68    Schedules prepared by the Crown for these proceedings also covered the whole range of trafficable and commercial ranges. The Crown presented separate schedules for decisions of Courts of Criminal Appeal in other States and in this Court. These schedules did not include first instance decisions. 
     
      
    69    In its submissions, the Crown contended that the schedules of cases of decisions by this Court in terms of outcomes, indicated the following pattern of sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) In relation to the standard case of a courier pleading guilty with regard to low range trafficable quantities the range seems to be a head sentence of imprisonment for five to seven years; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) In relation to the standard case of a courier pleading guilty in regard to offences involving mid range trafficable quantities, the range seems to be head sentences of imprisonment for six to eight and a half years; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) For quantities above those announced the cases do not fall into neat groups or lend themselves to the derivation of any precise tariffs.” 
        
       
      
    70    The Crown submitted that whilst there was no identifiable sentencing pattern for high range trafficable quantities, the Ferrer-Esis range of eight and a half to eleven years “falls logically into place”. Furthermore, it submitted that, on that basis, the range for low commercial quantities would be in the vicinity of ten to thirteen years.  
     
      
    71    Notwithstanding its reliance on the schedules of sentences, the Crown referred to the difficulties involved in identifying a sentencing pattern from the limited number of cases which come to this Court. Two particular difficulties were mentioned. First, the inhibition on the Court in the case of Crown appeals by reason of the double jeopardy factor, from imposing a sentence of a size which ought to have been imposed at first instance. Secondly, the distortion in the case of a substitution by police of a controlled delivery sample which results in a sentence technically related to a small trafficable quantity, when the original intention was to import a larger amount. By reason of these difficulties, the Crown urged the Court to adopt a more prescriptive, i.e. top-down approach, in identifying appropriate sentences. It should not be confined to the existing sentencing patterns. 
     
      
    72    The Crown proposed the following guidelines for head sentences in the case of couriers pleading guilty: 
     
      
       
      Low Range trafficable quantities - 5 to 7 years (2gms - 200gms) 
       
      Mid Range trafficable quantities - 6 to 8½ years (200gms - 1 kg) 
       
      High Range trafficable quantities - 8½ to 11 years (1kg - 1.5kgs (heroin) or 2kgs (cocaine)) 
       
      Low Range commercial quantities - 10 to 13 years (1.5kgs (heroin) or 2kgs (cocaine) - 3.5 kgs) 
       
      Substantial commercial quantities - 12 to 15 years (3.5kgs - 10kgs) 
       
      
    73    In substance, the Crown submitted that this Court should affirm the Ferrer-Esis guideline in accordance with the interpretation of that case which it urged on the Court and extend that guideline to other ranges. 
     
      
    74    The Crown’s submission that the Ferrer-Esis range “falls logically into place” is not justified. The level below, i.e. for mid range trafficable quantities was identified in the Crown submissions as six to eight and a half years. The Crown submission is that the high range trafficable quantity should commence precisely where the mid range quantity ceases. 
     
      
    75    The submission of the Crown is that what it identifies as the top of the range for mid range trafficable quantities, ie eight and a half years, should become the very bottom of the range for high range trafficable quantities. This contrasts with the Crown’s own identification of an overlap between low range and mid range trafficable quantities: the former ending at seven years and the latter commencing at six years. Similarly, the Crown submits that there should be an overlap between high range trafficable quantities (ending at eleven years) and low commercial quantities (commencing at ten years).  
     
      
    76    It is not correct, in my opinion, to fail to allow for an overlap between categories. There is no distinct point where one range ends and the other range commences. If quantity was the only factor relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, then one could accept a clear distinction at the point where one range ends and another begins. However, quantity is not the only factor required to be taken into account, either under s16A of the Crimes Act or in accordance with general principles. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing Patterns 
       
      
    77    In my opinion, the Crown’s schedules do not support the contention that the Ferrer-Esis range of eight and a half to eleven years is in accordance with sentencing patterns for high range trafficable quantities. 
     
      
    78    I annex as Schedule 1, a schedule of sentences in this Court for couriers and others involved at a low level in the hierarchy of an importing organisation. This is drawn from the Crown schedules submitted to the Court. It lists the cases which, in my assessment, cover couriers and equivalent participants. 
     
      
    79    In preparing such schedules there is scope for disagreement at the margin as to how particular outcomes should be classified and, in particular, where ranges, other than the statutory distinction between trafficable and commercial quantities, should be identified. 
     
      
    80    Schedule 1 draws on, but is not identical to, the schedules of decisions in this Court as presented by the Crown. This represents differences in judgment on some classification issues. 
     
      
    81    Schedule 1 consists of four categories as suggested by the Crown: 
     
      
       
      Low range trafficable quantities 2gms - 200gms 
       
       
      Mid range trafficable quantities 200gms - 1kg 
       
       
      High range trafficable quantities 1kg - 1.5kgs (heroin) 1kg - 2kgs (cocaine) 
       
       
      Low range commercial quantities 1.5kgs - 3.5kgs (heroin) 2kgs - 3.5kgs (cocaine) 
       
      
    82    In addition, it is appropriate to identify two other categories: 
     
      
       
      Substantial commercial quantities 3.5kgs - 10kgs 
       
      Major importations Above 10kgs 
       
       
      New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal cases in these categories are set out in Schedule 3. 
       
       
      These two ranges are above the level capable of being carried by an individual courier. In these categories there are only four cases of sentences on persons who participate at a level in the hierarchy that may be seen as equivalent to couriers. Accordingly, little in the way of guidance can be obtained from sentencing patterns. 
       
      
    83    When considering the sentences in Schedule 1, in my opinion, the Court should set aside the final outcome in any case in which a significant discount for assistance has been given. Because of the notorious difficulties of detecting the crime of importation - a crime whose victims cannot report it and would not if they could - the courts give significant discounts for assistance. 
     
      
    84    The ranges indicated in Schedule 1, for a courier or equivalent, after omitting cases affected by a substantial discount for assistance, are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Low range trafficable quantity range from 5 - 7 years head sentence 
        
       
       
        
        Mid range trafficable quantity 5.4 - 10 years head sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        High range trafficable quantity 6.5 - 10 years head sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        Low range commercial quantity range from 8 -12 years. 
        
       
      
    85    As one would expect there is a substantial overlap between the respective ranges. There are some anomalies. Nevertheless a reasonably clear sentencing pattern emerges. I do not accept the Crown submission that no discernible pattern exists above the mid range trafficable quantity. That proposition can, however, be sustained with respect to importations above 3.5 kilograms, to which Schedules 3 and 4 refer. 
     
      
    86    In general terms, the material put before the Court does support the conclusion to which this Court came in both Lawson and Bernier to the effect that the range suggested in Ferrer-Esis has tended to be imposed for low range commercial quantities rather than for high range trafficable quantities, although there is an overlap between the two ranges. 
     
      
    87    The Crown provided the Court with a schedule of outcomes from Courts of Criminal Appeal in other States. Schedule 2 sets out that information for couriers or other low hierarchy participants. The number of cases is less than those in this Court. A significant majority of drug importations occur in New South Wales. 
     
      
    88    The schedule contains a number of anomalies particularly with respect to some high sentences in the category of mid range trafficable quantities. However, with respect to the distinction between the high range trafficable and low range commercial quantities, the few cases are broadly confirmatory of the New South Wales position save that the outcomes of several cases in the low commercial range are significantly above the top of the range suggested by the New South Wales cases. 
     
      
    89    The desirability of uniformity of approach throughout Australia may indicate some need for firming up the top of the range for sentences involving low range commercial quantities. It is desirable that the respective State courts invested with federal jurisdiction to hear prosecutions for Commonwealth offences, approach the sentencing task with an element of harmony. This is required, in my opinion, by Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth). 
     
      
    90    As Malcolm CJ said in Medina v The Queen (1990) 108 FLR 288 at 292-293: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a context of offences which are committed against Commonwealth legislation, such as the importation provisions of the  
        Customs Act 
        , it is important that courts throughout Australia adopt a common approach to the sentencing of offenders.” 
        
       
      
    91    To similar effect is the reasoning of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in a joint judgment of Hayne JA, Crockett and Southwell AJJA in Krasnov & Shlakht (1995) 82 ACrimR 92 at 95: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted that because the offences to which Krasnov pleaded guilty were offences against Commonwealth law, it was important that there should be no significant departure from general sentencing levels obtaining throughout the Commonwealth and so much may be accepted. Uniformity of sentencing, particularly in relation to Commonwealth offences is important. Of course the exercise cannot be pressed too far. The assistance that may be obtained from particular sentences imposed on other persons in other circumstances is necessarily limited.” (at 96) 
        
       
      
    92    The proposition that sentencing for Commonwealth offences should adopt a similar approach can readily be accepted. It is implicit in the legislative scheme of the Crimes Act that this be so, notably in the provision of s16G itself, which seeks to ensure that sentences actually to be served are comparable, notwithstanding differences in State regimes with respect to the availability of remissions or other reductions. Absent the operation of permissible local factors, similar results should follow from the application of “uniform sentencing principles” (Leeth v The Commonwealth (1991-92) 174 CLR 430 at 476. See also Leeth at 470-471 per Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ; Sir Guy Green “The Concept of Uniformity of Sentencing” (1996) 70 ALJ 112 at 120-122). 
     
      
    93    In this regard it is pertinent to note that courts in other States have referred to the range in Ferrer-Esis in the context of determining appeals from sentences. In R v Foster & D’Anna (1992) 59 ACrimR 14, Seaman J, with whom Malcolm CJ and Dick J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales has held that the recognised pattern of sentencing for couriers of substantial quantities of heroin prior to the commencement of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         1989 (NSW) produced head sentences of between twelve and sixteen years, with minimum terms generally fixed within the order of approximately 60-75% of the head sentence:  
        Ferrer-Esis 
         (1991) 55 ACrimR 231.” (at 20) 
        
       
      
    94    This passage appeared in the course of his Honour referring to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia in which sentences of twelve years for couriers of a small importation were not regarded as excessive. His Honour also referred to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria in which a penalty of fifteen years with a minimum term of twelve years imposed upon a courier was not regarded as inappropriate. Similar references occur in R v Parsons (1993) 66 ACrimR 550 at 562 per Malcolm CJ, and R v Burns (1994) 71 ACrimR 450 at 456 per Owen J. 
     
      
    95    Recently in R v Cheng, R v Chan and R v Cheng [1999] SASC 175, to be referred to below, the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal referred to the qualification of Ferrer-Esis in Bernier and the majority in Spiteri, [95] - [100]. 
     
      
    96    A comparison of Schedule 1 and 2 does suggest that courts in other States impose slightly higher sentences at the top of the low commercial quantity range. 
     
      
    97    Schedules 3 and 4 set out sentences for substantial quantities (3.5kgs to 10kgs) and major importations (above 10kgs) in, respectively, this Court and other Courts of Criminal Appeal. Unlike Schedules 1 and 2 these schedules encompass all cases, including principals. (There are only four low level offenders in Schedule 3). 
     
      
    98    With respect to the 3.5kgs to 10kgs range in each of Schedules 3 and 4 there was one sentence which was low but explicably so. Otherwise the range in New South Wales was nine to eighteen years and, in other States and Territories, nine to twenty-five years. As in the case of low range commercial quantities, the interstate comparison indicates that uniformity of approach suggests a need to firm up sentences in New South Wales. 
     
      
    99    It is, however, difficult to be definitive in this respect. In each of the two higher ranges the range of sentence is too broad to suggest any definitive sentencing pattern. No doubt this reflects, in part, the great diversity of roles with respect to the act of importation performed by the offenders to whom the schedules refer (from the most minor part to the mastermind). 
     
      
    100    Of particular significance for present purposes is that, other than the one explicably low case in Schedule 4, only two other interstate cases are below a twelve to twenty-five year range. These are the cases of Yu Shing Cheng (9 years) and Gang Cheng (10 years). These, together with Bach An Chan (13 years), constituted the Adelaide leg of the very importation with which these appeals are concerned. I will return to these cases. 
     
      
    101    Schedules 1 to 4 refer only to sentence outcomes in Courts of Criminal Appeal. It is important to understand sentencing patterns by trial judges when determining whether a sentencing guideline should be promulgated. The existence of inconsistency or systematic leniency in sentencing by trial judges are two reasons for doing so identified in Jurisic and Henry. 
     
      
    102    The statistics available to the Court cover the period January 1990 to December 1998. They include sentences by trial judges and those imposed after appeal. The Court is concerned with head sentences for offences against s233B for heroin and cocaine. 
     
      
    103    The Judicial Commission’s statistics with respect to offences against s233B are of some, albeit limited, utility. The first limitation is the large variety of ways in which that section can be infringed. Secondly, the statistics do not permit the Court to distinguish between different levels of quantity within the two statutory categories of trafficable quantity and commercial quantity. Thirdly, the statistics do not permit the Court to distinguish offenders by the role played in an importation. 
     
      
    104    I annex hereto four charts showing the Judicial Commission statistics for head sentences. These charts indicate a concentration of sentences in certain ranges which suggests a substantial level of consistency in the sentencing pattern. Furthermore, there are very few short sentences. This suggests strongly that there is no systematic leniency in the existing sentencing pattern. That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that of the 303 offenders sentenced in relation to trafficable quantities, only eight received sentences which did not comprise or include a prison term. In the case of commercial quantities, of 133 offenders all received a prison term. Non-custodial sentences for this offence must be restricted to truly exceptional cases. Sentencing judges have done so. 
     
      
    105    In the case of trafficable quantities, approximately three-quarters of all sentences fall in the range of five to ten years. In the case of commercial quantities approximately three-quarters of all sentences fall in the range of seven to fourteen years. An additional 16% of cocaine offenders and 10% of heroin offenders received five or six year terms for commercial quantities. Furthermore, 19% of heroin offenders received more than fourteen years. 
     
      
    106    The Crown referred the Court to a recent report by the Judicial Commission, Sentencing Drug Offences (August 1999). This report contained a detailed analysis of sentences imposed by higher courts in New South Wales from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1997. The Commission’s findings included the following: 
     
      
    · the most common drug involved in importation offences was heroin (45.5%) followed by cocaine (31%). 
     
      
    · just over one third of offenders (35.1%) acted as couriers. 
     
      
    · about eight out of ten offenders (82.6%) pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    · about seven out of ten offenders (70.8%) had no prior record of offending. 
     
      
    107    Neither the Judicial Commission’s report, Sentencing Drug Offenders (August 1999), which analysed sentences imposed in higher courts of NSW, from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1997, nor the Commission’s Sentencing Information System statistics regarding drug offences under s233B of the Customs Act, finalised in higher courts, for the period of January 1990 to December 1998, identify a pattern of inconsistency of approach in sentencing drug offenders which would justify correction by an appellate court. 
     
      
    108    Indeed, as the authors of the report, Sentencing Drug Offenders, conclude (p52): 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall, the statistics reveal a pattern of consistency in the sentences handed down by the court. This does not deny the existence of disparities, in some cases unjustified - if there were no such instances there would be no need for a system of appeals.” 
        
       
      
    109    Further, the statistics do not suggest manifest inadequacy in the sentences imposed by the courts. The terms set for offences involving trafficable and commercial quantities of heroin and cocaine, suggest that the length of the terms of imprisonment do accord with the seriousness of these offences. 
     
      
    110    Nothing in the materials presented to the Court, and nothing in the experience of the Court, suggests that there is any systematic inadequacy in the sentencing patterns of trial judges with respect to the offence under consideration.  
     
      
    111    The judges of this State are aware of the exceptional threat to our society that is posed by large scale drug use. In the case of persons accused of importation, or of being involved in importation, and whose motive is greed, there is a discernible unanimity in judicial approach.  
     
      
    112    These are serious offences committed by persons who have been and are subject to significant punishment at a level capable of deterring others. Whilst there is room for legitimate diversity of opinion as to the sentence outcomes which this general approach requires in the circumstances of a particular case, such diversity has been kept within proper bounds. Those few cases which may fall outside of those bounds can be rectified by the normal course of appeals against severity or leniency. In the case of drug importers and their accomplices, who are motivated by greed, the judiciary speaks with one voice. 
     
      
    113    In such circumstances the considerations relating to inconsistency and to systematic inadequacy of sentences to which reference is made in Jurisic and Henry as justifying a guideline judgment, do not arise. 
     
      
       
      Promulgating a Guideline 
       
      
    114    In Jurisic and Henry, the Court referred to a number of different reasons for promulgating a sentencing guideline. This analysis drew on the experience in other jurisdictions, particularly England and Canada, in this respect. 
     
      
    115    The Crown submitted that a guideline judgment was required by reason of an apparent increase in the incidence of the offences. Prevalence has long been accepted as a factor justifying an upward revision of sentences. A guideline judgment is one means of achieving such a result. 
     
      
    116    The Crown relied on crime statistics for the proposition that the crime of importation of drugs was increasing. The two sources of crime statistics relied on were police data and victim surveys. The Crown submitted these statistics demonstrated an upward trend in the reported incidence of drug importation. This trend justified the promulgation of sentencing guidelines as a measure of general deterrence. 
     
      
    117    The Crown conceded the inherent weaknesses of the statistics, particularly the data relating to the seizure of narcotics, which is influenced by the resources allocated to that task. The data is limited in its capacity to confirm the increased incidence, or otherwise, of the importation of heroin and cocaine. 
     
      
    118    The NSW Recorded Crime Statistics 1995-1998, prepared by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, show that the number of separate incidents of the offence of imported drugs fluctuated as follows: 1995 (11); 1996 (9); 1997 (39); 1998 (25). The data does not permit any reliable conclusion as to increases in importation. The process of detection of imports is too haphazard. The figures themselves are equivocal. 
     
      
    119    The Australian Illicit Drug Report 1997-1998, prepared by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, provides a more thorough analysis. The principal findings of this report, on which reliance was placed by the Crown, are concerned with the quantity of heroin and cocaine detected or seized Australia-wide. The quantity of these drugs identified in customs border detections fluctuates considerably from year to year. This makes interpretation difficult. Fluctuations may have a random quality in terms of skill and luck in detection. They may also reflect increased resources or greater efficiency, rather than increased importation.  
     
      
    120    In the case of heroin, the quantity so detected appears to be greater in the second half of the 1990’s, than in the first half. In the case of cocaine, after a fall in the mid 1990’s, there appears to be an increase in recent years. 
     
      
    121    As noted these statistics may not reflect an increase in quantity being imported. The changes suggested by this data are not so dramatic, nor have they been sustained over a sufficiently long time, to suggest anything in the nature of a significant trend requiring a new response by the courts. This is not to understate in any way the significance of the crime or its prevalence. However, the changes identified in the Crown submissions do not of themselves indicate the need for a new sentencing pattern. 
     
      
    122    The victim surveys relied upon by the Crown (The National Drug Strategy Household Survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 1998, and survey responses documented in W. Hall “Methadone Maintenance Treatment as a Crime Control Measure” (1996) 29 Crime and Justice Bulletin 1), provide estimates of heroin use, and indicate the close connection between heroin use and crime. They highlight an endemic socio-economic problem: a spiral of drug dependence feeding crime, and vice versa. These surveys confirm the significance of the drug problem in our society. 
     
      
    123    This material does not warrant any cause for complacency on the part of the courts in performing their task to punish and deter those involved in these crimes. There is no warrant for any slackening on the part of the courts. Nor, however, is there a demonstrated need for a significant alteration in response on the part of the courts. 
     
      
    124    In my opinion, it is appropriate for this Court to promulgate a comprehensive quantitative guideline for an offence for which a relevant guideline has long existed and, it appears, has proved to be of utility to sentencing judges throughout Australia. I refer, of course, to the Ferrer-Esis guideline. This step is particularly appropriate where, as in this case, some differences have emerged with respect to the interpretation of that pre-existing guideline. 
     
      
    125    There are two additional reasons for promulgating a quantitative guideline with respect to the offence presently under consideration: First, by providing guidance to trial judges it is less likely that sentences will be imposed which suggest a need for appellate review. Secondly, the clear promulgation of likely actual sentences will assist the objective of general deterrence. 
     
      
    126    One of the functions performed by the promulgation of sentencing guidelines is that of deterrence. Potential offenders should know in advance that offences of a particular kind are likely to lead to a particular level of sentence. The publication of maximum sentences does not perform a substantial deterrent function, as the relationship between maximum sentences and actual sentences is not sufficiently clear. This is plainly the case with respect to offences against s233B where, in the case of trafficable quantities, the maximum is expressed to be a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for twenty-five years and, in the case of commercial quantities, is expressed to be imprisonment for life. The very scope of the range impedes the published maximum having a deterrent effect.  
     
      
    127    There are significant differences of opinion as to the deterrent effect of sentences, particularly, the deterrent effect of marginal changes in sentence. Nevertheless, the fact that penalties operate as a deterrent is a structural assumption of our criminal justice system. Legislation would be required to change the traditional approach of the courts to this matter.  
     
      
    128    Deterrence only works to the extent to which knowledge is transmitted to potential offenders about actual sentencing practice. Guideline judgments are a mechanism for increasing the efficiency of the transmission of such knowledge. Deterrence is an appropriate basis for promulgation of a guideline. (See Henry at [41] and [205] - [211]; Police v Cadd (1997) 94 ACrimR 466 at 511; and my address “Sentencing Guideline Judgments” 11 CICJ 5 at 10-11; 73 ALJ 876 at 880-881). 
     
      
    129    There are numerous statements in judgments of Courts of Criminal Appeal throughout Australia which emphasise the role that general deterrence must play in the determination of the level of sentences for offences against s233B. Courts have frequently cited with approval the following observations of Brennan, Deane and Gallop JJ in R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 399: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand the deterrent aspect of punishment is of primary importance in cases of this kind. The sentence should demonstrate to others tempted to engage in lawlessness on a vast scale that the punishment to be imposed will be calculated to protect society from the deliberate attack made upon it. When an organised, costly and complex offence is contemplated the risk of apprehension and the severity of punishment is evaluated; and thus there can be no other class of case in which the deterrent effect of punishment can more confidently be assumed to operate. Those who deliberately choose to run the risk of punishment in order to acquire a profit from the venture cannot point to mitigating circumstances of the sort which stand the chance offender in good stead. The extent to which the sentence recedes from maximum cases of this kind is limited by the necessity to impose sentences of unequivocal severity as the most efficient means available to the courts to enforce the relevant prohibition.” 
        
       
      
    130    The legislature has made it clear, in providing for a gradation of penalties in the three relevant cases - less than a trafficable quantity, trafficable quantity and commercial quantity - that the amount of drugs is an important consideration in the sentencing exercise. This would in any event be suggested on the basis of first principles. The primary object of sentencing is the protection of the community. The adverse effects of drugs such as heroin and cocaine on the community are directly related to the quantity of drugs available in the community. Accordingly, quantity is an exceptionally important aspect of the objective seriousness of the crime. 
     
      
    131    Notwithstanding the significance of quantity, it is not determinative of the appropriate sentence. Other aspects of the crime, including objective and subjective considerations, remain relevant in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. One factor which arises in the course of contraventions of s233B is the role of the accused in the organisation, if any, which imports the drugs into Australia. 
     
      
    132    The courts have consistently refused to treat couriers, or other persons who are low in the hierarchy of organisation involved in drug importation, with the leniency which is sometimes appropriate in the case of other offences, to distinguish principals from persons of a lesser role. (See Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 at 239-240; R v Muanchukingkan (1990) 52 ACrimR 354 at 356; Laurentiu (1992) 63 ACrimR 402 at 417-418; R v Thiagarajah (1989) 41 ACrimR 45 at 49; R v Budiman (1998) 102 ACrimR 411 at 413-414). 
     
      
    133    Nevertheless, the difference in roles remains of significance for the sentencing exercise. The decision of the High Court in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 73 ALJR 1550 does not doubt the relevance of categorising an offender, although it establishes that such categorisation is not an essential part of the sentencing process.  
     
      
    134    The importance of quantity, as confirmed in the structure of the statutory scheme, indicates that any guideline should be structured by levels of quantum. This is, of course, how the Ferrer-Esis guideline was expressed. As I have said above, because there are considerations other than quantum relevant to the sentencing task, sentencing ranges for successive quantity ranges will necessarily overlap. 
     
      
    135    Other jurisdictions which have adopted guidelines for sentencing for importation of drugs have also structured the guidelines in terms of quantum. In the United Kingdom, the guideline developed over a series of cases (R v Aramah (1982) 76 CrAppR 190; R v Bilinski (1998) 9 CrAppR 327). The Court of Appeal identifies two points of reference, rather than ranges, for heroin and cocaine: 
     
      
    · 500 grams 10 years 
     
      
    · 5 kilograms or more 14 plus years 
     
      
    136    In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal has stated, without being precise as to quantum, that sentencing patterns suggest six to seven years for importers of heroin on a large scale (R v Urlich [1981] 1 NZLR 310; R v Stanaway [1997] 3 NZLR 129). In one case the Court accepted eighteen to twenty years as an appropriate starting point for an importation of 2 kilograms of 80% pure heroin (R v Accused [1992] NZLR 316). 
     
      
    137    In the present case it is appropriate to adopt a “bottom up” system of guidelines which does not contain any significant prescriptive element. This is a field in which the collective wisdom of trial judges and appellate judges of great experience, whose careful attention over many years to the proper level of sentences has, insofar as a discernible sentencing pattern has emerged, created the foundation for a more specific articulation of such patterns. As Sir Garfield Barwick put it in Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310, after noting the appropriateness of a Court of Criminal Appeal seeking to achieve consistency in the sentences imposed by trial judges: 
     
      
       
        
        “The views of those whose daily, or almost daily, task is the sentencing of prisoners must command respect. 
        
       
      
    138    Similar observations were made in Bernier as quoted above. 
     
      
    139    In the present case the importance of the sentencing pattern is reinforced by the narrowness of the focus of the Crown submissions in the present case, on sentences with respect to s233B of the Crimes Act (Cth). Trial judges have a relevant body of experience with respect to the sentencing of offenders under cognate State statutes. I use the word “cognate” to indicate that the consequences of trafficking drugs, and the nature of the criminal organisations involved in such trafficking, does not differ in principle in cases of seizures at the border, (prosecuted under the Commonwealth Act), and domestic seizures (prosecuted under State Acts). Whilst different considerations arise in the context of the various State regimes, there are also important common factors. The judgment of trial judges and judges in Courts of Criminal Appeal, many of whom are trial judges also, in the absence of any apparent inadequacy of outcomes, should be validated by this Court. 
     
      
    140    There are, of course, a range of factors identified in s16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which are required to be taken into account in sentencing for this offence. It is not necessary to review the list of considerations which frequently arise for determination in this particular context (see eg Fox & Freiberg Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed, 1999) at pars 12.907-12.909). As indicated above, a central factor is the quantity of drugs involved. The other considerations, both objective and subjective, which usually arise for determination in this context are intended to be encompassed by the range referred to below. 
     
      
    141    That is not to say that in particular cases, sentences outside the range would not be appropriate. It will frequently be the case, for the reasons already referred to, that a substantial degree of assistance will justify a sentence below the relevant range. There may also be circumstances in which a plea of guilty is entitled to such significant weight as to justify a sentence below the range. The range is not intended to apply to the principal of an organisation responsible for an importation or a person high in the hierarchy of such an organisation, to whom an increment should be applied. These factors are not intended to be exhaustive of the circumstances in which sentences outside the range will not attract the close scrutiny of this Court. 
     
      
    142    The following guideline is intended to be non-binding in the sense explained in Jurisic and Henry. It has been determined primarily on the basis of existing sentencing patterns and is intended to apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. 
     
      
    · Low level trafficable quantity - 5 - 7 years (2gms - 200gms) 
     
      
    · Mid level trafficable quantity - 6 - 9 years (200gms - 1kg) 
     
      
    · High range trafficable quantity - 7 - 10 years 1kg - 1.5kgs (heroin) 1kg - 2kgs (cocaine) 
     
      
    · Low range commercial quantity - 8 - 12 years 1.5kgs - 3.5kgs (heroin) 2kgs - 3.5kgs (cocaine) 
     
      
    · Substantial commercial quantity - 10-15 years (3.5kgs - 10kgs) 
     
      
       
      The Crown Appeals 
       
      
    143    The Crown has appealed against the alleged leniency of the sentences in each of the two cases involving Jackie Kai Chu Leung (”Leung”) and Nelson Tak Fat Wong (“Wong”). Wong has appealed against the severity of his sentence. However, as noted above, no submissions were made on his behalf in this respect.  
     
      
    144    Law pleaded guilty before his Honour Chief Judge Blanch in the District Court on 5 August 1998 after the matter had been listed for trial. He was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years with a non parole period of six years dating from 8 November 1997, the day of his arrest. Leung and Wong both pleaded not guilty and were found guilty after trial by jury. They were each sentenced by his Honour Judge Davidson on 18 December 1998, to imprisonment for a period of twelve years with a non parole period of seven years dating from 8 November 1997, being the day of their arrest. 
     
      
    145    The basic factual background is as follows. On 31 October 1997, five wooden packing cases, each containing one marble pedestal arrived in Adelaide from Bangkok. They were marked for delivery to an Adelaide address. The unopened crates were intercepted by Australian Federal Police and Customs officers. Each pedestal had a hollowed out section containing packages which, on later analysis, proved to be heroin. In total there was an amount of 9.356 kilograms of pure heroin. This places the importation at the very top of the significant commercial range. 
     
      
    146    Whilst in police custody the pedestals were dismantled, the heroin extracted and replaced with another substance mostly made up of plaster of paris but containing a small amount of heroin. Sound recording and transmitting equipment was inserted in one of the pedestals. 
     
      
    147    The pedestals were delivered to the Adelaide address. From there they were transported to Sydney. Police maintained surveillance of the pedestals on their journey. On Friday 7 November, Law picked up the vehicle in which the pedestals had been transported and drove it to his house in Ivy Place, Cherrybrook. Police maintained surveillance of the premises during the remainder of that night and the following day. 
     
      
    148    The police installed video recording equipment focused on the garage. Sound was recorded both on a digital audio tape recorder and on the sound recording system of the video recorder. 
     
      
    149    The video recording depicted, inter alia, Wong inside the garage placing a cardboard screen across the window. The audio devices recorded sounds consistent with the smashing of marble pedestals and also conversation in Chinese languages. The conversation incriminated the participants. 
     
      
    150    At 7.00pm, the police executed a search warrant and entered through the front door of the house. Present in the house when they did so were Wong, Leung and Law and no other person. 
     
      
       
      South Australian Sentences 
       
      
    151    Davidson DCJ considered sentenced imposed by the Supreme Court of South Australia on three persons involved in that State in the importation. Yu Shing Cheng (to whom the crates had been addressed) was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years; Gang Cheng to imprisonment for thirteen years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years; and Bach An Chan to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years. 
     
      
    152    It will be necessary to return to the circumstances of the involvement of these three below. It is sufficient to note that, following a successful appeal, the sentences were reduced, the final sentences being as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Yu Shing Cheng: nine years, non-parole period five years; 
        
       
       
        
        Gang Cheng: ten years, non-parole period six years; 
        
       
       
        
        Bach An Chan: thirteen years, non-parole period nine years. 
        
       
       
      (See  
      R v Cheng; R v Chan; R v Cheng 
       [1999] SASC 175 (13 May 1999). 
       
      
    153    These sentences raise issues of parity in the present appeals because they involve the same importation. 
     
      
    154    Yu Shing Cheng was the consignee of the crates containing the pedestals. He went to the airport and arranged for the cargo to be delivered to his residence in Adelaide. The trial judge accepted Yu Shing Cheng’s submission that he was only expecting two small parcels [70], [71]. 
     
      
    155    Gang Cheng was recruited by Bach An Chan to drive the pedestals to Sydney. He was paid $3,000 as well as $1,000 for the expense of renting the car in which to drive the pedestals. He arranged for the hire of the Landcruiser. He paid the hire charge with a credit card he had stolen [41]. Gang Cheng helped load the pedestals into the Landcruiser, drove the Landcruiser to Sydney and arranged for the delivery in Sydney [74]. 
     
      
    156    Doyle CJ held that Gang Cheng had a higher degree of culpability than Yu Shing Cheng as his role, particularly in the hiring of the Landcruiser, “involved significant dishonesty and deception” [109]. 
     
      
    157    Bach An Chan organised the Adelaide end of the operation. It was his job to supervise and manage at every point the movement of the heroin from Adelaide to Sydney. He also flew to Sydney to supervise its delivery to recipients there, obtaining a ticket under a false name. He recruited Gang Cheng and Yu Shing Cheng [110]. 
     
      
       
      Leung and Wong 
       
      
    158    In the cases of Wong and Leung, Davidson DCJ had before him a broader range of facts than those before the Chief Judge in the case of Law, including the transcript of, and evidence in, the trial. Davidson DCJ was able to identify the role of Leung and Wong. His Honour held that Leung was the person identified in the transcript as M1 and Wong was M3. 
     
      
    159    Leung was heard speaking on a mobile phone. He referred to “five kilo one, five big ones”. He was reporting to whoever was at the other end of the phone and said, “Now we are opening paper boxes” and “after we arrange everything we will do it for you”. 
     
      
    160    He was also recorded as having said, “It’s really disastrous, yesterday loss $290,000, today having to cough up money again”. Davidson DCJ held that this was not the language of a person who was merely a courier. He found it to be of a person who had a more substantial stake than a courier would be likely to have in such processes of importation. Leung was also heard to say, “I teach you what to do first, you see there are twenty-five ounces in each piece, there are twenty-eight strokes in each ounce”. Leung was also heard to say that he wanted something checked. After Leung discovered the material in the pedestals was not heroin he was recorded as saying, “People will die if found out people will be killed that will be true”.  
     
      
    161    His Honour held that the transcripts of the conversations in the garage indicated that Wong had advance knowledge of what was likely to be found in the pedestals. Wong answered a call on a mobile phone and the contents of that conversation indicated he knew what was in the pedestals. He described the pedestal as having been packed insufficiently and stated that he may have to make it up. He asked the caller how much the caller wanted. Again Davidson DCJ concluded that Wong’s participation went well beyond a mere courier or labourer. It put him in the range of what has been described as a mid range participant in the importation, that is someone in between a courier and principal. 
     
      
    162    His Honour reached the following conclusion on the relative roles of Law, Wong and Leung: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the participation of Mr Law was somewhat more extensive in one sense than that of Mr Wong and Mr Leung, it was Mr Law who drove the vehicle to his parent’s house and made the premises available from which presumably the ongoing supply was going to be affected, nevertheless, the phone calls in the garage suggest to me that his participation ceased or was to cease at that point. He was not, as I have found as a fact, engaged in or to be engaged in any ongoing process of ultimate supply, for it is in my view the phone calls make clear that both Mr Wong and Mr Leung were. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, whilst Mr Wong and Mr Leung are also, as I have said to be dealt with as being in the middle range of persons involved in the process of importation or prohibited drugs, their participation … was of a more serious kind than that of Mr Law in that it brought them closer to the ultimate evil which these substances are productive of; that is to say, their ingestion by members of this community and the resulting harm which ensues.” 
        
       
      
    163    On his Honour’s findings, Wong and Leung were major participants in the distribution chain. Whilst they may not have been principals in the act of importation, the level of objective criminality was of a similar order to a principal. The guideline I have proposed above is not relevant to the cases of Wong and Leung. 
     
      
    164    The Crown submits that the sentences imposed on Leung and Wong were manifestly inadequate and that in each case the head sentence should have been in excess of fifteen years. 
     
      
    165    There was a submission on behalf of Leung that his sentence could be seen to be excessive if the same sentence was imposed on Wong. Wong had previous convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and robbery in company. These convictions dated from September 1994. Wong received a period of periodic detention and was placed on recognizance but this had expired at the time of sentencing. There is no reason to disturb his Honour’s judgment of general equivalence between the two offenders. 
     
      
    166    Counsel for both Leung and Wong relied on the result in the case of R v Spiteri as indicating that the sentences imposed on their clients could not be said to be manifestly inadequate. In that case the Court, by majority, dismissed a Crown appeal in the case of a principal of an importation of a similar quantity. The sentence was fourteen years with a non-parole period of eight years. It is not, however, appropriate to compare any single case with another. 
     
      
    167    Counsel for Leung and Wong both submitted that the Court should, in its discretion, reject the Crown appeal on the grounds of the delay that occurred between the time of sentence on 18 December 1998 and the signing of the appeals on 24 February 1999, a period of some sixty-eight days. 
     
      
    168    The Crown appeal is brought under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act. That section prescribes no limit on the time in which an appeal may be brought. Where a convicted person brings an appeal against conviction or seeks leave to appeal against sentence, the appeal or application must, by force of s10 of that Act, be filed within twenty-eight days of the conviction or sentence. During the period here under consideration, time would not have run against a convicted person between 25 December and 9 January (Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 2 r 5). 
     
      
    169    By letters dated 24 December 1998, solicitors for each of Wong and Leung were advised that the Crown was considering an appeal. 
     
      
    170    The question of delay in the institution of a Crown appeal arises only with respect to the exercise by the Court of a discretion. In this regard delay must be weighed in the balance with other discretionary considerations. The contrast between the absence of any time stipulations in s5D, and the express provision in s10 of the Criminal Appeal Act, indicates that s5D cannot be read as containing an implied stipulation that an appeal should be lodged within a reasonable time. (See eg R v Porter (1953) 53 SR(NSW) 97 at 98). 
     
      
    171    Of particular significance in assessing the weight to be given to delay in the exercise of the discretion is the circumstance which sometimes occurs that the convicted person has served the whole or a substantial proportion of the sentence, particularly in the case where the effect of a successful appeal would be to return a person to prison. (See eg R v Carngham (1978) 140 CLR 487, especially at 494; R v Pham (1991) 55 ACrimR 128 at 135-136; R v Hallocoglu (1991) 21 NSWLR 67 at 80). However, this consideration is not the only circumstance which could justify the Court exercising its discretion to reject the Crown appeal on the basis of delay. 
     
      
    172    In R v Pham, Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where there has been any delay on the part of the Crown in instituting an appeal in a matter of this kind the question of delay is a relevant and sometimes a decisive discretionary consideration. However, its weight and significance will ordinarily depend on all the circumstances of the case. One of those circumstances may be the view which the Court takes on the matter of the extent of the inadequacy of the sentence under appeal.” (at 138) 
        
       
      
    173    Another such consideration is the relationship between the extent of delay and the prison term to be served. Where, as here, the non-parole period is seven or eight years, the element of delay in the timing of the Crown appeal is not such as to be entitled to substantial weight. This is particularly so as, within a week of the sentence, the Crown had advised the Respondents that an appeal was under consideration. 
     
      
    174    I am unable to discern any error of principle in the way Davidson DCJ approached the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The issue for this Court is whether the sentences themselves are manifestly inadequate, either in the head sentence or the non-parole period. 
     
      
    175    This was a very large importation. The extent of human misery which would have been inflicted on our community if the shipment had been delivered, is immense. If the ultimate sentence is manifestly inadequate, it is likely to be because his Honour failed to give proper weight to the size of the importation. 
     
      
    176    An issue of disparity arises in the case of Wong and Leung. In the South Australian proceedings, Bach An Chan was sentenced to sixteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years. These were the sentences to which Davidson DCJ had before him when sentencing Wong and Leung. On appeal, Bach An Chan’s sentence was reduced to thirteen years with a non-parole period of nine years. 
     
      
    177    In the South Australian appeal the Court had before it the sentences imposed by Blanch CJ of DC and Davidson DCJ. Doyle CJ regarded Law as operating at a higher level than Gang Cheng and Yu Shing Cheng and about equivalent to Bach An Chan. It appears his Honour regarded Chan as having a lesser degree of criminality than Leung and Wong. Doyle DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am proposing a slightly lower sentence than that imposed on Law for Yu Shing Cheng, the same sentence as Law for Gang Cheng and a significantly greater sentence for Bach An Chan, who would appear to have been operating at much the same level as Mr Law. The sentence I have proposed for Bach An Chan is also greater than the sentence imposed in NSW on both Wong and Leung. On that basis it could be argued that there is a disparity between the sentence imposed on the NSW offenders and those which I am proposing in this case. The question is whether that should cause me to modify the sentences I am proposing. 
        
       
       
        
        Taking into account the respective roles of the several players in the operation, I am prepared to accept that there is a disparity between the sentence imposed by the District Court in New South Wales on the NSW offenders and those that I am now proposing. However, whilst a majority (Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ) in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 held that mere disparity between sentences imposed on co-offenders is not of itself a ground for the intervention by an appellate court, if the difference is manifestly excessive and if the disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance or gives the appearance that justice has not been done, the higher sentence may still be interfered with even though it may be free from error except in so far as the discrepancy itself constitutes or causes error. See also  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295 per Gummow J at 322-323. 
        
       
       
        
        … … … 
        
       
       
        
        This Court as presently constituted, and as now called upon to impose the correct sentence on the South Australian appellants, is not at the same jurisdictional level as the District Court of New South Wales. Although this Court can exercise no appellate jurisdiction from the District Court of New South Wales, there is a greater reason in the hierarchy of criminal courts in Australia for this Court to reach its own conclusion, notwithstanding that it may create disparity with sentences imposed by the District Court of New South Wales. 
        
       
       
        
        While there is disparity, and in the case of the sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge, that disparity might well be described as manifestly excessive, I do not need to consider whether the differences between what I am proposing and the current sentences on the NSW offenders are such that they would necessarily require interference on that ground if this Court were sitting on appeal from them. If the NSW sentences do inspire a sense of grievance, then that may have to be tolerated in the public interest. In all the circumstances if this Court endorses my view as to what are the appropriate sentences, then this Court would be shrinking from its own responsibility in not imposing those sentences. As King CJ said in  
        R v MacGowan 
         (supra), to establish what might be regarded as parity with the NSW sentences would be felt to compound an error which would be unacceptable to the public conscience. 
        
       
       
        
        This is particularly so in the light of the outstanding appeals to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. It will be for that court to make up its mind about the adequacy of the New South Wales sentences, and in doing so it may have regard to but will not be bound by this decision. It will be for the parties to take such steps as they may be advised if, at the end of that process, there is a disparity which engenders a justifiable sense of grievance and which gives the impression that justice has not been done.” 
        
       
      
    178    It appears that his Honour, whilst reducing the sentences of the South Australian trial judge, believed that the sentences he proposed to substitute could engender a sense of grievance in the South Australian Appellants because they were too high in relation to the sentences imposed on the Respondents in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    179    I agree with his Honour’s analysis. On this basis, the South Australian sentences are not such as would justify any sense of grievance on the part of the present Respondents if this Court were to increase their sentence. 
     
      
    180    In my opinion, on the basis of the facts as found by Davidson DCJ and the objective and subjective circumstances to which he referred, and taking into account the considerations in s16A, the sentences his Honour imposed were lower than the least sentence that could properly have been imposed in each case. 
     
      
    181    Wong and Leung were major participants in a very large importation. The head sentences of twelve years are, in my opinion, manifestly inadequate. On this basis, the sentencing discretion falls to be re-exercised by this Court. 
     
      
    182    In exercising this discretion, I would not wish to be understood as approving the relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period in the sentences of Davidson DCJ. The non-parole period is just over sixty percent of the head sentence. The non-parole period was, in my opinion, manifestly inadequate. There was no warrant to discount the head sentence to the extent his Honour did. However, bearing in mind the principle of double jeopardy, I do not believe this Court should reject the relationship to the degree to which the level of criminality involved suggests. 
     
      
    183    In each case the least sentence that should have been imposed is an additional two years on both the head sentence and on the non-parole period. 
     
      
    184    The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      Leung 
       
      
    185    1 Crown appeal upheld. 
     
      
       
      2 Sentence quashed. In lieu thereof the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of nine years commencing on 8 November 1997. 
       
       
      Wong 
       
      
    186    1 Crown appeal upheld. 
     
      
       
      2 Sentence quashed. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of nine years commencing on 8 November 1997. 
       
       
       
      
    187    MASON P: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
       
       
      
    188    SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice with which, subject to the following reservations, I respectfully agree. 
     
      
    189    The reservations concern the suitability of the cases presently before the Court to provide the foundation for a guideline judgment in relation to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of an importing organisation. It would not, in my view, be appropriate to characterise any of the present respondents to the Crown appeals as low in the hierarchy of this organisation. Law, who appears to have been treated as the least involved of the three, collected the heroin and took it to his own house which he made available for the purpose of extracting the drug from the pedestals in which it was concealed. This places him, in my opinion, in a position of considerable involvement. Leung and Wong were major participants. There is, accordingly, no specific set of individual facts on which to draw for the purpose of promulgating a guideline judgment in relation to couriers and low level participants.  
     
      
    190    Moreover, the need for a guideline judgment in this respect is not immediately apparent to me. The guideline judgment is a useful tool in the two sets of circumstances outlined - where the experience of this Court shows either (i) systematic error or (ii) marked inconsistency in sentencing practice: see, for example, R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; R v Henry [1999] NSW CCA 107; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Neither is here demonstrated. Although this Court has been at pains, in both Jurisic and Henry, to emphasise that the flexibility that is an essential feature of the sentencing exercise remains undisturbed following the promulgation of a guideline, it is to be expected, and indeed is intended, that sentencing courts will, generally speaking, adhere to the range of sentences promulgated as appropriate. In order best to discharge that function it is desirable that this Court have before it specific concrete examples of cases illustrative of the kind and range of cases that confront sentencing judges. The cases would throw up instances not only of the objective facts in relation to offences under the relevant provision but samples of the wide range of individual factors that can affect the sentencing outcome. To promulgate a guideline in the abstract is, in my opinion, undesirable. This Court does not have before it such specific examples of individual cases: what it has before it is a set of three cases, all involving the same importation, involving a very large amount of the drug, and high level operatives. These cases do not and cannot provide an appropriate vehicle for a guideline judgment. 
     
      
    191    The survey of cases undertaken by the Chief Justice demonstrates that sentencing in relation to couriers and low level participants is both consistent and at an appropriate level. It would be sufficient, for the present, to endorse the approach that has thus far been taken, and to reserve promulgation of a guideline judgment to a time when a collection of cases, representing an overview of actual cases involving participants at the relevant level including subjective circumstances, is presented.  
     
      
    192    Having made these observations and on the basis that a guideline is to be promulgated, I agree, on the information before this Court - that is, the information drawn from the judgments in the cases to which reference has been made - with the range of sentences proposed in paragraph 142. 
     
      
    193    I specifically agree with the orders proposed in relation to each of the present respondents. 
     
      
       
       
      
    194    SPERLING J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
       
       
      
    195    BARR J: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

 OF NEW SOUTH WALES Decision Date: 14 December, 1999 
  
  
  
  Environment Protection Authority 
  
  Prosecutor 
  
  
  v 
  
  
  Michael Jeffrey Waight [No 2] 
  
  Defendant 
  
  
  
  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
  
  
 1. By four class 5 summons the defendant is charged with, negligently disposing of waste without lawful authority in contravention of s 5(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 (the EOP Act); negligently causing a substance to escape in contravention of s 6(1) of the EOP Act; being the occupier of a controlled waste facility without being the holder of a licence in contravention of s 44 of the Waste Minimisation and Management Act 1995; and that he did pollute waters in contravention of s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. 
  
  
 2. The defendant has served a Notice to Produce requiring the prosecutor produce the following documents for the purpose of evidence: 
  
  
   
    
    All files of the Environment Protection Authority NSW, together with all file notes, memorandum, correspondence, reports, recommendations, calculations, photographs, video tapes, plans, designs and maps concerning the preparation and issue of proceedings and charges under the Clean Water Act (sic), the Waste Minimisation and Management Act and the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act against Michael Jeffrey Waight of Lot 204, Old Northern Road, Glenorie, NSW, 2157 (“Lot 204”), including all files dealing with the investigation of Lot 204 prior to the issue of proceedings and charges, covering the period from January 1994 to the present. 
    
   
  
  
 3. The prosecutor seeks to have the defendant’s Notice to Produce set aside on the grounds that the terms of the Notice are too wide, it effectively requires discovery in criminal proceedings, and is oppressive. 
  
  
 4. Mr Buchanan SC referred the Court to a number of authorities which he says support the prosecutor’s argument. 
  
  
 5. There is no right of discovery in respect of documents in the possession or control of the prosecutor ( 
 Maddsion and Anor v Goldrick and Anor 
  [1976] 1 NSWLR 651 and  
 Khoder Mohammed Sobh 
  (1993) 65 A Crim R 466). 
  
  
 6. Starting with  
 The 
  Commissioner 
  for Railways v Small 
  38 SR(NSW) 564 as further elucidated in  
 National Employers’ Mutual General Association Ltd v Waind and Hill 
  [1978] 1 NSWLR 372, a subpoena will be set aside if it is used for the purpose of “fishing” or for the purpose of discovery which requires the person to whom the subpoena is addressed to make a judgment as to which of the documents relate to issues between the parties. The principle applies equally to a Notice to Produce addressed to a party and accordingly it is an abuse to use a Notice to Produce to obtain discovery. 
  
  
 7. Hunt J colourfully described the nature of a fishing expedition in  
 Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd 
  [1982] 1 NSWLR 294 at 295 at follows:- 
  
  
   
    
    A fishing expedition, as I apprehend that term, means that a person who has no evidence that fish of a particular kind are in a pool seeks liberty to drag it for the purpose of finding out whether there are any there or not:  
    Associated Dominions Assurance Society Pty Ltd v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd  
    (1952) 72 WN (NSW) 250, at 254. 
    
   
  
  
 8. Quite distinct from an abuse of process by using a Notice to Produce for the purpose of discovery is the objection that a subpoena is too widely or oppressively drawn  
 “not to obtain evidence to support his case, but to discover whether he has a case at all: … or to discover the nature of the other side’s evidence” 
  ( 
 Small 
  at 575). 
  
  
 9. The terms in which the Notice to Produce is expressed are self evidently very wide but, nevertheless provide some particularity by in effect requiring the production of every document held by the EPA and which relate to the charges from January 1994 to date. 
  
  
 10. The prosecutor does not say the Notice to Produce cannot be complied with. However, there is evidence of the extent of the material that meets the description of the documents and an estimate that it would take about 10 days to copy all of the documents, compile them and then to identify documents in respect of which legal professional privilege is claimed and documents which fall outside the scope of the Notice to Produce. In addition to audio cassettes, video tapes and computer discs, it is estimated there is in excess of 18,000 pages of documents that would require inspection. 
  
  
 11. The prosecutor recognises that it is not simply a question of the extent of the task itself, but rather the requirement to ascertain the issues and to make a judgment as to the relevance of each document. It is not oppressive to require the production of a large number of documents if sufficient time is allowed. 
  
  
 12. Mr Preston SC, who appears for the defendant, explained that there was a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking to inspect the documents and that the Court should be satisfied that  
 “it appears to be ‘on the cards’ that the documents would materially assist the accused” 
  (Hunt J in  
 R v Saleam 
  (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 commenting on the observations by the Chief Justice and Brennan J in  
 Alister v The Queen 
  (1984) 154 CLR 404). In A 
 lister 
  it was stated that, because the proceedings were criminal, special weight had to be given to the fact that the documents might assist an accused person whose liberty is at stake. 
  
  
 13. In  
 Alister 
  the High Court was considering the exercise of a court's power to inspect documents for which a claim of public interest immunity had been made by a Crown instrumentality. 
  
  
 14. In  
 EPA v Taylor Woodrow (Australia) Pty Ltd 
  (50030 of 1996 11 October 1996) Bignold J made reference to  
 Saleam 
  and  
 Alister 
  in the context of an application to set aside a Notice to Produce on the ground that the Notice was too wide and being used as a substitute for discovery. 
  
  
 15. In  
 R v James Saleam 
  [1999] NSWCCA 86 (27 April 1999) Simpson J expressed the opinion that the principles governing applications to set aside orders for the production of documents are no different from those governing applications for access to documents produced in answer to a subpoena. Her Honour said that,  
 “(b)efore access is granted (or an order to produce made) the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; and (ii) establish that it is “on the cards” that the documents will materially assist the case” 
 . She cited  
 Saleam 
  (1989) and also  
 R v Ali Tastan 
  (1994) 75 A Crim R 498. 
  
  
 16. Accordingly, while Bignold J appears to have treated  
 Saleam 
  (1989) and  
 Alister 
  as concerning an application to set aside a subpoena rather than an application to inspect documents already produced in  
 Taylor Woodrow 
 , nevertheless Simpson J expressly applied the same principles to the production of documents. 
  
  
 17. Mr Preston’s instructing solicitor has sworn an affidavit annexing correspondence relating to a subpoena addressed to a witness. The solicitors for the company to whom the subpoena is addressed have advised that any documents held in relation to the matters the subject of the subpoena are now in the possession of the EPA. Furthermore, Mr Preston explained in argument that the nature of the offences with which his client is charged demand knowledge of events and observations which occurred over a period starting in 1994, leading up to the date it is alleged the offence took place. He told the Court that a large dam had been constructed on the subject land during that period and that material had been brought onto and deposited onto the property for that purpose. The site had been the subject of investigation and observation by the EPA over that period of time. 
  
  
 18. The nature of the charges laid against the defendant to a large extent invariably demand an appreciation and consideration of the state of the land before and after the events complained of and an understanding of actions leading up to those events. Mr Buchanan complains that, even though that may be true, the Notice to Produce nevertheless lacks the particularity required in respect of the particular subject matter. 
  
  
 19. In  
 Saleam 
  (1989) the subpoena sought the production of every document relating to the investigation and prosecution of the offences with which the appellant and the co-accused had been charged, together with the reports of any investigation into allegations of perjury committed by the principal Crown witness in the committal proceedings and at the trial. Hunt J commented that the subpoena was far too widely drawn, even though the documents sought were specified with some particularity,  
 “in that in effect every document in the possession of the police had to be produced” 
 . Although the subpoena had been complied with, his Honour observed that there could have been no legitimate forensic purpose in having produced many of those documents. In that case, the time for the Commissioner to complain of the width of the subpoena had passed and the question to be decided was whether the legal advisers could have access to the documents in dispute. It was decided that, as it was at least  
 “on the cards” 
  that the documents in question would assist the appellant in his appeal and that there was therefore a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the documents, access should be granted. 
  
  
 20. As Simpson J observed in  
 Saleam 
  (1999), the Court should not shrink from making an order to produce documents, even though it involves a financial and personal burden on the prosecutor. 
  
  
 21. However, a proper reading of the Notice to Produce in this case effectively means that the prosecutor is required to produce every document that is in its possession and which concerns the preparation and issue of the proceedings and charges from January 1994 to the present. The charges relate only to a period between 1 August 1997 and 19 May 1998. 
  
  
 22. It is difficult for the Court to make an informed decision about the extent of assistance the documents will provide for a legitimate forensic purpose in the absence of the documents. 
  
  
 23. In the meantime what the Notice seeks is production of all documents related to the proceedings that are in the custody or control of the prosecutor. A Notice to Produce must specify, with reasonable particularity, the documents that are required to be produced. Until that is done in the present case and documents are produced in answer to a proper Notice to Produce, it is not practicable to determine whether there is a legitimate forensic purpose in making them available for inspection. 
  
  
 24. During his address Mr Preston referred the Court to the duty of a prosecutor to ensure that all relevant evidence is made available to an accused, together with help to have the opportunity of considering all the material evidence which has been gathered and from which the prosecution has made its own selection ( 
 Hennessey  
 (1979) 68 Cr App R 419 and  
 Ward 
  (1993) 96 Cr App R 1). These principles are now found embodied in the New South Wales Bar Rules and Law Society of New South Wales Solicitors Rules. 
  
  
 25. There is no suggestion that the prosecutor has failed heretofore in these proceedings or has any future intention not to abide these principles. 
  
  
 26. Although the duty to give full disclosure has been emphasised over the last 25 to 30 years, that principle nevertheless does not obviate the need for a subpoena or Notice to Produce to contain the necessary element of particularity. 
  
  
 27. The Notice to Produce in its present form, in my view, is tantamount to discovery and accordingly should be set aside. 
  
  
 28. The formal order of the Court is that the defendant’s Notice to Produce be set aside.

     REGINA v Michael John MITCHELL 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Michael John Mitchell seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Luland, Queen's Counsel, at Parramatta District Court on 21 October 1998. On that occasion the applicant adhered to earlier pleas of guilty on one count of possessing housebreaking implements under s114(1)(B) of the Crimes Act, 1900. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude. The second matter was one count of break and enter with intent to commit a felony under s112(1) of the Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude.  
    2   His Honour was also asked to take into account a number of matters under two Form 2’s, which were likewise matters of dishonesty including a number of matters of larceny. The offences under the first and second counts were committed on 7 January 1998. The matters on both Form 2’s related to the period 7 January 1998 to 22 April 1998. In relation to the first count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of one year penal servitude to commence on 17 October 1998 and to expire on 16 October 1999. In relation to the second matter, his Honour imposed a minimum term of three years penal servitude to commence on 17 October 1998, and to expire on 16 October 2001. His Honour imposed an additional term of one year penal servitude to commence on 16 October 2002.  
    3   The applicant was born on 15 February 1963, so that at the time he stood for sentence he was 35 years of age. Unhappily he has a long criminal record which appears to have commenced in May 1985. On that occasion he was dealt with in relation to dishonesty offences and using a prohibited drug, heroin. Since that date there is a litany of offences ranging up until the present matter. Some 20 appearances in court over the period of 13 years between 1985 and 1998 are recorded. There is absolutely no doubt that the applicant’s criminal activity is related to his addiction to narcotic substances, and, despite attempts over the years to come to terms with those addictions, he has been unable to do so, and when he has resumed the ingestion of narcotic substances, he has again entered a course of criminal conduct which has inevitably brought him back before the courts. Remarkably he has a very supportive wife who is a university qualified nurse and at those times when the applicant is not serving sentences, he provides her with transport and assists in caring, to a considerable extent, for the young children of the marriage. 
    4   Basically this is an ad misericordiam plea. In other words the applicant has thrown himself on the mercy of the Court and sought the Court, he being unrepresented, to review the sentences imposed by Judge Luland. However there is one specific matter to which attention should be drawn, in written submissions to the court the applicant said: 
     
      
       
       “I would like to ask this court to look at a previous psychiatric report which I was told was going to be presented to the court. I realise that it is from a previous conviction but it is still valid. In it you will see that I have had long periods of abstinence through the help of the methadone program and a supportive family. During this time I have worked and helped raise my family”. 
       
      
    5   That was a reference to a report of Dr Alex Sharah, dated 18 January 1996. Dr Sharah has apparently been treating the applicant for some time, at times with a successful methadone course, and at other times obviously without success. In the report, which was not before Judge Luland, reference is made to the fact that in 1995 the applicant was involved in a very serious motor vehicle accident which, in addition to orthopaedic injuries, caused brain damage to the applicant. The degree of that brain damage is not outlined in the report which of course is now over three years out of date. Nevertheless, it is clear enough that some brain damage was sustained in 1995. However, as I have already said, the applicant’s drug induced criminal record was well established by 1995. The report concludes: 
     
      
       
        
       “He is seeing me, discussing the issues of his life and coping with the stress of his depression and the accident as well as the unchanged relationship with his wife. He will continue to do this as necessary over the next year or two. If necessary also he will again recommence methadone rather than fall back into using the various medications and heroin. I have every confidence in his good sense and good will in treatment”. 
       
      
    6   In the submissions to this Court the applicant has also pointed out that during his most recent sentences he has undertaken drug and alcohol counselling and been to narcotics anonymous meetings. He said that he is now on a stable dose of methadone. He has also started a building studies course by correspondence with TAFE. He thought that he would have been an ideal candidate for the Drug Court at Parramatta. Perhaps this is so. He confirms that he still has the support of his wife and children and seeks an opportunity to return that support and, once more, become a part of their lives. Apart from the devotion of his wife and family, the history of this applicant is one that one sees with monotonous regularity in this Court. However as the presiding judge has pointed out to the applicant, apart from questions of sympathy and concern about the welfare of his family, the burden rests upon him of establishing that there was some error in the sentences imposed by Judge Luland, or in the reasons which he advanced for the imposition of those sentences.  
    7   Indeed when one looks at the applicant’s history of criminal offences, together with the seriousness of the two matters in respect of which he was charged and indicted, together with the serious matters on the Form 2’s, the irresistible conclusion is that Judge Luland, consistent as he had to be to the relevant principles of law, imposed sentences which were at the lower end of the discretionary sentencing range available to him. I am far from convinced that had those representing the applicant before Judge Luland elected to tender Dr Sharah’s report, that the sentences imposed by the judge could have been any more lenient. One suspects from reading the whole of the report, that there were forensic reasons why the election was obviously made not to tender that report. 
    8   One can only hope that during this period of incarceration the applicant can come to terms with his drug addiction, and upon his discharge lead a normal life supported by his wife and family. However on the basis of the material before this court, there is no foundation whatsoever for this Court to interfere with the sentences imposed by Judge Luland. It would be quite wrong to do so, and inconsistent with the well established sentencing principles.  
    9   Accordingly in the circumstances I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    10   SULLY J: I agree. I think on this occasion we cannot do anything for you Mr Mitchell.

      Monday, 14 February 2000 
     
     
     REGINA v Alan Keith Cocking 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: The applicant, Alan Keith Cocking, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Howie QC at the Newcastle District Court on 24 April 1998. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to twelve counts of indecent assault. 
    2   The offences were committed against twelve complainants being females under the age of sixteen years, who were all members of the applicant’s extended family. Their ages ranged from five years to twelve years. The counts were pursuant to either s 76 or s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 as amended. Both sections are now repealed.  
    3   The maximum penalties prescribed were five years imprisonment for the former offence and six years for the latter. The offences occurred between 1 June 1955 and 31 December 1984. There were an additional 28 allegations of sexual assaults contained in the statements of the complainants which were tendered to the Court. The complainants were from two generations of the applicant’s extended family and, indeed, included children of some complainants. 
    4   The applicant stood to be sentenced as a person who was in a position of trust and of authority in relation to each complainant. Over the period of the offences the applicant was aged between 25 and 55. He was born on 27 July 1929 and accordingly at the time of sentence he was aged 68. He had no prior convictions. Judge Howie effectively sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of seven years with a minimum term of four years and six months. 
    5   In respect of count two, his Honour sentenced the applicant to eighteen months imprisonment to commence on 23 April 1998 and to expire on 22 October 1999. In respect of count ten, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 23 October 1999 and to expire on 22 April 2001.  
    6   In respect of count five, which, for sentencing purposes, is of particular significance, his Honour imposed a minimum term of 18 months to commence on 22 April 2001 and to expire on 21 October 2002, together with an additional term of two years six months to commence on 22 October 2002 and to expire on 21 April 2005. 
    7   In relation to counts one, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, eleven and twelve his Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 23 April 1998 and to expire on 22 April 1999. 
    8   It is not necessary to note the detail of the objective and subjective matters dealt with by Judge Howie in his comprehensive remarks on sentence. In written submissions on behalf of the applicant there was an acceptance that the overall sentences in respect of the minimum terms, the additional term and the fixed terms were within the discretionary range available to his Honour.  
    9   In argument before us Mr Ierace of Senior Counsel for the applicant did, however, submit that there was a failure on the part of the learned sentencing judge to give due weight, in all the circumstances, to the pleas of guilty by the applicant. I shall return to that later. 
    10   On the basis of the then evidence his Honour said during his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
       “Fortunately for the prisoner he is generally in good physical and mental health and therefore prison should not be a greater burden upon him than it would be upon other prisoners of his age and background."" 
       
      
    11   However, in the four months following the imposition of his sentence the applicant began to experience symptoms which warranted medical investigation. These included angina and problems with an earlier diagnosed renal cyst, as well as a urinary complaint. 
    12   Professor Richard Millard, a specialist urologist, following a consultation on 9 September 1998, diagnosed the applicant as having a malignant cancer of the prostate. Professor Millard expressed the opinion that it is “highly likely” that the applicant had contracted the cancer prior to the date of his sentence and expected that the onset of symptoms would have occurred in about April 1998. 
    13   The treatment warranted by the cancer was initially hormone therapy followed by daily radiation therapy for a period of six to eight weeks. The applicant's prognosis depends upon whether the cancer responds to this treatment, so Dr Millard indicated in his first report dated 25 June 1999. If it did not, Professor Millard thought that he may not survive the balance of his minimum term. 
    14   Following the discovery of the applicant’s health problems Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, concluded that the applicant “Psychologically is despondent and is best described as having an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood state. He finds imprisonment particularly stressful.” Dr Westmore considered that if the applicant’s cancer metastases then he will be at a significant risk of completing a self-harming act. Certainly his medical conditions would impose a greater burden on his ability to cope with his sentence. 
    15   Dr Westmore also commented on the fact that since the applicant, who was during his working life a miner, was buried in a mining accident as a young man, he has suffered from claustrophobia, and has experienced difficulty coping with being locked in a cell for extended periods. I am referring here of course to a report by Dr Westmore subsequent to the sentencing of the applicant. However there was an earlier report by Dr Westmore before the sentencing judge in which, interestingly, no reference was made to the claustrophobia.  
    16   Counsel for the Crown opposed this application and referred to certain aspects of the medical evidence. In his earlier report Professor Millard stated that appropriate treatment is available to the applicant at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Long Bay Gaol. The treatment has a relatively low level of side effects.  
    17   In the earlier report Professor Millard stated that the applicant was “currently asymptomatic and will get little in the way of troublesome symptoms as a result of radiotherapy”. Professor Millard further stated that it was quite difficult to predict whether the applicant’s medical condition would impose a greater burden on his ability to cope with the sentence. He said “Clearly he may have a stormy time after his radiotherapy but this should only be transient”. 
    18   Our attention was also drawn to the fact that Dr Westmore had expressed the view in his pre-sentence report that the applicant was despondent and probably depressed and, at that stage, Dr Westmore considered the applicant to be at some risk of self-harm. 
    19   During his remarks on sentence Judge Howie commented: 
     
      
       
       “It is his first gaol sentence and it will no doubt have a severe and deleterious effect upon him. It seems to me that I should make some allowances for the contingencies and uncertainties created by his age and the length of the sentence which I must impose”.  
       
      
    20   His Honour accepted Dr Westmore’s assessment that a period of incarceration would be extraordinarily difficult for the applicant. His Honour referred to Dr Westmore’s concern as to the prisoner’s emotional state and the possibility of his being suicidal. 
    21   Today, further evidence has been by leave presented to the Court, including an up-to-date report by Professor Millard dated 9 February 2000, and certain material from the Department of Corrective Services dealing with the circumstances under which the applicant has thus far served his term of imprisonment. This includes reference to his medical treatment and the places in which he has been incarcerated, including the Long Bay prison hospital. 
    22   In summary, referring to Professor Millard’s report of 9 February 2000, the doctor said that the applicant’s current condition is that he has hormone and radiation controlled prostate cancer with clinical and biochemical response to the treatment. There has been remission of his condition as a result of treatment. 
    23   There is no evidence of cancer spread on CT scanning or bone scanning. There may be slow emergence of his prostate cancer over the next five to ten years. The degree of likelihood of the cancer spreading is high over a ten to fifteen year time frame. The degree of likelihood of the applicant dying before expiration of his minimum term in 2002 is small, probably less than five per cent. Ongoing hormone therapy may be needed. Metastatic disease may require further courses of radiotherapy. 
    24   Any treatment that is required for him will be available while he is in custody. And finally, it is only if the applicant needs radiation therapy that he will need to be close to the Price of Wales Hospital. 
    25   This latter conclusion is of much significance because the applicant is present confined at the Kirkconnel Correctional Centre where he is in light protection. Presumably, that is the most satisfactory centre in which he can be housed, and light protection is also probably the most satisfactory classification which he can have. 
    26   Thus it will only be if he needs radiation therapy that it will be necessary for him to be moved from Kirkconnel to Long Bay where he will have access to the Prince of Wales Hospital. The downside to him being confined at Long Bay is that he will there be in strict protective custody, the stressful demands of such custody being well known. 
    27   Mr Ierace for the applicant has carefully taken the Court through the chronology of events of the applicant’s imprisonment from 24 April 1998 to 5 December 1999 which was a date shortly after the applicant's transfer to Kirkconnel. It is unnecessary, I feel for present purposes to relate here the detail of the difficulties and unpleasant aspects of the applicant's incarceration to date. It would seem however that the Corrective Services authorities have to, to the extent that they are able to do so, been assiduous to ensure that the applicant has received the medical treatment and hospitalisation which he has thus far required.  
    28   The cyst on the kidney has been removed. It would appear at the moment that, although there is evidence of ischaemic heart disease, that the applicant does not presently count that as a major health problem. 
    29   Professor Millard's latest report is rather heartening, particularly in the light of his earlier report to which I have already made reference. There is now a significant line of authority for the proposition that a medical condition which impacts adversely on a prisoner’s ability to serve his or her sentence, and which existed, but was unknown at the time the sentence was handed down is a relevant consideration when assessing the severity of the sentence.  
    30   The authorities are referred to in the relevantly recent judgment of this Court in Regina v L. Unreported NSWCCA 17 June 1996, Gleeson CJ, Badgery-Parker and Hidden JJ. The authorities establish that, generally speaking, ill-health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his or her state of health or where there is serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health. 
    31   In Regina v Wayne Peter Jones (1993) 70 A Crim R 449. which was referred to by this Court in L, the principle of law to be applied by this Court, when a question such as that which is presently before the Court arises, was stated (1993) 70 A Crim R at 456. as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       “The first question is whether independently of the applicant’s medical condition, which as I have indicated was not known to the judge or the parties, the sentences imposed were within the sentencing discretion available to the judge. In my view this question must be answered in the affirmative. I consider the sentences imposed by the judge were perfectly appropriate in the circumstances. 
        
        
       The second question is whether the additional evidence should lead to the imposition of a sentence different from that imposed by the judge. See  
       Elliasen 
        (1991) 53 Aust Crim R 391 at 394.” 
       
      
    32   Mr Ierace has put to this Court an interesting argument that that principle has now been superseded by the judgment of the High Court in AB v The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 1385. however I am not, speaking for myself, satisfied that that is so and I would apply the Jones test. It would probably in the end lead to the same result in any event. Both Jones and L made the point that it must be remembered that it is the responsibility of the executive to provide for the care and treatment of its prisoners. 
    33   If a prisoner’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds the executive is empowered to deal with the situation. Section 53 of the Sentencing Act, 1989 preserves the Royal prerogative of mercy and s25A(1) of that Act enables the Offenders Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or if there are other exceptional extenuating circumstances. 
    34   In L the Court said that where illness is seen to be relevant to the determination of sentence its weight must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. Obviously one of those circumstances will be the seriousness of the offence. 
    35   Turning then to the two questions posed in Jones with the approval of L, the answer to the first question is in my view clearly that on the material before Judge Howie the sentences imposed by him were perfectly appropriate in the circumstances, and, in that regard, I give full weight to the argument addressed to this Court this morning by Mr Ierace in relation to the pleas of guilty. The offences extended over some 29 years, adversely affected 12 young girls at sensitive stages of their lives, and the deterrent aspect was of much significance to his Honour. 
    36   Turning then to the second question, I am of the view that the additional evidence which has been put before this Court should lead to a variation of the sentences imposed by the judge. The difficulty, of course, is, in the light of all the material that has now been put before this Court, as to the extent to which the sentences imposed by Judge Howie should be modified. 
    37   One continually gets back, of course, to the serious objective circumstances and the necessity to balance the subjective circumstances, as we now know them, including not only the medical problems and illnesses of the applicant but also the difficulties that he has experienced in the period of incarceration to date. 
    38   Giving full weight to all the relevant matters I am of the view that the overall sentences imposed by his Honour should be reduced by one year. With the exception of the sentences on counts ten and five the sentences have expired. As I have already indicated, a fixed term of 18 months was imposed in relation to count ten and that is to expire on 22 April 2001.  
    39   I would propose that the minimum term be reduced by one year in relation to count five but that the additional term remain at two years and six months. 
    40   That would have the effect then that the sentences imposed in relation to counts one, two, one, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve would be confirmed, but in relation to count five the sentence imposed by Judge Howie would be varied to the extent that a minimum term of eighteen months imprisonment to commence on 22 April 2000 and to expire on 21 October 2001 would be imposed together with an additional term of two years and six months to commence on 22 October 2001 and to expire on 21 April 2004. That would have the effect that the applicant would be eligible for parole on 21 October 2001.  
    41   To give effect to these proposals I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted and that the appeal be upheld to the extent that I have indicated. 
    42   SULLY J: I entirely agree. The orders of the Court will be as announced by his Honour.

       REGINA v Torrence KAMA 
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Williams at the Sydney District Court on 9 August 1999. On 12 May 1999, the Respondent had pleaded guilty to one count under s35 of the Crimes Act 1900 of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to Shailendra (Tommy) Naidu (the victim). 
     
      
    2    The maximum penalty for an offence under s35 of the Crimes Act is penal servitude for seven years. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of penal servitude for twenty-seven months, comprising a minimum term of nine months, to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 20 August 1999 and expiring on 19 May 2000, with an additional term of eighteen months commencing on 20 May 2000, expiring on 19 November 2001. 
     
      
    3    The offence occurred on 23 February 1998 and was constituted by a vicious assault by the Respondent, then aged seventeen years and eight months, together with a co-offender, Livingstone Oloapu, then just under the age of sixteen. A third person was involved in the attack and acted as a lookout. 
     
      
    4    The evidence of an eye witness was accepted by the sentencing judge and was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Both of them were stomping Tommy with their feet and punching him with their fists. Tommy was on the ground and he looked like he was knocked unconscious. Both guys said something like, 'you keep out of this'. They were hitting Tommy about the head and he was bleeding a lot from the left side of his head. They were just hitting and stomping on Tommy, mostly on his head. They were really vicious, they hit and stomped on his head continuously many times."" 
        
       
      
    5    In addition to this evidence, still photographs were available which confirmed some part of the eye witness's report in the sense that they showed the foot of the Respondent coming into contact with the head of the victim on a number of occasions. 
     
      
    6    The victim suffered severe head injuries and brain damage consistent with the evidence of a vicious attack. He was an inpatient at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital until 11 March 1998, noting that the offence occurred on 23 February 1998. On 11 March the victim was transferred to the Metropolitan Rehabilitation Private Hospital. The nature of his traumatic brain injury was identified in the evidence before his Honour. The victim underwent a rehabilitation programme and was discharged from the inpatient programme on 9 April 1998. His treating doctor indicated that the length of the period of post-traumatic amnesia was consistent with ""an extremely severe brain injury"". The medical opinion, which was accepted by the sentencing judge, was that the victim had a permanent brain injury which affected, and will affect, his memory and concentration. 
     
      
    7    As his Honour expressed it, this was ""a vicious assault"". The objective circumstances were extremely serious. The Respondent inflicted sustained and repeated acts of violence on the victim. The attack occurred in a public place and must have terrified members of the public who observed it. The attack was committed in company. There was a substantial disparity between the significant physical size of the Respondent and that of the victim. The attack continued even after the victim was totally defenseless and lying on the ground. The nature of the injuries were severe and, to a significant extent, permanent. 
     
      
    8    The Crown submits that the gravity of the objective circumstances of the attack and of its consequences are such that the sentence of periodic detention imposed by his Honour was on its face manifestly inadequate. The Crown, however, had greater difficulty pointing to any particular error in his Honour's reasons. Its submission are expressed in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(a) His Honour gave undue weight in the sentencing exercise to rehabilitation and to a finding of 'emotional immaturity' on the part of the respondent and 
        
       
        
       
        
         (b) His Honour gave insufficient weight to the question of general and specific deterrence."" 
        
       
      
    9    Nothing in his Honour's reasoning would suggest that the weight he gave to what was described as the Respondent's ""emotional immaturity"" was in any way ""undue"". Nor is there any aspect of his Honour's reasoning which suggests that the weight given to deterrence was in any way ""insufficient"". The only basis for a conclusion that the weight given was, respectively, either ""undue"" or ""insufficient"" was the size of the final sentence. The Crown asserts that it was so manifestly inadequate as to fall outside the permissible range for sentencing in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    10    The particularly relevant passage in his Honour's reasoning is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""What I gather from the psychological report and the probation and parole report is that I have before me a person with an immature mind in a mature body. However, there is nothing in either report that suggests any overt or recognised psychological problems. What this tends to mean from a sentencing point of view is that I should lean more towards treating Mr Kama in accordance with his emotional maturity and thus more attention perhaps should be paid to questions of rehabilitation rather than general deterrence. That being said nonetheless the question of general deterrence and associated specific deterrence cannot be overlooked given the serious nature of this offence."" 
        
       
       
      This reasoning is not open to criticism. 
       
      
    11    A submission was made that what his Honour referred to as ""emotional immaturity"", would not have justified applying the principles of sentencing in some of the authorities which refer to an accused with a ""mental disorder or abnormality"". However, in my opinion, nothing in his Honour's reasoning suggested that his Honour approached the task in that way. Indeed, he made express reference to the fact that the reports before him did not suggest any recognised ""psychological problems"". 
     
      
    12    His Honour made a number of references to the serious objective circumstances of the offence and he referred to the aggravating feature involved in the offence being committed in company. He noted that this type of offence was increasingly prevalent in young men of this age group. It was for these reasons that his Honour decided that the case was not an appropriate one to be dealt with under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, even though the Respondent was seventeen years and eight months at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    13    His Honour concluded that a custodial sentence of some character was required but that this was an appropriate case in which the sentence could be served by way of periodic detention. Whilst, no doubt, his Honour had regard to all of the matters to which he had earlier referred, notably the psychological report, in the context of stating that periodic detention was an appropriate sentencing outcome, his Honour said that this was so ""having regard to his age and lack of criminal record"". There was evidence before his Honour not only of the lack of a criminal record, but also of good character and of a stable family life and, particularly, the evidence from the Respondent's father, who has expressed surprise at the conduct, which he suggested was out of character. 
     
      
    14    In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to identify ""emotional immaturity"" as a matter justifying greater weight to rehabilitation and less weight to general deterrence. His Honour was entitled to take into account age and lack of prior convictions as justifying the selection of periodic detention rather than a full-time custodial sentence. These were all factors relevant to be taken into account by the sentencing judge, in the general way he did. The weight to be given to such matter was, within broad limits, a matter for him. In my opinion, this case is concerned with those limits. 
     
      
    15    His Honour made a finding of special circumstances in the following terms: ""having regard to his age and lack of antecedents and the fact that it is going to be a first time custodial”. It is by no means clear that these matters are special circumstances warranting a relationship between the minimum term and the additional term other than the statutory relationship to any significant degree or at all. The end result is that, instead of the one-third relationship, his Honour reduced the minimum term to one-third of the total, imposing a nine months minimum term and an additional term of eighteen months. 
     
      
    16    The Crown put before the Court statistics of the Judicial Commission for this offence. This is an offence which can vary to such an extraordinary extent, particularly in terms of the severity of an attack, that such statistics are unlikely to be of great assistance. However, of the 305 offenders dealt with in the District Court for this offence between January 1990 and July 1998 only 60 per cent received a full-time custodial sentence; 15 per cent received some form of recognisance; 14 per cent received community service orders; and 10 per cent received periodic detention orders. Of some particular significance in the present case is the sub-category of 83 of these offenders who shared characteristics with the Respondent in this case, namely, no prior convictions, a plea of guilty, no Form I matters and only one count. Of this category, only 46 per cent received full-time custodial sentences, with 20 per cent receiving periodic detention. These statistics, even for the sub-category, do not indicate the gravity of the offence in the cases to which they relate. However, nothing in the statistics suggests that a sentence of periodic detention is outside the permissible range, but this must always depend on the particular circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    17    In the present case, the submission is that the actual result is a sentence manifestly inadequate. This must be determined by the viciousness of the attack and the severity of the consequences. 
     
      
    18    In my judgment, his Honour did err, particularly with respect to the minimum term being a short period of nine months to be served by way of periodic detention in circumstances of an attack of this character. That was, in my opinion, below range. This was an appropriate case at first instance for a full-time custodial sentence to be considered, but I am not prepared, on appeal, to impose such a sentence on the Respondent. He has served a substantial proportion of the minimum term, some six months out of the nine months. The principles of double jeopardy are such that, in my opinion, an increased sentence of periodic detention is the appropriate outcome on the appeal. 
     
      
    19    The special circumstances to vary the statutory relationship on the appeal include the fact that an additional term is being imposed in an appeal. 
     
      
    20    In my opinion, the appropriate orders are: quash the sentence and to substitute a period of two years to be served by way of periodic detention expiring on 19 August 2001 and a one year additional term expiring on 19 August 2002. 
     
      
    21    HULME J: In the case of Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 468 this Court had the following to say concerning punishment: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…the sentence to be imposed for any crime must take into account the many different purposes which that sentence is expected to serve - the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform - even though those purposes overlap and sometimes are in conflict: 
          
        Veen (No 2) 
          
        (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476; 33 A Crim R 230 at 237-238. It is important always to have regard first of all to the gravity of the crime viewed objectively for, without such an assessment, the other factors requiring consideration before arriving at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place: 
          
        Dodd 
         (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. Except in well-defined circumstances such as the youth or the mental incapacity of the offender, public deterrence is generally regarded as the main purpose of punishment, and the subjective considerations relating to the particular offender (however persuasive) are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed: 
          
        Rushby 
          
        [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-598. Retribution, or the taking of vengeance for the injury which was done by the offender, is also an important aspect of sentencing: 
          
        Goodrich 
         (1952) 70 WN (NSW) 42 at 43; 
          
        Cuthbert 
         [1967] 2 NSWR 329 at 330; 
          
        Rushby  
        (at 598). Not only must the community be satisfied that the offender is given his just deserts, it is important as well that the victim, or those who are left behind, also feel that justice has been done."" 
        
       
      
    22    I do not for one moment underestimate the weight which the Courts traditionally give to leniency on those who committed offences while young. Nevertheless, the authorities, including the decision of Gordon have made it clear that leniency on account of youth can be taken too far. In this case, I do not believe that the community, or the victim, could possibly feel that justice has been done, possibly no matter what sentence is imposed upon the offender, but certainly when the sentence does not include full-time custody. 
     
      
    23    There used to be a commonly accepted principle in this country that you do not hit a man when he is down. This offender not only hit the victim when he was down, but kicked him and stomped on him on the head in the way that the Chief Justice has described. 
     
      
    24    I would add to his Honour's quotation from the account of an eye witness something further. Immediately following the passage which the Chief Justice read, the eye witness goes on: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I tried to grab them and push them away from Tommy, but the second guy pushed me aside and said, 'Are you Sangwa' (which is apparently the name of the triad gang). I said, 'I don't know what you are talking about.' I walked away from them and out towards the footpath. The Islander guys were still beating up Tommy. As I got to the entrance a third guy who was Asian pushed me back into the station and said, 'Are you Sangwa?'... I turned and went back to try and help Tommy. I saw the first guy, the big Islander... stomping very hard on Tommy's face and head. He said to Tommy as he did this something like, 'You Sangwa killed my cousin in Campsie.'' 
        
       
      
    25    It is clear when one recognises the attempt of the eye witness to move away and then, having encountered the third member of the gang involved in the attack on the victim, the witness’ turning back, that the attack went on for a significant period. 
     
      
    26    In his interview with the police, the Respondent to this appeal advanced a number of reasons for the attack. His responses do not have any particular indication of credibility about them but they bear recitation. One was that the victim and his mates had chased the Respondent a couple of times with machetes. A second was that the victim had been threatening the Respondent’s girlfriend. The Respondent had not reported any of those incidents to the police, and the last occasion seems to have been in the previous year. Another explanation given was that he thought, albeit without any evidence, that the victim had been involved in the murder of his cousin and the Respondent, was going to teach the victim a lesson. A fourth was that the victim was staring at him and ""I remember his face and then I think he reached, he put his hand at the back of his pants, so I hit him because he was staring at me. Then the victim fell over"". According to the answers the Respondent did not know what happened then. 
     
      
    27    There is undoubtedly a problem in this community with the temptation and tendency of some of its members to resort to self-help resulting, amongst other things, in yet further violence. Such an attitude has to be stamped on hard by the courts. This attack, as his Honour found, was planned. There was no conceivable excuse for it, nor any half reasonable explanation for the vicious nature of what occurred. 
     
      
    28    It behoves the Courts to ensure that conduct such as stomping on a defenseless victim's head is, if not stamped out, at least rendered as infrequent as possible. Anyone who behaves as this offender did should receive a salutary lesson by way of a substantial full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    29    I can accept his youth, I can accept that he had an exemplary record apart from this offence. I can accept that he was remorseful. Nevertheless retribution and deterrence demanded and demand such a penalty in the case of the Respondent. 
     
      
    30    This Court traditionally imposes a sentence lower than should have been imposed at first instance, or alternatively a sentence at the bottom of the range. Even on that basis, the proper result of this appeal should be that it be allowed and the Respondent sentenced to a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of six months. 
     
      
    31    SMART AJ: The gravity of the offence and the serious injuries inflicted are not in doubt, nor is it in doubt that this Court needs to discourage kicking and stomping. 
     
      
    32    The sentence is manifestly inadequate and it is unnecessary for me to traverse what has been recounted in the earlier judgments. The Respondent should have received a full-time custodial sentence from the judge. 
     
      
    33    However, the Respondent has now served some six months by way of periodic detention. He has relinquished his previous position and obtained a fresh position so that he can serve his periodic detention. He has the active support of his family. I have taken into account that the Respondent spent three weeks in custody between his arrest and the grant of bail. 
     
      
    34    Having regard to all the circumstances, including the difficulties raised by committing a respondent to full-time custody after he has served some six months of his periodic detention, the appropriate sentence is one of three years penal servitude comprising a minimum term of two years, starting on 20 August 1999 and ending on 19 August 2001 to be served by periodic detention, with the additional term of one year to start on 20 August 2001. I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and his reasons. 
     
      
    35    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are: The appeal is allowed. The sentence of the sentencing judge is quashed. In lieu thereof the following sentence is substituted: a minimum term of two years penal servitude to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 20 August 1999 and expiring on 19 August 2001 and an additional term of one year, also to be served by way of periodic detention, to commence on 20 August 2001 and to expire on 19 August 2002.

     REGINA v. ALFRED ARCHIBALD LEONARD 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: Application for leave to appeal against sentence is brought in respect of sentences imposed by His Honour Judge Luland in the District Court after pleas of guilty entered by the applicant to two charges, the first, accessory after the fact to robbery, an offence punishable by a maximum of five years' imprisonment and the second, assault on a police officer, an offence punishable by a maximum of seven years' imprisonment. 
    2   The appellant has a long and appalling criminal record. Nonetheless, as has been pointed out on this appeal, prior to the matters for which he was sentenced that record is one which had shown some signs of improvement. 
    3   His Honour, when he came to sentence, reviewed shortly the facts of the commission of the offences. It is not necessary on this appeal to set them out in detail, save that the appellant had accepted a lift with one Timothy Peckham. It turned out that lift was in a stolen vehicle. He was driven by Peckham to the Riverstone RSL and was sitting in the car at a time at which Peckham robbed an elderly lady of her handbag occasioning her some injuries. In panic, when Peckham returned to the vehicle, the applicant drove them both away from the scene. When pursued by police he abandoned the vehicle. Chased by a police officer he struck the police officer in the right eye with his fist. He was overpowered and arrested. 
    4   When interviewed he not only admitted his complicity in the offence to which he eventually pleaded guilty but nominated Peckham and gave information which enabled Peckham to be apprehended. 
    5   Peckham in due course was charged and came before his Honour for sentence having pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery under s.95 of the Crimes Act 1900, a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years' penal servitude and the offence of take and drive a conveyance without consent, which carried a maximum sentence of five years, being an unlicensed driver was also taken into account. 
    6   At the time at which Peckham committed these offences he was on parole for the offence of robbery with wounding and had been granted bail. He had also committed the further offence of break, enter and steal which carried a maximum offence of 14 years' penal servitude to which he had pleaded guilty and he had been in custody for some time prior to sentence. His parole had been revoked. 
    7   The learned District Court judge sentenced Peckham in respect of those offences on the break, enter and steal to a fixed term of 18 months' penal servitude to date from the date of his arrest and, on the aggravated robbery, to a sentence totalling five years' penal servitude comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years and a fixed term of 12 months which was concurrent with a sentence imposed in respect of the offence of take and use motor vehicle. 
    8   It is apparent that Peckham's culpability was greatly in excess of that of the present prisoner and that the offences he had committed were offences punishable by a greater maximum. 
    9   It has been submitted on the applicant's behalf in succinct and carefully prepared submissions that the learned trial judge fell into error in the sentence that he imposed on the applicant. In particular, although s.444B of the Crimes Act requires the consideration of a reduction in sentence on a count of assistance to authorities, his Honour did not expressly refer to the nomination of Peckham when the applicant had been arrested and the provision of information as to the commission of the offence. Although his Honour did expressly refer to and take into account the applicant's plea of guilty. The fact that his Honour made no mention of the nomination of Peckham does tend to suggest that, whilst his Honour may have been aware of the fact, his Honour failed to take it into account in the sentence that he eventually imposed. It is, of course, much better practice, bearing in mind the statutory injunction to take the matter into account, that it be expressly referred to. 
    10   Further, when one compares the sentence imposed on Peckham and his culpability with the sentence imposed upon this applicant one cannot but be of the view that the applicant might well have a justifiable sense of grievance and that, in that sense, the sentences are disparate. 
    11   For my part I would see those matters as errors which taint the total sentences imposed. I would not find it necessary to consider, in the overall circumstances, as to whether this sentence is, considered discretely from the other alleged errors, in error by being manifestly excessive, as was submitted. 
    12   Nor would I find it necessary, as I am of the view his Honour fell into error in the respect I have mentioned, to consider whether his Honour further erred in failing to find special circumstances. I am of the view that there are here clearly to be found special circumstances in the accumulation of the sentences, in the evidence that was before his Honour, which it is not necessary for me to recite, and in the evidence which has been tendered by way of the affidavits of the applicant and his spouse, which accord with the material that was before his Honour as to the family circumstances of the applicant. All of these are such as to show the appropriateness for extended supervision to assist the applicant's coping skills, particularly since there appear to be prospects of rehabilitation as evidenced by his concern for assisting his family to cope with difficult circumstances. 
    13   I would, therefore, consider that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed, that the sentence below should be quashed on the count of accessory after the fact, that is, count one and, in lieu thereof, the applicant should be sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment to commence 2 August 1999, comprising a minimum term of seven months which would expire on 1 March 2000, and an additional term of three months. That would require a directed release on parole on 1 March 2000. 
    14   The orders I would propose, therefore, are, grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence below on the first count and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to 10 months' imprisonment comprising a minimum term of seven months commencing on 2 August 1999 and expiring on 1 March 2000, with an additional term of three months. I direct release on parole on 1 March 2000. 
    15   GROVE J: I agree with the judgment of Greg James, J. and with the orders he proposes. Those orders, therefore, will be orders of the court.

     REGINA v KAREN MARIE ZAIA 
      
       
      
      
       
     JUDGMENT 
      
       
      
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ in the Gosford District Court on 11 June 1999. The applicant appeared for sentence on a charge of armed robbery contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act. She also asked his Honour to take into account on a Form 1 a single charge of break, enter and steal. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The principal offence occurred when the applicant, at about 6am on New Year's Day, entered a small shop known as Ridgey Didge Pies, where she accosted the operator with a kitchen knife. She had worn, presumably as a disguise, a baseball cap and sunglasses. She obtained about $145 but, when leaving the shop she dropped the knife and was pursued by the owner. She was apprehended and later handed to police. The matter in the schedule relates to an offence which occurred but one month before the applicant appeared for sentence. In terms of offenders committing crimes of this nature there are some unusual aspects to the applicant's background. Although she is now approaching thirty years of age, being born on 7 May 1970, she had, when she appeared before his Honour, no prior convictions. It appears that she had a problem with ingestion of the illicit drug heroin but, again unusually, had come to the use of that substance comparatively later in life. The evidence before his Honour showed that she came into contact, and became a user of this drug, as a result of her association with a man called Neville Bell. He was a heroin addict. He was not only the person who introduced her to the drug but was an accomplice in committing the offence of break, enter and steal which, as is apparent from the facts which I have recited, occurred whilst she was on bail awaiting being dealt with for the charge of armed robbery. Undoubtedly that is a significant aggravating factor. 
      
       
      
     3     
     His Honour had the benefit of the guideline judgment in  
     R v Henry & Ors  
     1999 46 NSWLR 346 and it has to be said the sentence which he imposed of a total of five years' penal servitude divided into minimum and additional terms of three years and two years respectively was within the range available as a result of the application of those guidelines. It was, however, important for his Honour, as he did, to consider the applicant's subjective circumstances. Prominent amongst these were the prospects of the applicant's rehabilitation and her intention to seriously seek to undertake it. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The reports before his Honour were such that the situation must be described as considerably without promise. His Honour observed the matter had been adjourned on a number of occasions to allow the applicant to demonstrate her commitment to rehabilitation. He observed that three reports before him of the probation officer and the drug counsellor showed that neither of these people were persuaded of the applicant's commitment to her own rehabilitation. It can be concluded, therefore, that his Honour proceeded to sentence on the basis of that evidence. 
      
       
      
     5     
     There was, however, sworn evidence also before his Honour given by the applicant. Importantly in my view was evidence concerning her relationship with the man Bell whom I have mentioned. She told his Honour that she had accompanied him when they committed the offence in May 1999 because she owed drug dealers money and they were threatening her and her family. Significantly she told his Honour, as at that time, she had definitely split up with Bell. This was consistent with her other evidence that she had for the previous two to three weeks, returned to reside with her parents. As all the evidence before his Honour showed the applicant had considerable family support available to her if only she was prepared to avail herself of it. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It seems to me that the parting from the man Bell was capable of being a very strong indication (contrary to the indication to the drug counsellor and the Probation and Parole officer) that the applicant may have perceived the need to engage seriously in her own rehabilitation. In my view that was a matter which ought to have been weighed as one of the important circumstances in his Honour's ultimate assessment of sentence. It not being mentioned and having been apparently overlooked, the jurisdiction of this court is enlivened and the court should intervene to consider re-sentence. 
      
       
      
     7     
     On the matter of re-sentence we have received into evidence a report from the alcohol and other drugs worker at the Emu Plains Correctional Centre. That officer has seen the applicant on a number of occasions where she has been held at Mulawa. That officer has reported that the applicant since being incarcerated has thought deeply about her drug dependency and, although all inmates are on programmed urine tests it is to the credit of the applicant that she has been drug-free during the eight weeks that she was in custody up to the time of Miss Ward's report. It would therefore appear that the promise which I suggested ought to have been taken into account is confirmed by the subsequent conduct of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     8     
     These things being said, it is nevertheless incumbent upon this court to pay proper regard to the guidelines set out in the case of  
     R v Henry 
     . It seems to me, however, that the foregoing amount to special circumstances so that the proportion of sentence which might be served in the community whilst on parole should be lengthened beyond that specified by s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. In my view a sentence should be imposed of a total of four years divided into minimum and additional terms, each of two years. 
      
       
      
     9     
     I propose the following orders. That the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed and the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. In lieu thereof, taking into account the matter on Form 1, the applicant be sentenced to a total term of four years' imprisonment to be divided into a minimum term of two years commencing on 11 June 1999 and expiring on 10 June 2001 together with an additional term of two years to commence on 11 June 2001. I would specify that the applicant is to be eligible for parole from 10 June 2001. 
      
       
      
     10     
     GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     11     
     GROVE J: The orders of the court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

     CORAM: GROVE, J. 
     
      GREG JAMES, J. 
      
       
     WEDNESDAY 23 FEBRUARY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. SIEW-LONG RIEW LAY 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, Siew-Long Riew Lay, seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Rummery in consequence of his pleas of guilty and conviction on those pleas on two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and wounding, offences punishable by penal servitude for 25 years, and 11 counts of armed robbery, offences punishable by 20 years' penal servitude. In addition there were offences contained on a Form 1 comprising one count of assault with intent to rob, one count of use heroin, one count possess heroin, one count possess unlicensed firearm, that is, an air gun. 
    2   When the matter came before his Honour the applicant was a young person. Nonetheless, since the two offences of armed robbery with wounding were required by legislation to be dealt with at law, his Honour determined, in the exercise of his discretion, to deal with all the offences according to law. 
    3   His Honour set out in his remarks on sentence details of the 13 principal charges. He found that in all cases the weapons with which the applicant was armed were knives with blades of either 15 or 20 centimetres in length. In the two cases where victims were wounded it was the larger weapon. In respect of three of the offences, the applicant had been accompanied by a co-offender, also a juvenile, and younger than the applicant, the brother of the applicant's girlfriend. He had been living with her during this spate of criminality. The co-offender carried a club-lock as a weapon during two of those three offences but for one of them both he and the applicant were armed with 20 centimetre bladed knives. 
    4   The general modus operandi was for the applicant to present to his victim, the operators or staff at various service stations, a small item of food and money for purchase. When the victim turned to the register the knife was produced, the victim threatened and ordered to open the cash register, and money removed from it. There was some variation in the circumstances of the commission of certain of the offences. 
    5   As to the two wounding charges, on count one the victim, when threatened, attempted to disarm the applicant and received a laceration on his hand. On count two, when the victim opened the cash register, the applicant ran behind the counter and threatened him with the knife. In the course of the applicant waving the knife about the victim was cut on his right hand, the cut later requiring eight sutures. 
    6   The other matter that was on schedule, the offence of assault with intent to rob when armed, was committed using the same modus operandi to those matters which I have referred. However, on that occasion the applicant took hold of a fire extinguisher with which he smashed the front glass doors of the premises and the victim received slight lacerations to his face from the glass. 
    7   At the time of the offences his Honour noted the applicant was on bail granted by the Supreme Court on a similar armed robbery charge and had failed to attend court and otherwise meet the conditions of his bail. His Honour held the offences were motivated by the applicant's desire to obtain money and goods, usually cigarettes, in order that he might cater for his addiction to heroin. 
    8   He was interviewed in the presence of the father of the co-accused and made full and frank admissions shortly after having been arrested. 
    9   There were admissions of addiction to heroin and the possession of the air rifle, the subject of the charge of possess unlicensed firearm.  
    10   This was a spate of the most serious criminality. This court has recognised, in decision after decision, that the offences of armed robbery are offences that not only operate to deprive people of their property but to put them in terror and all too often have the consequence that those people are permanently adversely affected by the experience. Consequently there are many decisions of this court which emphasise the necessity for courts to reflect due regard to the objective seriousness of the conduct in sentences. 
    11   Turning to the applicant's subjective circumstances, he comes from a family of refugees who, having made it to Australia, it has been submitted, became dysfunctional as a family unit, the applicant falling out with his father. Extensive information as to the applicant's circumstances was provided to the sentencing judge by way of background and other reports from officers of the Juvenile Justice Department. His Honour referred to those family circumstances and the difficulties he had experienced in obtaining an education in detail in his most conscientious remarks on sentence. The contact between the applicant and the department was recited by his Honour, as was the departmental attempts at adequate supervision. That supervision, it may be summarised, was essentially unsuccessful arising from the effects on the applicant of his heroin addiction. 
    12   His Honour set out in his remarks on sentence some detail of the assistance the applicant received from the various departmental reports and made reference to the recommendations made to him by the departmental officers as to the mode under which the applicant should serve the inevitable sentence of imprisonment his Honour imposed. In particular it was recommended to his Honour that the applicant be given the opportunity to serve all or part of the sentence in a juvenile justice centre to enable counselling and other specialist assistance with the aim of rehabilitation. 
    13   His Honour, having regard to various assessments of the applicant's ability and, in particular, a keenness to consider further education which would enable the applicant in due course to pursue a career in electronics, made when passing sentence the order pursuant to s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that the applicant's sentences be served in an education centre until 30 November 2001, that is, a little over a month beyond the applicant's 21st birthday. That order was made in the expectation that the applicant will in that year be sitting for his Higher School Certificate or other matriculation examination equivalent and, to avoid disruption to the educative process if the applicant was required to leave the centre before that date. 
    14   His Honour relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Essam Karhani (unreported, 14 October 1998). His Honour took this course because he agreed with the submission put to him that the applicant wished appropriately to educate himself as an aspect of the applicant's own endeavours towards his rehabilitation. His Honour was of the view the applicant had the capacity to achieve goals which embraced successful tertiary studies. His Honour saw that process of education as having significance not only of benefit to the applicant personally but detected in that process a willingness on the applicant's part to achieve rehabilitation from his drug use and criminality which would be of benefit to the community generally. In that context his Honour was also prepared to, and did, find special circumstances and varied the ratio between the additional term and the minimum term required otherwise by s.5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 
    15   His Honour concluded that, applying the principles of totality, sentences should be passed to date from the day on which the applicant went into custody totalling 10 years' penal servitude, such sentences to be split into a minimum term of five years and an additional term of five years. His Honour had regard to the matters on the schedule and passed consequent sentences to carry out his intention on the other eleven offences, imposing terms of four years to commence on the same date and additional terms of four years, all sentences to be served concurrently. When concluding the sentencing exercise, his Honour sought that the applicant be advised that if he stayed at a juvenile justice centre, although he be by then over 21 years, ""he might get another extension of that if he wishes and he may not know that unless he is told that by a lawyer"". 
    16   I have for my part been unable to ascertain what precisely it was that his Honour was there referring to. It may be that his Honour was referring to some administrative process whereby the effect of the order he made under s.19 might be extended so the applicant might be permitted to remain in a juvenile justice centre notwithstanding that the date referred to in his Honour's order had passed. 
    17   Whatever be the position, it does seem as though his Honour sought to give the applicant to understand that he could have a further proportion of his minimum term served in a juvenile justice centre should he wish to take that course. 
    18   On the present appeal there have been two main criticisms made of what occurred below. The submissions are put in the alternative, the first being that, in the light of all the circumstances before his Honour and in the light of additional material which it is sought to have available to the court should it move to re-sentence him, the applicant's rehabilitation has advanced so far that the court should intervene to re-craft the overall total sentence and that the minimum term should be reduced so that it expires on a date shortly after the applicant would have completed his Higher School Certificate in the event that he should proceed to that examination. 
    19   It is put that this will facilitate the completion of the Higher School Certificate and not require a further period of custody in an adult prison after the completion of that certificate. 
    20   It is submitted that a further period of incarceration would probably retard the applicant's rehabilitation and, in that sense, is not in the best interests of the community. In support of that submission it has been put that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to, firstly, the age of the applicant at the relevant time, an addiction to heroin at the relevant time, and that the applicant was at the crossroads, the last being a reference to a passage contained in the judgment of Chief Justice King in Regina v. Osesnkowski (1982) 5 A. Crim. R. 394. 
    21   It is sufficient to say in response to those criticisms that his Honour plainly had regard to every one of those matters and dealt with them expressly, particularly when reducing the head sentence that might otherwise have been expected to be passed for this spate of criminality to the sentence he did pass and, particularly when it came to his Honour's determination of the respective proportions between minimum term and additional term. Certainly there was material before his Honour to suggest prospects for the applicant's rehabilitation, and his Honour had regard to it and reached an appropriate finding. The material that is presently tendered was not before his Honour and is not available to us for the purpose of ascertaining whether his Honour fell into error in that respect. 
    22   The second submission that is put is that, in the light of what his Honour said concerning the extension of the period during which the applicant might remain in a juvenile justice centre at least an expectation has been engendered to enable him to remain there after the time at which he turns 21 and at the conclusion of his Higher School Certificate. His Honour's remarks do not express with clarity, on all points at least, a conclusion that his Honour was persuaded the applicant might remain in such an institution after he turns 21. There is nothing on the face of s.19, nor in anything of which we have been informed today from the bar table, which would suggest any restriction on any order the court might make permitting a person to remain in such an institution after having reached their 21st birthday. 
    23   The judgment of this court in Karhani (supra) is direct authority in favour of that proposition. 
    24   The additional material which has been provided comprised a submission prepared by Miss Jane Marchant, case worker, and a further report. This material is most extensive and detailed. It is enormously to the applicant's credit. It shows within the institution he has laboured well and productively towards obtaining a first quality education and to rehabilitate himself such that great expectations might justifiably be held for him if he keeps this up in the future.  
    25   Nonetheless when this court comes to deal with an appeal of this kind it does so as a court of error. It does not sit to re-hear what occurred below. It is also required to apply legal principle. That principle includes having appropriate regard to the objective seriousness of the offences committed both in respect of the minimum term and the additional term. Although the distinction between minimum term and additional term does mean that the matters relevant to sentencing will have a different impact upon minimum term to that on the overall sentence and the additional term it does not mean that considerations of general and personal deterrence and those considerations relevant to objective seriousness should be disregarded in favour of rehabilitation, even such rehabilitation as may be to the community's general benefit, when one comes to assessing the minimum term. 
    26   For my part I am unpersuaded in those circumstances that any appellable error occurred in his Honour's sentence or in his assessment of the relevant proportions that should divide the sentences he passed. I am of the view, however, that in the light of what concluded his Honour's remarks concerning the applicant remaining in the juvenile justice centre, an appropriate direction might be given under s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 to clarify the matter and carry into effect what appears to have been indicated to the appellant as the intention of the sentencing judge. 
    27   Enquiry was made of counsel for the applicant as to whether his client would wish such a direction to be given in the event the court was not disposed in favour of his principal submissions concerning reduction of the minimum term. That enquiry was answered in the affirmative. In those circumstances I would propose leave to appeal against sentence be granted and that the appeal should, except in regard to the terms of the order made below under s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 be dismissed, but that the order under that section be varied to read that it be ordered that the sentence be served in a detention centre until the expiration of the minimum term, that is, until 22 August 2003, or until the applicant is released from custody. 
    28   GROVE, J: I agree with the judgment just delivered. The order of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by English DCJ. The applicant appeared before her Honour in respect of a number of charges involving two counts of assault, one count of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, and one count of threatening a witness contrary to s 322(a) of the Crimes Act. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant pleaded guilty to those offences and in respect of the first three charges which I have mentioned her Honour imposed fixed terms of imprisonment all of which have now expired. She also, in respect of the fourth count of threatening a witness, imposed a total sentence of four years' penal servitude which, after a finding by her Honour of special circumstances, she divided into minimum and additional terms of two years and six months and eighteen months respectively. She dated all sentences to commence from 13 October 1998. 
      
       
      
     3     
     Her Honour expressed herself in respect of four matters before her as not engaging in an exercise of accumulation but fixing an encompassing sentence on one count reflecting the total criminality subsuming concurrent fixed terms. It follows, therefore, that one should regard the over-arching sentence of four years as reflecting the total criminality involved in all offences and not just the particular one in respect of which it was ordered. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The learned judge erroneously made orders concerning parole overlooking the circumstance that the power of the court to order parole, as distinct from specifying eligibility, is limited to sentences of three years or less. In the event of the conclusion which I have reached it is not necessary to further dilate upon this matter nor upon the specification of some dates which counsel have pointed out would seem to be inaccurate.

     The circumstances which brought the applicant before the court involved violence in and about a hotel in the suburb of Manly. It has to be said that the applicant's record reveals him to be something of a thug. I am omitting reference to numerous convictions in Children's Courts but, leaving aside other offences, he has been before the courts in 1995 for assault, in 1995 a second time for assault, in 1997 for counts of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, the total counts of assault were four and of occasioning actual bodily harm two. Again in 1997 he was before another court for assault and again in 1998. Accordingly the applicant would appear, in respect of the matters which I have specified, as a person meeting the description of a recidivist. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It is unnecessary to set out in detail the facts of the altercations outside the hotel in Manly. These are recited in the agreed statement of facts tendered in the District Court which have been recited in full by her Honour in her remarks on sentence. 
      
       
      
     7     
     That leads me to her findings in relation to the fourth count of threatening a witness. The entirety of her findings is contained in this extract: 
      
       
        
         
         ""In the early hours of 13 October 1998 (the victim) was working as a security guard at the Manly Boatshed, a nightclub. The prisoner approached (the victim) and made a gesture in the shape of a gun with his fingers pointing at his own head, and then flicking it away. To use the words of (the victim) 'like the Los Angeles gangs do on TV.' In the ensuing discussion the prisoner said - 'Don't fuck me, if you fuck with me I am going to fuck with you. Don't charge me. If you charge me I am going to get you.' A few minutes later inside the nightclub the prisoner repeated, 'John, don't fuck with me.' The prisoner did not want to be charged by the police or by the victim."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     8     
     In the course of her remarks her Honour described the fourth count as being the most serious. In that description I do not find her Honour fell into error and I would reject the contention advanced by counsel for the applicant that she did. Nevertheless it was necessary that some assessment be made of the criminality involved in the facts found by her Honour. 
      
       
      
     9     
     It has been pointed out to the court that the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission show that a sentence of a total of four years divided into a minimum term of two and a half years with an additional term of one and a half years is the heaviest sentence ever imposed in respect of this particular offence. It is a reasonable conclusion that that statistic reflects the particular case which is the subject of the current application. 
      
       
      
     10     
     It was submitted that it is difficult to conceive that the facts found by her Honour (which I have reproduced) and his record which I have briefly touched upon, represent either the worst case or the worst offender, or both. I would respectfully agree with that submission. 
      
       
      
     11     
     There has been some discussion in the course of the hearing about an extract from a statement which was tendered before the District Court. It was a statement by the victim in which it was asserted that the applicant had said ""If I go to prison I'm going to get someone to kill you."" Objectively assessed, I would regard that statement as more serious than the facts which her Honour found. In my view, given that it was for her Honour to find available facts from the evidence before her for purposes of sentence and that she did not make a finding that those words were used, it is not appropriate to consider her assessment of sentence in the light of this evidence to which she did not refer. 
      
       
      
     12     
     Attention has also been drawn to the circumstance that there was jurisdiction in a Local Court to deal with all of the offences which were before the District Court. In the whole of the circumstances I do not regard that as a matter of any consequence. I am, however, of the view, that even allowing that the sentence of four years was expressed by her Honour to reflect the totality of criminality including that of the three offences for which the specific sentences have now expired, it was excessive.  
      
       
      
     13     
     This conclusion is reached weighing the apparent seriousness of the threat and accepting guidance available from recorded statistics. Comparison would suggest that this sentence is markedly out of kilter with any sentence pattern derivable from them. 
      
       
      
     14     
     In my view the jurisdiction of this court is enlivened by that circumstance and it should intervene to re-sentence. 
      
       
      
     15     
     I propose that sentence be adjusted in respect only to count 4 bearing in mind, as I have observed, that the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1-3 are expired and although this application is not made in respect of them, it is accepted that it would be relevant to give account to the circumstances concerning them. 
      
       
      
     16     
     I therefore propose that the appeal be allowed but before doing so, I should refer to the finding by her Honour that special circumstances required an adjustment by way of extension of the additional term component of her imposition. Given the record of the applicant which I have described in brief terms and the absence of any real indication of a path or an effort towards rehabilitation, I would for my part find that there are no special circumstances justifying the departure from the division of sentence specified in s5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The orders I propose are as follows: the application for leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed, the sentence imposed upon count 4 of threatening a witness contrary to s 322(a) of the Crimes Act be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of two years' imprisonment to consist of a minimum term of one year six months commencing 13 October 1998 and expiring 12 April 2000, together with an additional term of six months commencing on 13 April 2000. I would order that the applicant be released to parole on 12 April 2000 and whilst on parole he be subject to the authority of the Probation and Parole Service. 
      
       
      
     18     
     GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     19     
     GROVE J: The orders of the court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

      GREG JAMES, J. 
      
       
     WEDNESDAY 23 FEBRUARY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. NELSON WATERMAN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: Application for leave to appeal is brought from sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Hosking in the District Court for two offences. The first involved an offence for which the applicant was arrested in the act on 25 August 1998, of disposing of stolen property under s.188 of the Crimes Act 1900 and was punishable by 10 years' imprisonment. The second was an offence of escape lawful custody on 12 August 1998, under s.34 of the Correctional Sentence Act 1952, also punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. The sentence for that latter offence is required by s.34(2) of that Act to be cumulative on all previous sentences imposed by the court, or to which the inmate is subject. It is necessary therefore that the sentence on count two commence at the expiration of the minimum term the applicant was then serving. 
    2   At the time of the escape in question the applicant was serving sentences that had been imposed on 24 February 1997 at the Wollongong District Court on counts of break, enter and steal, stealing from a dwelling and breach of recognisances granted in respect of other offences. It is not necessary to recite the detail of those sentences save and except that the relevant minimum term of 18 months expired on 5 October 1999. 
    3   The applicant has been returned to custody to serve the additional term of 18 months and faces confinement in maximum security as a result of being an escapee for the balance of his sentences. Consequent upon his escape, the prisoner was at liberty for 13 days. He will have to serve the equivalent of that time. 
    4   During the time when the applicant was an escapee, he came into possession of a considerable quantity of electrical goods, a Medicare card and a Bankcard and was apprehended seeking to pawn the electrical goods using the cards for identification. He decamped during that arrest but was apprehended again. These matters gave rise to the first offence for which he was sentenced. 
    5   His Honour in a careful judgment recited the circumstances of the offences and imposed on the charge of escape a sentence of penal servitude of 18 months to date from 18 October 1999 (his Honour took into account the 13 days at liberty) and imposed an additional term of one year expiring on 17 April 2002. On the charge relating to the stolen goods the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months' penal servitude to date from 18 October 1999 with release on 17 April 2001, a term wholly concurrent with the minimum term on the escape charge. 
    6   His Honour had expressed the view, that whilst the prospects of rehabilitation might be considered with considerable reserve, the applicant would benefit from supervision for a period longer than he thought was open to him to impose. His Honour found special circumstances and found, in relation to the escape, that the prisoner had been at large for only 13 days, that it was an impulsive and foolish escape committed whilst gardening outside the minimum prison confines. He was at that time in custody ""doing well"" and had by reason, he asserted, of family hardship circumstances escaped only two weeks from being allowed out on work release. 
    7   As I have said, as a further consequence of escaping, as well as the sentence being cumulative and the prospect of liberty at or about the end of the minimum term being forfeit, the applicant will be treated within the prison system as an escapee and be subject to maximum security. His Honour considered this and adverted to the recent increase in the maximum penalty to that now applicable for the offence. His Honour correctly adverted to the aggravating circumstance of the commission of a further offence whilst in custody. 
    8   His Honour came to sentence the applicant for these offences before a co-accused, one Nicholas Scott Seymour who had escaped with the applicant and who in due course was charged with the escaping offence and one count of break, enter and steal, a matter which was dealt with on a schedule. 
    9   A number of grounds have been here advanced submitting that his Honour fell into error. One of the matters to which our attention is drawn is the fact when his Honour came to deal with the applicant he was informed that no question of parity with the co-accused presently arose and that was because the co-accused was to be sentenced after this applicant.  
    10   It was necessary for the sentence of this applicant before his Honour to proceed when it did rather than to have the matter adjourned as his Honour would not have been sitting for some months following the matter coming forward, and his Honour was of the view that it was appropriate in those circumstances to deal with the applicant but that a copy of his remarks should be provided to that judge before whom the co-accused came for sentence. 
    11   We are informed by the affidavit of Martin Green which was read on this appeal and sworn 11 February 2000, that the remarks on sentence of the Chief Judge of the District Court who dealt with the co-accused are not presently available, but that on 14 January 1999 Seymour was sentenced to a minimum of three months and an additional term of nine months on the charge escape lawful custody. As I have said the charge of break and enter was put on a schedule and taken into account. 
    12   On the hearing of the appeal enquiry was made of both the learned prosecutor and the learned counsel for the applicant as to whether there was any distinguishing feature which might indicate that regard should not be had to the co-accused's sentence in the light of the principles expressed by the High Court of Australia in Lowe v. The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v. The Queen (1997) 187 CLR 295, and we were informed that there was no such distinguishing matter. Indeed the Crown Prosecutor conceded that there appeared to be no good reason why in the circumstances the applicant should not have received a sentence of the same general nature and extent as that imposed upon the co-accused. In those circumstances I for my part would not find it necessary to go on to consider the other grounds as asserted except to say that in my view they would not succeed to the extent of producing a sentence that would be likely to be of the range of a parity with that imposed on the co-accused. It may well be that parity with the sentence imposed on the co-accused would produce a sentence which would appear to be entirely inadequate in all the circumstances. Nonetheless there is clear authority from the High Court of Australia, particularly in Lowe (supra), that occasions may well occur when a sentence that is otherwise appropriate might, having regard to the principle of parity, be reduced to avoid a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the imposition on a co-accused of a sentence otherwise seen to be inadequate. This would, it seems to me, be one of those cases. In the circumstances I am of the view that it is necessary for the court to intervene. 
    13   I would grant leave to appeal. I would allow the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court. In lieu thereof I would sentence the appellant to a fixed term expiring today on count two, that term to commence on 18 October 1999. I would propose a sentence on count one, that is the receiving count, of a fixed term of six months to date from 25 August 1998. 
    14   GROVE, J: I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons of Greg James, J. as given. The order of the court, therefore, will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

     REGINA v Melissa 
       
     Dianne PAGETT 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   HIDDEN J: I will ask Acting Justice Carruthers to give the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Melissa Dianne Pagett seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her by Judge Goldring at the Sydney District Court on 9 August 1999. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of robbery whilst armed under s97(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900, as amended, which offence attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. The details of that offence need not be noted, except to record that one of the applicant’s two co-offenders was David Charles Thomas, to whom I shall later refer. 
    3   The ground upon which this application is based is that of an asserted lack of parity with the sentence imposed upon Thomas by Judge Goldring who, in accordance with normal District Court practice, sentenced both co-offenders and a third co-offender, to whom it is not necessary to make reference. 
    4   Before I deal with the sentence imposed by Judge Goldring on the applicant for the subject offence, it is convenient to trace earlier relevant sentences imposed upon the applicant. On 22 November 1996, the applicant was sentenced at the Penrith District Court to concurrent sentences in relation to offences of armed robbery. A minimum term was fixed of 18 months to date from 24 October 1996 and to expire on 23 April 1998, with an additional term of two and a half years to date from 24 April 1998 and to expire on 23 October 2000. 
    5   On 23 April 1998, the applicant was released to parole. However, she failed to comply with certain parole conditions, namely she failed to remain at Kedesh House, failed to inform the Probation and Parole Service of her change of address, and failed to report. These breaches occurred in October 1998. 
    6   Accordingly, on 24 November 1998, at a time when the Parole Board was unaware of the applicant’s location, it revoked the applicant’s parole and ordered her to serve the then balance of the additional term of one year eleven months and two days. Whilst the applicant was at large, if I could use that expression, the subject offence was committed on 12 December 1998. 
    7   The applicant decamped after the subject offence was committed and it was not until 24 February 1999 that she was taken into custody at Mulawa Correctional Centre to commence service of the balance of the additional term, that is to say the one year eleven months and two days, to which I have already referred. That period was to date from 24 February 1999 and to expire on 16 February 2001. 
    8   Although the applicant had been taken into custody at the Mulawa Correctional Centre on 24 February 1999, the police officers investigating the subject offence were not aware of that fact until 18 March 1999. On that date, having ascertained her whereabouts, the police officers charged the applicant with the subject offence. 
    9   Against this background, Judge Goldring, at the Sydney District Court on 9 August 1999, sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two and a half years to date from 9 August 1999, the date of sentence, and to expire on 8 February 2002 in relation to the subject offence. He imposed an additional term of 18 months to date from 9 February 2002 and to expire on 8 August 2003. The consequence of the sentence, thus structured, is that between 9 August 1999 and 16 February 2001 the applicant is concurrently serving the additional term flowing from the revocation of her parole, together with the sentence for the subject armed robbery. 
    10   After 16 February 2001, the applicant, for the first time, will be serving a period of custody solely referable to the subject armed robbery, thus, on the assumption that she would be released to parole on 8 February 2002, she will have only served, according to the calculations of the Crown, 297 days for that offence. 
    11   I then turn to the sentencing history of the co-offender Thomas. On 17 February 1993 he was sentenced, at the Sydney District Court, concurrently on four counts of break, enter and steal to a minimum term of four years three months, to date from 11 September 1992, and to expire on 10 December 1996, with an additional term of three years five months to date from 11 December 1996 and to expire on 10 May 2000. 
    12   On 10 December 1996, Thomas was released to parole. As earlier indicated, the subject offence was committed in company with the applicant on 12 December 1998. That offence of course involved a breach of Thomas’ parole conditions, but at that stage no steps were taken by the Parole Board with regard to that breach. On 14 December 1998, Thomas was arrested for the subject offence and remained in custody on remand until he was sentenced by Judge Goldring at the District Court on 11 June 1999. If I could say, parenthetically, it will be observed this was approximately two months before Judge Goldring sentenced the applicant. 
    13   On 11 June 1999, Judge Goldring sentenced the offender Thomas to a minimum term of two and a half years to date from 14 December 1998, the date he was taken into custody for the subject offence, and to expire on 13 June 2001. His Honour imposed an additional term of eighteen months to date from 14 June 2001 and to expire on 13 December 2002. 
    14   Eleven days after Judge Goldring imposed this sentence, that is to say on 22 June 1999, the Parole Board revoked Thomas’ parole in relation to the four break, enter and steal matters and directed that he was to serve the balance of the additional term, namely one year four months and twenty-nine days to date from 14 December 1998 and to expire on 12 May 2000. The relevant breach of parole was the commission of the subject offence. 
    15   That means, of course, that the whole of the additional term flowing from the breach of parole will be served by Thomas concurrently with the minimum term for the subject offence.  
    16   In the parity argument, counsel, in written submissions for the applicant, focused upon the fact that the applicant’s sentence for the subject offence was fixed to commence from the date of sentence, whereas Thomas’ minimum term was fixed to commence from the date of his arrest. Parity, counsel contended, would have required that the applicant’s sentence be backdated to the date of arrest, vis 18 March 1999. 
    17   The Crown contends that this is not a disparity situation. The Crown relied upon the fact that whereas Thomas' revocation of parole was related to the commission of the subject offence, the applicant's revocation of parole was related to her failure, prior to the commission of the subject offence, to comply with her parole conditions. 
    18   It is significant, the Crown contends, that in sentencing the applicant, his Honour did not take into account the further breach of parole by the applicant in committing the subject offence, which was clearly an aggravating circumstance: See R v Train. (1999) NSWCCA 109 at par 15. In those circumstances, the applicant received the benefit of not having the increased criminality arising out of the commission of an offence on parole reflected in the sentence for the subject offence. In short, the applicant was serving a sentence for breach of her parole constituted by breaches of conditions which occurred prior to commission of the subject offence, whereas Thomas had not committed any breach of his parole independently of the commission of the subject offence. 
    19   Further, the applicant committed, the Crown submits, the subject offence whilst on parole from an offence of violence of the same type, namely armed robbery. This is, it is contended on the authority, if authority be needed, of R v Jones Unreported, NSWCCA, 30 June 1994. an aggravating factor. Thus, contrary to the submissions on behalf of the applicant, the Crown contends that the antecedent circumstances could not be considered to be identical. Thus, the Crown contends, there was no error made in not backdating the applicant's sentence to the date of commission of the said offence, in the sense of any violation of the principle of parity. 
    20   Ms Lyons, who appeared before this Court on behalf of the applicant, but who did not prepare the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, has raised a further interesting argument. She has put to the Court that it is well-known that where there is a revocation of a parole order and an order that the offender serve the balance of the additional term, such offender can reasonably expect to have his or her breach of parole reviewed by the Parole Board, and that such review would take place within a reasonable period of the direction that the additional term be served. This, it was contended, was not a factor taken into account by the sentencing Judge and should have had a direct bearing on the parity argument. No authority was relied upon in respect of this submission. 
    21   Having carefully considered the argument, I am not persuaded that, had it been drawn to the attention of the sentencing Judge, it could reasonably have affected the sentences which he imposed upon the applicant. Bearing in mind the particular circumstances associated with the applicant’s breach of parole, for reasons which I have indicated, and the commission of the subject serious offence on 4 December 1998, one could only, to put it at its highest, speculate upon when the applicant would have been reviewed by the Parole Board and what action, if any, the Parole Board would have taken. 
    22   Thus, in my view, the submission does not undermine the rationale expressed in the sentences his Honour imposed upon the applicant, as distinct from the co-offender Thomas. In my view, the submissions put on behalf of the Crown are valid, and I am unable to accept that there has been any breach of the parity principle. In the circumstances, I would propose, however, that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    23   HIDDEN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Acting Justice Carruthers.

       JUDGMENT -  
       Application to cross-examine Edward William Szkudelski on criminal record 
       
        
      
    1    HER HONOUR: Mr Stratton makes application pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”) to cross-examine the witness Edward Szkudelski with a view to establishing that Mr Szkudelski is a person with a tendency to act in a particular way, namely, to behave violently. 
     
      
    2    The notice served in accordance with the requirements of Part 3.6 of the Act specified as the tendency sought to be established “a tendency to commit crimes of violence to obtain cash”. Mr Stratton sought to amend the notice to expand the tendency to that more general one which I have described. The Crown did not contend that it had been prejudiced in any way by the amendment and accordingly, to the extent that the notice fails to comply with the requirements of Part 3.6, pursuant to s 100, I dispense with the notice requirements. 
     
      
    3    Mr Stratton's application was that he be permitted to cross-examine the witness upon various entries in his criminal record which is Ex A on the voir dire. The matters the subject of Mr Stratton's application were the entries for offences of violence; an unlawful assault in January 1984, convictions before the Geelong Magistrate's Court in February 1984 for assault, a common assault dealt with by the Queanbeyan Local Court in August of 1996, an assault which was dealt with by the Queanbeyan Local Court in July of 1997 and a matter which is pending against the witness, namely an aggravated robbery offence contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act. I consider that each of those matters meets the test imposed by s 97(1)(b) of the Act of having significant probative value and I allow cross-examination of the witness in respect of those matters. 
     
      
    4    The Crown objected to cross-examination concerning a conviction for “possession of an unlicensed firearm” recorded before the Queanbeyan Local Court in April 1997 and I note that Mr Stratton did not press that matter. 
     
      
    5    Additionally, Mr Stratton sought to cross-examine upon information contained in the criminal history computer print-out produced by the Police Service which discloses that one of the witness’ aliases is the name ""Eddie the Knife"". I do not allow evidence to be led on that topic. In my view it does not meet the test imposed by s 97(1)(b) of the Act. 
     
      
    6    I note that, additionally, Mr Stratton has signalled his intention to cross-examine the witness upon the topic of the witness' alleged conviction for trafficking in drugs, being a matter which resulted in a sentence of imprisonment. That matter is put upon the basis of the witness' credit. I propose to allow cross-examination on that topic. I am satisfied that a conviction for trafficking in drugs which resulted in a sentence of imprisonment meets the test of substantial probative value for the purposes of s 103.

     Regina v Matthew Wayne DE GRUCHY 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant Matthew Wayne De Gruchy was convicted on 14 October 1998, of the murder of his mother Jennifer Ann De Gruchy, of his sister Sarah De Gruchy, and of his brother, Adrian De Gruchy, each of whom was killed in the family home on 12 March 1996. He was sentenced, on each count of murder, to concurrent minimum terms of 21 years and to additional terms of seven years. He now appeals against these convictions. Although the notice of appeal included an application for leave to appeal against the sentences, Senior Counsel for the appellant realistically conceded that nothing could be said on that aspect. The sentences imposed were manifestly appropriate for the offences of which the appellant was convicted. 
     
      
     The Crown Case 
      
    2   The De Gruchy family, including the appellant and his father Wayne De Gruchy, lived at 28 Shearwater Boulevard Albion Park Rail. Mr. Wayne De Gruchy (“Mr De Gruchy Senior”) often stayed overnight at his parents’ house at Moorebank, rather than with his family, because of the time it took him to travel to work. He followed this practice on the night of the killing, having attended a company golf day at Pennant Hills Golf Club. He rang home at about 6 to 6.30pm to inform his wife that he intended to stay over at his parents’ home. Two fellow employees confirmed that he had played golf with them that day and that he was still at the club at about 7pm. Mr. Ronald De Gruchy, the grandfather of the appellant, also confirmed that Mr De Gruchy Senior was at his home on the night of 12 March between 8.30pm and 10.30pm, when he retired to bed.  
    3   Earlier that evening the appellant had been at his own home, where he took a telephone call from Mrs Dorothy Halliwell, his maternal grandmother, between 7pm and 7.30pm. He passed that call on to his mother. He took another call from Alyssa Brindley, his girlfriend, at about 8pm. An uncle, Raymond Halliwell, received a telephone call from the appellant’s mother at about 7.45pm. He spoke to her for about ten to fifteen minutes. These times are relevant in so far as they assist in fixing a possible time frame for the killings, and in so far as they establish a window of opportunity for the appellant to have committed the crimes. 
    4   Alyssa Brindley gave evidence that the appellant came around to her home at about 11.00 to 11.30pm, and spent the rest of the night, until 8am, the following morning, with her. Her evidence in this respect was corroborated by her mother, Mrs. Gail Brindley. Alyssa said that the appellant explained that he was late because “my mum was having prank calls and she asked me to stay”. She had attempted to phone him at his home at 10.30pm, but had repeatedly received an engaged signal. She said that he was wearing a white T-shirt and black tracksuit pants when he arrived. She saw no blood on him or on his clothes. He had no apparent injuries to his face or body, and he did not seem depressed, anxious or upset. Mrs. Brindley senior also noticed nothing unusual about his demeanour.  
     
      
    5   At about 8.30am on Wednesday 12 March 1996, the appellant went to the house of Steven Bailey who lived opposite the De Gruchy home. He was seen to be crying, and was heard twice to say “There is something wrong with mum and Sarah”. Mr. Bailey did not notice any blood or injury upon him. He went over to the De Gruchy home where he found Mrs De Gruchy dead in her bed. He then alerted the emergency services. He returned to the house where he found the body of Sarah. This occurred at about 9.03am. Another neighbour, Laurens Hoogvliet, and two of the first police to arrive at the scene, Detectives Williams and Pepper, similarly noticed the appellant to be very distressed, describing him as lying down and sobbing outside Mr. Bailey’s house. Two ambulance officers thought him to be sufficiently upset for them to take him to Shellharbour Hospital. 
    6   When Alyssa Brindley questioned the appellant later that day, after he had returned from the hospital, about the prank phone calls, he said “someone had rung and said three people in your family would be deceased”. This was not something that he mentioned to police that day or subsequently. 
    7   When police investigated the scene, they found the appellant’s mother, brother and sister all to be deceased. Each was suffering from massive head wounds and, in the case of Adrian, extensive injuries to the trunk. Mrs. De Gruchy and Sarah were in their beds, while Adrian was lying in a supine position on the floor in the garage. He smelled strongly of petrol. His arms were blistered and his shirt and shorts were soaked in that substance. His head and neck were covered with a doona, which had some cuts in it A cushion found in Sarah’s bedroom, which appears to have been placed over her head, was also found to have several cuts. 
    8   During a post mortem examination of Adrian’s body, some strands of hair were found between the fingers of his right hand. They were 8 to 10cms in length. As his own hair was 4cms at its longest, it seems that the strands had not come from his head, at least upon that day. The strands had blood upon them. DNA recovered from the sample, it was established, could not have been that of the appellant, but it could have been that of Adrian or Sarah. The report as to this test noted that it was not possible to determine whether the DNA came from the hair or from the blood which had soaked into it.  
    9   There was a good deal of blood from Adrian in the vicinity of his body and upon his hands. His right hand can be seen in a photograph of the scene to have been in an open position, palm down, resting over the back of an upturned chair. 
    10   There was an open Jerry can containing petrol near his body. The appellant’s fingerprints were found upon it, but Mr. De Gruchy senior said that both he and the appellant used Jerry cans from time to time to put petrol in the cars used by the family, in his case a Holden Berlina which had been temporarily replaced by a blue rented Holden Commodore following an accident to the Berlina, and in his wife’s case, a Toyota Corolla Seca hatchback. The appellant was permitted to drive this latter vehicle, and it was that vehicle that he used on the night of 12 March. 
    11   More detailed forensic examination of the crime scene revealed that a large square of carpet had been cut from an area directly in front of the bedside table in the main bedroom, where Mrs De Gruchy was found. Two smaller sections of carpet had been cut out from an area at the foot of the bed. A small tuft of carpet was later recovered from the Toyota Corolla. This tuft was found on the floor of the vehicle on the rear offside. It had a red stain at one end. DNA recovered from it matched the 6 DNA systems of the appellant. The DNA, it was established, could not have come from any of the deceased or from Mr. De Gruchy Senior. 
    12   Expert evidence was called to the effect that it was “highly probable” that the tuft came from the same carpet as that in the main bedroom. Mr. De Gruchy Senior gave evidence of having hired a carpet cleaner on 9 March 1996, which was then used to clean the carpets in the house. He did not notice any damage to any carpet that day or any area where carpet was missing. There was expert evidence to the effect that cleaning a carpet of the age of that in the bedroom was unlikely to remove a tuft. 
     
      
    13   The appellant’s fingerprints were found in a smear that appeared to be blood on the door knob to the cupboard under the vanity unit in the main bathroom. Other stains or smears that appeared to be blood were found in the wash basin, on the mirror, and on the inside of the door to the vanity unit cupboard. 
    14   A small circular reddish coloured stain was located in the bottom of the wash basin in the en suite to the main bedroom. Blood smears were found on the wall above the bed in that room. A set of numchukas were also present in this room, but there was evidence from Mr. De Gruchy Senior that they were his and were normally kept in that room. There was no evidence to suggest that they had any relevance for the killings. 
    15   When Detective Senior Constable Doherty, of the Crime Scene Unit, examined the bedroom of Adrian De Gruchy, he found some blood smears on the wall near the light switch, just inside the doorway. In the appellant’s room, he saw that the drawers in the wall unit had been pulled out and that the doors to the wardrobe were open. A number of items were lying on the floor, including a metal moneybox.  
    16   A reddish coloured stain was found by him inside the lid area of the washing machine in the laundry, which opened off the garage, along with blood smears on the floor of that room. Spots of blood or red smears were also found on the hallway floor and on the wall in the kitchen near the light switch. The washing machine in the laundry was seen to contain two towels and a pair of rubber gloves. One of the towels in the washing machine bore a reddish stain. 
    17   DNA recovered from a swab taken from the wall of the main bedroom behind Mrs. De Gruchy’s bed was found to be the same as the six systems of the appellant. Similar results were found in relation to a blood spot on the hallway floor. Blood grouping and DNA tests were, however, unsuccessful in relation to the smears on the bedroom mirror, or in relation to the spots found in the laundry, in the ensuite basin, on the wall to Adrian’s bedroom, and on the doorknob to the cabinet below the main bedroom ensuite. 
    18   In the loungeroom area, Detective Senior Constable Doherty noticed that the doors to the video cabinet were open, and that a video recorder had apparently been disconnected and removed.  
    19   He noticed that a towel had been placed over Mrs De Gruchy. He also noticed a wash basket containing towels on the floor in her bedroom, in front of the dressing table. In the main bathroom he found a slightly damp towel hanging over the top of the shower recess. The observations in this regard were made in the late afternoon/early evening of 13 March. 
     
      
    20   No smears or blood stains were found in the bedroom of the appellant. It was, however, seen to be in an untidy state with a number of items strewn around the floor. The appellant said, in his evidence that the drawers had not been pulled out when he left the house on the night of 12 March. 
    21   Detective Senior Constable Doherty did not observe any external damage to any doors or windows of the house. Similarly, he found no damage to the door locks of the Toyota Corolla. Inside the hatch (which was found to be open) in the rear of the vehicle he found a jack. He was, however, unable to find the standard jack handle or wheel brace, which employees of Ken Sams Toyota said had been supplied with the vehicle, before it was delivered to Mr. De Gruchy Senior in July 1995. It was his opinion that the spare wheel had not been used. 
    22   Post mortem examinations of the deceased revealed, in the case of Mrs. De Gruchy, a very severe depressed fracture between the eyes, severe lacerations in conjunction with skull fracturing in the left forehead region, fractures of the cheekbones and extensive underlying brain trauma, along with a number of abrasions and bruises. Dr. Cala was of the opinion that the injuries were capable of having been caused by a wheel brace or sledgehammer while the deceased was asleep. 
    23   In the case of Adrian De Gruchy, approximately 21 injuries to the head and neck were found. He had a grossly fractured face and base of the skull, along with numerous lacerations to the back of the head, right forehead, and mouth, as well as fractures to the cheekbones and jawbone. There were six injuries to the trunk, including some tram track or linear bruises to the chest. These bruises were replicated by very obvious bloodied tram track patterns on his shirt. Dr. Cala was of the opinion that the head injuries were similar to those suffered by his mother and sister, and could have been caused by a similar weapon to that used to inflict the chest injuries, which he opined to have been a heavy straight object approximately 1cm. in width and at least 15cms. in length, such as a jack handle or wheel brace. He tended to favour the latter, because of the presence of a coin shaped bruise to the chest of this deceased. A sledgehammer, he said, may have caused the head injuries. The peeling skin seen on the arms of this victim were consistent with petrol having been poured on him, preparatory to setting him alight. 
    24   In the case of Sarah De Gruchy, ten injuries were found to her head and neck, mainly confined to the right side. There was marked skull fracturing of the forehead, and of the right side and base of the skull, as well as extensive lacerations, abrasions and bruising. On the right arm there were three bruises including one tram track bruise, consistent with it having been struck with a tyre lever. She had some defence type injuries to her right arm. 
    25   It was Dr. Cala’s opinion that the time of death of each of the deceased was similar and that it occurred between 8pm on 12 March and 1am. on13 March. He conceded that the time of death could have been as late as 3am. 
    26   Detective Williams, who assisted in various aspects of the investigation, said that on 15 March he located a jewellery box in the walk in wardrobe of the main bedroom. It was ascertained that nothing had been taken from this box. Similarly it was shown that nothing had been taken from the appellant’s wallet or moneybox. 
    27   Several weeks after the killings, some children playing in the vicinity of a dam at the old Boral Brickworks, at Woonona, found a red bag containing a sheet, and a towel wrapped around a small sledgehammer. One of the boys removed the hammer and placed it in the grass. His companion put the bag back in the water. Some time later the first boy returned to the scene with a Mr. Sean Chamberlain, who moved the hammer behind a tree. The matter was then reported to police. 
    28   When police attended at the dam they recovered a red and white Le Sport bag, a black coloured backpack and a number of loose items. Those items comprised a towel, Sega game cases and control pads, a black lady’s purse containing credit cards, papers and a licence in the name of Mrs. De Gruchy, a light coloured sock, a pair of scissors, a pair of blue track pants and a calculator with the name “A De Gruchy” inscribed on the back . A hanky was also found lying in the mud of the dam. Another handkerchief was found alongside a game case near the west bank of the dam, after it was drained. The hammer was found under a tree, as had been reported. 
    29   The sports bag was found to contain two T-shirts, (one maroon coloured, one blue coloured) a video tape recorder, a kitchen knife, a key ring, a number of compact discs and cases, another towel, a pair of binoculars, a bottle of Zambucca, some pieces of carpet and a plastic zip-lock bag. The black back pack contained a Sega “Master System II, two calculators, some Sega game cases, a video cassette, Gameboy and games cartridges, a light coloured sock, a “Batman” bag and a black sports velcro wallet. 
    30   The pieces of carpet found in the dam bore similar black marks to those seen on the sheet. 
    31   The plastic zip-lock bag, that was found inside the red and white sports bag, was examined and seen to contain some bandaid wrappings and a torn up piece of paper in the appellant’s handwriting. When reconstructed it appeared to have been a sheet of “Noah’s on the Beach” notepaper, on which were written:

     Written on the rear of this sheet of paper were a series of numbers. 
      
    32   Some evidence was called from Stephen Heyman to the effect that he had seen the appellant, on a couple of occasions prior to 1996, riding his bike with companions at the brickyard. Detective Sergeant Sharkey gave evidence to the effect that the brick pit was 31 kms. distant from the De Gruchy home, and that it took 26 minutes to drive there at a speed 5 kms an hour less than the speed limit. Detective Palamera gave similar evidence and also said that the distance between the Brindley home (at 9 Luxor Street Woonona) and the brickworks was 2 kms, the travel time by vehicle being in the order of two minutes. 
    33   The pieces of carpet found in the sports bag at the dam were compared with the main bedroom carpet and with the tuft found in the car. Mr. Pailthorpe, an expert in fibre science, concluded that it was “highly probable” that the carpet found in the dam, similarly to the tuft found in the Toyota, came from the carpet in the main bedroom. 
    34   The hammer tested presumptively for blood, but it would seem that DNA testing and blood grouping were unsuccessful. No fingerprints were recovered from the items in the dam, it would appear, because they had been immersed in water for too long. 
    35   After discovery of the note police made a further examination of the De Gruchy home. Nothing was found to have been hidden in the roof cavity, or thrown down any wall space. A search of the area to the rear of the house also produced nothing of relevance. However, during a search conducted on 22 June 1996, a single sheet of “Noah’s on the Beach” note paper, similar to that recovered from the dam, was found in the appellant’s bedroom. Items in his handwriting were compared with the last mentioned note, by a document examiner who provided an expert opinion that they were produced by the same hand - a proposition that was not challenged by the defence. 
    36   Mr. De Gruchy Senior said that so far as he was aware, the tyre lever and jack handle, that were standard issue for a Toyota Corolla Seca of the kind which he had purchased in mid 1995, had never been used. 
    37   He also said that he had kept a small sledgehammer in the garage but it did not look like the one found at the dam. He was able to identify some of the items found at the dam as coming from his home. Some items he was unable to identify one way or the other. 
    38   When the appellant was interviewed electronically by Detective Sgt Sharkey on 17 March, he detailed his movements during the evening of 12 March and the morning of 13 March 1996. He said that when he returned to his home that morning, he went into the kitchen/dining area, but nowhere else. He put down his overnight bag. He did not see anybody around about. He went back to his mother’s car and drove to a supermarket to purchase some cigarettes. It was upon his return that he discovered the body of his mother. He placed a towel over her and ran outside for help. He did not go into Sarah’s room, Adrian’s room, the bathroom, the laundry, or the main bedroom ensuite, at any stage that morning. Nor did he open any cupboards, doors or drawers or use the bathrooms.  
    39   He stated that he had left to go to Alyssa Brindley’s house, the preceding night, a bit before 10pm. He said that there had been about five prank calls up to about 9.40pm. He added that when the phone had been picked up, all he could hear were the beeps, indicating that the caller had hung up. He also said that he had packed a change of clothes in a bag, which he took to Alyssa’s home, and left in the family room upon his return. The clothes were not used. 
    40   This interview followed the taking, by Detective Senior Constable Dickinson, of a preliminary statement from the appellant on the afternoon of 13th March, as to his movements that day and the preceding day.  
    41   In neither the statement nor the ERISP did the appellant make mention of any person informing his mother that there were to be some deaths in the family. In the statement he said that he had been wearing a pair of blue quicksilver shorts and a white track shirt, and runners when he went to Alyssa’s home. The next morning he said that he changed into a tracksuit. He was to give a different version at his trial. 
    42   When he was arrested on 22 June 1996, the appellant exercised his right to decline to answer any further questions. 
    43   Finally, it may be noted, that on 19 March 1996, a man by the name of Wakehim committed suicide and left a note in which he noted that he was afraid that he would be blamed for the De Gruchy murders. Police discounted this line of inquiry, it having been shown that this man had been depressed and had contemplated suicide from an earlier time. 
    44   It was the Crown case that the appellant had murdered his mother, brother and sister some time after 8pm. on the evening of 12 March 1996, and had then driven to the quarry in the Toyota Corolla, where he disposed of various items taken from the house, in the dam. His purpose in removing the items from the home, the Crown suggested, was to create the pretence of a robbery. Having done that, the Crown alleged, he went to his girlfriend’s house before returning home the following morning, where he pretended surprise at the discovery of his mother and sister.  
    45   The Crown accepted that its case was entirely circumstantial, and that it could not point to any motive on the part of the appellant to murder his mother and siblings. 
    46   It was the appellant’s case that he knew nothing about the murders and that they must have been the work of someone other than himself. He gave evidence at the trial to the effect that he last saw his family alive when he left his home at around 10pm on 12 March, before driving to his girlfriend’s home in his mother’s Toyota Corolla. He had been delayed, he said, because his mother had been concerned about a couple of prank phone calls. She informed him that the caller made mention of three family members going to be deceased.  
    47   When he left the home his mother and sister were in their rooms. He did not know where Adrian was and assumed that he had gone out. He had gone home the next morning he said to return the car so that his sister and brother could be driven to school. When he arrived the house was quiet and he assumed that someone else had taken them to school. It was after going to the supermarket to buy some cigarettes and returning that he found his mother. All that he remembered thereafter was running outside to find help.  
    48   He was given medication at the hospital which left him confused and feeling dopey. He was still in that state, he said, when interviewed by police on the afternoon of 13 March and again on 17 March, as he was continuing to take the sleeping pills prescribed.  
    49   He said that he got on well with his mother and loved her. He had not argued with her or with his brother or sister on 12 March. 
    50   After the carpets has been cleaned over the weekend before the killings, he said that he placed the carpet cleaner in the back of the Toyota on a piece of carpet to protect the car. Offcuts were kept in the garage for this purpose. He also used the Jerry can to fill up the car with petrol, as was his duty when his father was away.  
    51   He gave evidence that there had been a family party at the home to celebrate his eighteenth birthday in mid December. Some of the activities involved in holding the party, he said, were consistent with things written in the torn up note recovered from the dam. He added that some of the birthday presents he received were also consistent with items recorded in the note. The numbers noted on the back he said could have been consistent with tracks on CD disks selected as music for his birthday party.  
    52   The appellant said that he had no actual recollection of writing the note but he accepted that the writing was his. 
    53   Evidence of his good character was led from his uncle, Paul De Gruchy, from his father and from his girlfriend - who variously said that he was a gentle, polite person who was not given to violence and who got on well with his family. It was accepted that he had no prior convictions. His uncle, who was present at the interview on 17 March, confirmed that the appellant appeared affected by the sleeping pills. 
    54   A wheelbrace was tendered in the defence case. It had been found by Mr. Urquhart, the occupier of 34 Shearwater Boulevarde, and given to police on 17 June 1996. Detective Doherty said that it had not been provided to Dr Cala for examination or subjected to fingerprint examination. Presumptive tests carried out by him in relation to it had been negative, and to his mind nothing of an evidentiary nature was located in relation to it. In the cross examination of Detective Doherty, it was also established that a black handled knife was found in Koona Street, some 100 metres or so from Shearwater Road. It was examined but nothing of an evidentiary nature was found. 
    55   The substantial ground argued on appeal was that the verdicts were unreasonable or not supported on the evidence: S6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as that ground has been refined or explained in decisions such as Gipp (1998) 72 ALJR 1012, Fleming (1999) 73 ALJR1, and Giam (1999) NSWCCA 53. As this is an acquittal argument, I shall deal with it last. 
     
      
     Ground two - exclusion of evidence of other violent murders committed in the neighbourhood 
      
    56   Counsel at the trial attempted to secure production, pursuant to subpoena, of police records concerning investigations into the violent murders of David Thomas O’Hearn and Frank Arkell, in respect of which Mark Van Krevel was arrested and charged on 1 October 1998, ie during the trial of the appellant. 
    57   It was accepted that each of these murders occurred well after those with which the appellant was charged. Each, however, occurred in the same general area - Mr. O’Hearn’s residence being suggested at the trial to have been only 300 yards from the De Gruchy home, although in fact it was 1.7kms. distant. The killing of Mr. Arkell occurred further away, in his home at West Wollongong. Mr. Van Krevel lived at Albion Park Rail, and he had been to the same school as the De Gruchy children. It was accepted that these two murders had also been marked by extraordinary levels of violence; although they were somewhat different in that the two victims had been the subject of mutilation. 
    58   It was submitted that his Honour erred in refusing access to the subpoenaed documents, and also in precluding cross examination of police concerning the Arkell and O’Hearn murders or concerning other murders in the greater Wollongong area. Access to the subpoenaed material was sought, and the cross examination was pressed, upon the basis that a legitimate forensic purpose existed, namely to show an alternative hypothesis consistent with the appellant’s innocence - that Van Krevel or some other unidentified person lived in the area who was disposed to acts of random and gratuitous violence, and who may have been responsible for the killings with which the appellant was charged. 
    59   His Honour declined access to the subpoenaed material upon the basis that there were insufficient similarities between the killings to make the material admissible under S98 of the Evidence Act, as coincidence evidence. It was submitted that in approaching the subpoena access question from an admissibility point of view, his Honour posed the wrong test. Rather, it was submitted that the correct test was whether a legitimate forensic purpose was shown for access to the material: Saleam (1989) 39 A Crim R 406 and Alister (1983-4) 154 CLR 404. In Saleam Hunt J, as he then was, expressed the test in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “In my view, when a trial judge is faced with a subpoena of this kind, he should require counsel for the accused to identify expressly and with precision the legitimate forensic purpose for which he seeks access to the documents, and the judge should refuse access to the documents until such an identification has been made. Sometimes that purpose will not become apparent (even to counsel for the accused who had advised the issue of the subpoena) until the trial has been under way for some time ( 
       cf  
       National Employer’s Mutual General Association Ltd v Waind 
         
       [ 
       1978] 1 NSWLR 372 at 385) and the judge’s initial refusal to permit inspection should always be open to review. The problems which arise when counsel is unable to formulate such a submission with clarity are well exemplified by the decisions in  
       Maddison v Goldrick 
        [1976] 1 NSWLR 651 at 666 and in  
       McPhail 
        (1988) 36 A Crim R 390. 
       
      
      
       
       In my view, the criterion finally suggested by Gibbs CJ in  
       Alister 
        as that which had to be satisfied before a court should inspect documents in relation to which a claim for public interest immunity had been made is appropriate to be applied also when the trial judge has to determine whether access should be granted to documents subpoenaed from the police in relation to which objection has been taken that no legitimate forensic purpose exists for their production. He must be satisfied that it is ‘on the cards’ that the documents would materially assist the accused in his defence.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    60   To similar effect are the decisions in Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court of NSW v Tastan (1994) 75 A Crim R 498 at 504, and Carroll v the Attorney General for New South Wales (1993) 70 A Crim R 162 at 181 to 182. 
    61   So far as the cross examination was concerned, it was submitted that his Honour similarly applied too narrow a test in confining the issue to one of coincidence evidence. Rather it was submitted the cross examination should have been allowed since it also went to the existence of a possible alternative hypothesis consistent with the appellant’s innocence: Barca (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104-106. There Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ observed (at 105): 
     
      
       
       “… although a jury cannot be asked to engage in groundless speculation it is not incumbent on the defence either to establish that some inference other than that of guilt should reasonably be drawn from the evidence or to prove particular facts that would tend to support such an inference. If the jury think that the evidence as a whole is susceptible of a reasonable explanation other than that the accused committed the crime charged the accused is entitled to be acquitted.” 
       
      
    62   By excluding exploration of the possibility that Van Krevel, or some other unidentified assailant, was the killer, or of at least placing that possibility before the jury, it was submitted his Honour erred and deprived the applicant of a chance to be acquitted. 
    63   It is clear from his Honour’s reasons for judgment that he dealt with the application for access, and the attempted line of cross examination, upon the basis presented by trial Counsel, namely that by reason of apparent coincidences between the various killings, the evidence would support the existence of the alternative hypothesis. That was the forensic purpose identified and it was appropriate therefore for his Honour to have considered whether it was a legitimate purpose, in the circumstances of the case, or merely a fishing expedition. 
    64   Alister and Saleam dealt with very different factual circumstances, in which the material subpoenaed had an obvious link with the case in hand. In the present instance the documents sought, and the line of cross examination involved in my view, nothing more than a fishing expedition. The Arkell and O’Hearn murders occurred in June 1998, more than two years after the killings with which the appellant was charged, and his Honour, after examining the documents, saw no common modus operandi or anything in the way of physical evidence or otherwise that might link Van Krevel with the events at the De Gruchy home. Moreover, there had been no admissions by him concerning those events, whereas he had come forward to confess in relation to the Arkell and O’Hearn killings. In confessing to those crimes he stated that while O’Hearn had been randomly selected as a victim, Arkell had been chosen because of the things he had done - a reference, it may be assumed, to the paedophile charges that he faced. 
    65   It was, in these circumstances, mere speculation that he may have been involved. In the terms of the test approved in Saleam, it was not “on the cards” that the subpoenaed material would assist the defence. His Honour was accordingly correct in refusing access to those documents. 
    66   Equally, in my view, he was correct in excluding the proposed cross examination both in relation to the Arkell and O’Hearn murders, and in relation to any other killings that may have occurred in the greater Wollongong or Illawarra districts. In this latter regard, Counsel did not identify any particular killings, solved or unsolved, that bore any similarity or possible connection. It would have been pure speculation to float before the jury the circumstance that since other killings had occurred, so might the present killings have been the work of one or other of those responsible for them - absent that is, some identified connection. 
    67   Again, Barca is distinguishable since there was there strong circumstantial evidence pointing to a party other than the accused as having been responsible for the killing in the form of evidence going to the existence of a motive on his part, threats by him directed towards the victim and a witness, the existence of intense anger upon his part towards the victim, the fact of his involvement in another killing having a marked similarity to the case before the Court, and the existence of a custom for persons of his ethnic background to carry out the very kind of offence charged in circumstances where, as it was there alleged, the honour of his daughter had been besmirched. 
    68   Since the matters raised did not go beyond mere conjecture as to the existence of an alternative hypothesis, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in the approach taken, or that the appellant was deprived of an opportunity for acquittal by the exclusion of a possible body of evidence going to the O’Hearn or Arkell murders, or of any other murders that may have happened to have been committed in the general district, over an undefined period, before or after the present killings. 
     
      
     Ground 3 - directions given concerning remarks made by the Crown Prosecutor in his closing address, as to whether or not the appellant had a disturbed mind. 
      
    69   Somewhat inadvisedly, the Crown Prosecutor suggested, in his closing address, that the person who committed the murders “must have had a disturbed mind”. This followed an earlier observation to the effect that in cases where there has been extreme and apparently senseless violence visited upon a victim, there is quite often no motive. 
    70   Complaint was made at the time by Counsel for the appellant to the effect that, by these observations, the Crown Prosecutor had offered to the jury an explanation for the absence of any apparent motive, an explanation which was totally lacking in support since there was no evidence in the trial as to whether the appellant had or had not been psychiatrically examined, let alone shown to have had a disturbed mind. As a consequence, a request was made that the submission be withdrawn. 
    71   In response the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, as was clearly correct, that the Crown did not have to prove a motive. The justification for the balance of the comment was said to lie in the “nature of the acts themselves”, it being put that “as a general proposition anybody responsible for these acts must have had a disturbed mind.” 
    72   The approach taken by the Crown Prosecutor in this regard was both ill-advised, and curious since the comment did not necessarily advance the prosecution case. It also involved a degree of circularity. In the absence of any evidence that the appellant had a disturbed mind, the comment was capable of being understood as pointing to some person other than the appellant as the culprit. To that extent, it favoured the defence case. However, the complaint of the appellant lay in the submission that it offered a possible explanation for the appellant acting in a most disturbing and violent way, which was apparently out of character for him.  
    73   It is evident that his Honour saw it necessary to deal with this matter, and with the submissions made in respect of it during the closing addresses, which he elected to do in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “You may remember that the Crown Prosecutor when he addressed you said to you that the Crown is not required to prove a motive. That is correct in law … Of course, it is comforting to an ordinary human being where you are seeking to assess somebody’s action to know why they did it but I should tell you the law does not require the crown to tell you why people commit crimes.”  
       
      
      
     His Honour went on to note: 
      
      
       
       “It was said that the Crown Prosecutor had observed to you that frequently it was the case that crimes of great violence had been committed without motive. 
       
      
      
       
       My understanding of what he said was that such crimes were known to have happened and the motive was unknown or ‘baffling’ was a word I remember him using. I did not understand him to say that there was no motive; merely that the motive was unknown. “ 
       
      
    74   So far the directions were unexceptional, as were the preliminary observations reminding the jury of the remark of the Crown Prosecutor which had attracted attention: 
     
      
      
       
       “The matter which is argued by counsel or related to what was said about that, is an expression used by the Crown Prosecutor when he was talking about motive and making submissions to you and he went on to say that the three killings and the level of violence with which you had to deal would have been the product of a disturbed mind. 
       
      
      
       
       Let me say that at the very least I would suggest to you that that was an unfortunate expression for counsel to use in the flourish of advocacy. 
       
      
      
       
       This is not a case about disturbed mind. “ 
       
      
    75   It is what followed that gives rise to this ground of appeal, namely the observation:  
     
      
       
       “In the course of address on Friday counsel for the accused said there was no evidence here or anywhere else that the accused had a disturbed mind.  
       I confirm to you there is no evidence here that the accused has a disturbed mind or anything that might be described. 
         
       So far as 
         
       anywhere else is concerned, neither you nor I know whether there is such evidence one way or other  
         
       and it is entirely irrelevant. To your mind, excise it in this case 
       . Because counsel have engaged in this dispute, I think it appropriate that I should say a few further things to you.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    76   His Honour then proceeded, in a lengthy passage, to place the matter of mental illness into its proper context, explaining: 
     
      
       
       “I expect in the course of your ordinary lives you would have read in newspapers or heard from other organs of the media that in trials for murder evidence is given by psychiatrists and the like as to what the state of mind of an accused person is in terms of normality. Sometimes issues arise in a trial, for example where a person is charged with murder, as to whether or not that person should be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. That involves an inquiry as to whether or not that particular accused suffered a defect of reason so as to be not responsible for his or her act because that person either did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act of killing or if that person did that they did not know it was wrong. 
       
      
      
       
       Sometimes in a case of murder, defences, as they are called, arise concerning what is called diminished responsibility. That involves issues as to whether or not a particular accused in a particular case suffered from such an abnormality of mind as to reduce that person’s culpability for killing. The result of that I will mention to you in passing is that the crime of murder can be reduced to manslaughter. No such issue arises in this case. If such an issue had arisen, it is conceivable that evidence could have been called about the state of mind of the accused."" 
       
      
    77   His Honour went on to emphasise that not only were there no such issues in this trial but also that there was no evidence concerning them. In the course of doing so, he repeated, in the italicised sections which follow, the passages to which the present complaint is directed. 
     
      
       
       “I emphasise to you there is no such evidence and I am not suggesting I know one way or the other whether any such evidence exists. This matter has been somewhat elaborated, starting with a flourish by the Crown Prosecutor, as a murder by a disturbed mind and responded by his opponent that if that is what he wanted to suggest you would have heard about it. You would have heard evidence and there were no questions even hinting that the accused had a disturbed mind. 
       
      
      
       
       For my part and this is a comment of mine, I do not know what the Crown Prosecutor meant by his expression “disturbed mind” but this I can tell you, there is no issue in this case about the state of mind of the accused other than the allegation that if he was the person that caused the death, at the time of causing the death he intended to kill or do grievous bodily harm.  
       You should put entirely to one side, first, the observation by the Crown Prosecutor about “disturbed mind” and secondly the observations by his opponent that you could have heard evidence called by the Crown or otherwise about it. 
       
      
      
       
        
       It is as I said to you earlier, to say the least, unfortunate that this contretemps has arisen but what I tell you as a matter of law is that you in this case put entirely to one side both the observations as to disturbance of mind made by the Crown Prosecutor and by counsel for the accused  
       because one thing is certain in this case, there is no evidence as to the state of mind of the accused, so far as disturbance is concerned one way or the other.  
       What you are invited to infer from the evidence is that whoever perpetrated these killings intended at that time to cause death or grievous bodily harm. 
       
      
      
       
       But insofar as the remarks that have been made to you invite you to speculate about disturbance of mind, in the sense that that phrase is commonly used, that is not an issue for deliberation in this case. As I say to you, I do not know precisely what the Crown Prosecutor meant when he used the phrase in the first place and I can say no more than that the response to it, which seems to me to carry the implication that the Crown was somehow seeking to raise one of the issues that I mentioned to you that you could have in some trials but not as an issue in this trial was perhaps an understandable response but nevertheless an unnecessary one I apologise to you for spending so much time on this. I am only seeking to emphasis that you should put to one side the original remark and the response to it. 
        
       
      
    78   At the conclusion of the summing up trial Counsel asked his Honour to withdraw the whole of these directions and also asked for an instruction that there was general evidence (i.e. character evidence) from which the jury could reason that the appellant was in fact not of a disturbed mind. This request was declined. 
    79   It is now submitted that his Honour erred in directing the jury, that: 
     
      
       
       (i) there was no evidence as to whether or not the appellant had a disturbed mind; and that 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) they should ignore the appellant’s submission that had there been any evidence that the appellant had a disturbed mind, the Crown could have or would have called it. 
       
      
    80   As to the first point, it was submitted that there was evidence to the effect that the appellant was not of a disturbed mind in so far as there was unchallenged evidence from his father, his uncle and his girlfriend that he was a gentle, polite and quiet person not given to violence, and in so far as it as shown that he had no prior convictions. 
    81   This submission lacks conviction. The character evidence was not evidence going to the existence or non existence of a disturbance of the mind in the sense that his Honour was directing the jury, i.e. in the context of mental illness or diminished responsibility.  
    82   As to the second point, it was submitted that the response of Counsel at the trial was well based, and that as good character had been raised, the Crown would have been entitled to call evidence of any disturbance of mind, on the appellant’s part, had it been available. That may have been so had such a disturbance of mind sounded in anti social or discreditable conduct, ie subject to any discretionary exclusion of the evidence relevant to its probative value and its prejudicial effect. As a general proposition, however, it is too broad.  
    83   Read fairly, and in its full context, what his Honour was at pains to do was to make it clear that this was not a case in which any issue arose going to the state of health of the appellant’s mind, as would arise in a case where issues as to mental illness or diminished responsibility arose.  
    84   I am satisfied that the jury would have understood the remarks of his Honour to have been directed to that matter, and in that respect to have neutralised the somewhat ill-advised and circular observation of the Crown Prosecutor. Once these directions were given, there is no reason for supposing that the jury were left with the apprehension that there might have been some uncalled evidence available to this effect, or that they might properly speculate that the accused had been suffering from a disturbed state of mind. 
    85   I am also satisfied that the directions did not have the effect of watering down the character evidence which remained available and capable of showing that it would have been out of character for this appellant to have committed crimes of the savagery here involved. Nor did it water down the proposition that the Crown had not proved, and could not prove, a motive on the part of the appellant - a matter it conceded throughout. 
     
      
     Ground 4: the summing up was unbalanced so far as the case of the appellant was concerned 
      
    86   In essence this submission depended upon the proposition that the summary of the Crown case occupied some twelve pages of the transcript, while the summary of the defence case occupied about seven pages, of which one and a half pages comprised a critique of the defence submissions concerning the failure of some police witnesses to record details in their duty books. It was submitted that in particular, insufficient attention was given to significance of the strands of hair found in the hands of Adrian De Gruchy during the post mortem examination. It was also submitted that added significance attached to the circumstance that his Honour dealt with the addresses in reverse order to that in which they were given and, it was put, almost completely omitted defence criticisms of the propositions advanced by the Crown.  
    87   It is always necessary that the respective cases be put in a balanced way and that the defence of an accused person be adequately put to the jury. As this Court made clear in Davis (CCA NSW 31 July 1997) the defence case needs to be clearly and fairly put as a recognisable entity, in which attention is drawn to any evidence or arguments that throw doubt on the Crown case: see also Vaudrey (CCA NSW 16 April 1998). 
    88   Whether or not a summing up is balanced in this respect cannot depend upon any numerical comparison of the pages of transcript devoted to the addresses. Almost invariably, and particularly in a circumstantial case, many more witnesses will be called in the prosecution case than will be called in the defence case, with the consequence that it will take longer to summarise the former. The present case was no exception - the Crown having called thirty-seven or so witnesses whose evidence extended over approximately 700 pages of transcript, while the defence case was confined to the appellant and his uncle, whose evidence occupied 70 pages or so. Even if such a comparison could provide a meaningful guide as to balance, the point could not, however, be made good in this case since, contrary to the submission advanced, the summary of the two cases occupied almost the same number of pages of transcript (fourteen in the case of the defence and thirteen in the case of the prosecution). 
     
      
    89   The submission that the defence case was not adequately put is not made good. His Honour reminded the jury that the appellant had said that he knew nothing about the killings, and that if this remained open as a possibility, then he must be acquitted. They were reminded of the evidence that the appellant and his uncle had given, and of the fact that the focus of the defence case was that there was a rational possibility open that someone other than the appellant was the killer. They were similarly instructed that if this was so they must return a verdict of not guilty. 
    90   His Honour next reminded the jury of the criticisms of the Crown case that had been offered by the defence, to the effect that police had ignored lines of inquiry which had not fitted with their view as to the appellant’s guilt - of which some instances were given concerning the lack of examination of windows, of doors, of shower taps or of the laundry for fingerprints; the omission to test the herringbone pattern in the blood on the garage floor and of the appellant’s clothing; the failure to examine the tools in the garage or the car of Mr. De Gruchy Senior; the conclusion that the wheelbrace found by Mr. Urquhart was irrelevant; the absence of a full forensic examination of the bag found in the dam which contained the note; a suggested inadequacy in testing the bloodied fingerprint on the vanity unit; and suggested inconsistencies in the testing of the hair found in the hand of Adrian De Gruchy. Attention was drawn to the suicide note and to the argument that it was consistent with the existence of a rational possibility that someone other than the appellant was the killer, it also being put that the behaviour of the appellant over the critical period between March and May was consistent with his innocence. 
    91   Earlier in the summing up the jury had been reminded that the appellant had made no admissions, and that an attempt by police to obtain incriminating evidence via a listening device had failed. They had also been reminded of the evidence of good character that had been led, and given an entirely proper direction in relation to it. 
    92   There was in my view no imbalance in the summing up, the defence case having been clearly and comprehensively put. So far as I can see no material point was omitted. The finding of strands of hair in the hands of Adrian De Gruchy was mentioned, and his Honour read to the jury, at the request of Counsel for the appellant, the terms of the certificate given by Professor Aitcheson concerning it. The possible significance of the hair was obvious and there was no reason for his Honour to go into any further detail concerning it. There was no denigration of the defence case, nor in my view, any unfairness arising out of the sequence in which the two cases were summarised. 
     
      
      
     Ground 1 - verdict unreasonable in that it could not be supported on the evidence 
      
    93   As I have observed the Crown case was wholly circumstantial and depended, in summary, upon proof of the following matters: 
     
      
       
       (a) the items taken from the home were not items of value other than a video recorder - in particular the jewel box of Mrs De Gruchy and the wallet of the appellant were not taken - suggesting, it was put, that an attempt was made to fake a ‘robbery’, particularly as the items that were stolen were dumped in the dam; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) the offender removed some carpet from the main bedroom floor, behaviour consistent with an attempt to remove or conceal some piece of physical evidence that might link him to the crimes. 
        
       
      
      
       
       (c) portion of the carpet, and some items taken from the home were dumped in the dam near Woonona, a place that was known to the appellant and that was on the route he took from his home to that of his girlfriend on the night of the killings. 
       
      
      
       
       (d) a tuft of carpet that matched the carpet removed from the bedroom was found in the Toyota of Mrs. De Gruchy containing material the DNA of which was consistent with that of the appellant and inconsistent with any other member of his family; 
       
      
      
       
       (e) the items found in the dam included the very curious note, in the handwriting of the appellant, that contained some items consistent, it was put, with a plan to kill the three deceased  
       who were the only persons named in it 
       , to carry out a number of activities after the killing to remove possibly incriminating evidence from the scene and from his person, and to inflict injuries upon himself so as to create the impression that he had been set upon by robbers.  
       
      
      
       
       (f) the explanation offered by the appellant for the note which had been torn up, it was argued, made no sense whatsoever in so far as it was suggested to be a list of birthday presents or of activities that occurred on his birthday. 
       
      
      
       
       (g) Dr. Cala testified that the fatal injuries could have been caused by implements such as the jack handle and wheelbrace that had been supplied with the Toyota, and which had been removed from it, even though they had not been used since the vehicle had been purchased; 
       
      
      
       
       (h) that vehicle was in the appellant’s possession on 12 and 13 March; 
       
      
      
       
       (i) The body of Adrian was splashed with petrol the obvious source for which was an open Jerrycan which was adjacent to his body, and which bore the appellant’s fingerprints.  
       
      
      
       
       (j) the knob to the cupboard below the vanity unit in the main bathroom bore a left palm print of the appellant, that was located within a smear that may have been blood. 
       
      
      
       
       (k) bloodstains consistent with having come from the appellant, but not from other members of the family, were found on the hallway tiles, and on the wall above and behind the bed of Mrs. De Gruchy; 
       
      
      
       
       (l) the appellant’s assertion that there had been prank phone calls to his mother and his suggestion that, in one such call, the caller had said that “three of your family will be deceased” bore, it was argued, the hallmarks of an invention by him to divert attention to a non existent marauder - particularly as the appellant had made no mention of such a chilling and accurate prophesy when he was interviewed by police on 13 or 17 March, and also because it was curious that such a “threat” should have been confined to three members of a family of five. Moreover, the Crown queried why in the face of such a threat, and the number of anonymous calls that the appellant said were made, he would have left the house, particularly if as he suggested, his mother was concerned about them. 
       
      
      
       
       (m) when the appellant first spoke to Mr Bailey, allegedly immediately after discovering his mother, he said that there was ‘something wrong with Mum and Sarah’, yet on the account he gave to police he could not have known that there was anything wrong with Sarah, since he had not been to her room, and had assumed, when he had first gone into the house, that she had already left for school; 
       
      
      
       
        
       (n) the appellant arrived much later than expected at his girlfriend’s home and it was submitted, had ample opportunity in the time available between 8pm. and 11pm, to carry out the killings, to collect various items at the scene, to drive to the dam to dispose of them, and then to drive on to his girlfriend’s house, a total trip occupying in the order of 28 minutes. 
       
      
    94   It was submitted by the appellant, however, that the various strands in the cable presented by the Crown were not compelling whether considered in isolation or together, and that the verdict was unsafe, being unreasonable or not supported having regard to the evidence. In particular it was submitted that: 
     
      
       
       (a) if the killer had been in the house to steal, then he may have decided not to take items of the kind mentioned either because he did not notice them, or because he was distracted, or because he chose not to take items which could be readily identified; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) there was no evidence of the appellant having sustained any injury on the night of the killing that might have been expected in the course of such a violent series of events, or that could have explained the presence of his blood on the tuft of carpet, or on the hallway or wall, or that could have occasioned him sufficient concern to remove the piece of carpet from the main bedroom; 
       
      
      
       
       (c) there was no evidence of his shoes or clothing being blood stained, and presumptive tests for blood on the steering wheel of the Toyota were negative; 
       
      
      
       
       (d) the jack handle and wheelbrace from the Toyota were never found or linked positively with the killings - any number of similar implements being capable of causing the injuries, including the wheel brace found by Mr. Urquhart some time later in Shearwater Boulevarde, which was not subjected to comparison by Dr. Cala. 
       
      
      
       
       (e) even if the tools from the Toyota had been used as the murder weapons, they could have been removed from the vehicle by someone else; 
       
      
      
       
       (f) off-cuts of the carpet were kept in the garage and were used, from time to time, to carry things in the Toyota to save it from getting dirty - in fact a piece of such carpet had been used the weekend before the killings when the hired carpet cleaner was returned; 
       
      
      
       
       (g) there was no way of determining the age of the blood (if that was what it was) on the tuft of carpet found in the Toyota; 
       
      
      
       
       (h) many other people were familiar with the dam, and there was nothing particular to associate the appellant with it; 
       
      
      
       
       (i) there was nothing surprising in finding the appellant’s fingerprint on the Jerrycan, since on his account, and as confirmed by his father, both of them used it from time to time to fill the cars,  
       
      
      
       
       (j) similarly there was nothing surprising in finding his fingerprints on the surface of a vanity unit in the bathroom of a house where he lived; 
       
      
      
       
       (k) there was an adequate explanation for a robber disposing of the items taken from the house, in so far as it would have been sensible for him or her to get rid of any items that might provide a link to the killings; 
       
      
      
       
       (l) the note found at the dam contained a number of events that did not occur - no bottle or hi fi was thrown down the back, nothing was found in the wall cavity, the appellant had no sign of injury suggestive of him having hit or cut himself, and there seemed to be little point in opening the blinds to see through; 
       
      
      
       
       (m) there was no sensible reason for leaving the list in a torn up state together with other items connected with the murders (rather than destroying it in a more effective way);  
       
      
      
       
       (n) it was possible that the note was already in the bag and was simply swept up by whoever was responsible for the killings, along with the other items taken from the scene; 
       
      
      
       
       (o) the conversation with Mr. Bailey, it was suggested, was explicable by the distraught state in which the appellant was, and by the possibility that he may not have been sure whose body he had seen; 
       
      
      
       
       (p) the appellant had no motive to kill a mother to whom, on the evidence, he was attached, or his brother and sister; 
       
      
      
       
       (q) the hair that was found in the hands of Adrian De Gruchy could not have come from him, because of its length (his hair being 4 cms at its longest, and that found in his hand being 8cms. to 10cms long) and, it was suggested, because it was of a different colour - thereby opening up a possibility that someone other than the appellant was the killer; 
       
      
      
       
       (r) there was nothing unusual in the demeanour of the appellant when seen by Ms Brindley and her mother, although this was at a time when upon the Crown case, he had just committed three terrible crimes; whereas on the following day he reacted in a way, it was submitted, that could only be described as natural and appropriate for a young man who had just discovered that his mother, at least, had been murdered; 
       
      
      
       
       (s) the appellant was shown to be a person of good character, without any prior conviction, who enjoyed a reputation as a young man of gentle disposition; 
       
      
      
       
       (t) no admissions were made by him when interviewed by police and nothing was discovered of an incriminating nature while he was subject to electronic surveillance; 
       
      
      
       
       (u) a number of the items found in the dam were described by his father as having no connection with the appellant’s home - most relevantly the sheet with a striped pattern and the small hammer; 
       
      
      
       
        
       (v) the suicide note left by Mr. Wakehim suggested that its author, now deceased, at least feared being accused of the killings; 
       
      
      
       
       (w) there was no examination of the Toyota for the presence of coal dust or of dirt, of the kind that may have been picked up, had it used the Coal Wash Road that was the only means of public access to the dam. 
       
      
    95   It may be accepted that there were significant arguments for the jury to consider, in determining whether the only rational inference open was that the appellant killed the three deceased. The fact that a jury, properly instructed, came to that conclusion, after having heard and seen the appellant and the other witnesses, after having reviewed the physical exhibits, and after having heard detailed closing addresses as well as a careful and comprehensive summing up from a very experienced trial Judge, is not conclusive of the matter when, on appeal, a S6(I) ground of appeal is raised. This Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence, and in the light of that review, reach its own conclusion as to whether or not a jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt: Jones (1997) 72 ALJR 78. 
    96   In making that assessment, regard may properly be had to the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing the case unfold, particularly when credit issues arise and conflicting evidence is received. However, if at the end of the day, after making due allowance for the extent to which any difficulties apparent in the Crown case might be resolved by reference to that advantage, the Court has a doubt itself as to the guilt of the appellant, then normally it will conclude that such doubt ought to have been entertained also by the jury; 
    97   The most significant factors in favour of the appellant were his unchallenged prior good character; the lack of any apparent motive for him to commit such appalling crimes; the absence of injury or of any sign of abnormal behaviour or distress or anxiety on his part, on the night of 12 March (compared with his apparent reaction the following morning); the presence of hairs in the hand of Adrian De Gruchy, which the defence suggested may have been seized from the head of his assailant; and the finding of some items in the dam that were not positively identified as coming from the De Gruchy home; 
    98   The explanation offered by the Crown concerning the penultimate matter, to the effect that hair previously shed by Adrian, (from a time when his hair was longer) or by his sister (see Dr. Goetz’s evidence noted above) may have been already present on the garage floor and adhered to his bloodied hand, cannot be dismissed as entirely improbable. The photographs of the deceased in situ do not show the hand in which the strands were found to have been clenched. Rather, it was in an open position, palm down, resting on the ground over an upturned chair. To this extent the evidence does not inevitably suggest that the strands were torn from the head of an assailant. 
    99   Another possibility, admittedly unexplored, also remains open - namely that the strands were gathered from the head of Sarah, when she was struck and having adhered to the weapon used upon her, were transported to the garage where Adrian was beaten. Her hair, it would seem from the photos, was a good deal longer than that of Adrian’s, and to have been of a similar colouring. 
    100   So far as a disparity in colouring was suggested to have existed, that depended entirely on Dr. Cala’s description of the recovered strands of hair as having been “dark brown”, and of the hair of Adrian as having been “dark brown-black” - an imprecise distinction with little if any material difference. 
    101   In the end, the evidence concerning the strands was equivocal, since DNA that could have come from either Adrian or Sarah was found in the sample, and it could not be said with any certainty, that the hair inevitably must have come from an assailant who could not have been the appellant. 
    102   The suggested scenario of a thief or thieves having been disturbed, and having attacked the occupants, thereby missing the more valuable items in the house is in my view unconvincing, having regard to the fact that Mrs. De Gruchy and Sarah were obviously killed in their own beds. Equally unconvincing is the suggestion that the thieves deliberately ignored items that may have provided identifiable links to the killings, since the purse of Mrs De Gruchy, the video recorder, and the calculator found in the dam served that purpose. 
    103   While it is true that Miss Brindley, her mother and police did not notice any injuries to the deceased, there seems to be little doubt that he did lose some blood that night in view of the spots of blood found in the hallway and on the wall above Mrs. De Gruchy’s head, and in view of the material found on the tuft of carpet, which although of insufficient size to be presumptively tested for blood (because that would have prevented DNA testing), gave every appearance of being blood. 
    104   There was no occasion for Miss Brindley or her mother to make any detailed observation of the appellant on the night of 12/13 March, nor in the absence of immediate suspicion was he subjected to medical or other examination for possible minor injuries such as a nosebleed or small cut. Moreover, while the tuft in the car could conceivably have got there, and collected the material from which DNA was recovered consistent with that of the appellant, on another occasion, there was no evidence to suggest any such occasion on which he had suffered a cut or other injury, or on which he had lost some bodily fluid that may have provided the source for the DNA. 
    105   The suggestion that robbers might have torn up the note, or placed it and other items such as the clothing, towel and knife, that happened to be mentioned, in the dam, makes little sense. The fact that not all of the steps listed was attended to is of limited significance, since a decision may have been made that they were unnecessary.  
    106   What was important about this list was its authorship, and the references to the three deceased, to steps consistent with a plan to remove possibly incriminating physical evidence from the scene, and to steps consistent with an attempt to manufacture a possible appearance of the appellant having been assaulted 
    107   Apart from the reference to the three deceased, it is significant that against the words ‘tracksuit pants’ appears the numeral ‘1’, against the word ‘knife’ appears the numeral ‘1’, and against the words ‘T-shirts’ appears the numeral ‘2’. Found in the dam in fact were 1 pair of tracksuit pants, 1 knife and 2 T-shirts. Furthermore, among the items listed in the note and found in the dam were a hanky, a towel, and a bottle.  
    108   The appellant was unable to give any explanation in relation to the items concerned with head butting a mirror or bench, or to cutting somewhere with a knife. His explanations to the effect that the references to hitting arms or legs with a pole may have had something to do with guests at his birthday party getting wild with the lanterns that had been placed on bamboo poles to light the garden area or with someone stumbling over, were to my mind absurd - particularly in the light of the added comment that he might have needed to write these things down to remember them, or to render help.  
    109   The explanations given for other items make little better sense. For example, the appellant suggested that the reference to ‘throw bottle (singular) down back’ was a reference to the collection of bottles from the party in a container at the back of the garden, and that the reference to the hi fi, was to a small portable hi fi, that was taken outside where the younger guests had assembled. The item ‘throw things down wall’ was said to be a reference to the placement of baits, for field mice or rats, in the ceiling, a precaution that he said was taken from time to time and repeated just prior to his birthday. In fact, the wall cavities were capped save for one area where there was an opening or inspection point. The “opening of blinds to see through” and of the “gate” were also said to relate to the birthday party, the former to allow people to circulate inside and outside the house, the latter to allow people to see into the house from the Pergola, as well as to look to the outside from the house, “just to keep an eye on people”. Such events are so mundane as not to justify mention or recording in any programme for a planned birthday party. 
    110   The numbers written on the back of the note, the appellant acknowledged, he could not readily explain or remember writing. The “only thing that could come to mind” he suggested was the selection of track numbers on CDs for music at the party - again a somewhat extraordinary answer if the note had in fact been written as a plan for a birthday party held only three months earlier. The reference to “have shower” he suggested may have been a reference to having a shower “when under the influence of alcohol to straighten oneself up” - again an explanation lacking credibility. 
    111   The existence of this note, and the extraordinary explanations or answers given in relation to it, in my view provided powerful evidence for the Crown. The appellant’s evidence, upon the face of the transcript was unimpressive in several other respects. Apart from the significant conflict with Mr. Bailey as to whether he mentioned that there was something wrong with Sarah, he gave accounts that were contradictory either of known facts or of his statement to police as to the items of clothing that had been placed in the overnight bag, as to whether he had been wearing shorts or tracksuit pants, as to whether he had placed a pair of joggers in the bag, and as to whether the prank caller had conveyed a message or had hung up by the time the calls were answered. 
    112   Significantly, he identified a maroon Quicksilver T-shirt as one given to him by a friend some time after the killing, at a time when he could not get access to his own clothes. However, when it became obvious that this was problematic since it had been found in the dam with the other items, it was his explanation that this was “more towards the police” - the clear implication (which he was then reluctant to fully embrace) that they had “planted” it. 
    113   When all of the factors identified by the Crown are taken into consideration, in combination, I am not persuaded that the case is one in which the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. In particular, the combination of the note, the presence of the appellant’s fingerprint on the cabinet door knob, the DNA recovered from the carpet tuft, and from the spots of blood in the hallway and bedroom, the comment to Mr. Bailey about Sarah, the appellant’s unconvincing evidence concerning the note, the absence of any mention to police of the prophesy as to the death of three members of the family, the appearance of a staged robbery, and the finding of the items in a dam with which he was familiar, constituted a powerful circumstantial case. It may also be assumed from the verdict that, having seen and heard the appellant give evidence, the jury were not impressed with his credibility - a conclusion well open to them by reference to the matters I have mentioned. 
    114   In these circumstances I am of the view that the appeals against conviction should be dismissed, and the applications for leave to appeal against sentence refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
     SIMPSON J 
      : 
      
    116   In every respect except one I agree with the analysis of the Chief Judge. The sole point of departure concerns the evidence of the hair clutched in Adrian’s hand, hair that could not have been that of the appellant, and which (by reason of its length, not its DNA composition) was very unlikely to have come from Adrian. I mention this because, absent a satisfactory explanation, I would consider this evidence to be of very considerable significance in the appellant’s favour. Unlike the Chief Judge (paragraph 98) I do regard the explanation proffered by the Crown (that this hair may have already been on the floor and come into contact with Adrian during or after the attack) as so inherently implausible as to warrant rejection. I do not so regard the alternative explanation proposed in paragraph 99. That DNA testing established that the hair could have come from Sarah answers the questions that would otherwise have remained unanswered. Given the events that must have taken place in the house that night, it would not be surprising if some of Sarah’s hair attached to the assailant, who then transferred it to Adrian. The question then is whether the remaining evidence satisfactorily establishes that the appellant was the assailant. The circumstances of which evidence was adduced by the Crown added up to a compelling case establishing that fact. It is unnecessary to reiterate what has been said. Having undertaken the independent analysis of the evidence that is required I am left with no reasonable doubt that the Crown established that the appellant was the killer. 
    117   I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.

       70078/98 - REGINA v RITA ROSE KIRKWOOD 
        
        
       SENTENCE 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: On 3rd November 1999, the prisoner, Rita Rose Kirkwood, was arraigned before me on an indictment charging her with the murder of Edward Szponder on 29th June 1998 at Rutherford. To that charge she pleaded that she was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    2    The prisoner and the deceased had known one another for a period of between four and five years. Not long after meeting they commenced a sexual relationship. They maintained separate homes but the deceased regularly stayed at the prisoner's house. Their relationship was a volatile one. The prisoner's sister, Elizabeth Farley, told the police that the pair tended to fight and argue with each other over petty things. Both were accustomed to drinking substantial quantities of alcohol. The arguments were associated with the occasions when the two were drinking. Ms Farley had not, herself, observed physical violence between the two. However, six months prior to the subject events, the prisoner and the deceased had called to Ms Farley's home. The prisoner had two black eyes. In the presence of the deceased, the prisoner said, ""See what Eddie did?"". The deceased said ""I can't remember, I can't remember"". A month or so later, it appears that there was an incident in which the deceased broke some windows at the prisoner's home. The police were called on this occasion. Ms Farley understood that the deceased had subsequently been ordered by the court not to approach the prisoner's home. 
     
      
    3    Despite their troubled history, the prisoner and the deceased maintained their relationship. The deceased was present at the prisoner's home at 9 Endeavour Street, Rutherford, on 29th June 1998 with her consent. He had spent the previous night there. He had suffered an injury to his lower right leg and heel. His leg was in plaster and he was using a surgical shoe and crutches to get around. 
     
      
    4    In the late afternoon of 29th June, the prisoner and the deceased consumed around one dozen stubbies of beer between the two of them. A little before 10.00pm, the prisoner left the house by taxi to go to the Maitland Leagues Club where she picked up her son, Gary, and Ms Farley. 
     
      
    5    The three returned to the Endeavour Street premises. On arrival, the prisoner took three stubbies of beer from the refrigerator. She sat at the kitchen table with Gary and her sister. The deceased came into the kitchen from the bedroom. It appears that he was in an argumentative frame of mind. He accused the prisoner of spending all his money. She believed that he was angry because there was no beer left for him. He was verbally abusive calling the prisoner a ""slut"" and the like. Gary told him not to abuse his mother and he made to strike at the deceased. The blow did not connect. The deceased responded by picking up a stool which he threw at the prisoner. The stool is depicted in photograph 18 which forms part of Ex A. It is of metal construction. It did not hit the prisoner. She picked it up and threw it back at the deceased. It struck the deceased on the plaster on his leg. He crossed the room and removed a knife some 12"" in length from a drawer near the sink. He held the knife in his right hand. The prisoner said, ""Put the knife down and don't be stupid. I can play the same game"". She walked over to the deceased and took the knife from him. She took hold of the knife by the blade causing a minor injury to her hand. The prisoner was at this time standing in front of the deceased. She poked the knife at the chest of the deceased. In so doing, she stabbed him. He sustained a single wound to the chest. The knife passed between the third and fourth ribs through the upper lobe of his lung and into his pericardium. The depth of the wound track was 15cm. 
     
      
    6    Ms Farley, who was present throughout the incident, did not see any obvious stabbing movement. She saw the deceased walk backwards into the lounge room holding his stomach. Gary picked up the knife and said ""Look mum there's blood on it"". Ms Farley went into the lounge room and found the deceased lying on the floor. Gary attempted to resuscitate the deceased. The prisoner came into the lounge room and felt the deceased’s face saying, ""Don't be silly, come on, talk to me"". Ms Farley said to her, ""Rita, he's dead, honestly he's dead"". The accused went into the kitchen. She was crying and saying, ""I'm sorry"". 
     
      
    7    The prisoner is a part-Aboriginal woman aged sixty-three years. She had little formal schooling. Her father was a bullock driver and timber cutter. The family led an itinerant life. They did not have a permanent home but travelled with the father camping out. The life was a rough one but the prisoner's parents were loving and she reports fond memories of her childhood. 
     
      
    8    In 1954, the prisoner married Geoff Fletcher. The couple had seven children. The surviving children range in age from 28 to 45 years. In 1972, one of the prisoner's sons, a child age 4, died tragically in a car accident. Another of her sons, Stanley, was severely injured in that accident. In the same year, the prisoner's mother died. The combination of these losses led to the prisoner's admission to a psychiatric hospital for six months in 1972. 
     
      
    9    The prisoner's marriage broke up in 1975. She and her husband had maintained their relationship for a number of years for the sake of the children. One of the pressures contributing to the strain on the relationship was the prisoner's dependence on alcohol. She had commenced drinking alcohol in a regular way when aged 20. It has been a problem throughout her adult life. 
     
      
    10    Following the marriage break-up, the prisoner formed a de facto relationship with a man named Eric Kirkwood. Her son, Gary, was the product of this union. In 1984, Gary was injured in a motor vehicle accident. He sustained brain damage and developed epilepsy following the accident. Gary is now aged 24. He lives with the prisoner. 
     
      
    11    In 1989, the prisoner's son, Stanley, died. It appears that his early death was the result of the significant injuries he had suffered in the 1972 motor vehicle accident. 
     
      
    12    Eric Kirkwood was apparently a loving partner and the relationship was a happy one. In the early 1990’s, Mr Kirkwood developed cancer of the bladder. Ultimately, he came to require full-time nursing care and he was placed in a nursing home. The prisoner visited him daily until his death in 1994. 
     
      
    13    The death of Mr Kirkwood left the prisoner feeling lonely and distressed. In 1995, she met the deceased at a club. They commenced their sexual relationship shortly thereafter. The deceased came to spend more and more time at the prisoner's home. This was not entirely welcome. The prisoner was worried that her social security entitlement might be adversely affected should she be seen to be living with the deceased. She tried to discuss these concerns with him and to encourage him to spend a few days at a time at his own home. He would return to the prisoner's home during the night when affected by alcohol and start banging loudly on the door. 
     
      
    14    Neither Geoff Fletcher nor Eric Kirkwood are described as having been heavy drinkers. Although the prisoner had a problem with alcohol dependence throughout these years, her domestic life appears to have been a settled one. The pattern changed during her relationship with the deceased. He too was a heavy drinker. Together they might consume two casks of wine and a substantial quantity of beer in a session. They would drink whenever they had the money. The deceased was described by the prisoner as a nice man when sober. When he was drunk it would seem that he became verbally and emotionally abusive. There were episodes of physical violence. When the deceased hit the prisoner she would hit back. Ms Barbara Aldrich, psychologist, assessed the prisoner and prepared a report dated 30th November 1999 which I found helpful. Ms Aldrich said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Rita reports that Eddy was verbally and emotionally abusive of her and that their relationship often degenerated into violence on both sides. She says that he left her 'all nervy' and distressed with his accusations of infidelity and his verbal abuse. She said several times she hit him because he abused her. She says she has never hit anyone else and I saw no evidence that she was a vicious, aggressive or spiteful woman."" 
         (Ex 2 report 30/11/99 p7) 
        
       
      
    15    I accept that the prisoner is not a woman prone to violence. Ms Aldrich described the prisoner as presenting as a likeable and friendly woman who appeared to be of borderline to mildly intellectually disabled. She recommended that the prisoner be assessed by a neuropsychologist to ascertain the degree, if any, of cognitive impairment. The sentence proceedings were adjourned to enable this to be done. 
     
      
    16    The prisoner was assessed by Ms Hendy, consultant neuropsychologist. Ms Hendy noted that the prisoner presented as a friendly and likeable woman who was cooperative throughout the assessment. She observed that the prisoner was a poor historian who had great difficulty explaining herself. Her descriptions of events were very concrete and filled with irrelevant detail and it was difficult to extract salient points from her. The assessment established that the prisoner functions at the upper end of the mildly intellectually impaired range. Functionally, she is illiterate. Her mathematical skills were equally rudimentary. Ms Hendy expressed this opinion which I accept: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mrs Kirkwood is a woman of naturally limited intellectual abilities who is now showing some subtle features of changes to her abilities brought about by prolonged alcohol abuse. I do not think that these would be the explanation for the events that occurred in 1998. It is probably more the case that Mrs Kirkwood has been all her life dependent on others to help her get by in the world. She had neither the literacy skills nor the intellectual abilities to cope with any but the most basic activities of daily living. From her history it appears that she may have become dependent on having a man around who could manage these things for her and in return she provided domestic support."" 
         (Ex 5 report 1/2/00 p5) 
        
       
      
    17    Mr Austin, who appeared on behalf of the prisoner, invited me to impose a non-custodial sentence in this case. It was his submission that the objective circumstances of the offence place it towards the lower end of the continuum of seriousness for manslaughter offences involving the use of a knife. The incident was precipitated by the deceased's abusive behaviour towards the prisoner including the throwing of the metal stool at her. It was the deceased who took the knife from the drawer and commenced to wave it about in the context of addressing abuse and recriminations to the prisoner. The prisoner's action in taking the knife from him and poking it at him was an impulsive one. 
     
      
    18    The Crown accepted the plea upon the basis that the wielding of the knife was an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    19    In addition, Mr Austin pointed to a number of subjective features which, in combination, he submitted made this case exceptional such as to justify the course which he urged. He placed reliance on (i) the prisoner's intellectual limitations, (ii) her medical problems, (iii) her role as the carer for her son Gary, (iv) her age and generally creditable life, (v) her plea and (vi) her Aboriginality. It is appropriate that I deal with each of these considerations. 
     
      
    20    The prisoner suffers from an intellectual handicap. I accept that she is at the upper end of the mildly intellectually impaired range. I consider that this feature operates to significantly mitigate her culpability for the offence. I propose to give less weight to considerations of general deterrence than might otherwise be appropriate for the reasons that were explained in R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Letteri (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 March 1992); and R v Wright (unreported, NSWCCA, 28 February 1997). 
     
      
    21    The prisoner suffers from a number of health problems. Reports prepared by Dr Singh Ubeja and Dr Chahl were tendered on her behalf. The prisoner has been a patient at the Greenhills Medical Practice at which Dr Ubeja has had rooms for the past eighteen years. She has been attending Dr Ubeja for eight years. He notes that she suffers from chronic lower back pain. This is due to a prolapsed lumbar disc causing lateral canal stenosis at L4/5. She also suffers severe right-sided sciatica. She has gout which is aggravated by her failure to take medication and her alcohol consumption. She has been a smoker for many years and now has chronic obstructive airways disease. She has diffused degenerative osteoarthritis. This mainly involves her knee and hip. It is of such severity that, at times, she finds it difficult to move and to carry out ordinary activities. 
     
      
    22    Dr Chahl's report of 16th December 1999 serves to underline the problems the prisoner has had associated with the osteoarthritic condition. On 24th September 1999, when Dr Chahl saw the prisoner, she presented with pain and swelling of the right knee. An x-ray was ordered and she was placed on Naprosyn. The x-ray confirmed a large effusion on the knee. X-rays also showed enlargement of the heart. By 4th November 1999, the knee showed signs of improvement and the prisoner was able to walk without the aid of crutches. 
     
      
    23    Dr Ubeja reports that the prisoner has been negligent as to her health and that she has tended not to be compliant with treatment regimes. Dr Chahl observes that the problems associated with the discovery of the enlargement of the prisoner's heart were not addressed in consultation with him. She does not appear to have returned for treatment since 4th November 1999. The failure to follow up medical treatment as advised may perhaps be explained by the prisoner's limitations. She has also been prone to anxiety following her arrest with respect to this matter. She was placed on antidepressants by Dr Ubeja in mid-1998 at a time when he observed her to be extremely distressed over this pending court case. 
     
      
    24    The significance of the prisoner's health problems to the exercise of my discretion with respect to sentence is as explained by the Court in R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351. At p 353, the Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is obvious that imprisonment will always impose physical and emotional hardships and deprivation upon the person imprisoned. But there can be cases where that hardship and deprivation would be particularly aggravated by matters subjective to the prisoner and that is a proper consideration to be taken into account by a sentencing judge."" 
        
       
      
    25    I consider that, having regard to this prisoner's age and the constellation of health problems, particularly her severe osteoarthritis, means that imprisonment will inevitably fall more harshly on her than it would on others. This is a proper matter for me to take into account and I propose to do so. 
     
      
    26    I turn now to the question of the prisoner's role as the carer for her handicapped son, Gary. The evidence touching on this topic is found in the pre-sentence report of Mr Haggerty of the Maitland Probation and Parole Service and in Ms Aldrich's report. Gary sustained some degree of brain damage in consequence of the 1984 car accident. This has left him developmentally delayed. He also suffers from epileptic fits. The prisoner told Ms Aldrich that Gary is unable to function independently in the community. There is no other evidence as to the extent of Gary's difficulties or the impact that his mother's imprisonment might be expected to have on him. On the material available, I accept that it will cause hardship. However, I do not consider that the circumstances of this case are so highly exceptional as to permit me to refrain from imposing a custodial sentence on this account; R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. 
     
      
    27    Both Ms Aldrich and Ms Hendy express concerns that the prisoner presents a risk of self-harm in the event of a sentence of imprisonment. Ms Aldrich deals perceptively with this in paragraph 5 of page 6 of her report. I accept what she says in this regard. Again, I do not consider that I can depart from the imposition of a custodial sentence in consequence of this consideration. However, it is a matter which I propose to take into account in the same way as the matters I have already noted concerning her poor physical health. 
     
      
    28    The prisoner has a minor criminal record disclosing drink driving offences, consistent with her admitted long-standing alcohol problems, and one minor offence of dishonesty committed almost thirty years ago in respect of which she was fined $20. I approach this matter upon the basis that she has no relevant criminal history. She is a woman of sixty-three who has given birth to eight children. Mr Haggerty reports that she is described as having been a good mother and a caring person. Ms Aldrich's report reinforces that view. I accept it. Despite her intellectual limitations and long-standing addiction to alcohol, she has managed to raise her children well and to provide ongoing support for Gary. She is entitled to credit for this. 
     
      
    29    She is also entitled to credit for her plea of guilty. 
     
      
    30    I was informed by Mr Austin that the prisoner is part-Aboriginal. The Crown conceded that to be the case. There was no evidence going to this aspect. I do not see that the considerations with which Wood J was concerned in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 have application in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    31    I have given close consideration to the submission that I impose a non-custodial sentence. The fact that it was the deceased who initiated the tragic events of this evening by his abusive behaviour, in combination with the various subjective matters to which I have referred, favour a significant measure of leniency in this case. However, I am conscious of the observations of the Court in R v MacDonald (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). I bear in mind that the respondent to the appeal in that case was described by a psychiatrist as a person with limited intellectual capacity and as being of dull intelligence. The Court there observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In a case such as the present, it is important to bear in mind the denunciatory role of sentencing. Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life and certainly safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system."" 
        
       
      
    32    It does not seem to me that this case falls within the exceptional class of case in which a non-custodial sentence is appropriate upon a conviction for manslaughter. 
     
      
    33    The sentence which I propose reflects the strong subjective circumstances of this case and the fact that the prisoner was reacting impulsively to a stressful situation created by the deceased. 
     
      
    34    The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this was a case in which I would find special circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. I consider that the prisoner's intellectual and health difficulties taken together with the fact that at sixty-three she will for the first time be serving a sentence of imprisonment constitute special circumstances for the purposes of s 5(2). I propose to impose an additional term that exceeds the minimum term by more than one-third. 
     
      
    35    Rita Rose Kirkwood, I sentence you to a minimum term of 12 months imprisonment. That sentence will date from today and will expire on 2nd March 2001. I specify an additional term of 18 months which will commence on 3rd March 2001 and expire on 2nd September 2002.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J : 
       
      I have had the advantage of reading the judgment in draft form of Simpson J and gratefully adopt her sketch of the background to this appeal. I do not wish to add to what she has written concerning the alternative ground of appeal which was sought to be supported by reference to s 165 of the Evidence Act and  
     R v Birks 
      1990 19 NSWLR 677. 
      
       
      
     2     
     Grounds 1 and 2 are inter-related in the sense that both focus upon the omission to disclose that the witness Reynolds received a benefit by way of leniency in sentencing proceedings deriving from assistance which he had rendered, and was rendering to police. That benefit flowed from the content of a “letter of comfort” signed by two detective sergeants (one of whom was Detective Sergeant Bandouvakis, the informant in the case against the appellant) dated 23 September 1993 and tendered as Exhibit G before Nield DCJ who dealt with Reynolds for his offences. Reynolds was on 30 September 1993 sentenced to imprisonment for nine months to be served by way of periodic detention. Although the recording of his Honour’s remarks on sentence has since been destroyed, a notation probably made by the Crown representative present in Court at the time has survived and reads: 
      
       
        
         
         “Save for prior good character, rehabilitation and Exhibit G would have imposed full time gaol”. 
         
        
       
      
     3     
     It is plain from unchallenged affidavit material presented in this Court that, had the Crown Prosecutor at the appellant’s trial, which did not commence until 10 August 1998, been aware of the content of the letter of comfort he would have disclosed it to the defence. The essential issue now is whether the absence of communication of the fact that assistance to police was one factor in gaining leniency for Reynolds demonstrates miscarriage of justice in the appellant’s trial. 
      
       
      
     4     
     An affidavit by counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial (who did not appear in the appeal) referred to reading documents in August 1999. About this he affirmed: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was only when I received these documents that I first became aware that Mr Reynolds was in fact a police informer, and had provided assistance to the police and that Detective Bandouvakis had prepared a letter to the presiding judge to assist Mr Reynolds in relation to his sentence proceedings.” 
         
        
       
      
     5     
     Whilst that evidence is accepted, and without debating whether Reynolds as a primary witness was a police informer in respect of whom the guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions explicitly applied, it was obvious that Reynolds was assisting police in the current matter in the sense that he was giving evidence against the appellant. Reynolds’ record of convictions was disclosed to the defence.  
      
       
      
     6     
     In written submissions on behalf of the appellant it was stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “In short, the defence case was that each car had been acquired from Reynolds in the condition in which it was sold. If the vehicles had been converted or ‘rebirthed’ the conversion occurred prior to the transfer of the property from Reynolds to the appellant. By implication (at least) it was the defence case that Reynolds was the true villain.” 
         
        
       
      
     7     
     It was acknowledged that it was never directly put in cross examination that Reynolds had performed the conversions but there were unmistakably sinister implications in cross examination suggesting that, at the relevant time, he possessed stamps which could be used for the purpose of stamping engine and chassis numbers; that such stamps were never produced to police; that at the time of the offences alleged against the appellant he had severe financial difficulties; that his car yard was capable of holding a number of vehicles; that there were discrepancies in log books he was required to keep relating to the sale and disposal of the cars; and that during the time he conducted the wrecking business he had used the stamps to place engine and chassis numbers upon certain vehicles, in particular Ford motor cars, and that this process was “not easy”. The vehicles involved in the charges against the appellant were Ford motor vehicles. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The perception of possible miscarriage is confined to a limited aspect of cross examination of Reynolds referrable to general credit rather than to the facts of the case. The possible significance of such cross examination should be assessed in the context of the overall evidence. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The five subject vehicles were stolen in the western part of the State at or near Dubbo. The appellant lived at Dubbo. Reynolds operated his car yard at Yennora in Sydney. Although the cross examination of Reynolds conveyed the implications referred to above, the challenge to Reynolds’ evidence as to fact lay essentially in a contradiction between his testimony that all but one of the cars supplied to the appellant were in undriveable condition; and in the appellant’s unsworn statement that they were all driveable when he received them. 
      
       
      
     10     
     It was common ground however that no vehicle was in registration when it passed from Reynolds to the appellant, but all five “reborn” vehicles were in fact registered by the time they were sold to purchasers. (Four vehicles were sold by the appellant and the fifth vehicle was sold by his wife). 
      
       
      
     11     
     The pattern of movement from non-registered status to registered vehicle in each case is supportive of the conclusion that the metamorphoses involved in the rebirth of the vehicles were simultaneous with the changes in registration status, i.e. when they were in the possession of the appellant. 
      
       
      
     12     
     As has been pointed out, trial counsel had also appeared for the appellant at committal proceedings when Reynolds was cross examined. It is true that it did not emerge in the evidence at committal proceedings that the assistance to police had been a factor in gaining leniency for Reynolds. There was nevertheless extensive cross examination about the relationship between Reynolds and investigators. That cross examination took place on 23 June 1994. It included exploration of matters in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And when did the police first speak to you in relation to the matters of Mr Grey? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was brought in for a statement in January this year. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In January of this year? 
         
        
        
         
         A. This year yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did they speak to you about Mr Grey’s matters before January 1994? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They had, I couldn’t give you dates on, on when it had happened and not specifically Mr Grey they had asked me matters of the vehicles certainly before then. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. About the vehicles? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah the vehicles that were tagged in the police book. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it only in relation to the five vehicles that the prosecutor has referred you to in evidence today or were you asked by police about a whole host of vehicles? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I have been asked about many vehicles, there were vehicles that I was charged with, that happened in between February ’92 and March ’92. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. They were the vehicles you were charged in relation to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well now how many vehicles were involved in the matters that you were charged with? 
         
        
        
         
         A. There were eight vehicles. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Eight vehicles? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm.” 
         
        
       
      
     13     
     And later in his cross examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Were you spoken to by the police in respect of any other matters where you may have been charged but you were not charged? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Where I may have been charged? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes, there were other instances where involving motor vehicles or breaches of regulations that, that you breached that you could have been charged but you weren’t charged you were only charged with the matters that you’ve appeared before the court for? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t quite understand the question, if you’re saying have I done other things that were wrong? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’m sure I have in relation to my books but -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In relation to other motor vehicles? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’ve been a police witness on other occasions, I’ve had basically in a similar situation someone else had done something and I was just a -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. A witness as you are now? 
         
        
        
         
         A. As I am now. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So how many times have you been a witness and how many cases have you been involved in? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I was involved in one in Goulburn when I first started, I was involved in my own case where I was convicted and this one. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Any other cases in the future that you’ve anticipated with-- 
         
        
        
         
         A. I certainly hope not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see I put this to you that in relation to the silver Fairlane that Mr Grey went down to collect that vehicle and buy it off you and there were no number plates fitted to the vehicle? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right yep the number plates were at that time held by the police. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. For the silver Fairlane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because those number plates were on one of the vehicles that I was charged with. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There is when Mr Grey went down to purchase it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. There were no number plates on the vehicle that’s right.” 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     Insofar as the material upon which it is desired that Reynolds be cross examined as to credit is fresh or new evidence the tests articulated in  
     Mickelberg v The Queen 
      1988 167 CLR 259 are relevant. In the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ @ 301 their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The underlying rationale for a court of criminal appeal setting aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice: see e.g.  
         Gallagher v The Queen 
          1986 160 CLR 392 @ pp 395, 402, 410. There is no miscarriage of justice in the failure to call evidence at trial if that evidence was then available, or, with reasonable diligence, could have been available: see  
         Ratten v The Queen 
          1974 131 CLR 510 @ pp 516-517, per Barwick CJ noting however, that there may be somewhat greater latitude in the case of criminal trials than in the case of civil trials. See also  
         Lawless v The Queen 
          1979 142 CLR 659, at pp 666, 675-677. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ‘credible’, ‘cogent’, ‘relevant’, ‘plausible’: see e.g.  
         Gallagher 
          1986 160 CLR at pp 395-396, 401-402, 408-409;  
         Craig v The King 
          1933 49 CLR 429 at p 439;  
         Ratten 
          1974 131 CLR at pp 519-520;  
         Lawless 
          1979 142 CLR at pp 671, 676-677. In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it ( 
         Gallagher 
          1986 160 CLR at p 410 per Brennan J) or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ‘a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]’ ( 
         Gallagher 
          1986 160 CLR at p 399 per Gibbs CJ and per Mason and Deane JJ) 1986 160 CLR at p 402.” 
         
        
       
      
     15     
     Given the availability of Reynolds to be cross examined at committal proceedings and the examples of the thrust of cross examination set out above; to which might be added the explicit knowledge that Reynolds had been charged, convicted and sentenced; with great respect to the contrary view, I find it hard to postulate that reasonable diligence would not have detected that Reynolds had sought and obtained some favourable consideration for his assistance to authority in his own sentencing proceedings. The precise detail of the content of the letter of comfort may have required a judicial order in order to enable access, but the circumstance that benefit for assistance was granted was not subject to any inhibition from disclosure.  
      
       
      
     16     
     Whether ground 2 be regarded as made out or not, it remains to consider whether the inability to utilize the relevant information because of its non disclosure has led to miscarriage. In the context of the factual evidence pointing towards the guilt of the appellant, I am unable to conclude that the addition of one additional factor to the many others addressed to the central Crown witness gives rise to a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The appeal should be dismissed.

        REGINA v Anthony Stephen GREY 
        
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
      
     19     
     On 26 August 1998 following a trial by jury in the District Court the appellant was convicted on five counts of stealing motor vehicles and four counts of disposing of stolen motor vehicles. The indictment also contained five counts of receiving stolen motor vehicles as alternatives to the stealing charges, but, having regard to the verdicts on the principal charges it was unnecessary for verdicts to be taken on the alternatives. 
      
       
      
     20     
     On 30 October 1998 Rummery DCJ sentenced the appellant on each count on which he was convicted to a total term of penal servitude for five years, made up of a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years, all sentences to be served concurrently. The appellant appeals the convictions. He has abandoned an application for leave to appeal against the sentences. 
      
       
      
     21     
     The Crown case was that the appellant (with, to a more limited extent, his de facto wife, who was jointly charged with him) was involved in the systematic theft and re-constitution (colloquially called re-birthing) of Ford motor vehicles, and their subsequent re-sale. All offences were alleged to have been committed over a period between April and November 1992, in and around Dubbo in the central west of NSW. In part, the Crown presented its case on a circumstantial basis, relying on the doctrine of recent possession. The appellant did not dispute having had possession, or having disposed, of the vehicles in their converted state. He denied stealing them, converting them, or knowing that they had been stolen. He claimed that he had received four of the vehicles, in driveable condition, from Leon Reynolds and had purchased the fifth vehicle and given it to Reynolds to repair.  
      
       
      
     22     
     Reynolds was an important, even critical, Crown witness in relation to each count in the indictment. His evidence was to the effect that in 1992 he ran a motor vehicle wrecking yard in Yennora and that during that year he had sold a number of wrecked vehicles to the appellant. He said these were not in driveable condition at the time of sale. It was the Crown case that the appellant used parts from these vehicles to re-constitute the stolen vehicles. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Reynolds was extensively cross-examined by counsel for the appellant at trial, apparently with the intention of establishing in the jury’s mind the reasonable possibility that he, not the appellant, was responsible for the thefts and the conversions, and that the appellant had innocently acquired the vehicles from him and disposed of them. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The lines of the dispute were therefore clearly drawn, and drawn in such a way that Reynolds’ credibility was a serious and important issue. He himself had pleaded guilty in 1993 to a series of charges of a similar nature and had been sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. So much was known to the appellant’s legal advisers, and was used by them in cross-examination on the issue of his credibility. What was not known to the appellant’s legal advisers was that in his sentencing proceedings the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Bandouvakis, had provided to the Court a letter outlining assistance that Reynolds had given, both in admitting his own guilt, but also, importantly, in relation to police inquiries into  
      
       
        
         
         “the activities of a group in the central west of this State, involving the theft and the conversion of Ford motor vehicles, on a widespread basis.” 
         
        
        
       Detective Bandouvakis was the informant in the charges against the appellant.  
        
       
      
     25     
     An available inference from the passage extracted above is that the investigation to which reference was made was the investigation which resulted in the present charges. 
      
       
      
     26     
     Reynolds was sentenced by Judge Nield on 30 September 1993. Although his Honour’s remarks on sentence have, apparently, never been transcribed and the tapes have been destroyed, the Crown Prosecutor’s note taken at the time of sentence records that the Judge ordered that the Bandouvakis’ letter be placed in a sealed envelope and that, but for the contents of the letter, Reynolds would have been sentenced to a term of full-time custody. Plainly, therefore, Reynolds received, with the support of the prosecution authorities, a very significant benefit resulting from the information he gave Detective Bandouvakis.  
      
       
      
     27     
     By grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal the appellant asserts that, as a result of the ignorance in his legal representatives of the existence of the Bandouvakis letter and the benefit received by Reynolds, an important matter relating to Reynolds’ credibility was not put before the jury. Although one ground, as framed, attributes blame to the “prosecuting authorities” for failure to bring the existence of the letter to the appellant or his lawyers, this can be disposed of quickly. In an affidavit sworn for the purpose of the appeal the Crown Prosecutor at the trial disclaimed any knowledge of the letter and said that if he had known of it he would have told the appellant’s counsel about it. Detective Bandouvakis clearly knew of the letter, and he was the informant on the record in the appellant’s trial; but it must be remembered that the letter was written and used in 1993, and the appellant’s trial was in 1998. No reason for the long delay was disclosed in the material before this Court but fairness precludes any conclusion that the non-disclosure of the letter at the appellant’s trial occurred by reason of some  
     mala fides 
      on the part of anybody to do with the prosecution. The most likely reason for its non-disclosure, on the material now available, is that the passage of time rendered its significance less obvious. I would not attribute any actual impropriety to anybody involved in the prosecution of the appellant. 
      
       
      
     28     
     That conclusion does not, however, have the necessary consequence that no miscarriage of justice occurred. A miscarriage of justice can occur accidentally, or without any fault on the part of any individual. Having considered all of the material, I am of the view that the appellant has demonstrated that such a miscarriage occurred. The existence of the letter, and the advantage derived by Reynolds as a result were important relevant matters affecting Reynolds’ credibility which should have been known to the appellant’s counsel at trial. Had they been known to counsel, they could, and would, have been put before the jury, and may have affected the jury’s acceptance of Reynold’s evidence.  
      
       
      
     29     
     For the purpose of the argument the Court was provided with extracts of guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning aspects of prosecution policy. These guidelines have been made public by publication in  
     Criminal Law 
      (NSW) (Watson, Blackmore, Hosking) and contain the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “11. … 
         
        
        
         
          Prosecutors are under a continuing obligation to make full disclosure to the accused of all facts and circumstances and the identity of all witnesses reasonably to be regarded as relevant to any issue likely to arise at trial. Tactical considerations are not to be taken into account when making that assessment. … 
         
        
        
         
         16. The Office [of the DPP] maintains an index of informers. An informer is a person (not being a victim or a primary witness) who has given assistance to police or investigators as a consequence of knowledge that has come into his or her possession through direct personal contact with the alleged offender. … 
         
        
        
         
          With the assistance of the Office index the accused should be informed in advance of the trial of: 
         
        
        
         
          (a) the informer’s criminal record; 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) whether or not the Police Service or Corrective Services have any information which might assist in evaluating the informer’s credibility, particularly as to: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (i) motivation, 
         
        
        
         
          (ii) … 
         
        
        
         
          (iii) … 
         
        
        
         
          (iv) … 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (v) the extent to which public officers have given evidence or written reports on behalf of the informer (eg to courts, Parole Board); 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) whether any monetary or other benefit has been claimed, offered or provided; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (d) … 
         
        
        
         
          (e) … 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) whether any discount on sentence has been given for assistance in the matter; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (b) … 
         
        
        
         
          …” 
         
        
       
      
     30     
     It will be observed that an informer is defined as a person who has given assistance to police or investigators, but that the definition excludes a victim or a primary witness. Since Reynolds was a primary witness it may well be thought that he was not, strictly speaking, an informer for the purpose of the guideline. This is, in any event, of little significance, because the guidelines do not give any enforceable right to any person. They are, however, relevant in the consideration of whether, in accordance with prosecution policy, the Bandouvakis letter ought, in the ordinary course, to have been disclosed to the defence. Prima facie, as a matter of prosecution policy, as well as of fairness, the letter should have been disclosed. It contained information which might have assisted in evaluating Reynolds’ credibility and, except for the fine distinction between “informers” and “witnesses”, would have fitted neatly into the guideline. Even leaving aside guideline 16, guideline 11 is relevant, and would ordinarily require disclosure of a letter as significant as that here in question. 
      
       
      
     31     
     Moreover, pursuant to s 14 of the  
     Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, 
      separate guidelines have been issued to police in relation to disclosure by police to the Office of the DPP of information and material additional to briefs of evidence provided. These guidelines require police to notify the DPP of the existence of, and where requested, to disclose all documentation, material and other information, including that concerning any proposed witness, which might be of relevance to either the prosecution or the defence.  
      
       
      
     32     
     Of course, guidelines cannot be treated as prescriptive in the same sense as a statute might prescribe procedures, non compliance with which might have specific legal consequences. The DPP guidelines are precisely what they are called - guidelines. They are designed to ensure the fair conduct of criminal prosecutions. They do not create any enforceable right in any individual. But they do provide a useful touchstone, both of what fairness requires, and of what an accused person might expect by way of disclosure from those involved in the prosecution. The guidelines which I have extracted show, in my opinion, what ordinary notions of fairness would in any event suggest: that, had those involved in the prosecution of the appellant been conscious of the existence of the letter, and of the benefit Reynolds received, and had they complied with the obligations suggested in the guidelines, the Bandouvakis letter would have been disclosed to the appellant, and his legal advisers would have been in a position to make use of it in cross-examination of Reynolds. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Counsel for the appellant referred also to the rules of the NSW Bar Association concerning the duties of prosecutors who hold practising certificates issued by the Bar Association. A Crown Prosecutor who is a barrister is bound to observe those rules, the sanction for non-compliance potentially being disciplinary action under the  
     Legal Profession Act 1987 
     : s 57D(4). The rules include the following: 
      
       
        
         
         ”62. A prosecutor must assist the court to arrive at the truth, must seek impartially to have the whole of the relevant evidence placed intelligibly before the court, and must seek to assist the court with adequate submissions of law to enable the law properly to be applied to the facts.  
         
        
        
         
          … 
         
        
        
         
         66. A prosecutor must disclose to the opponent as soon as practicable all material available to the prosecutor or of which the prosecutor becomes aware which constitutes evidence relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused, unless such disclosure, or full disclosure, would seriously threaten the integrity of the administration of justice in those proceedings or the safety of any person.” 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     These rules, like the guidelines, do not confer on any accused person any directly enforceable right. They, too, are relevant to a proper evaluation of the fairness of the trial as it took place, and to what the appellant was entitled to expect from the prosecution by way of disclosure. 
      
       
      
     35     
     The fundamental question which emerges from all the guidelines and rules, and, independently, from ordinary notions of fairness, is whether the undisclosed document could be said to have had sufficient relevance to a material issue in the proceedings. The material issue was Reynolds’ credibility. As I have said his evidence was important, if not critical, to the prosecution case, given the issues as they emerged. The fact that he gave to the police information about the very matters with which the appellant was charged, resulting in a reduction in his own sentence, was highly relevant to his credibility. Having given the information in 1993, he was obliged at the risk of himself being re-sentenced; to maintain his position when the appellant was tried:  
     Criminal Appeal Act 1912,  
     s 5DA. I am of the view that the unavailability to the defence of the evidence might have caused the appellant to lose a fair chance of acquittal:  
     R v Mraz (No.1)  
     1955 93 CLR 493. 
      
       
      
     36     
     The Crown, however, argued that the letter amounted to new evidence (drawing a distinction between fresh evidence and new evidence) and that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence on the part of the appellant’s legal representatives at and prior to trial, it would have been disclosed, and that, accordingly, he is not now entitled to rely upon it. The appellant was represented by the same experienced counsel at committal (which was contested) and at trial. During the course of cross-examination of Reynolds at committal the appellant’s counsel elicited Reynolds’ own prior convictions, including the convictions for offences of a nature similar to those with which the appellant was charged. He also elicited the fact that Reynolds had given evidence for the prosecution on other occasions. The Crown argument was that the answers given by him to those questions should have alerted defence counsel to the possibility, or probability, that Reynolds had received support from police in return for his assistance and that, therefore counsel should have made, or should have caused to be made, the necessary enquiries as a result of which the letters would in all likelihood have been divulged. I do not accept this reasoning. First, the questions and answers in the committal do not bear the character the Crown now wishes to give them. When a question was put to Reynolds that might be interpreted (with a good degree of generosity) as asking on how many occasions he had been a police witness in relation to motor vehicles he answered: 
      
       
        
         
         “I’ve been a police witness on other occasions, I’ve had basically in a similar situation someone else had done something and I was just a …” 
         
        
       
      
     37     
     He was then asked on how many occasions he had been a witness and how many cases he had been involved in and his answer was:  
      
       
        
         
         “Well, I was involved in one in Goulburn when I first started, I was in my own case where I was convicted and this one.” 
         
        
       
      
     38     
     I do not agree that these answers should have signalled to the appellant’s counsel that enquiries ought be made as to any benefit Reynolds received for the information he gave in relation to the investigation into the offences with which the appellant was charged. The offences were non specific, tending to suggest (so far as they can be said to have any precision) that Reynolds had given evidence in relation to other matters. The benefit he received on sentence was expressly in recognition of the information (and evidence) that he gave in relation to the charges against the appellant. It may be that the appellant’s legal representatives could have issued a subpoena for production of the District Court file, in order to ascertain whether Reynolds had received any benefit on sentencing; but some limits ought to be applied to the assessment of what speculative steps should have keen taken. The answers extracted do not reasonably suggest a line of inquiry and I do not believe that the failure to pursue any possible advantage given to Reynolds in any way reflects on the appellant’s then lawyers, or ought now to preclude reliance on the present ground. 
      
       
      
     39     
     A second part of the reasoning which I do not accept is that appropriate enquiries would or might have drawn out the existence of the letter. It is not at all clear what enquiries the appellant’s legal representatives might have made based on the answers extracted. Since there was insufficient in the answers to suggest that he had received a benefit  
     in relation to the present charges 
     , there was no reason for the appellant’s lawyers to have sought access to the material relevant to his sentencing. In any case, the primary obligation lay on the prosecution to disclose the letter, not upon the appellant’s lawyers to engage in a complicated detective exercise. The concession that the failure to disclose the letter might have resulted from an understandable oversight on the part of those involved in the prosecution in no way diminishes the impact of the oversight on the appellant's conviction. 
      
       
      
     40     
     During the course of argument the Court was referred to authorities establishing that the fresh evidence rules have more limited operation in relation to criminal trials than in civil. I do not find it necessary to do more than acknowledge that these matters were drawn to our attention.  
      
       
      
     41     
     I am satisfied that the appellant has established a miscarriage of justice on this ground.  
      
       
      
     42     
     Counsel sought, and was granted, leave to add an alternative ground of appeal: that the failure of the appellant’s former legal representatives to make the relevant enquiries falls within the principles stated in  
     R v Birks 
      (1990) 19 NSWLR 677, and itself caused a miscarriage of justice. Having regard to the conclusions I have reached above, it is unnecessary for me to pay any further attention to this ground.  
      
       
      
     43     
     That makes it strictly unnecessary to consider a further alternative ground, which concerned the failure of the trial Judge to give a direction under s 165 of the  
     Evidence Act 1995 
     , but since I understand that other members of the Bench may not share my views on the first issue, I should deal with it briefly.  
      
       
      
     44     
     At trial, counsel sought a direction in relation to Reynolds’ evidence. He generally related the application to s 165. S 165 applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, specific examples of which are given. In a jury trial, where evidence falls into the category of evidence that may be unreliable, and the trial Judge is requested by a party to do so, the Judge is required to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable; to inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and to warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence; and the weight to be given to it if accepted.  
      
       
      
     45     
     One of the specific examples of evidence of a kind that may be unreliable is identified as: 
      
       
        
         
         “(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding.” 
         
        
       
      
     46     
     As I have noted above, the tenor of the cross-examination addressed to Reynolds was to suggest that the conversion of the vehicles had taken place while they were in his custody and before he passed them on to the appellant. It was common ground that, although the groundwork for such a conclusion was painstakingly laid, by, inter alia, establishing that Reynolds had the tools and facilities that would have enabled him to undertake the conversion, it was never directly put to him that he had in fact done so.  
      
       
      
     47     
     Where a direction is sought in reliance upon s 165(1)(d), it is necessary for the trial Judge to determine whether there was evidence capable of raising a reasonable supposition that the witness concerned was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charge. If so, the Judge is obliged to give the direction (unless, in the circumstances of the case, there were good reasons not to do so: see sub s (3)):  
     R v Taranto 
     ;  
     R v Freeman  
     [1999] NSW CCA 396, unreported, per Spigelman CJ, Dunford and Hidden JJ. 
      
       
      
     48     
     Unfortunately, that is not what occurred in this case. The Judge was asked for a s 165 direction; but the application did not rely on any of the specific examples of unreliable evidence mentioned in the section. Instead, the application relied upon Reynolds’ statement that he had a poor memory; and that he had tried to expunge the relevant period of his life from his mind; and that in 1998 he was giving evidence of events that had occurred in 1992. The Judge held, quite correctly in my view, that neither of these circumstances was sufficient to bring Reynolds’ evidence within the description “of a kind that may be unreliable”, so as to bring s 165 into play. It was, as the Judge said, in no different category than the evidence given by any of the other witnesses, all of whom were recounting events of the distant past. He held that it was part of the jury’s function to assess, and to evaluate, the reliability of the evidence of all of the witnesses, including Reynolds. In the context of the application that was made to him, this was an entirely correct conclusion. What is now put is that the Judge failed to apply his mind to the assessment whether Reynolds was a witness who might reasonably have been supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the charges. This he was never asked to do.  
      
       
      
     49     
     One question that arises is whether the appellant requires leave, pursuant to Rule 4 of the  
     Criminal Appeal Rules 
     , to argue this ground. Rule 4 provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
         
        
       
      
     50     
     An application for a direction in general terms under s 165, on the basis of a witness’s poor memory and the lapse of time since the events in question, is insufficient when the ground now raised is that a direction ought to have been given because of the suggestion that Reynolds might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally involved in the enterprise. Leave is required to argue the ground. It is not affected by the discovery of the Bandouvakis letter. The issue of Reynolds’ involvement was an issue at trial. Many cases have established the obligation of counsel to assist the trial Judge, and to ensure that the trial process is not infected by avoidable error. Particularly in the light of the failure of counsel to put expressly to Reynolds the accusation that he was criminally concerned in the thefts or conversation of the vehicles, there was no reason why the Judge should, in the absence of a request by counsel, have turned his mind to paragraph (d) of s 165(1). Had he been invited to do so, it may well have been that he would have reached the necessary factual conclusion which would have given rise to the need to give the direction. Had he done that, undoubtedly he would have given the direction. This is a case in which, in my opinion, leave under Rule 4 should not be granted.  
      
       
      
     51     
     In the light of my conclusion in relation to grounds 1 and 2, I propose that the appeal be allowed, the convictions quashed, and a new trial ordered.

     MATTER NO. IRC 1591 of 1999 
      
      
     SWIFT PLACEMENTS PTY. LIMITED v. WORKCOVER AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES (INSPECTOR MAY) 
      
      
     Appeal by Swift Placements Pty. Limited against a decision of and orders by Mr. Justice Marks respectively on 26 March 1999 and 9 September 1999 in Matters Nos. IRC 7104, 7105 and 7106 of 1997 re prosecutions under s.15(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983. 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT OF THE COURT 
       
      
      
      
     1     
     On 5 January 1996, at the premises of Warman International Limited (Warman) at Artarmon in the State, Rudolf Steven Terkes was cleaning a sand mixing machine on the moulding line in the foundry when he suffered injuries to his right hand from moving metal blades causing the loss of two fingers and severe lacerations. It seems that the appellant, Swift Placements Pty. Limited as a personnel agency and supplier of labour to industry, had arranged for Mr. Terkes to perform work at Warman's premises; the respondent, Louise May, as an inspector of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, initiated prosecutions against the appellant for three breaches of s.15(1) of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      1983 arising out of the accident on 5 January 1996 to Mr. Terkes.  
      
      
     2    The prosecution proceedings were heard by  
     Marks 
      J. in which the only defence raised was that Mr. Terkes was not an employee of the appellant when he sustained the injuries at the premises of Warman. Otherwise, it was conceded that the appellant was an employer and the remaining essential ingredients of the offences were admitted so as to enable them to be found proven. His Honour held on 26 March 1999, in the decision now under challenge, ""that there was an employment relationship on the relevant occasion between the defendant (the appellant) and Mr. Terkes. … the prosecutor has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the employer of Mr. Terkes on 5 January 1996 whilst Mr. Terkes was working at the premises of Warman"". On 9 September 1999,  
     Marks  
     J. made orders convicting the appellant of each of the offences and imposed a fine of $15,000 for each offence with a moiety to the prosecutor plus costs; his Honour stayed the orders for the payment of the penalties and costs until the determination of the present appeal or until further order. 
      
      
     3    The sole issue raised for determination is whether or not Mr. Terkes was an employee of the appellant at the relevant time when he sustained injuries at Warman's Artarmon premises. If that not be so, there was no basis for his Honour convicting the appellant of the three charges, including the imposition of sentences, and each charge should have been dismissed with costs; that was the relief claimed by the appellant on appeal. 
      
      
     4    The appellant mounted its challenge to the orders of  
     Marks 
      J. pursuant to s.196 of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      1996 and s.5AA of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      1912 by way of an appeal as of right and as a rehearing on the evidence given at first instance. The proper approach to adopt on appeal was stated by a Full Bench ( 
     Fisher 
      P.,  
     Peterson 
      and  
     Schmidt 
      JJ.) of the Court in  
     Warman International Limited v. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales  
      (1998) 80 I.R. 326 at 338-339 as follows : 
      
      
       
        
         
         We accept the submissions of the appellant that the approach to be adopted by this Court to the determination of appeals brought to it in respect of criminal proceedings taken before a judicial member must be the same as that adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal to appeals brought to it under s.5AA of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
         . Section 196(2) of the 1996 Act in applying to such an appeal the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          in the same way that it applies in the Court of Criminal Appeal requires the application of s.5AA(3) ""any such appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the evidence …"". 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         There is no scope for the possibility that those words applied to proceedings here could be given a different meaning and effect to the same provision applied in the context of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal to s.5AA has been discussed in numerous decisions to which we have earlier made reference, particularly  
         Camilleri 
          (1993) 32 N.S.W.L.R. 683 and  
         BWM  
         (1997) 91 A. Crim. R. 260. It follows from the principles elaborated in those cases that the appellant here is not obliged to demonstrate error of the trial judge. The appeal comes to the Court by way of rehearing and the Court will consider the question of sentence for itself. That does not mean that the appeal bench will of necessity come to a conclusion in relation to penalty different from the sentencing judge. A different result need not necessarily flow from the appeal court's exercise of the sentencing discretion; it must nevertheless exercise that discretion. 
         
        
       
      
      
     5     
     We will so consider the present matter as did the Full Bench of this Court in  
     Fletcher Construction Australia Limited v. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Fisher) 
      (1999) 91 I.R. 66 at 75, although in the context of adopting the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
     Histollo Pty. Ltd. v. Director-General of National Parks and Wildlife Service 
      (1998) 45 N.S.W.L.R. 661 that legislative reconsideration should occur of the nature of appeals pursuant to s.5AA and s.5AB of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     . It need only be mentioned that no separate appeal was made against the sentences imposed by  
     Marks 
      J., simply that because Mr. Terkes was not an employee of the appellant the charges could not be sustained and should be dismissed. If, however, the appellant be unsuccessful on that issue, no submissions were made against the sentences  
     per se 
     .  
      
      
     6    The obligation under the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      found to be breached by the appellant is stated in this way : 
      
      
       
        
         
         15 Employers to ensure health, safety and welfare of their employees 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (1) Every employer shall ensure the health, safety  
            
             
             and welfare at work of all the employer's employees. 
             
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
           … 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     7     
     Thus, an essential ingredient of the offence is that the person subject to the relevant detriment to safety must be an employee of the employer defendant. Section 4(1) of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      defines an ""employee"" and an ""employer"" in the following terms : 
      
      
       
        
         
         employee 
          means an individual who works under a contract of employment or apprenticeship. 
          
          
         employer 
          means a corporation which, or an individual who, employs persons under contracts of employment or apprenticeship. 
          
         
        
       
      
     8     
     The question for determination therefore turns on whether Mr. Terkes was an ""employee"" of the appellant in the common law sense, that is, under a contract of employment between Mr. Terkes and the appellant whereby he was performing the work at the premises of Warman when he was injured. 
      
      
     9    It is, we think, fundamental in resolving the present issue to have in mind that the ultimate conclusion as to whether Mr. Terkes was an employee of the appellant is a question of fact, although it is to be acknowledged that in reaching that conclusion questions of mixed law and fact may, and probably will, arise: see  
     Clarkson v. Dent 
      (1998) 84 I.R. 250 at 252-253 and the authorities cited therein. The learned authors of  
     The Liability of Employers 
      (Glass, McHugh and Douglas, 2nd. ed., 1979, Law Book Company) put it in the following way (at pp.69-70) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         Whether or not the relationship of employer and employee exists depends upon whether the person employed works under a contract of service or a contract for services. The distinction between a contract for services and a contract of service is that, in the former case the employer can only order or require what is to be done. In the latter case, however, he can not only order or require what is to be done, but can also direct how it is to be done ( 
         Collins v. Hertfordshire County Council 
          [1947] K.B. 598, per  
         Hilbery 
          J. at p.615; [1947] 1 All E.R. 633, at p.638). This test, which may be conveniently called the control test, is the most valuable criterion for determining whether the relationship of employer and employee exists. The question whether the relationship exists is one for decision by a jury in accordance with the tests laid down by the trial judge ( 
         Fitzpatrick v. Evans & Co 
         . [1902] 1 K.B. 505, at p.510;  
         Simmons v. Heath Laundry Co. 
          [1910] 1 K.B. 543, at pp.548-9;  
         Smith v. General Motor Cab Co. 
          [1911] A.C. 188, at p.193). It is in this sense that statements (see e.g.  
         Performing Right Society Ltd. v. Mitchell & Booker Ltd. 
          [1924] 1 K.B. 762, per  
         McCardie 
          J. at pp.765-6;  
         Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. J. Walter Thompson (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. 
          (1944) 69 C.L.R. 227, per  
         Latham 
          C.J. at p.229) are to be understood to the effect that the question is a mixed question of law and fact. It is certainly true that if the only evidence relating to the nature of the relationship is to be found in a written document a question of law is involved ( 
         Performing Right Society Ltd. v. Mitchell & Booker Ltd. 
          [1924] 1 K.B. 762). However, such a situation will rarely arise in actions for damages for personal injury. There is bound to be some oral evidence of the industrial relations which existed during the period before injury occurred. It will then be for the jury to consider any written agreement in the light of evidence concerning the actual course of dealing between parties. It will be entitled to disregard the written document if this does not correspond to the real arrangement between them. 
          
          
         In  
         R. v. Foster; Ex parte Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Ltd. 
          (1952) 85 C.L.R. 138 the terms of employment of certain insurance agents were contained in a written document. The agreement purported to exclude the relationship of employer and employee and contained a clause that no communication from the employer was to be regarded as binding on the agent but was merely to be considered as in the nature of advice. Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto JJ. were of the opinion that neither the clause nor the agreement was to be regarded as finally determining the relationship of the parties. If the relationship of employer and employee existed in fact the terms of the written agreement could not prevent effect being given to it. They said ((1952) 85 C.L.R. 138 at p.151. cf. when the relationship is ambiguous  
         A.M.P. Society v. Allan  
         (1978) 52 A.L.J.R. 407) : 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""Provisions of this character are perhaps more likely to arouse misgivings as to what the practical situation of the agent may be than to prevent a relation of master and servant being formed. 
            
            
           For, if in practice the company assumes the detailed direction and control of the agents in the daily performance of their work and the agents tacitly accept a position of subordination to authority and to orders and instructions as to the manner in which they carry out their duties, a clause designed to prevent the relation receiving the legal complexion which it truly wears will be ineffectual."" 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
     10     
     That latter comment by the High Court in  
     Foster 
      as to the existence in fact of an employment relationship was reflected later in what Lord  
     Denning 
      M.R. said in  
     Massey v. Crown Life Insurance Co. 
      [1978] 1 W.L.R. 676 at 679, that is : 
      
      
       
        
         
         The law, as I see it, is this: if the true relationship of the parties is that of master and servant under a contract of service, the parties cannot alter the truth of that relationship by putting a different label upon it. … 
          
          
         On the other hand, if the parties' relationship is ambiguous and is capable of being one or the other, then the parties can remove that ambiguity, by the very agreement itself which they make with one another. The agreement itself then becomes the best material from which to gather the true legal relationship between them.

      statement was accepted by the Privy Council in  
     Narich Pty. Limited v. Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax 
      [1983] 2 N.S.W.L.R. 597 at 601 as correctly stating the position and in which their Lordships adopted the principle to the same effect as stated by the Privy Council in  
     Australian Mutual Provident Society v. Allan  
     [1978] 52 A.L.J.R. 407 at 409; (1978) 18 A.L.R. 385 at 389-390 per Lord  
     Fraser 
      of Tullybelton. One need only add the observation made by Lord  
     Fraser 
      therein that ""where there is no reason to think that the clause (in the parties agreement as to the nature of their relationship) is a sham, or that it is not a genuine statement of the parties' intentions, it must be given its proper weight in relation to other clauses in the agreement"". There was no suggestion in the present case that the arrangements made between the persons concerned (the appellant, Mr. Terkes and Warman) to regulate their relationships were a sham or were otherwise not genuine statements of their intentions. Rather, as the arguments were presented, the appellant and the respondent contended that the consequences of those arrangements in terms of legal principle led to competing or different results. On the one hand, the appellant said Mr. Terkes performed the work as an employee of Warman, even though it (the appellant) had to show only that it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that it was the employer; on the other hand, the respondent claimed Mr. Terkes was employed by the appellant in the performance of the work at Warman's premises. 
      
      
     12    Given that the true relationship between parties is a question of fact, but in which issues of law will arise (such as, the construction of documents and the relevant legal tests or principles), it is convenient, firstly, to review the facts of the present case and then, secondly, to assess the significance of the facts so found in accordance with the proper principles of law in order to determine the true nature of the relationship, if any, which existed between the persons concerned on 5 January 1996 when Mr. Terkes suffered the detriment to his safety while working at the premises of Warman. In other words, the task involved, as directed by the applicable definitions in s.4(1) of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
     , is to determine whether at the relevant time Mr. Terkes was performing the work as an employee of the appellant under a contract of employment between them or pursuant to some other relationship.  
      
      
     13     
     As the facts in this matter as set out in the judgment of  
     Marks 
      J. were not disputed, although the proper conclusions to be drawn therefrom were sharply contested, it is convenient to recite what his Honour recorded, as follows : 
      
      
       
        
         
         The following narration is based on oral evidence given and documentary evidence tendered in the proceedings. 
          
          
         The defendant operates an employment agency from which it places persons to perform work in establishments operated by its clients. One of those clients is Warman. It issued a document entitled ""Benefits of Swift Placements Temporary Staffing"" which described its services and the basis upon which it operates, and Warman was aware of the contents of that document and dealt with the defendant on the basis of information and assertions made in that document. The defendant advertised by way of that document its ability to provide staff for clients in a number of areas including labourers. All personnel were evaluated in terms of basic numeracy and personal abilities skills. 
          
          
         Under the heading ""Advantages"" the document stated that administration costs of clients would be reduced because group certificates would be prepared by the defendant and it would process payroll and manage the hiring for labour shortages and turn-over problem areas. There was reference under this heading to ""Swift Placements Employees"". 
          
          
         Under a heading ""Quality Control"" the document said that: ""Swift Placements maintains a quality control program on each of our field employees. All our employees understand that their performance is constantly measured which in itself ensures a high degree of productivity and accuracy."" 
          
          
         The defendant undertook to consult the direct supervisor of its employee within the first four hours of an assignment to ascertain satisfactory performance with an undertaking to replace ""the employee"" immediately without charge in the event of dissatisfaction. The defendant would obtain details of hours worked over the previous week by its employees each Thursday morning. 
          
          
         With respect to overtime the document said: ""Although all overtime worked will be paid to our employees at time and a half and double time, you will only be charged at time and 40% and 80% respectively."" Allowances payable under a relevant award would be charged to the client at cost. All temporary staff were to be paid a minimum of three hours working time each day. 
          
          
         The responsibilities of the defendant and the client were described in the document in the following terms: 
          
          
           
           ""CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
            
           To instruct and supervise Swift Placement employees in the operations they are required to perform. 
            
            
           To accurately inform Swift Placements of the job classification, or any changes to the job description. 
            
            
           To inform Swift Placements of any accidents, sickness or problems relating to its employees immediately. 
            
            
           To keep an accurate record of the daily hours worked by Swift Placements employees. These hours will be obtained from you by Swift Placements, by telephone/facsimile, Thursday mornings. Both the employees' pay and invoice to you are produced from these hours. Time sheets can be provided if required. 
            
            
           Submitted timesheets should be authorised and signed by relevant supervisory staff. Swift Placements cannot take responsibility for receipt of unsigned timesheets."" 
           
          
         
         
         Under a heading "" 
         TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
         "" applying to temporary placements the following material was included as to salaries:

         … 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Terkes first came into contact with the defendant when he saw an advertisement for a job in a newspaper. He made an appointment to see Mr Colin West the managing director of the defendant and was interviewed by him on 31 October 1995. On this occasion Mr Terkes was asked to fill in a number of forms which he did. One of these was entitled ""Temporary Application Card"" which sought a number of personal details and in particular recent work experience and nature of the work which Mr Terkes was seeking. Another document was a health questionnaire. The third document was entitled ""Swift Placements Pty Ltd Offer of Casual Employment"". Because of the significance that this document assumed in the proceedings I shall set out all of its terms verbatim: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""This is to confirm the offer of casual employment as a casual employee, made to you, subject to the following terms and conditions. 
            
            
           1. Where not specifically referred to herein, your employment is governed by the provisions of the applicable Award (an Award of the NSW Industrial Commission). 
            
            
           2. Your rate of remuneration will be based on a rate per hour, which includes Casual Loading and a factor of 1/12th representing Annual Holiday Leave Entitlement. Payment will be for a minimum of four hours on each day of engagement. Termination of employment will be on a day to day basis dependant upon work requirements by the client. 
            
            
           3. In addition to your remuneration, the percentage amount under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of your ordinary earnings (that is, not including the loadings referred to as part of your remuneration), will be paid into a Superannuation Fund administered through the National Flexi Super Plan (which is a fund having ""approval"" for purposes of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act). Such payment will be made with respect to each month where your hours of work exceed 38. If you advise that you wish to terminate this Contract of Employment, then an amount ""accumulated"" will be paid to the fund of your account. The fund nominated for purposes of meeting occupational superannuation contribution obligations provides benefits at least equal to, but potentially better than, that provided under the Award, but is nominated in order for Swift Placements to avoid a multiplicity of funds for purposes of meeting it's (sic) collective obligations for employees, and is provided for the majority of our employees on the basis of agreement reached at the enterprise level. 
            
            
           4. The rate of pay referred to in 2 above will be adjusted from time to time in accordance with variations made under the Award referred to. The rate of contribution for occupational superannuation contributions will also be adjusted to accord with Award variations, or as prescribed under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. 
            
            
           5. Upon cessation of employment and where relevant, the return to your original Country of residence, the onus must be on you the employee to make contact with the Superannuation Fund and thus inform them where accumulated funds can be sent. The contact number is 1800 331 240. 
            
            
           6. Under the terms of employment, you are required to contact Swift Placements each day between 8.00am and 8.30am to ascertain whether work is available on such day, or some subsequent day. Once work has been allocated you must attend at the place nominated and undertake the work directed. 
            
            
           PROVIDED HOWEVER 
            that, in the event of your being unable to perform the work provided on account of illness, injury or other pressing necessity you are required to notify Swift Placements no later than 7.45am on the day that the work has been arranged. You must undertake the work directed with dispatch and diligence, and subject to the supervision of the person nominated by Swift Placements for the purpose. With respect to the administration arrangements, you are responsible to Swift Placements, and you are not to agree to undertake any work for the client which has not been arranged or directed through this office. 
            
            
           7. Where requested safety boots/clothing must be worn and where applicable safety equipment must be utilised at all times. Failure to comply with the above will result in loss of employment. 
            
            
           8. Whilst you remain bound at all times to observe proper conduct towards Swift Placements (including, but not limited to, not being party to either any act of omission, any conduct which may, or be calculated to, cause damage to Swift Placements, it's (sic) property or reputation but you will at all times and in all reasonable ways continue to treat and refer to Swift Placements with respect and propriety), you are also bound not to at any time, either during employment or subsequently, divulge kind or nature whatsoever relating to the business of any client of Swift Placements where you may have been engaged to work, which has been acquired during or as a consequence of your engagement with the client of Swift Placements, or with the Company. 
            
            
           9. You must notify Swift Placements as soon as you have completed any work or assignment for any client of Swift Placements, and ensure that with respect to the work undertaken Time Sheets or other relevant records relating to the work have been properly completed and properly verified by the client. Failure to complete these records will be seen as a wilful breach of duty, and may result in your not being paid for the work. 
            
            
           10. Completed Time Sheets, when used will be provided to Swift Placements by Thursday at 10.00am each week. Remuneration will be calculated with respect to all work complete up to and including each Wednesday to 12.00pm (sic) midnight. 
            
            
           11. If you wish your wages to be paid direct into your bank account, you must supply us with all the relevant details. These should be given to us by 12.00pm on Wednesdays, or if you wish you can receive your pay by the following methods. 
            
            
           # You collect your cheque from the reception after 2.00pm Friday 
            
           # We post your cheque to a private address only. 
            
            
           12. You are entitled to coverage by Swift Placements under the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, 1987. Pursuant to the provisions of the said Act you are required to give notice of any injury to Swift Placements as soon as practicable after the incident giving rise to the injury, and prior to your leaving the place at which are engaged to perform work. You are also required to make a claim for Worker's Compensation on the approved form as soon as practicable. 
            
            
            SIGNED 
           :.................................... 
           DATE 
           ..................."" 
            
           
          
         
         
         About two and a half weeks later Mr West telephoned Mr Terkes and told him that there was a job available at Artarmon which involved heavy lifting and that there was a lot of overtime. Mr West asked him whether he wished to take it and Mr Terkes said that he would. Mr West gave Mr Terkes the address of Warman and he was told to contact a person named Gary at that establishment and to be there before 6am the next day. 
          
          
         Upon attending Warman Mr Terkes was introduced to Gary who asked him whether he knew how to grind. After indicating that he did he was shown what to do and before starting work was given some protective safety items and overalls to wear. After about four weeks working the grinder Gary then moved Mr Terkes into the moulding section where he did some sweeping and other jobs. He was in that section for about a week during which time he was helping an employee named Jerry with the cleaning of machinery. On 5 January 1996 Jerry did not attend work and Mr Terkes was asked to clean the machine. This was when the accident previously described occurred. 
          
          
         Under cross examination Mr Terkes agreed that whilst he was working on the premises of Warman, personnel of that organisation directed him as to what work to do, where to work in the premises, when to work on various projects, what hours he would work including overtime, what safety equipment should be used, how to perform certain tasks which were allocated to him, to which Warman employee he was to report and what training and instruction he should receive. He did receive on-the-job training and instruction in a number of areas and was, as I have said, transferred from one area to another. 
          
          
         In a statement made to the prosecutor, Mr Colin West said that the defendant provided its clients ""with the staff according to what they want, it's up to them to provide suitable and safe equipment as we cannot impinge on there (sic) territory. We provide the person they provide the equipment that is safe to use, it's the responsibility of the client to provide safe equipment in a safe working environment and Rudolf Terkes should have an awareness of the responsibilities of a fettler."" 
          
          
         The defendant had effected workers' compensation insurance with MMI Workers' Compensation (NSW) Ltd. Consequent upon Mr Terkes' injury the defendant filled in an employer's report of injury form in which it described Mr Terkes as a worker and which it completed as an employer. Mr Terkes completed a workers' compensation claim form in which he described the defendant as his employer. 
          
          
         On 15 July 1998 the defendant issued a 1998 Group Certificate showing that it was the employer of Mr Terkes between 2 July 1997 to 7 January 1998, a period which I observe is irrelevant for the purposes of these proceedings. 
          
          
         On 8 January 1996 Warman completed an accident report form for the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales. That form noted Mr Terkes as being an injured person but stated that he was not an employee of that company. 
          
          
         On 22 February 1996 National Australia Financial Management Ltd received from the defendant an ""employer contribution"" on behalf of Mr Terkes being an occupational superannuation payment made for the period 30 June 1995 to 24 September 1998.

     We would wish to add to his Honour's summary some additional facts from the unchallenged evidence. In the document intituled "" 
     BENEFITS OF SWIFT PLACEMENTS TEMPORARY STAFFING BRINGING PROFESSIONALISM TO THE INDUSTRY

     16     
     We would add also that in a statement made to the respondent as prosecutor on 18 December 1996, the appellant's Managing Director, Mr. Colin West, admitted in response to a question whether he had authority ""to speak legally on behalf of the company"" that he had ""full authority"" and undertook to produce written authority to that effect. The following is an extract from the recorded interview of Mr. West by the respondent :

     Mr. West was further interviewed by the prosecutor on 28 October 1997. As to the steps taken by the appellant in assessing the work environment at Warman for safety purposes, he said it ""continues to be done … happens all the time … (by) … a workplace visit and discussion with Warman staff, and the discussion is based on safety aspects and other things"". Mr. West added the following information concerning the work Mr. Terkes was required to perform at Warman, including the cleaning of the sand mixing machine at the time he was injured, and the training for such work: 
      
      
       
        
         
         Q. Was Swift Placements Pty Ltd aware that Rudolph Terks ( 
         sic 
         ) may be required to clean the sand mixing machine on the fast loop moulding line? 
          
         A. Yes, if they go as a labourer or a Fettler they are required to move around as requested by Warman International because it is an unskilled job. 
          
          
         Q. Did you make any inquiry as to the training and instruction Mr. Terks ( 
         sic 
         ) received from Warman International in performing that task? 
          
         A. No, not required. 
          
          
         Q. Did Swift Placements make any inquiry of the training Rudolph Terks ( 
         sic 
         ) had received from Warman International? 
          
         A. Not specific because we know that every person that goes in there are trained according to the specific requirements. 
          
          
         Q. What system did Swift Placements Pty Ltd have in place to ensure it was advised of the items of plant and equipment it's ( 
         sic 
         ) employees, and in particular, Rudolph Terks ( 
         sic 
         ), would be required to operate while working for Warman International? 
          
         A. We provide them with the staff according to what they want, its up to them to provide suitable and safe equipment as we cannot impinge on there ( 
         sic 
         ) territory. We provide the person they provide the equipment that is safe to use, its ( 
         sic 
         ) the responsibility of the client to provide safe equipment in a safe working environment and Rudolph Terks ( 
         sic 
         ) should have an awareness of the responsibilities of a fettler. 
         
        
       
       
      
     18     
     The appellant's wages record for Mr. Terkes disclosed hours worked and gross wages paid from his commencement at Warman in November 1995 to the date of the accident on 5 January 1996. Specifically, for the week ended 10 January 1996, during which week the accident occurred, the wages record showed that Mr. Terkes worked for 17.20 hours and gross wages paid to him amounted to $227.14; the appellant's invoice to Warman in respect of that same week for the services of Mr. Terkes as a fettler was for 17.20 hours worked for which the fee was a total of $379.98; thus, the appellant received from Warman an amount of $152.84 over and above the wages it actually paid to Mr. Terkes no doubt representing for those 17.20 hours the appellant's fee to cover profit, expenses and associated labour costs in the employment of Mr. Terkes. Support for those financial arrangements appeared from the appellant's report of the injury to its insurer where Mr. Terkes' wage rate was shown as $12.48 per hour ($474.00 per week average) whereas the hourly rates the appellant charged Warman for Mr. Terkes' services were $21.11 for ordinary hours and $29.55 for overtime hours.  
      
      
     19     
     Marks 
      J. approached the matter by considering firstly whether there was any contractual relationship between Mr. Terkes and the appellant and what were the terms and conditions of that contract. His Honour reasoned that the offer of casual employment document was just that, an offer, and did not itself bring any contract of employment into existence; however, once Mr. Terkes had notified the appellant of acceptance of a particular position then, as his Honour found, ""the terms and conditions contained within the offer of casual employment document … manifested an intention of both parties to enter into a legally binding contract of employment"". After accepting that any characterisation given to a relationship by the parties themselves could not foreclose the ability of a court to correctly categorise the relationship in another way if to do so would be in accordance with established principles of law, his Honour referred to  
     Narich 
      and to  
     Australian Mutual Provident Society 
      for the proposition ""that any ambiguity may be resolved by reference to the professed intention of the parties as to the true legal relationship between them"".  
      
      
     20     
     His Honour considered that the intention of the appellant and Mr. Terkes to enter into a legal relationship of employment was consistent with the manner in which the appellant dealt with Warman and concluded that such dealing was ""on the basis that Mr. Terkes would be the defendant's employee and not the employee of Warman"".  
      
     21     
     His Honour further concluded, on the facts, that there was no intention on the part of Warman to enter into a contract of employment with Mr. Terkes in that ""there is absolutely no evidence"" of such an intention which would, in any event, ""have been inconsistent with the nature of the business arrangement which Warman had with the defendant"". His Honour concluded also that there was no evidence Mr. Terkes saw himself as an employee of Warman.  
      
      
     22     
     Having found a relationship between the appellant and Mr. Terkes, the professed intention of which was a relationship of employer-employee,  
     Marks 
      J. then attended to the essential question as to whether the relationship truly constituted a contract of employment or rather should be characterised other than as an employment relationship according to law. For that purpose, his Honour cited and followed the judgment of  
     Mason 
      J., as he then was, in  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling Co. Pty. Limited  
     (1986) 160 C.L.R. 16 at 24, 28-29 in relation to the degree of control exercised by a person who engages another to perform work over the person so engaged. After referring to the problems which have emerged over the years in the application of the control test with a skilled workforce, working patterns and the organisation of labour (particularly, as here, where labour is outsourced or hired to a third party),  
     Marks 
      J. said ""there can be no doubt that substantial direction and control over the work activities of Mr. Terkes devolved upon Warman personnel"".  
      
      
     23     
     His Honour then analysed, but distinguished on the facts, recent decisions of both the High Court and the Federal Court concerning the nature of the relationship established between a labour hire company and a worker performing services for a third party: see  
     Accident Compensation Commission v. Odco Pty. Ltd. 
      (1990) 95 A.L.R. 641 and  
     Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v. Odco Pty. Ltd.  
     (1991) 99 A.L.R. 735. After referring to the decision of  
     Balmford 
      J. in the Supreme Court of Victoria in  
     Drake Personnel Ltd. v. Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic.) 
      (1998) 40 A.T.R. 304, the facts of which were said to ""bear a striking resemblance to the facts in these proceedings"" but with which decision his Honour disagreed,  
     Marks 
      J. then concluded : 
      
      
       
        
         
         For the reasons which I have advanced Mr Terkes could not have been an employee of Warman at the time of the incident which gave rise to these proceedings. There is simply no evidence of any contractual relationship between him and Warman which would found any employment relationship. 
          
           
          
         On the other hand there is ample evidence of a contractual relationship between Mr Terkes and the defendant. The contract came into being at the time that Mr Terkes accepted the offer to perform work at Warman and the terms and conditions were established by the offer of casual employment document. There was a clear intention to create an employment relationship. The only feature missing from the terms and conditions of the contract of employment which would otherwise clearly characterise the relationship created by the contract as being one of employment in the traditional sense was the provision of detailed direction and control in connection with the performance of the work. However it was a term and condition between the defendant and Mr Terkes that Mr Terkes would be subject to detailed direction and control by Warman personnel. To this extent there was a provision contained within the contract between the defendant and Mr Terkes concerning detailed direction and control and Warman personnel were appointed to carry this out. As I have previously indicated this is not a traditional employment situation. It is a contemporary situation now not uncommonly encountered within the business world. New and evolving techniques require the law to continually evaluate its approach to the characterisation of relationships and rights and obligations which may flow from them. Such detailed control and direction as was necessary to establish an employment relationship did not necessarily have to devolve on the defendant personally. 
          
           
          
         … 
          
           
          
         I have no doubt for the reasons which I have earlier outlined that there was an employment relationship on the relevant occasion between the defendant and Mr Terkes. Accordingly I find that the prosecutor has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the employer of Mr Terkes on 5 January 1996 whilst Mr Terkes was working at the premises of Warman.

     Counsel for the parties helpfully provided written submissions which were supplemented by oral argument. Those submissions analysed the facts in light of the authorities as referred to in the judgment of  
     Marks 
      J., but with different results. Counsel for the appellant, the Hon. Mr. J. J.  
     Macken 
      and Mr. H. J.  
     Mater 
     , for their part, made the following main points - 
      
      
       
        
         
          
          (1)  
          Marks 
           J. erred in determining that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the employer of Mr. Terkes on 5 January 1996 while he was working at the premises of Warman. 
           
          (2) The proper statement of principle in determining whether an employment relationship existed was contained in the judgment of  
          Mason 
           J. in  
          Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
           (160 C.L.R. at p.24), namely, a prominent factor is the degree of control exercised in the sense of ultimate authority over the employee in the performance of his work residing in the employer so that he was subject to the latter's order and direction; however, control is not the sole criterion by which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment but rather to regard it merely as one of a number of indicia which must be considered in the determination of the question. 
           
          (3) On the facts of this case,  
          Marks 
           J. was correct in finding that substantial direction and control over the work activities of Mr. Terkes devolved upon Warman personnel in that direct control and supervision, including training and the like, were all in the hands of Warman.  
           
          (4) Throughout the time Mr. Terkes was at Warman's premises, and particularly on the date of the accident, the appellant could not control, and had no right to control, the work which Mr. Terkes performed. 
           
          (5)  
          Marks 
           J. was in error in finding that all indicia other than control pointed to an employment relationship between the appellant and Mr. Terkes; those indicia included the absence of ultimate authority in the appellant to order and direct Mr. Terkes in the performance of his work, the appellant paid remuneration to Mr. Terkes but the amount was reimbursed by Warman, Warman had the exclusive responsibility to provide and maintain equipment (including personal protective equipment) for Mr. Terkes' use, Mr. Terkes was not obliged to perform work when it was offered by the appellant, the hours of work were determined by Warman not by the appellant and the deduction of income tax by the appellant from Mr. Terkes' wages was merely a paper transaction. 
           
          (6) To the extent it has been said (see  
          Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
           per  
          Mason 
           J. (160 C.L.R. at pp.28-29) and  
          Pitcher v. Langford 
           ((1991) 23 N.S.W.L.R. 142 per  
          Kirby 
           P. at p.150) that the notion of ""control"" is particularly inapposite in determining the nature of some relationships in modern post-industrial society, such observations have no application to the present case which involves an unskilled labourer who was, in fact, under constant and detailed instruction and supervision by Warman. 
           
          (7) Adopting the classic test of ""control"" for determining whether a particular relationship is that of master and servant, as stated by  
          Wilson 
           and  
          Dawson 
           JJ. in  
          Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
           (160 C.L.R. at p.35) Mr. Terkes was not subject to the command of the appellant either as to what he should do in the course of his employment or as to how he should do it. 
           
          (8)  
          Marks 
           J. was in error in not following the reasoning in  
          Accident Compensation Commission v. Odco 
          ,  
          Building Workers' Industrial Union v. Odco 
           and  
          Drake Personnel v. Commissioner of State Revenue 
           so as to fail to hold that Warman, and not the appellant, was the real employer of Mr. Terkes; essentially from those authorities, his Honour was wrong in not recognising the overriding principle that where the day-to-day control of the work being carried out rests with the client (here Warman) and not with the labour hire agency (here the appellant) then the client is the employer and not the agency. 
           
          (9) Notwithstanding the language used in the apellant's document offering casual employment to Mr. Terkes, the totality of the evidence established that the contract between those persons was not a contract of employment; alternatively, the evidence in that document did not permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that on the relevant date when Mr. Terkes was working at the premises of Warman he was an employee of the appellant. 
           
          (10) The document outlining the benefits of temporary staffing provided by the appellant to Warman dealt with ""paper matters"" and could not prevent a court discerning the real nature of the relationship between parties which here, on the facts, was not that of employer-employee as between the appellant and Mr. Terkes: see  
          Pitcher v. Langford  
          (23 N.S.W.L.R. at p.162 per  
          Handley 
           J.A.). 
           
          (11)  
          Marks 
           J. was in error in concluding there was no evidence of any contractual relationship between Mr. Terkes and Warman which would found a relationship of employment in that there was abundant evidence of such a contract meeting the control test and other indicia; there was no need for the terms to be formally agreed as they could be implied from the facts which here pointed to Warman as being the employer. 
           
          (12) The contract between the appellant and Mr. Terkes was one of agency by which the appellant arranged a contract of employment between Mr. Terkes and Warman. The appellant also was Warman's agent with respect to the transmission of wages and entitlements to Mr. Terkes in consideration of fees paid by Warman to the appellant.  
          
         
        
       
       
      
     25     
     In his oral submissions, Mr.  
     Macken 
      vividly described in the following way how the relationships between the various parties should be seen : 
      
      
       
        
         
         Many employers these days - and his Honour refers to this development - outsource the accounting department, outsource the maintenance department, outsource the accountancy department, outsource the public relations department. They get rid of them to other firms and you can just as easily outsource your personnel employee relations department and that is the way, we submit, this whole question should be approached. 
          
          
         Swifts are an outsourced human resources department of Warmans. You can say to a head hunter: We want such and such staff. We want them to have these qualifications. We want you to select them, train them, bring them to a satisfactory state and we want you to send them to us and to make the arrangement work, you pay them and we will reimburse you. We will tell you the overtime and you pay them. It is an outsourced human relations department but there is no reason whatever to argue that a head hunter has become the employer - and mostly they don't. A firm may ring up and ask for a new professional engineer and they are provided. The head hunter does not become the employer. 
          
          
         The contractor who wants the employee stays the employer and that can be the position here and all the advantages that come from vicarious employment can remain on foot. 
         
        
       
       
      
     26     
     In resisting the appeal, counsel for the respondent, Mr. S.  
     Crawshaw 
      S.C. and Mr. M. F.  
     Taylor 
     , adopted the reasoning of  
     Marks 
      J. as set out in the challenged judgment. The basic submission was, as Mr.  
     Crawshaw 
      said, that ""the evidence points overwhelmingly to Swift (the appellant) as being the employer"". The particular categories of evidence relied upon for that result included the admission by the appellant's managing director that Mr. Terkes was employed by it, the various documents all suggested the appellant was the employer, the appellant made all payments to Mr. Terkes relevant to the employment relationship, the direction and control of Mr. Terkes was with the appellant as well as with Warman and the ultimate authority over or legal control of Mr. Terkes resided with the appellant. In summary, Mr.  
     Crawshaw 
      put the position in this way : 
      
      
       
        
         
         When it comes down to it, as I said, the indicia are overwhelming in favour of Swift and that, in our submission, is why my friend is forced to resort to this idea of agency. Because there are so many indicia of employment between Swift and Mr. Terkes, the appellant is forced to put a position that Swift is the agent of Warman. The problem with that argument is that no evidence is cited for the proposition at first instance and  
         Marks 
          J. correctly found … that there was no evidence for this proposition - no evidence has been cited for that proposition on appeal - and in particular, if you look at the benefits of the Swift Placements document … there's no mention of an agency in any form whatsoever. It's really in that document, which sets out the relationship between Swift and Warman, where you would expect to find this agency if it existed. There's no suggestion in that document in any way that there is an agency … 
         
        
       
      
      
     27     
     At the outset of our consideration of this appeal, it is necessary to identify the ultimate question to be decided. That question is whether Mr. Terkes was employed by the appellant under a contract of employment on 5 January 1996 when he suffered the detriment to his safety at the Artarmon premises of Warman. It was accepted by both parties that Mr. Terkes was employed by somebody while he was performing the work of cleaning the sand mixing machine; the real issue dividing the parties was not that there was no legal relationship between the appellant and Mr. Terkes but rather the nature of that relationship. On the one hand, the appellant said it was the agent of Mr. Terkes by which it arranged a contract of employment between Mr. Terkes and Warman and also it was Warman's agent in the transmission of wages and entitlements to Mr. Terkes in consideration of fees paid by Warman to it. The rationale for that approach was, as Mr.  
     Macken 
      urged, the appellant's position as a ""head hunter"" or outsourced human resources department of Warman in obtaining appropriately qualified persons from those, like Mr. Terkes, who had indicated a desire to perform certain work. On the other hand, the respondent said the appellant was and remained the true employer of Mr. Terkes at all relevant times.  
      
      
     28     
     Whether a person is the ""employee"" of another who is the ""employer"" (or, to use the older terminology, the ""servant"" of a ""master"") at any particular time or for any particular purpose seems to us, as we have indicated earlier, to be a question of fact to be determined according to given criteria: see  
     Mead v. New England Seed Traders Pty. Limited  
     [1972] W.C.R. 113 per  
     Kerr 
      C.J. and  
     Hope 
      J.A., with whom  
     Holmes 
      J.A. agreed, at pp.113, 118. However, as  
     Wilson 
      and  
     Dawson 
      JJ. observed in  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
      (160 C.L.R. at p.37), ""any attempt to list the relevant matters, however incompletely, may mislead because they can be no more than a guide to the existence of the relationship of master and servant"". In  
     Poulson v. John Jarvis and Co. Limited 
      [1919] 122 L.T. Rep. 471, a case not dissimilar to the present in which the issue was which of two employers was the true employer, Lord  
     Sterndale 
      M.R. referred (at p.472) to the difficulty in answering such a question by observing that there were ""many cases on the subject, and they are not easy to reconcile with one another, the reason being … that it comes eventually to a question of fact upon which the judges have drawn different conclusions in the different cases, and that from the reports it is not easy to discover the exact reasons for drawing the different conclusions"". The Master of the Rolls added (at pp.474-475), by adopting the words of Lord  
     Loreburn 
      in  
     McCartan v. Belfast Commissioners 
      (1911) 2 Ir. Rep. 143 at p.145, that : 
      
      
       
        
         
         Decisions are valuable for the purpose of ascertaining a rule of law. No doubt they are also useful in enabling us to see how eminent judges regard facts and deal with them, and great numbers of recorded precedents are useful in no other way. But it is an endless and unprofitable task to compare the details of one case with the details of another in order to establish that the conclusion from the evidence in the one case must be adopted in the other case. Given the rule of law, the facts in each case must be independently considered in order to see whether they bring it within the rule or not. 
         
        
       
      
      
     29     
     And, with respect, so we think it to be in the instant case before us as concerns the true nature of the relationship between the appellant and Mr. Terkes. 
      
      
     30     
     Even given the doubts as to the utility in law of definitions, as expressed by Hart in  
     Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence 
      (1954) 70 L.Q.R. 37, it is nevertheless helpful, we think, as a starting point in addressing the present issue to refer to the following statement by  
     MacKinnon 
      L.J. in  
     Hewitt 
       
     v. Bonvin 
      [1940] 1 K.B. 188 at 191-192: 
      
      
       
        
         
         I think the definition of a servant in Salmond on Torts can hardly be bettered: ""A servant may be defined as any person employed by another to do work for him on the terms that he, the servant, is to be subject to the control and directions of his employer in respect of the manner in which his work is to be done."" 
          The emphasis on the control and directions of the employer in this has no doubt reference to the well known case of  
         Quarman v. Burnett 
          (6 M. & W. 499). The driver of the vehicle there was obviously a servant, but he might be regarded as the servant of one or other of two persons as his employer; which of them was his employer depended on the question of control and direction; and that emphasis is further material upon the difference between a servant and an independent contractor. 
          
          
         But before any question as to the right of control and direction over the tortfeasor arises at all, it must be established that in doing the act complained of he was employed by the third party to do work for him. 
          This cannot be established by mere proof that the tortfeasor is using a chattel, or driving a vehicle, which is the property of a third party, though that may, in the absence of any further explanation, be some evidence of the proposition.

     That comment is instructive for present purposes in that it emphasised, apart from the important aspect of ""control"", an initial and essential feature of the existence of a master-servant relationship as being that the servant be employed by the putative master to do work for him but where the use by the servant of the property of the other party was merely some evidence that the relevant relationship existed. Here, of course, Mr. Terkes operated the machine owned by Warman and at its premises, but, unless Warman engaged him to do work for it on certain terms then the fact it may have had a degree of control over such work would count for little other than as providing some evidence that it may have so employed him. Necessarily on that reasoning, with which we concur, for a conclusion to prevail of an employment relationship between Warman and Mr. Terkes would require a finding that the appellant did not employ Mr. Terkes to do any work for it and for its own purpose. Put another way, it would have to be found, in our view, that Warman did not engage the appellant itself to do the work concerned, albeit by the appellant using its own employee, but rather that Warman engaged Mr. Terkes himself. It will be apparent, therefore, and as we have intimated, that much depends upon the particular circumstances as disclosed by the facts found.

     The range of relevant facts and the essential elements involved in the employer-employee relationship were considered in detail by the High Court in  
     Attorney-General for New South Wales v. The Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) 
      (1952) 85 C.L.R. 237 where the development of the law of master and servant was traced from its root in the familial relationship to modern commercial situations. In particular,  
     Kitto 
      J. explained the connection and resultant elements of the employer-employee relationship in the following way (at pp.299-300) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         Of course the widening of the range of private enterprise meant that the link between many kinds of servants and the households of their masters became attenuated and ceased to have any reality; but the relation has remained in the law as one which enables a man in the conduct of his private affairs to avail himself of the services of others who will enter into the appropriate relationship with him for that purpose. This is reflected in one of the definitions of ""service"" given in the  
         Oxford English Dictionary 
          : ""work done in obedience to and for the benefits of a master""; and the correlative definition of a ""servant"" may be quoted from the same source: ""one who is under obligation to work for the benefit of a superior and to obey his (or her) commands"".  
         The definition in the American Restatement of the Law, Vol. 1, Agency, p.483 is to the like effect: ""A servant is a person employed to perform service for another in his affairs, and who, with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the service, is subject to the other's control or right to control"": 
          (quoted, as being in accordance with our law, by  
         Latham  
         C.J. in  
         Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. J. Walter Thompson (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. 
          (1944) 69 C.L.R. 227, at p.233). 
          
          
         It will be seen that three elements are involved: first, the relationship must entail, on the part of the servant, obedience to orders; secondly, the obedience to orders that is required is obedience to orders in doing work; and, thirdly, the doing of the work must be for the benefit of the master, that is, it must relate to his own affairs. As to the first, no more need be said than this, that the obligation of obedience exists while the relationship continues. 
          The relationship may be voluntary; and whether voluntary or not, it may be determinable at the will of either party; but without the obligation to obey orders there can be no meaning in the relationship, and it therefore cannot subsist.  
         As to the second element, that the obedience entailed must be obedience to orders in doing work, the point which is vital is that the master's authority must extend both to ordering that the work shall be done and to directing how it shall be done. 
           
         Bramwell 
          L.J. said, in  
         Yewens v. Noakes 
          (1880 6 Q.B.D., 530, at pp.532, 533: ""A servant is a person subject to the command of his master as to the manner in which he shall do his work""; and in  
         Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd.  
         (1947) A.C. 1, at p.17, Lord  
         Porter 
          said ""… it is not enough that the task to be performed should be under his (the master's) control, he must also control the method of performing it"". Citations to the like effect might be multiplied.  
         As to the third element, the statement that the doing of the work must be for the benefit of the master does not mean, of course, that the direct benefit from the work itself must necessarily accrue to the master; he may, without altering the relationship, direct his servant to do work which will benefit another. 
          A good illustration of this may be found in  
         Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd. 
          (1947) A.C. 1.  
         But the doing of work by one person must be required by another as a means whereby that other may attain ends of his own. 
          A foreman, a head of a government department, or an army officer, may have full power to give the most detailed orders to a subordinate as to the manner in which the latter shall do work, and yet no one would suppose that the relation of master and servant exists between them.  
         The point is that the power of direction residing in a person must belong to him for the purpose of enabling him to conduct his own affairs; 
          and only if that is the situation is it possible for him to complain that conduct causing him to lose the service is an infringement of a right to enjoy them which he may vindicate in an action  
         per quod servitium amisit.

     33     
     The above statement of the legal principle, consistent as we think it is with what was said in  
     Hewitt v. Bonvin 
      by  
     MacKinnon 
      L.J. (with whom  
     du Parcq 
      L.J. and  
     Bennett 
      J. agreed), laid stress on the initial requirement, that is, the creation of a legal relationship between the parties concerned for the performance of work. Then, but only then, arises the need to ascertain whether the relationship so created be one of employment (under a contract of service) or of some other kind (such as, principal - independent contractor or principal - agent). In  
     Dalgety Farmers Ltd. t/as Grazcos v. Bruce  
     (1995) 12 N.S.W.C.C.R. 36,  
     Kirby 
      A.-C.J. put the matter in this way (at pp.47-48) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         In determining whether a contract of service has been entered, and if so with whom, it is necessary to look to the circumstances of the engagement and to ascertain who it was that offered employment, and whether the worker accepted that offer. To determine whether what then ensued was indeed employment (in the sense of a contract of service) it is necessary to look to the whole of the relationship. 
          
         
        
       
      
     34     
     His Honour then dealt with the relevant criteria, including the right of control, in categorising a relationship; we will in due course deal with that process.  
     Clarke 
      and  
     Cole 
      JJ.A. agreed with the Acting Chief Justice.  
      
     35     
     Marks 
      J. found that ""there is simply no evidence of any contractual relationship between (Mr. Terkes) and Warman which would found any employment relationship"". In denying liability under the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      as the employer of Mr. Terkes, the appellant challenged his Honour's finding and submitted ""that the dealings between Mr. Terkes and Warman evidence a contract of employment between them, with the arrangements for payment of wages and other 'paper matters' being outsourced to Swift"". Against his Honour's finding as to the evidence, the appellant based its submission on ""the existence of abundant evidence"" of an employment contract between Mr. Terkes and Warman which met the control test and other indicia of employment. The evidence relied upon was said by Mr.  
     Macken 
      to be that Warman directed Mr. Terkes what work to do, told him where to work within the premises, told him when to work on various projects, told him what hours he would work (including any overtime), issued him with appropriate safety equipment, instructed and trained him how to perform certain tasks, transferred him between various sections of the factory and told him which supervisor of Warman he was to report to; also, the Assistant Foundry Manager of Warman believed he had the power to suspend Mr. Terkes if thought necessary.  
      
      
     36     
     However, the evidence also was that Mr. Terkes commenced work at Warman's Artarmon premises on 27 November 1995 after accepting the offer made by the appellant; on attending he was simply asked whether he could perform the work outlined and, on saying he could, he commenced the job. The evidence of the appellant's Managing Director, Mr. West, was that at the time Mr. Terkes sustained the injuries he was employed as a general labourer at Warman performing ""normal duties"". In respect of the arrangement as between Warman and the appellant, Warman was to advise the work to be performed by Mr. Terkes and any proposed changes thereto; as between Mr. Terkes and the appellant, the arrangement was that he was not to undertake any work for Warman which had not been organised or directed through the appellant.  
      
      
     37     
     It will be apparent that Mr.  
     Macken's 
      submission did not attend to the primary question arising, namely, whether there was an intention to create a legal relationship between Mr. Terkes and Warman but rather assumed such a relationship and characterised it according to various criteria, principally control, as an employment contract. Having in mind the proper process referred to above in  
     Hewitt v. Bonvin 
     ,  
     Perpetual Trustee Company 
      and  
     Grazcos  
     to look first to the circumstances of the engagement to ascertain whether a legal relationship was created before determining the nature of that relationship, we consider the submission to be flawed and not supportive of the appellant's case. Indeed, on the facts as found, we are satisfied that  
     Marks 
      J. was correct in finding no evidence of any contractual relationship between Mr. Terkes and Warman.  
      
      
     38     
     Shortly stated, Mr. Terkes obtained the work from the appellant and agreed to perform it on the appellant offering it to him; attendance by him at Warman's premises to commence and continue performance of the work involved no separate or distinct offer by Warman nor acceptance by Mr. Terkes. It follows, in our view, that to the extent any legal relationship existed it did so between the appellant and Mr. Terkes, although, of course, the nature of such relationship is another question. 
      
      
     39     
     We should refer to Mr.  
     Macken's 
      reliance on  
     Mead 
      ((1972) W.C.R. at p.117) for the proposition that the facts may ground an inference of an implied contract of service, even though the parties thereto may not be conscious of the legal consequences of what they have done, so that the law will spell out such a contract from their dealings. Whilst we do not doubt the proposition so stated in  
     Mead 
     , the case is to be seen as distinguishable in that it was decided in the context of an accepted legal relationship (a director of a corporation performing work) and it was a matter of determining the nature of it. Similarly, Mr.  
     Macken's 
      reliance on  
     The Queen v. Foster; ex parte The Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Limited 
      (1952) 85 C.L.R. 138 and 151 was misplaced. Again, that case was concerned with whether the accepted legal relationship between the parties, which was described as one of agency according to a written agreement, was truly an employer-employee relationship because the alleged employer assumed the detailed direction and control of the agents in the daily performance of their work and the so-called agents tacitly accepted that position. The present case on the facts, as we have said, is markedly different with no real factual support for any legal relationship between Warman and Mr. Terkes. 
      
      
     40     
     The further argument by Mr.  
     Macken 
      in support of this proposition, that the relationship between Mr. Terkes and Warman was to be viewed using the test of objective intention, relied upon the statement to that effect contained in Carter and Harland,  
     Contract Law in Australia 
      (3rd ed., Butterworths, 1996) as said to be quoted with approval by  
     Wright 
      J., President, in  
     Knowles v. The Anglican Church Property Trust, Diocese of Bathurst 
      (1999) 89 I.R. 47 at 72. Again, however, and without wishing to qualify the learned authors' statement of law, it is to be repeated that it was made in the context of a party seeking to enforce a contract as distinct from whether, as here, any contract existed. In any event, it should be pointed out that the President's citation of the extract was not an expression of his Honour's view but rather as part of the summary of the arguments put by the then applicant in  
     Knowles 
     . 
      
      
     41     
     We turn now to the decisive issue of the relationship as between Mr. Terkes and the appellant. The relationship is to be viewed, in our opinion, in light of contemporary employment practices by applying the established legal principles and tests but recognising the variety of different employment situations which have arisen in modern Australian society. At first instance in this case,  
     Marks 
      J. recognised as much, in a way with which we agree, when he said that ""this is not a traditional employment situation"" but was ""a contemporary situation now not uncommonly encountered within the business world"" so that ""new and evolving techniques require the law to continually evaluate its approach to the characterisation of relationships and rights and obligations which may flow from them"". His Honour was directing those comments particularly at the use of the control test in assessing the nature of a work relationship, a test heavily relied upon by the appellant before his Honour and on appeal before us. As  
     Kirby 
      A.-C.J. commented in  
     Grazcos 
      (12 N.S.W.C.C.R. at p. 48) - ""… those relationships can be quite unusual with features far distant from the ordinary engagement for weekly wages with which the courts were once so familiar"". In  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
      (160 C.L.R. at p.24),  
     Mason 
      J. observed, in effect, that whilst the existence of control was significant it was not the sole criterion by which to gauge the nature of an employment relationship but merely as one of a number of indicia to be considered in determining that question. His Honour relevantly added (at pp.28-29) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         The traditional formulation, though attended with some complications in its application to a diverse range of factual circumstances ( 
         Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Barrett 
          (1973) 129 C.L.R. at p.400), nevertheless has had a long history of judicial acceptance. True it is that criticisms have been made of it. It is said that a test which places emphasis on control is more suited to the social conditions of earlier times in which a person engaging another to perform work could and did exercise closer and more direct supervision that is possible today. And it is said that in modern post-industrial society, technological developments have meant that a person so engaged often exercises a degree of skill and expertise inconsistent with the retention of effective control by the person who engages him. All this may be readily acknowledged, but the common law has been sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing social conditions by shifting the emphasis in the control test from the actual exercise of control to the right to exercise it, ""so far as there is scope for it"", even if it be ""only in incidental or collateral matters"":  
         Zuijs v. Wirth Bros. Pty. Ltd.  
         (1955) 93 C.L.R., at p.571. Furthermore, control is not now regarded as the only relevant factor. Rather it is the totality of the relationship between the parties which must be considered. 
         
        
       
      
      
     42     
     To a similar effect,  
     Wilson 
      and  
     Dawson 
      JJ. in  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
      (at pp.36-37) said : 
      
      
       
        
         
         In many, if not most, cases it is still appropriate to apply the control test in the first instance because it remains the surest guide to whether a person is contracting independently or serving as an employee. That is not now a sufficient or even an appropriate test in its traditional form in all cases because in modern conditions a person may exercise personal skills so as to prevent control over the manner of doing his work and yet nevertheless be a servant:  
         Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works 
          [1947] 1 D.L.R. 161, at p.169. This has led to the observation that it is the right to control rather than its actual exercise which is the important thing ( 
         Zuijs v. Wirth Bros. Pty. Ltd.  
         (1955) 93 C.L.R. 561, at p.571) but in some circumstances it may even be a mistake to treat as decisive a reservation of control over the manner in which work is performed for another. That was made clear in  
         Queensland Stations Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
          (1945) 70 C.L.R. 539, at p.552, a case involving a droving contract in which Dixon J. observed that the reservation of a right to direct or superintend the performance of the task cannot transform into a contract of service what in essence is an independent contract. 
          
          
         The other indicia of the nature of the relationship have been variously stated and have been added to from time to time. Those suggesting a contract of service rather than a contract for services include the right to have a particular person do the work, the right to suspend or dismiss the person engaged, the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged and the right to dictate the place of work, hours of work and the like. Those which indicate a contract for services include work involving a profession, trade or distinct calling on the part of the person engaged, the provision by him of his own place of work or of his own equipment, the creation by him of goodwill or saleable assets in the course of his work, the payment by him from his remuneration of business expenses of any significant proportion and the payment to him of remuneration without deduction for income tax. None of these leads to any necessary inference, however, and the actual terms and terminology of the contract will always be of considerable importance. 
          
          
         Having said that, we should point out that any attempt to list the relevant matters, however incompletely, may mislead because they can be no more than a guide to the existence of the relationship of master and servant. The ultimate question will always be whether a person is acting as the servant of another or on his own behalf and the answer to that question may be indicated in ways which are not always the same and which do not always have the same significance. 
         
        
       
      
      
     43     
     The importance of placing the concept of control in its proper context in considering the nature of modern industrial relationships, so as to emphasise the proper enquiry as being the totality of the relationship between the parties concerned, no doubt led  
     Kirby 
      A.-C.J. in  
     Grazcos 
      (12 N.S.W.C.C.R. at p.48) to comment ""that, in modern circumstances, the actual exertion of control will be rarer and more subtly applied"". And here, after considering the totality of the relationships (as between the appellant and Warman; Mr. Terkes and Warman; and Mr. Terkes and the appellant)  
     Marks 
      J. said : 
      
      
       
        
         
         One way of considering the relationship between Mr. Terkes and the defendant is to say that the contract between them was that in consideration for the payment of remuneration, Mr. Terkes would carry out work at Warman for the assignment which he had agreed to accept under the full direction and control of Warman. That is, it was a term and condition of his contract with the defendant that control as to the manner, method, time and duration of the work would repose in Warman personnel. Looked at in this way all of the traditional elements of control are present but Mr. Terkes agreed that he would be answerable in this regard to a third party, the client of the defendant. Seen in this way this is a classic case of an employee whose services are lent on hire by the employer to another person. 
         
        
       
      
      
     44     
     Seen in that way, which we think was wholly open on the evidence, control by an employer over an employee is not to be viewed merely in the on-the-job situation in directing a person what to do and how to do it, but rather in the sense of the ultimate or legal control over the person to require him to properly and effectively exercise his skill in the performance of the work allocated in default of which disciplinary measures may be adopted, including the final step of dismissal. To the extent here that Mr.  
     Macken 
      suggested the appellant did not exercise detailed direction and control over Mr. Terkes, which was said to reside in Warman, and particularly where Mr. Terkes was regarded as an unskilled labourer, we consider that such an approach misapplied the essential nature of the control test. After all, although Mr. Terkes was a labourer he could not truly be said to be ""unskilled"" as he must necessarily have exercised some degree of skill, albeit perhaps in the lower range, in performing his various functions operating and cleaning machines at Warman's Artarmon factory. This aspect was considered by  
     Denning 
      L.J. in  
     Cassidy v. Ministry of Health 
      [1951] 2 K.B. 343 at 360 in the following way : 
      
      
       
        
         
         It is no answer for them to say that their staff are professional men and women who do not tolerate any interference by their lay masters in the way they do their work. The doctor who treats a patient in the Walton Hospital can say equally with the ship's captain who sails his ship from Liverpool, and with the crane driver who works his crane in the docks, ""I take no orders from anybody"". That ""sturdy answer"", as Lord Simonds described it, only means in each case that he is a skilled man who knows his work and will carry it out in his own way; but it does not mean that the authorities who employ him are not liable for his negligence. See  
         Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ld.  
         [1947] A.C. 1, 20. The reason why the employers are liable in such cases is not because they can control the way in which the work is done - they often have not sufficient knowledge to do so - but because they employ the staff and have chosen them for the task and have in their hands the ultimate sanction for good conduct, the power of dismissal. 
         
        
       
      
      
     45     
     The evidence established that Mr. Terkes had the requisite degree of skill to enable the above approach to apply - in the document provided by the appellant to Warman detailing the benefits of the appellant's temporary staffing, the placement of labourers was subject to ""skills evaluation"" according to the appellant's evaluation programme (including numeracy testing and assessment of personal abilities), the appellant constantly measured the performance of placements under a quality control programme and suitably screened personnel were provided. 
      
      
     46     
     Further, that same document, which formed the terms of the agreement between the appellant and Warman, provided under the heading "" 
     TERMINATION 
     "" that ""Staff provided are Swift Placements employees""; the plain inference, we think, is that the client, Warman, was being told that it was the appellant as the employer who would control the termination of employment of persons, like Mr. Terkes, placed with the client. Also, the document contained the following provisions as to the appellant monitoring the continued performance of the person placed : 
      
      
       
        
         
         TELEPHONE ASSESSMENT - FIRST DAY OF ASSIGNMENT 
          
          
         During the first four hours of an assignment, Swift Placements will consult with the direct supervisor of our employee to ascertain satisfactory performance. If,  
         for any reason 
         , there is not complete satisfaction we will replace the employee immediately without charge (for non-production time incurred by the original placement) if notified to the Swift Placements office within three (3) hours of commencement of the field employee. 
          
          
         TELEPHONE ASSESSMENT - ON-GOING 
          
          
         Swift Placements will telephone on a regular basis to ascertain the continued performance of our employee/s. 
         
        
       
       
      
     47     
     Again, that is further compelling evidence, having in mind the modern practice of labour hire arrangements for the performance of work, that the appellant was retaining the requisite degree of control over Mr. Terkes in terms of ensuring his compliance with the employment obligations. To a similar effect, paras. 6 and 7 of the document setting out the offer by the appellant of casual employment to Mr. Terkes (earlier cited but which it is worthwhile to repeat for present purposes) dealt with the obligations imposed on him to perform the work allocated in a proper manner and the consequences of failure to do so, as follows : 
      
      
       
        
         
         6. Under the terms of employment, you are required to contact Swift Placements each day between 8:00am and 8:30am to ascertain whether work is available on such day, or some subsequent day. Once work has been allocated you must attend at the place nominated and undertake the work directed. 
          
          
           
           PROVIDED HOWEVER 
            that, in the event of your being unable to perform the work provided on account of illness, injury or other pressing necessity you are required to notify Swift Placements no later than 7:45am on the day that the work has been arranged. You must undertake the work directed with dispatch and diligence, and subject to the supervision of the person nominated by Swift Placements for the purpose. With respect to the administration arrangements, you are responsible to Swift Placements, and you are not to agree to undertake any work for the client which has not been arranged or directed through this office. 
           
          
          
         7. Where requested safety boots/clothing must be worn and where applicable safety equipment must be utilised at all times. Failure to comply with the above will result in loss of employment. 
         
        
       
       
      
     48     
     Paragraph 8 thereof forthrightly laid down the duty of Mr. Terkes to the appellant to observe proper conduct towards it and to its clients; para. 9 required Mr. Terkes on completion of any work assignment for a client to complete and have verified by the client the time sheets and other relevant records - failure to do so was to ""be seen as a wilful breach of duty, and may result in your not being paid for the work"". It is perhaps difficult to imagine that those requirements on Mr. Terkes were anything other than direct control and direction of him with respect to the work undertaken. 
      
      
     49     
     There was no issue that some relationship existed between the appellant and Mr. Terkes. The appellant categorised it as one of agency by which the appellant arranged a contract of employment between Warman and Mr. Terkes; the respondent categorised it as a contract of employment so as to make effective as against the appellant the provisions of s.15(1) of  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
     . In view of our earlier finding that no legal relationship existed between Warman and Mr. Terkes, it is strictly unnecessary to consider further the question of agency. All we need say about it, given the general proposition that the relationship of agency exists where one person (the principal) agrees that the other person (the agent) should act on his behalf so as to affect his relations with third parties (see  
     Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency 
      (16th ed., Sweet & Maxwell, 1996 at art. 1-001), is that there was no evidence in the proceedings to support such a contract. Indeed, to the contrary, the acceptance by Mr. Terkes of the offer of casual employment made by the appellant on 31 October 1995 directly negates any agency and where he applied for a job in response to an advertisement by the appellant for labour.  
      
      
     50     
     It is perhaps trite that the relationship of employer-employee is founded in contract: see  
     Byrne v. Australian Airlines Limited 
      (1995) 185 C.L.R. 410 at 436 per  
     McHugh 
      and  
     Gummow 
      JJ. We do not doubt in the circumstances that there was an intention between the appellant and Mr. Terkes to enter into a legal relationship and that that relationship was pursuant to the terms agreed on 31 October 1995 as set out in the offer of casual employment document earlier referred to. But was it properly characterised as a contract of service between them? In  
     Knowles 
      (89 I.R. at pp.78-79),  
     Wright 
      J. in answering such a question cited and followed with approval the following passages from the judgment of  
     Gleeson 
      C.J. in  
     Connelly v. Wells 
      (1994) 10 N.S.W.C.C.R. 396 at 398; 55 I.R. 73 at 74: 
      
      
       
        
         
         Where the relationship between two persons is founded in contract, the character of the relationship depends upon the meaning and effect of the contract. In the absence of a suggestion that a contract was varied after it was originally made, its meaning and effect must be determined as at the time it was entered into. If the contract is in writing, then the Court which is considering the nature of the relationship between the parties is directed to an examination of the terms of the written agreement in the light of the circumstances surrounding its making ( 
         Narich Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of Pay Roll Tax 
          [1983] 2 N.S.W.L.R. 597 at 601). 
          
          
         In some cases, of which the present is an example, the contract may have been entered into without writing, and in circumstances of considerable informality. This may mean that it is more difficult to reach a conclusion as to when the contract was entered into, and as to the terms of the agreement which the parties made. The conduct of the parties may need to be examined for the purpose of reaching a conclusion as to their common intention as to the terms and conditions on which they were contracting with one another. However, the basic principles remain the same. 
         
        
       
      
      
     51     
     We affirm the correctness of  
     Wright 
      J. in so approaching the issue. Here, the contract was in writing and, so, its nature is to be considered as at the time it was entered into and according to its terms in light of the circumstances surrounding its making. As  
     Gleeson 
      C.J. in making those remarks relied on the judgment of the Privy Council in  
     Narich 
     , and although we have earlier made short reference to that case, it is convenient to recite for present purposes the three principles of law stated therein and formulated by their Lordships from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in  
     Australian Mutual Provident Society 
     , also referred to earlier by us; those principles were stated in  
     Narich 
      ([1983] 2 N.S.W.L.R. at p.601) thus : 
      
      
       
        
         
         The first principle is that, subject to one exception, where there is a written contract between the parties whose relationship is in issue, a court is confined, in determining the nature of that relationship, to a consideration of the terms, express or implied, of that contract in the light of the circumstances surrounding the making of it; and it is not entitled to consider also the manner in which the parties subsequently acted in pursuance of such contract. The one exception to that rule is that, where the subsequent conduct of the parties can be shown to have amounted to an agreed addition to, or modification of, the original written contract, such conduct may be considered and taken into account by the court: see the  
         AMP 
          case (1978) 18 A.L.R. 385, at 392; 52 A.L.J.R. 407, at 411. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         The second principle is that, while all relevant terms of the contract must be regarded, the most important, and in most cases the decisive, criterion for determining the relationship between the parties is the extent to which the person, whose status as employee or independent contractor is in issue, is under the direction and control of the other party to the contract with regard to the manner in which he does his work under it: see the  
         AMP 
          case (at 387; 408). 
         
        
        
         
         The third principle relates to cases where the parties have, as in the present case, included in their written contract an express provision purporting to define the status of the party engaged under it, either as that of employee on the one hand, or as that of independent contractor on the other. With regard to a clause of this kind Lord Fraser of Tullybelton said in the  
         AMP 
          case (at 389, 390; 409): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""Clearly cl.3, which, if it stood alone, would be conclusive in favour of the Society, cannot receive effect according to its terms if they contradict the effect of the agreement as a whole. Nevertheless, their Lordships attach importance to cl.3, and they consider that the following statement by Lord Denning M.R. in  
           Massey v. Crown Life Insurance Co. 
            [1978] 1 W.L.R. 676 correctly states the way in which it can properly be used: 'The law, as I see it, is this: if the true relationship of the parties is that of master and servant under a contract of service, the parties cannot alter the truth of that relationship by putting a different label upon it … On the other hand, if their relationship is ambiguous and is capable of being one or the other [ie either service or agency], then the parties can remove that ambiguity, by the very agreement itself which they make with one another. The agreement itself then becomes the best material from which to gather the true legal relationship between them.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           In the present case, where there is no reason to think that the clause is a sham, or that it is not a genuine statement of the parties' intentions, it must be given its proper weight in relation to other clauses in the agreement."" 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
     52     
     Marks 
      J. below agreed with the appellant that the written offer of casual employment, even though signed by Mr. Terkes on 31 October 1995, was nothing more than an offer of employment as a casual employee; in other words, as his Honour said, the offer ""would be more in the nature of an invitation to treat rather than an offer"". However, his Honour went on to hold ""that when Mr. Terkes accepted any offer of casual employment in a particular position arranged by the defendant, the terms and conditions of that employment would be as set out in … the offer of casual employment document and such other conditions as were agreed either orally or in writing including the precise location, the general nature of duties, time and date of commencement of employment, the amount of remuneration etc."" On that reasoning, and again as his Honour found, ""the contract came into being at the time that Mr. Terkes accepted the offer to perform work at Warman (27 November 1995) and the terms and conditions were established by the offer of casual employment document. There was a clear intention to create an employment relationship"". That employment continued at Warman until 5 January 1996 when Mr. Terkes was injured so that as at that last-mentioned date his Honour found the appellant to be the employer of Mr. Terkes while he was working at Warman.  
      
      
     53     
     We interpose, although it is strictly unnecessary to finally decide in view of the conclusion we have otherwise reached, that we have serious doubts of the correctness of the rejection by  
     Marks 
      J. of any contract between the appellant and Mr. Terkes as from 31 October 1995 and finding a contract only as from 27 November 1995. Indeed, we incline to the view that a contract (whether of service or otherwise is yet to be determined) was made between them on 31 October 1995 which contract continued on a day-to-day basis with Mr. Terkes having the status of a casual. The offer of casual employment, accepted by Mr. Terkes on 31 October 1995, was quite excessive if it was merely an ""invitation to treat"" rather than an ""offer of casual employment"". We think it to be a complete statement of the necessary and relevant conditions for the performance of work once the work be available. The fact the actual work was not then available matters not, it seems to us, and even though work be a necessary ingredient for a contract of service (see  
     Perpetual Trustee Company 
      (85 C.L.R. at p.299)); what matters is that ""work"" must be the object of the contract but which work may be performed at some future time or even from time-to-time. For instance, in  
     The Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. J. Walter Thompson (Australia) Pty. Limited 
      (1944) 69 C.L.R. 227 an issue was whether an employment relationship existed between a company presenting radio plays and artists suitable for the various parts on their selection after rehearsals, fees (wages) being paid for actual performances but not for rehearsals.  
     Latham 
      C.J. in finding the existence of an employer-employee relationship for the whole of the period concerned, including rehearsals, made the following observations (at pp.232-234) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         It was argued that the fact that the terms of engagement provide that there were to be no fees for rehearsals shows that the employment related only to the actual acting on the night of the production of the play. In my opinion this is not the case. The artists were bound under their engagement to attend rehearsals, and were subject to direction during those rehearsals, though no fee was payable unless the performance actually took place. Even on the night of the actual performance, detailed control and supervision by the producer is essential to the performance. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The fact that the artists are not whole-time employees does not show that they are not employees of the company. … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         …  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The employment of a servant may be limited to a particular occasion or may extend over a period. It may be continuous during that period or discontinuous. 
          In the present case the artists are as truly employed for rehearsals as for the final performance, though they receive no pay unless the performance takes place and they then play their parts. They are bound to attend rehearsals as specified in their contract, and are bound to conform to the directions of the producer during those rehearsals. (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
      
     54     
     In the present case, Mr. Terkes was obliged under the contract to contact the appellant each day to ascertain whether work was available and once work had been allocated to him he had to attend the place nominated and undertake the work directed. Thus, during the period when he was not working at a nominated location Mr. Terkes was nonetheless required to make contact with the appellant and was under an obligation to accept work if it were available. In a very real sense, we think, the arrangement (to use a neutral word) settled on 31 October 1995 was the commencement of a period during which Mr. Terkes was to be offered work at the premises of the appellant's clients from time-to-time and during the performance of such work he was to be paid the specified wages; termination of employment was to be on a day-to-day basis depending upon the client's work requirements so that Mr. Terkes and the appellant may reasonably be said to have an ongoing relationship. 
      
      
     55     
     The case of  
     Ryde-Eastwood Leagues Club Limited v. Taylor 
      (1994) 56 I.R. 385 concerned a claim for the reinstatement of a person employed as a casual from time-to-time and who was dismissed while awaiting further casual work. The Full Commission ( 
     Bauer 
      and  
     Hungerford 
      JJ., and  
     Murphy 
      C.C.) of the former Industrial Relations Commission under the  
     Industrial Relations Act  
     1991 held there was jurisdiction to reinstate the person on the basis that he had been dismissed from employment. In presently relevant respects, the Full Commission said (at pp.399, 401-402): 
      
      
       
        
         
         In principle, and using the technical terminology of contract, an enforceable contract may readily be drawn, namely - in consideration of a payment by X to Y, in accordance with the relevant award or enterprise agreement for work actually performed, X agrees to employ Y as a casual employee on work as mutually agreed as and when it arises from time-to-time pursuant to a weekly roster published by X at least seven days in advance of such work and Y agrees to make himself available to perform such work subject to the release of Y allowed by X for illness, holidays and other reasonable cause. Such a contract, in our opinion, would represent an appropriate common law contract of employment to give effect to an ongoing or continuing enforceable contract of casual employment. … 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         It is apparent that two classes of employee colloquially described as ""casual"" can readily be identified in the organisation of industrial relationships. The first class refers to those employees who are truly casual in the sense that there is no continuing relationship between the employer and the employee. The second class is where there is a continuing relationship which amounts to an ongoing or continuing contract of employment; … 
         
        
       
      
      
     56     
     It is not our intention to further the reasoning on this aspect because, as we have said, it is strictly unnecessary to finally rule upon it here. Even so, it is an approach which obviously could well arise in situations comparable to the present and we therefore think it timely to raise it, particularly as it was argued below and was the subject of a finding by  
     Marks 
      J. to a contrary effect. Suffice it for us to simply refer to authorities relating to the preliminary view which we have expressed: see  
     Doyle v. Sydney Steel Company Limited  
     (1936) 56 C.L.R. 545 at 551, 565;  
     Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v. Sunland Enterprises Pty. Ltd. (t/as Sunland Wholesale Meats) 
      [1988] 24 I.R. 467 at 473;  
     Licensed Clubs Association of Victoria v. Higgins  
     (1988) 4 V.I.R. 43 at 49-50; and  
     Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v. R. J. Gilbertson (Qld.) Pty. Ltd.  
     [1988] 26 I.R. 237 at 250. For completeness on this aspect, we would add the observations of  
     Latham 
      C.J. in  
     Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty. Ltd. v. Watson  
      (1946) 72 C.L.R. 435 at pp.452-453, as follows : 
      
      
       
        
         
         The general rule with respect to contracts of employment was stated in  
         Browning v. Crumlin Valley Collieries Ltd.  
         (1926) 1 K.B. 522, at p.528 by  
         Greer 
          J. in the following words ""The consideration for work is wages, and the consideration for wages is work."" In  
         O'Grady v. M. Saper Ltd. 
          (1940) 2 K.B. 469, at p.473,  
         MacKinnon 
          L.J. in the Court of Appeal said: ""It was rightly said … by  
         Atkinson 
          J. ( 
         Petrie v. Mac Fisheries Ltd.  
         (1940) 1 K.B. 258, at p.269), 'The question must depend, as is indicated in the notes to  
         Cutter v. Powell 
          (1795) 6 T.R. 320 [101 E.R. 573] ( 
         Smith's Leading Cases, 
          13th ed. (1929), vol. 11, p.49), on the terms of the contract. ""The right to wages depends upon whether the consideration therefor has been performed.""  
         It is submitted in the notes to that case, as I think rightly, that it must be ascertained from the contract whether the consideration for the payment of wages is the actual performance of the work, or whether the mere readiness and willingness, if of ability to do so, is the consideration.'"" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In the present case, the contract between the parties (clause 5) provides for the payment of salary, expenses, bonuses and commission ""as consideration for his"" (Watson's) ""services and for the faithful observance and performance of the terms and conditions of these presents by him to be observed and performed."" It is therefore, I think, clear in the present case that Watson was not entitled to salary and other payments under the contract unless he did the work of general manager for which the contract provided. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
     (emphasis added) 
     
     
      
     57     
     Dixon 
      J. put the matter in that case in the following way (at pp.465- 466) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         A contract for the establishment of the relation of master and servant falls into the same general category of agreements to pay in respect of the consideration when and so often as it is executed, and is, therefore, commonly understood as involving no liability for wages or salary unless earned by service, even though the failure to serve is a consequence of the master's wrongful act. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Some difficulty has been felt in saying what is the service which carries wages.  
         The wages are incident to the subsisting relationship of master and servant. … They also serve who only stand and wait. 
          … But, broadly speaking, it is enough to say that wages are for the service reasonably demanded under a subsisting relationship of master and servant. (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
      
     58     
     In our opinion, Mr. Terkes and the appellant had a legal relationship according to a contract for the performance of work on a casual basis from time-to-time and where the performance of the work, for which wages would be paid, would depend upon the appellant allocating work to Mr. Terkes according to the requirements of its clients and where Mr. Terkes was obliged to accept such work once it was allocated. That contract came into existence at least from 27 November 1995, but possibly as early as 31 October 1995. It was a contract which was in existence when Mr. Terkes was injured at the Artarmon premises of Warman on 5 January 1996. 
      
      
     59     
     In light of the legal principles referred to by us as developed and formulated in the authorities cited, and in particular  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
     , we entertain no doubt that on the totality of the facts of this case the relationship we have found between the appellant and Mr. Terkes was that of employment pursuant to a contract of employment between them. That relationship was of an ongoing nature at least from 27 November 1995 when Mr. Terkes commenced work at Warman, but arguably as from 31 October 1995 on Mr. Terkes acceptance of the offer of casual employment; it was certainly a subsisting relationship as at the date of the accident at Warman's Artarmon premises on 5 January 1996. Indeed, we are of the view that the facts were, as Mr.  
     Crawshaw 
      suggested, overwhelming to that effect. One may be mindful in this situation, we think, of the words of  
     Somervell 
      L.J. in  
     Cassidy 
      ([1951] 2 K.B. at pp.352-353), referred to with approval by  
     Denning 
      L.J. in  
     Stevenson Jordan and Harrison, Ltd. v. Macdonald  
     [1952] 1  
     The Times  
     L.R. 101 at 111, in dealing with the control test that ""One perhaps cannot get much beyond this 'Was the contract a contract of service within the meaning which an ordinary person would give under the words?' ""  
      
      
     60     
     The written provisions of the casual employment made available by the appellant for Mr. Terkes make it plain to us that all relevant and necessary terms for a contract of employment were in place. The indicia of an employment relationship contained therein were manifest and comprehended award coverage, payment by the appellant of wages for hours worked (including casual loading and annual holiday entitlements), method of payment of wages, engagement by the day, termination of employment on a day-to-day basis dependent on the work requirements, provision for superannuation, adjustment of the rate of pay in accordance with relevant award variations, provision of completed time sheets to the appellant in respect of any work or assignment completed (failure to do so being ""a wilful breach of duty""), notification to the appellant of any absence from work, requirement to wear safety boots/clothing at all times on pain of loss of employment and coverage for workers' compensation benefits.  
      
      
     61     
     As to the control of Mr. Terkes by the appellant, the contract required him to contact the appellant daily to ascertain whether work was available and, once work had been allocated, to attend at the place nominated and undertake the work directed; he was required to do so with dispatch and diligence subject to the supervision of the person nominated by the appellant for that purpose and, importantly, with a direction that he was not to undertake any work for a client not arranged or directed through the appellant. The contract contained stringent provisions for Mr. Terkes to observe proper conduct towards the appellant so as not to cause damage to it, its property or reputation and during employment or subsequently he was not to divulge information relating to the business of any of the appellant's clients where he had worked. 
      
      
     62     
     The evidence of Mr. Terkes in the proceedings was that he regarded himself as an employee of the appellant; for its part, the appellant, as admitted by its Managing Director, said it was the employer of Mr. Terkes: see  
     Pitcher v. Langford 
      (23 N.S.W.L.R. at p.160 per  
     Handley 
      J.A.,  
     Kirby 
      P. agreeing at p.147) for the proposition that admissions as to the true nature of a relationship were admissible and entitled to considerable weight. There was no suggestion, nor on the facts could there be, that the stated relationship between them of employer-employee was a sham. The integrity of the written employment contract was affirmed also by evidence showing that the appellant deducted income tax from Mr. Terkes' wages and issued to him taxation group certificates noting it as the employer.  
      
      
     63     
     If more be needed of the genuineness of a contract of employment, and we do not think it is, after the accident at Warman's factory the appellant reported the injury sustained to its workers' compensation insurer by advice dated 9 January 1996 in which it declared as true and correct that it was the employer and, in a corresponding way, Mr. Terkes' compensation claim dated 8 January 1996 submitted to the insurer showed the appellant as his employer.  
      
      
     64     
     Even though the employment contract was in clear and unambiguous terms, we emphasise that its meaning and effect must be determined as at the time it was entered into absent any suggestion, and none existed here, that the contract was varied after it was originally made: see  
     Connelly  
     (10 N.S.W.C.C.R. at p.398; 55 I.R. at p.74). The agreement between parties as to their relationship for the performance of work is the best material from which to gather the true legal relationship: see  
     Narich 
      ([1983] 2 N.S.W.L.R. at p.601);  
     Australian Mutual Provident Society 
      (18 A.L.R. at p.389; 52 A.L.J.R. at p.409); and  
     Massey 
      ([1978] 1 W.L.R. at p.679). We are satisfied that the true intention of the parties as to the nature of their relationship was as evidenced in the written contract between them. 
      
      
     65     
     The circumstances in which the contract was made involved the prior agreement between the appellant and Warman as set out in the document dealing with the benefits of the appellant's temporary staffing which was replete in its terms, both express and implied, that a person placed with a client was an employee of the appellant. That document, in our view, made it patent that there was an agreement between the appellant and Warman whereby the appellant would provide the services of persons, on a temporary staffing basis as required, to Warman in consideration of Warman paying a fee to it. Mr. Terkes was so made available.  
      
      
     66     
     We have said earlier that an element involved in an employment relationship was that the performance of the work concerned must be for the benefit of the employer. Here, of course, the work performed by Mr. Terkes at Warman's Artarmon factory was subject to regular on-the-job control by Warman as to the work to be performed and how that should be achieved. Indeed, it was that aspect which was at the core of Mr.  
     Macken's 
      case that the control and direction over Mr. Terkes was exercised by Warman so that it was the true employer of him and that was so because the work was for Warman as part of its manufacturing process. As much as that may be, we do not consider mere on-the-job direction of a person necessarily makes that person the employee of the person directing.  
      
      
     67     
     In this case, having in mind the way in which we have formulated the contract between the appellant and Warman, the services of Mr. Terkes were provided to Warman by the appellant in return for a fee and in respect of which it was for the purposes of the appellant's business as a provider of labour. The point was made by the High Court in  
     Accident Compensation Commission v. Odco 
      in which Odco carried on business under the name of Troubleshooters Available (TSA) as a labour agency providing the services of tradesmen to builders. The High Court observed (95 A.L.R. at p.652) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         Once it is accepted that there was (1) an agreement between TSA and the builder for the supply of a tradesman to the builder to do certain work on terms that the builder was to remunerate TSA for supplying the tradesman and for the work which he did, and (2) an agreement between TSA and the tradesman whereby the tradesman agreed to perform work at the site at the builder's direction for remuneration to be paid by TSA, it follows as a matter of plain language that the tradesman supplies services to TSA by attending at the site and doing work there. By attending there and doing work, he supplies services to TSA for the purposes of its business, notwithstanding he also at the same time supplies the same services to the builder for the purposes of its business. 
         
        
       
      
      
     68     
     This same point was made by  
     Kitto 
      J. in  
     Perpetual Trustee Company 
      (85 C.L.R. at p.300), by following the illustration in  
     Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd. 
      (1947) A.C. 1 at 17, that ""the statement that the doing of the work must be for the benefit of the master does not mean, of course, that the direct benefit from the work itself must necessarily accrue to the master; he may, without altering the relationship, direct his servant to do work which will benefit another"". We understand that to be the position here.  
     Baldi & Fletcher Pty. Ltd. v. Rabmar Pty. Ltd.  
     [1988] 25 I.R. 101 further illustrates the point where  
     Clarke 
      J.A., with whom  
     Samuels 
      and  
     McHugh 
      JJ.A. agreed, commented (at p.102) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         It is, I think, beyond argument that Baldi and his accountants organised his affairs in such a manner that he became the employee of Rayneb Pty. Ltd. which provided his services for reward to B&F. In these circumstances it could not be said, as a matter of law, that Baldi was the servant of B&F. He was not. He was the servant of his family company Rayneb Pty. Ltd., which was the entity which entered into the contract or arrangement with B&F.  
         
        
       
      
      
     69     
     And, in our opinion, so it is in the instant case where the services of Mr. Terkes as an employee of the appellant were provided for reward to Warman so that he remained the employee of the appellant and did not become the employee of Warman.  
      
      
     70     
     Taking Mr.  
     Macken's 
      submissions at their highest, the most he could achieve by relying upon what we have found to be the limited degree of control exercised by Warman over Mr. Terkes' work would be to view Mr. Terkes  
     pro hac vice  
     the employee of Warman at the precise time on 5 January 1996 when he was cleaning the sand mixing machine. In  
     Steel Structures Ltd. v. Rangitikei County 
      [1974] 2 N.Z.L.R. 306, the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered the liability of a master to third persons due to the negligence of its employee temporarily under the direction and control of another person. Their Honours put the principle in the following way (at pp.310-311) : 
      
      
       
        
         
         It is well established that there are circumstances in which the permanent employer of a tortfeasor can say that his employee was to such an extent under the control and direction of someone else in authority in a particular operation that a temporary transfer of the employee pro hac vice should be held to have occurred.  
         Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd. 
          [1947] AC 1; [1946] 2 All ER 345, is the classic authority in this area. There, it was said that the burden of establishing such a transfer is a heavy one, and can only be discharged in quite exceptional circumstances. In  
         Denham v. Midlands Employers Mutual Assurance Ltd. 
          [1955] 2 QB 437,: [1955] 2 All ER 561, Denning LJ added that such a transfer rarely takes place when a man is lent with a machine, such as a crane or a lorry, or where a skilled man is lent so as to exercise his skill for the temporary employer. In such cases the parties do not contemplate that the temporary employer shall tell the man how to manipulate his machine or to exercise his skill.  
         O'Reilly v. Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.  
         [1955] 1 WLR 1155; [1955] 3 All ER 382 is an instance of a driver being on permanent loan with his lorry, but even then the Court held that the plaintiffs had not discharged the heavy onus of establishing that the defendants had the right to direct how the particular work was to be done. In New Zealand these principles were applied by this Court in  
         Ferguson Construction Co. Ltd. v. Hargreaves 
          [1973] 1 NZLR 634. There, however, the situation was a little different, for the plaintiff was seeking to recover not only from his permanent employer, the owner of the crane, but also from the hirer of the crane. The difference is adverted to by  
         Salmond on Torts 
          (15th ed.) 619. Nevertheless, all the cases show that the test in all circumstances is one of the right to control not merely what is done but how it is to be done. Each case must necessarily be decided on its own facts, and such observations as those of Lord Denning in  
         Denham's 
          case are better not treated as propositions of law but instead as reflections on the facts of a particular case. 
         
        
       
      
      
     71     
     It will be apparent that whether the employee of the general employer becomes the employee of the particular employer will depend upon the circumstances of the case concerned and where, in any event, such a transfer in employment occurs only ""in quite exceptional circumstances"" and where the obligation to establish a new employment was a ""heavy onus"". The difficulty was adverted to by  
     Lush 
      J. in  
     Poulson  
     (122 L.T.Rep. at p.478) in the following way : 
      
      
       
        
         
         To what extent must the particular employer have taken over the control before he can be said to have become the master, responsible for the acts of the workman as being the acts of his servant? The hirer always gives some directions to the workman. He tells him where the work is to be done and what it consists of. That is not a taking over the control. The hirers in  
         Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool  
         (14 Q.B. Div.890) told the servant what streets to water, but they were held not to have controlled the servant. There must be a taking over by the particular employer of the complete control - a complete transfer of the service - before he can be held to be the responsible employer of the workman. ""The great test,"" said Bowen, L.J., in  
         Moore v. Palmer 
          (2 Times L. Rep. 781, at p.782), ""was this - whether the servant was transferred or only the use and benefit of his work?"" a test which Lord Dunedin adopted in  
         McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners 
          (1911, 2 Ir. Rep. 143). 
         
        
       
      
      
     72     
     The facts of the present case, on any view of them, do not, in our view, demonstrate the degree of control exercised by Warman over Mr. Terkes at the time of the accident as being ""a complete transfer of the service""; on the facts as found, and as  
     Lush 
      J. reasoned, the test is ""whether the servant was transferred or only the use and benefit of his work"". Here, as we have earlier said, the appellant provided the services of Mr. Terkes to Warman but there was no evidence otherwise of a transfer of the employment. It follows, in our view, that when Mr. Terkes was cleaning the sand mixing machine on 5 January 1996 at the Artarmon factory of Warman he was not  
     pro hac vice 
      the employee of Warman but remained the employee of the appellant. 
      
      
     73     
     Finally, we should deal with the submission by Mr.  
     Macken 
      to the effect that the appellant was a ""head hunter"" or an outsourced human resources department of Warman in providing labour, such as Mr. Terkes. We disagree as the submission was not supported by and, indeed, was contrary to the evidence. The submission may be tested by reference to the document setting out the agreement between the appellant and Warman; it expressly provided under the heading of "" 
     TERMINATION 
     "" that ""Staff provided are Swift Placements employees"" and where a client itself employs one of the appellant's employees or former employees on the temporary staff then it ""must notify Swift Placements immediately and may be charged permanent placement fee"". That provision is directly inconsistent with Mr.  
     Macken's  
     submission in that persons placed by the appellant with a client were its employees unless the client engaged them as its employees, either permanently or for a limited period, in which case a placement fee may be charged. In other words, the traditional reward to a ""head hunter"" or labour agency of a placement fee only occurs where the client ceases the temporary placement and assumes full responsibility for the person concerned. That was not the position in the present case. 
      
      
     74     
     It remains only to deal with three recent cases specifically relied upon by Mr.  
     Macken 
      concerning the operations of labour hire companies and the nature of their relationship with persons placed in work with third parties.  
     Marks 
      J. examined those cases in detail and either distinguished them on the facts or disagreed with the conclusion reached. We do not propose to repeat the complex of facts which are set out in his Honour's reasons and will attempt to deal with them as shortly as possible. In that exercise, we are reminded of the comment by the Court of Appeal in  
     Steel Structures 
      ([1974] 2 N.Z.L.R. at p.311) that ""each case must necessarily be decided on its own facts, and … observations … are better not treated as propositions of law but instead as reflections on the facts of a particular case"". 
      
      
     75     
     Accident Compensation Commission v. Odco 
      in the High Court was principally concerned with the liability of a labour agency providing the services of persons to industry to pay a levy under the  
     Accident Compensation Act 
      1985 (Vic.), ss.8, 9; the issue involved the interpretation of those statutory provisions and not, as here is the case, whether the relationship was that of employer-employee. Like  
     Kirby 
      A.-C.J. in  
     Grazcos 
      (12 N.S.W.C.C.R. at p.48), and as his Honour said of it, ""The facts were rather special. I see little analogy to assist in the determination of who was the worker's employer in this case"".  
      
      
     76     
     The second case in this category,  
     Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v. Odco Pty. Ltd. 
      (1991) 99 A.L.R. 735, was before a Full Court of the Federal Court and concerned a claim for relief against a trade union by Odco, trading as Troubleshooters Available and being the entity involved in the earlier High Court proceedings, in respect of inducement to breach contracts and breaches of the  
     Trade Practices Act 
      1974 (Cth.) ss.45D, 45E.  
      
      
     77     
     Shortly stated, Troubleshooters Available provided labour to builders and the persons who worked under the arrangement signed contracts with Troubleshooters Available in which it was agreed that the relationship created was one of principal-independent contractor rather than employer-employee; that agreement was supported by express provisions that the contractors were self employed, not bound to accept any work through Troubleshooters Available, payment was to be for actual on-site hours or a job price, the contractors and not Troubleshooters Available were to be responsible for any liability in respect of insurance,  
     PAYE 
      taxation deductions were expressly forbidden, the contractors had no claims on Troubleshooters Available in respect of holiday pay, long service leave, sick pay or any similar payment, the contractors were to carry out all work in a workmanlike manner, all faulty work had to be made good by them and the contractors were to supply their own plant and equipment, safety gear, boots, gloves or any necessary ancillary equipment. Importantly, the contractors operated either as individuals, persons in partnerships, persons employed by a company or persons employed by a trustee.  
      
     78     
     The Full Court, in upholding the trial judge's decision that the relationship was not one of employment but that of an independent contractor held, following  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
     , that there was an absence of the requisite degree of control by Troubleshooters Available over the contractors and, following  
     Australian Mutual Provident Society  
     and 
      Narich 
      that the written agreement was not a sham and became the best material to gather the nature of the true legal relationship. Significantly, however, the Full Court found no contract of employment between the contractors and the builders for whom the work was performed. If we may say so, with respect, and having in mind our reasoning in the present case, we find the conclusions reached in that case in the Federal Court to be not unexpected as the facts were clearly in marked contradistinction to those before us. 
      
      
     79     
     The third case in this category,  
     Drake Personnel Ltd. v. Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic.) 
      (1998) 40 A.T.R. 304 before  
     Balmford 
      J. in the Supreme Court of Victoria, involved the issue whether persons provided by an employment agency to clients to perform work were the employees of the agency, Drake Personnel.  
     Marks 
      J., in considering that case, commented that the facts bore ""a striking resemblance"" to the facts in the proceedings before him.  
     Balmford 
      J., in considering whether the temporaries were employees as such, dealt with various authorities, including  
     Stevens v. Brodribb Sawmilling 
      and  
     Building Workers' Industrial Union v. Odco 
     . Her Honour held that in performing work the temporary staff were not subject to Drake Personnel's control or directions and there was no reservation of a power in Drake Personnel to require one of its workers to move from one site to another or to work beyond the initial agreed day sufficient to permit a right of control to be found. After reviewing her Honour's reasons, in light of the facts stated therein,  
     Marks 
      J. expressed disagreement with the conclusion that there was no contract of employment between Drake Personnel and the temporary staff. 
      
      
     80     
     Our review of the judgment of  
     Balmford 
      J. does not satisfy us that the facts were relevantly consistent with those in the present case, although one may accept some similarity. For instance, a person on the books of Drake Personnel was not obliged to accept an assignment offered and could not be compelled to do so; also, it is not obvious from the reasons of her Honour whether a written contract was made between Drake Personnel and the temporary concerned nor how and in what way the parties themselves considered the nature of their relationship. A perusal of her Honour's decision seems to us to show that it rested on a view that it was the client who, on the facts, exercised such a degree of control over the work of the temporary as to become the employer. It is not for us independently and separately to make a qualitative assessment of the evidence before her Honour. However, with respect, to the extent her Honour placed greater, almost decisive, reliance on the test of control than we would in the total circumstances, then we disagree with the reasoning and consequent result. Mr.  
     Macken's 
      submission that we should follow the decision in  
     Drake Personnel 
      so as to hold Mr. Terkes not to be an employee of the appellant also was based very much on the single issue of on-the-job control; we decline to accept it. 
      
      
     81     
     For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Terkes was employed by the appellant under a contract of employment within the meaning of the common law principles. The appellant was the employer of Mr. Terkes for the purposes of s.15(1) of the  
     Occupational Health and Safety Act 
      at all relevant times, including on 5 January 1996 when the accident occurred at the Artarmon factory of Warman causing injury to Mr. Terkes. The appeal must, therefore, fail and with the respondent to have the benefit of its costs. 
      
      
     82     
     We make the following  
     orders 
      - 
      
      
       
        
         
         1. The appeal is dismissed. 
          
         2. The stay of the orders made at first instance by  
         Marks 
          J. is set aside. 
          
         3. The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs in an amount as agreed or as assessed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: In this matter on 18 August 1999 the Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice pursuant to s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that he desired to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against sentence pronounced by his Honour Judge Nader at Newcastle District Court on 15 April 1998 when the respondent, Helen Forrester, appeared for sentence on a charge of robbery in company to which she had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    2    For that offence on that occasion his Honour deferred sentence upon condition that the respondent enter a recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years on the ground that she receive a reduced sentence because of her undertaking to assist the law enforcement authorities. She failed to fulfil that undertaking. 
     
      
    3    On 8 April 1999, the respondent came before his Honour Judge Job at Newcastle District Court for sentence on another charge in relation to an offence of in company assaulting with intent to rob and at the time of that assault, wounding. On that occasion, Judge Job was invited to deal with what the Crown claimed was a breach of recognizance imposed by his Honour Judge Nader. 
     
      
    4    His Honour was told on behalf of the respondent that the respondent would no longer give evidence for the Crown and that appeared to be one of the main bases that his Honour Judge Nader gave her a recognizance on that occasion. 
     
      
    5    Judge Job recorded that Judge Nader said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all of the circumstances of this case and especially in view of the last step taken by your client …. I think it would be quite inappropriate to send her to gaol, notwithstanding the extreme seriousness of the offence that she committed.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    6    In respect of that breach of recognizance which his Honour found, Judge Job sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of six months for that offence. 
     
      
    7    On this appeal the Crown has filed submissions which are directed to the sentence imposed by Judge Job on 8 April 1999. On that basis it appears that on its face the appeal as filed was misconceived. Any appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Job by the Crown would be pursuant to s5D of the Act. One of the problems of appealing against any sentence imposed by Judge Nader was that his Honour deferred sentence. 
     
      
    8    When this matter was brought today to the attention of the Crown it was suggested that in reality the appeal was against Judge Job's sentence; the possibility was raised of some amendment being made to the notice of appeal. However, in my opinion, bearing in mind the extraordinary nature of Crown appeals against inadequacy of sentence it is inappropriate for the Court, even if such an amendment were pressed for, to grant it. 
     
      
    9    On the basis that the notice of appeal is formulated in a way which is misconceived, in my opinion, it should be dismissed. 
     
      
    10    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding Judge. It would, I think, have been possible for the Crown to appeal against the order made by Judge Nader on 15 April 1998 because an order pursuant to s558(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 does fall within the extended definition of “sentence” in the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    11    The notice of appeal of 18 August 1999 was prepared on the basis of Judge Nader’s order. However, as the presiding Judge has demonstrated, the case the Crown now wishes to argue is quite a different case, directed not to the order made by Judge Nader but to the sentence passed by Judge Job and based on a different section of the Criminal Appeal Act. I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding Judge. 
     
      
    12    DOWD J: I agree with the orders proposed and the reason therefor of the presiding Judge. I also agree with the remarks of Justice James. 
     
      
    13    SHELLER JA: The order of the Court is the appeal is dismissed.

     REGINA v BJW 
    The respondent was found guilty of five counts of sexual offences against his step-daughter and one count of assault. The complainant was aged between 9 and 23 years at the time these offences were committed. All charges were denied by the respondent and no sign of contrition was shown.At trial, there was evidence that the respondent suffered chronic lower back pain, epilepsy and migraine attacks. He required regular medication. There was also medical evidence that long term imprisonment might contribute to depression. In his remarks on sentence, Ford DCJ gave effect to the medical evidence and “substantially reduce[d] the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed”. His Honour imposed a total effective sentence of 2 years and 8 months. The Crown appeals against this sentence.Held: (by Sheller JA, James and Dowd JJ agreeing)1. The trial judge gave little details of the facts and circumstances of the offences. Nothing was said of the impact of the respondent’s conduct on the complainant.  R v Gebrail (unreported, CCA, 18 November 1994), referred to.2. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing child sexual offenders. This is especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim.  R v Skinner (1994) 72 A Crim R 151, referred to.  R v Hudson (unreported, CCA, 30 July 1998), referred to. Child sexual abuse within family unit discussed.3. The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. However, ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of their health.  R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587, referred to. 4. The trial judge erred by giving an overly generous discount of sentence on account of the respondent’s health. A court cannot determine the bearing which an offender’s illness might have upon sentence in the absence of adequate evidence as to the nature and extent of the illness and its effects upon the conditions of the offender’s incarceration. The medical report tendered by the respondent at trial barely met these requirements. There was nothing to suggest that the Department of Corrective Services, meeting its responsibilities for the health of prisoners, would not be able to adequately treat the respondent.  R v L (unreported CCA, 17 June 1996), applied.  R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570, referred to.5.  The right of the Crown to appeal against a sentence on the grounds of inadequacy is exceptional. However, where sentences imposed are so inadequate as to indicate departure from principle or accepted sentencing standards, they demonstrate an error in principle which the Crown is entitled to have the Court correct. It is insufficient if the Court would itself, in the position of the sentencing judge, have imposed a more severe sentence. Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293, referred to. Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295, referred to. R v Barbara (unreported, CCA, 24 February 1997), referred to. 6. The sentences imposed by the trial judge in this case were so inadequate as to indicate error in the sentencing process. In light of the seriousness of the offences, the mitigating consequence flowing from the respondent’s health condition must only be slight. The sentences imposed were well below the range for the offences found and do not reflect the objective seriousness of the offences. R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349, referred to. 7. In re-sentencing, the Court is bound to take into account the double jeopardy into which the respondent is put for the second time in regard to his freedom beyond the sentence imposed. Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295, applied.8. The respondent was accordingly re-sentenced to a total effective sentence of 5 years with a minimum term of 3 years and 9 months.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: The Director of Public Prosecutions by a notice of appeal signed on 3 August 1999 appeals against sentences pronounced on 18 June 1999 by Acting Judge Ford QC in the District Court at Campbelltown in respect of six offences for which the respondent, BJW, had been convicted. A copy of the notice of appeal was served on the respondent on 18 August 1999.  
     
      
    2    The respondent was indicted on seven counts, the first six of which alleged sexual offences and the seventh assault. In each case the complainant was the same person. On 21 May 1999 the jury returned with verdicts of guilty on six of the counts, counts 1 to 5 and 7, and a verdict of not guilty on count 6. 
     
      
    3    The complainant was born on 31 December 1974. In 1984 the respondent began a de facto relationship with her mother. They were married in 1987. The six offences of which the respondent was found guilty occurred between November or December 1984, when the complainant was 9 or 10 years of age, and 24 January 1998 when she was 23.  
     
      
    4    The first charge was of indecent assault in 1984 when the complainant was under 16 years of age. The charge was laid under s61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, since repealed. The maximum penalty was 6 years penal servitude. The second charge was of carnal knowledge between 28 August and 10 September 1985 of a girl above 10 and under 16 years. This charge was laid under s71 of the Crimes Act, since repealed, and carried a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. The third charge was of sexual intercourse between 4 and 11 July 1987 with a child between 10 and 16 years and under the authority of the respondent. This charge was laid under s66C of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. The fourth charge, laid under the same section, was of sexual intercourse on 30 October 1988 with a child between 10 and 16 years and under the authority of the respondent. The fifth charge was of carnal knowledge between 28 June 1991 and 31 December 1991 of a girl of and above the age of 16 years and under the age of 17 years, the respondent being her step-father. This charge was laid under s73 of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 8 years penal servitude. The seventh charge was of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 24 January 1998 laid under s59 of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 5 years penal servitude. 
     
      
    5    Judge Ford sentenced the respondent as follows. On the fifth count of carnal knowledge by the respondent being the complainant’s step-father when the complainant was 16, his Honour imposed a minimum sentence of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 21 May 1999, the day the respondent was taken into custody, and an additional term of 8 months concurrent with the sentences imposed for the other five charges. On each of the first, second, third and fourth charges, his Honour imposed concurrent fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 21 May 1999. On the seventh charge, he imposed a concurrent fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to commence on 21 May 1999. The term of the total effective sentence was 2 years and 8 months. 
     
      
    6    In his remarks on sentence his Honour gave little detail of the facts of, and circumstances surrounding, the offences of which the respondent was found guilty. This may be explained by the hearing having taken place between 17 and 21 May 1999 and there being no further evidence on sentence apart from a pre-sentence report dated 18 June 1999 and a medical report from Dr Singham of 16 June 1999. At the trial the respondent denied all the charges made against him. The parties on this appeal are agreed that we proceed on the following short statement of facts. 
     
      
    7    The facts giving rise to the first count were that between 1 November 1984 and 31 December 1984, the complainant was living at Lethbridge Park, with her mother and the respondent. On one evening between these dates, the respondent called the complainant to his bedroom. He was lying on the bed. The respondent indecently assaulted the complainant by taking her hand and placing it on his penis. The complainant was aged 9 or 10 years.  
     
      
    8    The facts giving rise to the second count were that on an occasion between 28 August 1985 and 10 September 1985 at the family home at Lethbridge Park, the complainant awoke in her bed to find the respondent on top of her. The respondent started to touch her breasts and vagina. He took her pyjama pants off and sexually assaulted her by penile penetration. The complainant’s mother was then in hospital giving birth to the respondent’s daughter. The complainant was aged 10.  
     
      
    9    Two weeks before Christmas in 1986, the complainant together with her mother and the respondent moved to Werrington Downs. The respondent and the complainant’s mother married on 4 July 1987. The facts giving rise to the third count were that on an occasion at Werrington Downs between 4 July 1987 and 11 July 1987, the complainant was asleep in her bedroom when the respondent came into her bed and sexually assaulted her by penile penetration. He then ejaculated into a handkerchief. The complainant was aged 12 years.  
     
      
    10    The facts giving rise to the fourth count were that on 30 October 1988, when the complainant’s mother was overseas, the respondent had returned home with the complainant after taking her swimming. He then undressed her and sexually assaulted her by penile penetration. The complainant was aged 13 years. 
     
      
    11    The facts giving rise to the fifth count were that when the complainant was working at a restaurant in Penrith between 28 June 1991 and 31 December 1991, the respondent was in the habit of picking her up after work and driving her home. On an occasion after the respondent had picked up the complainant from work, he drove to a location near the Nepean River and sexually assaulted her by penile penetration while in the back seat of the car. The complainant was aged between 16 and 17 years.  
     
      
    12    The facts giving rise to the seventh count were that on the afternoon of 24 January 1998, the respondent was making sexual advances upon the complainant. As a result of her resisting these advances, an argument broke out. The respondent grabbed hold of the complainant by her upper arms and threw her against a wardrobe. The complainant suffered bruising as a result of this incident. According to the sentencing Judge, the complainant had announced that she was leaving home where she had resided with her mother and the respondent. 
     
      
    13    The respondent was interviewed by police. He declined to comment in respect of the indecent assault matters. He admitted that he had engaged in sexual activity with the complainant when she was 16 years and 9 months. He admitted being in an argument and scuffle with her but denied throwing her against a wardrobe. The respondent further stated that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant a number of times after she had turned 16 years and 9 months.  
     
      
    14    The respondent was born on 3 September 1956 and was aged 42 at the time of sentencing. He committed the offences charged when he was aged between 28 and 41.  
     
      
    15    After leaving High School at the equivalent of year 9, the respondent had worked as a truck driver for 12 years until he sustained a work place injury, the result of a motor vehicle accident. He then sought more appropriate employment. For the 4 years up to the date of sentencing, he was on a disability pension because of chronic lower back pain and epilepsy and suffered from frequent migraine attacks. In the past he had required regular medical attention. Since his marriage in 1987 he had lived with his wife and two children who are school aged. He is supported by his wife and family and has no previous convictions. 
     
      
    16    Judge Ford’s remarks on sentence were brief. His Honour observed that the respondent had denied any sexual involvement with the complainant before she reached the age of 16 and said that he had had an affair with her but “the jury obviously did not accept your explanation as regards most of these charges.” His Honour referred to Dr Singham’s report. Dr Singham had known the respondent for a period of 12 years and said the respondent had a long standing history of chronic lower back pain, epilepsy and frequent migraine attacks. He required regular medical attention to control his epilepsy attacks. He was currently on Epilum 500mg and Panadeine Forte. He required regular monitoring for his epilum levels. Dr Singham expressed the opinion that long term imprisonment might contribute to depression. Of this his Honour said that he had no doubt. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
         “Ordinarily of course, these [sic are] very serious offences involving the abuse of a young child and particularly a person who is in your care, you being her step-father and you were her step-father, certainly in 1991, when you committed that offence.” 
        
       
      
    17    The pre-sentence report referred to the respondent’s family and said that, being incapacitated in recent times, the respondent’s attention had centred largely upon his immediate family. Judge Ford referred to the respondent’s work history and said that the respondent clearly did not admit the commission of the offences and showed no sign of contrition. The remarks on sentence then continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of the medical disabilities from which you suffer, you have been assessed as being unsuitable either for a community service order or for periodic detention. It is said that supervision by the Parole Service would be of only marginal benefit. The assessment of you as being unsuitable for community service or periodic detention gives due weight to the seriousness of your disabilities and it means, of course, that any period of imprisonment, full time custody that is, suffered by you would be quite considerably more harsh than it would be if you were fully fit. 
        
       
       
        
        You are now approaching your forty third birthday and you have been incapacitated for the work that you ordinarily performed, now for some years. I propose to give effect to the medical evidence that has been presented here and I will substantially reduce the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed. I propose that you will not serve a minimum period of imprisonment for more than two years.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then imposed the sentences which I have summarised. 
       
      
    18    The Crown complained that the sentencing Judge failed specifically to refer to the facts of the offences proved, citing R v Gebrail (unreported) CCA, 18 November 1994 where at 6 Mahoney JA, with whose reasons both Newman and James JJ agreed, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is, in my opinion, the duty of the trial judge in sentencing in a case such as this to make clear the findings of fact which have been made by him for the purpose of sentencing and the facts upon the basis of which he has assessed sentence: see generally  
        R v Smith 
         (1993) 69 A CrimR 47 at 48;  
        R v Martin 
         (1981) 2 NSWLR 640 at 642.”  
        
       
      
    19    While the inadequacy of description of the facts may be explained by the way the trial was conducted, one consequence is that nothing is said about the impact on the complainant of the respondent’s conduct over these impressionable years of her life. The first two offences were committed when the complainant was aged 9 or 10. This put her at the lower end of the age range for the second offence charged. The second offence was committed in the family home when the complainant’s mother was in hospital. The third and fourth offences were committed when the complainant was aged 12 and 13 and under the authority of the respondent. In the case of the third offence charged, the respondent came upon the complainant when she was asleep. In the case of the fourth count, he took advantage of her mother’s absence overseas.  
     
      
    20    The impact on the complainant, then a child, of these four occasions of sexual abuse, was not mentioned by the sentencing Judge though it can safely be assumed to have been traumatic and appalling. The maximum penalties the legislature has set for such offences reflect community abhorrence of and concern about adult sexual abuse of children. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing such offenders and especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim. See the remarks of Kirby ACJ in R v Skinner (1994) 72 A CrimR 151 at 154. In R v Hudson (unreported) CCA, 30 July 1998 at 3 Sully and Ireland JJ with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Recognition is also given to the fact that children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attack by the male parent and that children have a right to be protected from sexual molestation within the family and that this can only be achieved by the courts imposing sentences of a salutary nature.” 
        
       
      
    21    Similarly, a child aged 13 or younger is virtually helpless in the family unit when sexually abused by a step-parent. All too often the child is afraid to inform upon the step-parent; see generally R v Bamford (unreported) CCA, 23 July 1991 per Lee CJ at CL at 5. The younger the victim the more serious is the criminality; see R v PWH (unreported) CCA, 20 February 1992. 
     
      
    22    The Crown submitted that the respondent’s course of conduct and the repeated nature of the offences made the criminality more serious, see R v Skinner at 151 and that the sentencing Judge gave undue weight to the respondent’s ill health. Taking these matters into account, together with the offender’s position of trust and the absence of any suggestion of remorse, the sentences imposed were said to be manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    23    The structure of the remarks on sentence does suggest that the sentencing Judge gave an overly generous discount on account of the respondent’s health. The respondent’s counsel, in opposing any interference by this Court with the sentences imposed, referred to Dr Singham’s medical report and submitted that this Court had accepted that ill health, such as to cause an offender to experience prison substantially more harshly than otherwise, might cause a sentence to be less than otherwise would have been imposed. In R v L (unreported) CCA, 17 June 1996 the Court (Gleeson CJ, Badgery-Parker and Hidden JJ) said at 6: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that an offender suffers from an illness does not necessarily mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less than the circumstances of the case would otherwise require. It is the responsibility of the executive to provide for the care and treatment of its prisoners:  
        R v Vachalec 
         (1981) 1 NSWLR 351, per Street CJ at 353-4. If a prisoner’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds, the executive is empowered to deal with the situation. Section 53 of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         1989 preserves the Royal prerogative of mercy, and s25A(1) of the Act enables the Offenders’ Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or there are other ‘exceptional extenuating circumstances’:  
        R v Jones 
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 449, per Carruthers J at 457.” 
        
       
      
    24    Their Honours referred to the judgment of King CJ, frequently cited, in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589: 
     
      
       
        
        “The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health, or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender’s health.” 
        
       
      
    25    However, the Court in R v L went on at 8 to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where illness is seen to be relevant to the determination of sentence, its weight must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. Obviously, one of those circumstances will be the seriousness of the offence. In some cases it might lead to a reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate, while in others it might justify a disposition other than a custodial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    26    Their Honours quoted from R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570 at 573 in which this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the conduct in question and any damage to health, or shortening of life.” 
        
       
      
    27    In R v L their Honours said that a court cannot determine the bearing which an offender’s illness might have upon sentence in the absence of adequate evidence as to the nature and extent of the illness and, where appropriate, its effect upon the conditions of the offender’s incarceration.  In the present case, the report of Dr Singham barely met these requirements. There was nothing to suggest that the Department of Corrective Services, meeting its responsibilities for the health of prisoners, would not be able to treat adequately the respondent for the conditions from which he suffered. The only comment about the effect of imprisonment made by Dr Singham was its possible contribution to depression. 
     
      
    28    The respondent sought to distinguish the facts in Skinner, but the principles to be applied are the same. Counsel referred to Judicial Commission statistics but acknowledged that these did not assist in the case of multiple offenders. The respondent relied upon what was said in Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299 and submitted that no error was shown in Judge Ford’s sentencing. 
     
      
    29    The right of the Crown to appeal against a sentence on the grounds of inadequacy is exceptional. However, where sentences imposed are so inadequate as to indicate error or departure from principle, or depart from accepted sentencing standards, they demonstrate error in point of principle which the Crown is entitled to have this Court correct; see Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310; Everett at 300 and R v Barbara (unreported) CCA, 24 February 1997 at 6. The case must be a compelling one before this Court can interfere. It is not sufficient that this Court would itself, in the position of the sentencing Judge, have imposed a more severe sentence. However, sentences outside the permissible range of those the product of a properly exercised sentencing discretion prima facie manifest error; see House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. Even so, in the case of a Crown appeal, there remains a residual discretion as to whether the Court will interfere; R v L at 10. 
     
      
    30    In the present case, the seriousness of the offences of which the respondent was convicted in the circumstances of the case to which I have referred have led me to the conclusion that the sentences imposed were so inadequate as to indicate error by his Honour in the sentencing process. His Honour expressly acknowledged that the offences were very serious. It may be that the exercise of discretion went wrong with the determination substantially to reduce the sentences because of the medical evidence.  
     
      
    31    For present purposes, I accept, despite the sketchiness of the evidence, that full time custody for the respondent would be harsher than it would be if he were fully fit. But the mitigating consequence of this must be balanced against the seriousness of the offences. In that balance, in my opinion, the mitigating consequence is slight. His Honour wrongly treated it as “substantial”. Quite simply the sentences imposed are well below the range for the offences found and do not reflect the objective seriousness of the offences; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A CrimR 349 at 354. Accordingly, the Crown has demonstrated that this Court may intervene to quash the sentences imposed and re-sentence the respondent. No discretionary matter has been advanced nor am I persuaded there is any which should lead us to refuse to do so. 
     
      
    32    On re-sentencing the respondent filed, without objection, and relied upon two affidavits by Mary Spiers Williams, both affirmed on 7 March 2000. To the first of these affidavits are annexed references addressed to the Court from members of the respondent’s family which I have read and which reflect the deponents’ opinions that he is an honest and hard working family man who has done his best to provide a happy and stable home for his wife and children. These references were given in the context that the respondent continues to maintain his innocence of all the offences charged. 
     
      
    33    The second affidavit annexes medical records from the Corrections Health Service. From these it can be seen that in November 1999 on more than one occasion the respondent attended on the Health Service and reported headaches. Our attention was also drawn to reports relating to pain in his hip region which he experienced over ten weeks, back pain which was slowly getting worse and pain at the back of his head. These matters were complained of in August and September 1999. A medical certificate in November 1999 refers to disc and back trouble and recommends a lower bunk on the ground floor. In September 1999, the respondent was referred to a radiology consultant for a CT scan of the “LS spine”. This material shows a continuation of his chronic back problem, which is not surprising, but does not indicate any problem in obtaining appropriate treatment and medication. 
     
      
    34    In cases of this kind, little leniency can be expected for previous good character. The respondent has no other convictions. There remains no sign of contrition. No special circumstance was found by the sentencing Judge or has been advanced to support any reduction of the minimum sentence. In re-sentencing, this Court must, and I do, take into account what the High Court in Everett at 299 referred to as the jeopardy into which the respondent is put for the second time in regard to his freedom beyond the sentence imposed. The hardship of this uncertainty points the Court towards the bottom end of the appropriate range of sentence. The sentences imposed must reflect the total criminality of the offences for which the respondent has been convicted. As I have said, I accept that full time custody will be harsher for the respondent than if he were fully fit and I take this into account. Bearing all these matters in mind, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Ford on 18 June 1999 in respect of counts 2, 3, and 4 be quashed; 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof  
       
       
        
        (a) on count 3 the respondent is sentenced to 5 years penal servitude consisting of a minimum term of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 21 May 1999 and expiring on 20 February 2003 on which date the respondent will be eligible to parole and an additional term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 21 February 2003; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) on counts 2 and 4 the respondent is sentenced to fixed terms of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 21 May 1999 and expiring on 20 February 2003; 
        
       
       
      4. The sentences imposed by Judge Ford in respect of counts 1, 5 and 7 are confirmed; 
       
       
      5. The sentences imposed or confirmed by this Court are to be served concurrently.

     REGINA v Jesse David BLICK 
    Following a robbery during which some cash and a bum bag were stolen, the victim gave the police a description of the offender as a man with a goatee beard. One week later, the victim was shown a bum bag which he identified as the stolen bag. He was also shown photographs of 12 men, including one of the appellant. The photograph of the appellant was the only photograph of a man with a goatee beard. The victim selected the appellant’s photograph as that of the offender. One week later, the victim made a statement in which he referred to his photographic identification and gave a further description of the offender.At trial, the appellant pleaded not guilty. The basis of the Crown case rested on the identification evidence. Howie DCJ refused the appellant’s application to have the photographic identification evidence excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. Following a detailed summing up by the trial judge, the jury returned a guilty verdict and the appellant was convicted of armed robbery. The appellant appealed against the admission of the identification evidence and argued that its admission resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Held: (by Sheller JA, James and Dowd JJ agreeing)1. When an application is made by a defendant to exclude evidence pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act, the judge must balance the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice the defendant. 2. While the product of that process is a judgment analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion, there is a risk of error if a judge proceeded upon the basis that she or he is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated by the legislation. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected.  Moran v McMahon (1985) 3 NSWLR 700, referred to.3. Evidence of identification from photographs is relevant and prima facie admissible. The use of such evidence, however, presents very real dangers at trial. Carusi v R (1997) 92 A Crim R 52, discussed. Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395, discussed.4. The probative value of the evidence in this case was not great considering:-i) the likelihood that the victim had been alerted to the possibility that the offender had been apprehended by being shown the bum bag before being asked to examine the photographs;ii) that a significant feature of the victim’s recollection of the offender was his goatee beard; iii) that only one photograph showed a man with a goatee beard; andiv) that the photograph of the man with the goatee beard was of a different shape and size to the other photographs, giving the impression that it had been cut down for the purposes of the identification examination.  
     
      
      At the same time, the unfair prejudice to the appellant was substantial, especially because the photographic identification placed firmly in the victim’s mind the appellant’s photographic image when the victim came to make a statement and give evidence at trial and because the photographic identification was an essential feature in the Crown case. 
     The trial Judge therefore erred in concluding that the probative value of the victim’s identification evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant’s conviction was quashed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: This appeal by Jesse David Blick is principally directed against the admission by the trial Judge of evidence of identification by photograph of the appellant during his trial on a charge of armed robbery, of which he was convicted, and concerns s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 and whether the evidence should have been excluded because “its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” This particular ground flowed into a more general ground of appeal that the admission of the evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The appellant also claimed, in substance, that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported. 
     
      
    2    The salient facts were these. On 11 June 1998, Nicholas Smail was employed as a sales assistant at Whitewood Warehouse, Brookvale. At 11am on that morning, a man asked Mr Smail for change for $2 which Mr Smail gave him. Present in the shop was another man who was standing to one side. Both men left the shop together.  
     
      
    3    At 3 pm in the afternoon, Mr Smail was in the office area when he heard a loud whack. He looked up to see a man at the counter with a wooden bedpost. This man demanded money from the cash drawer and reached over and grabbed the keys. Mr Smail opened the drawer and handed $200 cash in $50 notes to the man. The man demanded a small black bum bag in the shop which Mr Smail handed over to him. The bum bag contained $300 in cash, a cheque for $69, a Visa card, a couple of EFTPOS bankcards and $200 in change. The robber dropped the bedpost and left the shop.  
     
      
    4    Mr Smail rang the police who arrived shortly afterwards. He described the offender to the police. That description included a statement that the offender had a goatee beard. Mr Smail said in evidence that he thought the robber was the second man standing to one side on the earlier occasion that he described at 11 in the morning.  
     
      
    5    By 18 June 1998, the offender had not been apprehended. One of the investigating police officers, Detective Patison, came to the shop on that day when Mr Smail described to him the bum bag which had been stolen and its contents. Detective Patison then showed Mr Smail various items which Mr Smail identified as the bum bag and part of its contents. Mr Smail was also shown a bundle of photographs. The bundle consisted of twelve photographs of men, including one of the appellant. The photograph of the appellant was the only photograph of a man with a goatee beard. One of the other photographs was of a man with what could be described as a fringe beard which extended from his chin up the back of his cheeks. Mr Smail selected the photograph of the appellant as a photograph of the robber.  
     
      
    6    From 11 June 1998, Detective Patison had a suspicion that the appellant was the robber. That suspicion increased when he was given information on 18 June by a Mrs Pangallo whose son, Nathan, was a friend of the appellant. Mrs Pangallo said that the appellant had stayed at her house for a week beginning on 8 June 1998. On 15 June 1998, she noticed a black jacket in the hallway and as she picked it up, a bum bag fell out of it. In the bum bag were the cheque and various bankcards. She notified the police and subsequently handed the bum bag and its contents to Detective Patison. On 24 June 1998, the appellant was arrested and declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
    7    On 24 June 1998, Mr Smail made a statement in which he referred to the identification by him from the photographs and gave a further description of the offender.  
     
      
    8    The trial began on 24 February 1999. The appellant pleaded not guilty. After the jury had been empanelled, on the appellant’s application to have Mr Smail’s identification by photograph excluded, evidence was taken on the voir dire as to the admissibility of the photographic identification by Mr Smail on 18 June 1998. On 24 February 1999, Judge Howie gave judgment on the appellant’s application. His Honour said that at the commencement of the voir dire he had been asked “to consider the exercise of my discretion principally under s137 of the Evidence Act in relation to the fact that identification in this case was conducted by photographs rather than by an identification parade.” As the application proceeded, reliance was also placed on ss115 and 138 of the Evidence Act. His Honour concluded that the evidence was admissible and there was no basis on which he ought to reject it “in the exercise of my discretion”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         “The simple facts are that on 11 June 1998 a robbery occurred at a store. That robbery was committed by a single person against the victim, that person being armed with an offensive weapon. The person was in clear view of the victim. He was not in any way disguised and certainly no part of his face or body was hidden other than the normal street clothes that the person was wearing. 
        
       
       
        
        There is little doubt in my mind that the victim in this matter had a good opportunity to observe the person who was perpetrating the offence against him subject of course to such matters as fear or anxiety or stress which might affect his ability at that time to record accurately the person who was threatening him. 
        
       
       
        
        But the decision in this matter does not really rest upon what is generally called the observation stage in the identification process except to say this, there is in my view nothing about the observation stage at all which would indicate that the evidence of identification of the accused is in any way unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        A description was given by the victim shortly after to police. That description is in a very general way but clearly indicates features which are consistent with the accused as he appeared at the time according to the evidence which I have before me on the voir dire both as to height, build, race, but in particular by a description that the person who had attacked the victim had what the victim described as a goatee beard. 
        
       
       
        
        Seven days later on 18 June the officer in charge of this matter returned to the store and spoke to the victim. At that stage the officer in charge had been given information which clearly implicated the accused in the commission of the offence. The officer has given evidence before me and quite frankly has stated that even from 11 June he had a suspicion that the accused was the person responsible. That suspicion increased dramatically when on 18 June he was given certain information as to the accused being in possession at about the time, or shortly after, the offence of the proceeds of the robbery. There is some dispute about that evidence but the Crown intends to call evidence which the jury could find would indicate that at a period shortly after the robbery the accused was present in a house for some period and that after the accused had left that house there was found in that house the bag and some of the proceeds of the robbery which were stolen by the robber. 
        
       
       
        
        On 18 June the police officer approached the victim at the store, and at some stage asked the victim to have a look at a set of photographs. Also about that time he asked the victim to have a look at a bag and items which had been located at the premises to which I have earlier referred and which he had with him at that stage. It is unclear unfortunately now whether the victim was shown the bag and the items before he was shown the photographs. It does not seem to me however that the resolution of that matter or the existence of that confusion is very significant in the determination of this issue. 
        
       
       
        
        The photographs that were shown to the victim are of a number of young men, one of whom is clearly the accused. Those photographs all appear generally to fit the description given by the victim except that there is only one person in that array of photographs who can in any way be described as having a goatee beard. That person is the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        Otherwise it does not seem to me to be a particularly unfair set of photographs, no more so than is very often the case with photographs shown to victims in these circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        A short time thereafter the victim made a statement on 24 June in which he referred to the identification by him from the photographs and gave a further description of the offender. That description is a little fuller perhaps than the description he earlier gave but not substantially different, but of course that description is unreliable because it was a description given after he had seen the photographs. For some reason which is not apparent and seems quite inexplicable the victim made a statement on 18 June, the day he was shown the photographs and the purse, but does not mention the fact that he had made an identification of the accused from the photographs.” 
        
       
      
    9    Detective Patison, on the voir dire, said that the reason he decided to embark upon identification by photographs rather than attempt to hold an identification parade was that as at 18 June, he was unaware of the whereabouts of the appellant even though he had made what the Judge considered to be reasonable enquiries to find him. Detective Patison therefore decided that he would show the photographs to the victim rather than have the matter delayed any longer on the chance of having the appellant arrested and the appellant agreeing to participate in an identification parade. Detective Patison indicated that he obtained the photographs from records he had available to him and chose those photographs which best fitted the description given by Mr Smail. Judge Howie observed: “Unfortunately however, there were few if any photographs of persons with goatee beards and moustaches.” His Honour went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already indicated that there is some other evidence other than the evidence of the identification of the accused which would tend, or might tend, to suggest that the accused was the person who committed the crime. There is no doubt however that if the identification evidence is not admitted there is no evidence upon which the Crown could proceed. The other evidence in my view could not prove that the accused was the robber. However, it also seems to me that that other evidence is admissible to a certain extent and is evidence which could be used by the jury to support the identification.” 
        
       
      
    10    Dealing with the application based on s115, his Honour said that he had come to the conclusion that the photographs did not of themselves reveal that they were pictures of persons in custody. In his view, s115 did not apply. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Therefore the matter comes down to my discretion. Firstly, I have been asked to find that the evidence of the identification was improper in accordance with s138 of the Evidence Act. In my view I am not satisfied at all that there was any impropriety in what the police officer did.”  
        
       
      
    11    The Judge pointed out that Detective Patison was in a difficult situation. On the one hand he had only one identifying witness. If he embarked upon photographic identification, there was no doubt he would not thereafter be able to have a meaningful identification parade. On the other hand, he had time running against him. He had over a period of a week made enquiries and investigations in an attempt to find the accused and had failed. He had been given information on that very day which indicated that the accused had left a particular address where he had been staying over this period. He had made enquiries and had been told that the accused was not living at his home. On the one hand Detective Patison could wait to see what would happen and hope that the accused was arrested shortly thereafter. On the other hand he could attempt an identification at a time when it could be reasonably expected that the victim would have a clear recollection of the robber. 
     
      
    12    Having put aside s138, his Honour continued: “The question then really comes down to the exercise of my discretion.” He referred to Carusi v R (1997) 92 A CrimR 52. That case dealt with the identification of an offender from photographs at common law and by reference to the “Christie discretion” (R v Christie [1914] AC 545 at 559 and 564) whereunder a trial judge could exclude any evidence where its prejudice to the accused outweighed its probative value. In Christie at 559 Lord Moulton said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law is so much on its guard against the accused being prejudiced by evidence which, though admissible, would probably have a prejudicial influence on the minds of the jury which would be out of proportion to its true evidential value, that there has grown up a practice of a very salutary nature, under which the judge intimates to the counsel for the prosecution that he should not press for the admission of evidence which would be open to this objection, and such an intimation from the tribunal trying the case is usually sufficient to prevent the evidence being pressed in all cases where the scruples of the tribunal in this respect are reasonable. Under the influence of this practice, which is based on an anxiety to secure for every one a fair trial, there has grown up a custom of not admitting certain kinds of evidence which is so constantly followed that it almost amounts to a rule of procedure.” 
        
       
      
    13    The comment has been made (see for example Ritchie’s Supreme Court Practice, para 4235.2) that at common law, a trial judge in criminal proceedings had a discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice that could follow from its admission. In contrast, s137 made it mandatory to exclude such evidence.  
     
      
    14    In R v Edelsten (1990) 21 NSWLR 542 at 551 this Court (Carruthers, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ) referred to the trial Judge’s discretion as one to exclude evidence that is technically admissible. Even though the evidence is admissible the trial Judge had a discretion to reject it.  
     
      
    15    Judge Howie observed of Carusi that there were many matters to be taken into account in the exercise of “this discretion” including the reasons why an identification parade was not undertaken and why preference was given to a photographic identification, the time at which it occurred and the circumstances surrounding it. His Honour concluded that he ought to apply that case and that no suggestion had been made to him otherwise. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In applying that case one of the considerations I have to take into account is [the] principle that this identification by photographs occurred at a time when the accused was well and truly a suspect for the commission of this offence. I have no doubt if the accused walked into the shop at that date on 18 June prior to the photographic identification he would have been arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        Therefore prima facie, the weight of the argument would tend to favour rejection of the evidence. On the other hand one of the factors which the court says that can be taken … into account in allowing for the admission of the evidence notwithstanding that it has taken place at that stage, is the fact that the accused was not available for the purposes of an identification parade at that particular time. 
        
       
       
        
        It also seems to me that it would be highly unlikely that police officers would be able, with ease, to gather a number of people together who would look like the accused, that is persons who would have facial hair which the accused shows in the photograph and which was observed by the victim in this matter. I feel it highly unlikely that the police could have a fair identification parade if they could not, as is, apparent find sufficient photographs which would have the same characteristics in their files.” 
        
       
      
    16    The Judge reiterated that there did not seem to be anything improper in what the police did but said that he was sitting to determine “whether or not to exercise my discretion to reject this evidence.” Amongst the factors he considered were the difficulties involved in identification evidence by way of photograph and the prejudicial aspects involved which he referred to. One such matter was that only one photograph showed a person with a goatee beard and that photograph was notable by reason of its shape, that is to say the shape of the photograph as a whole which was narrower and different from the shape of any of the other photographs.  
     
      
    17    Again the Judge referred to the exercise of discretion and R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A CrimR 190. His Honour said that generally “the discretion will be exercised where the trial judge believes that he or she cannot properly direct the jury in relation to the identification evidence pointing out, as is required under s116 of the Act and by the decision of the High Court in Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555, all of the matters which would tend to indicate that the identification process is unreliable in some way.” His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some of those matters will be more apparent to a jury than others. In my view it will be readily apparent to a jury that the identification process in this case in relation to the recognition stage is flawed in that the only person who is shown in the photographs having a goatee beard and a moustache is the accused. Also that the accused’s photograph is clearly different in shape and size to the other photographs in the array. The jury will no doubt be warned by myself during the course of the summing up as to that matter and told to take it into account when assessing the reliability of the identification evidence given by the victim in this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        As I have already indicated, there does not seem to me to be very much at all that can be said to the jury about the recognition stage in the identification process apart from those matters to which I have already referred. The recognition stage occurred only seven days later and it is for the jury to look at the photographs and form their views as to whether or not that was a fair representation from which a proper and reliable identification can be taken and it would be apparent as I say to the jury the defects in that aspect of this identification process. 
        
       
       
        
        The matter has troubled me to some degree because of the difficulty of knowing when one should intervene and exercise the discretion to reject the identification evidence which is otherwise probative and when one should leave it to the jury and trust the good sense of the jury and the directions and cautions that the trial judge has to give them. I am satisfied that this is a proper matter to go to the jury. I do not believe that there is any reason for me to exercise my discretion by reason of the fact that a photographic identification process was conducted rather than a line-up in light of the fact that the police officer believed that he could not locate the accused. I take into account of course that the accused was in fact located only seven days after the identification occurred, but there was nothing as I understand it in the evidence, nothing placed before me, to suggest that the accused was in the area or in the vicinity or would be located shortly thereafter. The police officer as I have already indicated was in the difficult situation of determining when it was that an identification process other than a line-up should take place. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, therefore, the evidence is admissible and there is no basis on which I ought to reject the evidence in the exercise of my discretion.” 
        
       
      
    18    At common law a trial judge on the tender by the prosecution of photographic evidence to identify an accused person had first to determine whether the material was admissible. If it was, then on the Christie principle, the judge could refuse to admit it if of the view that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice to the person accused. Section 137 makes inadmissible evidence adduced by the prosecutor in circumstances which are of the same kind. Confusion in approach is fuelled by the fact that s137 finds its place in Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act which is entitled “Discretions to exclude evidence”. Also in that Part is s135 under the heading “General discretion to exclude evidence” which is expressed in terms of a power vested in the court and not in terms of a mandate to the court.  
     
      
    19    When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion; see the cases referred to by Priestley JA in Moran v McMahon (1985) 3 NSWLR 700 at 716 and following, particularly Lee Transport Co Limited v Watson (1940) 64 CLR 1 at 13 and Miller v Jennings (1954) 92 CLR 190 at 197. In the second of those cases, Dixon CJ and Kitto J, in an appeal against damages awarded by the trial judge, said of the sum awarded that it was “reached after a very full and careful examination of the facts of the case and it represents an informed judgment upon a matter which must largely be one of opinion and must be governed to a not inconsiderable degree by an estimate formed of the witnesses and in particular the appellant.” Translated to the task set by s137, a trial judge’s estimate of how the probative value should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice will be one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge’s own trial experience. In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment; see Heydon, ‘A Guide to the Evidence Acts’, 2nd ed, para 3.725. 
     
      
    20    Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected.  
     
      
    21    It is not clear that the Judge in this case so approached this evidence. But no point was taken about the matter and apparently at the trial, the parties proceeded upon the basis of what had been said by the Court in Carusi. I shall say no more about it. 
     
      
    22    The appellant relied on three grounds of appeal in the notice of appeal. The third ground, that the sentence was manifestly excessive, has been abandoned. The first was, in substance, that the trial Judge erred in allowing evidence of Mr Smail’s photographic identification of the appellant to go to the jury, and in particular erred in not rejecting it at the end of the voir dire. Counsel for the appellant developed this ground in a number of ways directed to the effect that the photographic identification would have in shoring up what was said to be a less than satisfactory verbal identification by Mr Smail on the date of the robbery and in making the evidence of identification in the statement given after the photographs had been examined and at trial of little worth. Such submissions point up the problems of photographic identification discussed by Hunt CJ at CL in Carusi with reference to what was said by the High Court in Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395.  
     
      
    23    In Carusi Hunt CJ at CL said that it is now beyond question that evidence of identification from photographs is relevant and therefore prima facie admissible. But, the use of such evidence presents very real dangers at the trial. His Honour referred to the inability of the accused, by contrast with a situation when an identification parade is held, to litigate any weaknesses in the way in which the photographic identification is made. Other dangers relate to the defects in the use of the photographs themselves, the “rogues gallery” effect, the “displacement” effect by which a witness may subconsciously permit the photograph to displace his or her memory of the offender and the limitations of the photograph itself. The Chief Judge said that the result is that there is always the danger that the jury will give to evidence of an identification from photographs a greater weight than it deserves. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “When that is added to what has been described as the seductive effect of identification evidence generally, ( 
        Domican v The Queen 
         at 561) the danger of the prejudice to the accused by its admission (for the reasons already outlined) is considerably heightened. Such prejudice can sometimes be lessened (but rarely removed) by appropriate directions to the jury. However, identification evidence (as with any other evidence) is subject to the common law ‘ 
        Christie 
        ’ discretion, whereby the trial judge may exclude any evidence where its prejudice to the accused outweighs its probative value. That discretion plays a large part in all identification cases, and one test as to whether evidence of identification generally should be excluded is whether the quality of that evidence falls short of the point where its frailty or frailties cannot be cured by an appropriate direction or caution to the jury. Such evidence is also subject to another common law discretion whereby evidence may be excluded where the use of the evidence would result in an unfair trial for the accused.” 
        
       
      
    24    In considering probative value, one must consider, it seems to me, the likelihood, as counsel for the appellant submitted, that Mr Smail had been alerted to the possibility that the offender had been apprehended by being shown, before he was asked to examine the photographs, the bum bag which he recognised and its contents which included some of the items which had been stolen.  
     
      
    25    At that time, a significant feature of Mr Smail’s recollection of the offender was that he had a goatee beard. He may well have expected to find a photograph of a suspect in the bundle of photographs. Amongst the twelve he was asked to examine, the only one of a person with a goatee beard was that of the appellant. Furthermore, it was a photograph which gave the impression of having been substantially cut down for the purpose of the identification examination. I do not see how it could be said that an identification obtained by such a process was of great probative value. At the same time it results in unfair prejudice to the appellant. But it was not the probative weight of the evidence which gave rise to the prejudice; compare R v Truong (1996) 86 A CrimR 188 at 195. The prejudice to the appellant remained high although the method of obtaining the identification evidence greatly diminished its probative value. There lay its unfairness. 
     
      
    26    In his careful summing up which dealt at length with the question of identification, Judge Howie told the jury that the real issue which required their determination was whether the robber was the accused and that issue depended “upon the identification of the photograph of the accused as the robber by Mr Smail. That evidence of identification is at the very heart of the Crown case, it is really the basis of the Crown case, and without it you cannot convict the accused.” In this context, his Honour pointed out to the jury that no other person in the array of photographs had any significant facial hair at all and told them to “look carefully at the range of photographs when assessing whether this was a reliable way of having the witness identify the robber.” As his Honour said, had Mr Smail identified a person with a goatee beard rather than the person who robbed him.  
     
      
    27    In Alexander the High Court, as well as pointing out the various difficulties involved in identification from photographs, pointed up that often photographic identification is a necessary if not essential tool in criminal detection. At 400 Gibbs CJ said of an identification parade held for the purpose of identification that  
     
      
       
        
        “it goes without saying that precautions must be taken to ensure that no prompting, suggestion or hint is given to the witness that any particular member of the group is the suspect. For example, it would be unfair and improper to show to a witness, before the identification parade was held, a single photograph of a person who was said to be the suspect, and it would be unsafe to act on evidence of identification given in those circumstances:  
        R v Russell 
         (1977) 2 NZLR 20 at 27.”  
        
       
      
    28    Judge Howie accepted that in the present case, particularly to achieve identification early rather than later and when the whereabouts of the suspected robber were not known, to choose to have Mr Smail identify the robber by the examination of photographs was not improper or unreasonable. There is no reason to challenge this conclusion. But, unfortunately, to show Mr Smail a group of photographs in which only one was of a man with a goatee beard, when that was an identifying factor in Mr Smail’s mind, is, in my opinion, little better than showing him only one photograph, the photograph of the appellant. The prejudice to the appellant was both unfair and very considerable because it placed firmly in the mind of Mr Smail the photographic image when he came to make his statement and to give evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    29    The probative value of an identification in those circumstances was particularly low. The unfair prejudice was substantial particularly when it is remembered that the photographic identification was an essential feature in the Crown case. In my opinion, on the application to reject the identification evidence based on the photograph, there could only be one conclusion and that was that the probative value of Mr Smail’s identification evidence by reference to the photographs was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Accordingly, the Court was bound to reject that evidence. 
     
      
    30    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Quash the conviction of the appellant; 
       
       
      3. Direct that a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered. 
       
       
      
    31    JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Sheller JA in draft form. I agree with his Honour’s judgment and with the orders proposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    32    DOWD J: I have seen the judgment of Sheller JA in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and the reasons given for such orders.

     REGINA v Gordon James CROCKER 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence. On 7 August 1998 the applicant, Gordon James Crocker, was sentenced by Hulme J on four charges to which he had pleaded guilty. Three of the charges related to offences committed on 3 June 1997. The fourth charge was that, on or about 13 June 1997, the applicant murdered Robert William Campbell. For that offence under s18 of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty is penal servitude for life, or twenty-five years.  
     
      
    2    The offences committed on 3 June 1997 at Fairy Meadow were, first, that in company with two others the applicant robbed Barry Raymond Thompson of cash, keys and a wallet and, immediately before, inflicted grievous bodily harm on him. Under s98 of the Crimes Act, the offence charged carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years penal servitude. 
     
      
    3    The second charge was that the appellant stole Mr Thompson's motor vehicle. Under s154AA of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for that offence was ten years penal servitude. 
     
      
    4    The third charge was that the applicant maliciously destroyed the vehicle by fire. Under s195 (b) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for that offence was ten years penal servitude. 
     
      
    5    The sentences Hulme J imposed were as follows: for the offence of robbing and inflicting grievous bodily harm, fifteen years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of twelve years, commencing on 17 June 1997 and ending on 16 June 2009, and an additional term of three years. For each of the offences of stealing and maliciously destroying Mr Thompson's motor vehicle, his Honour imposed a fixed term of fifteen months penal servitude, commencing on 17 June 1997. For the offence of murder, his Honour imposed a total term of imprisonment of fifteen years, comprising a minimum term of ten years, commencing on 17 June 2009 and concluding on 16 June 2019, and an additional term of five years.  
     
      
    6    In his remarks on sentence, his Honour said that the aggregation of sentences and the period during which the prisoner will be institutionalised constituted special circumstances justifying the additional term forming a longer than usual proportion of the sentence. In the result, the effective term of imprisonment was one of twenty-two years by way of minimum term and a further five years by way of additional term.  
     
      
    7    Objectively, the charges of murder and robbery in company and having causing grievous bodily harm are serious, as the maximum statutory penalties indicate - indeed extremely serious. 
     
      
    8    The circumstances in which the applicant perpetrated the offences charged were horrific. They are set out in detail in Hulme J’s remarks on sentence. What his Honour said about them has not been challenged on this application.  
     
      
    9    On the night of 3 June 1997, the applicant drove to a park with two friends with the intention of mugging someone. The applicant carried, as a weapon, a steering lock. One of the three having engaged the victim Mr Thompson in conversation, the applicant attempted to grab him and then hit him with the steering lock around the face. He repeatedly hit the victim to keep him quiet and continued to do so when the victim was on the ground. He hit the victim between ten and sixteen times and desisted only when pushed away by one of the others. The offenders took the victim's keys and opened his car and took his wallet, the contents of which they shared amongst themselves. Later, they returned and took the car to an isolated place and burnt it. They left the victim in the park to his fate. It is hard to imagine a more cowardly and brutal attack. 
     
      
    10    The sentencing Judge said the offences, objectively considered, fell well within the upper range of seriousness, although not at the extreme end of that range. The offence was planned and the harm at the high end of the range. His Honour said the offences of stealing and maliciously destroying Mr Thompson's vehicle were committed after further thought and, in one case, a conscious attempt to avoid the consequence of what had previously occurred. 
     
      
    11    The victim was found later that night in the park and, fortunately, survived. He was taken to hospital unconscious. He had multiple jagged lacerations, mainly over the left side of his scalp, with a single laceration over the right side. He had an extensive skull fracture running from front to back over the vertex of the skull. A CT scan showed extensive subarachnoid blood over the left hemisphere, with cerebral contusions.  
     
      
    12    Mr Thompson's condition deteriorated over a number of days, until it appeared to be hopeless. Despite that, his condition improved over a period. About three weeks after the attack, he had to be re-admitted to intensive care. He returned to a normal ward on 3 July. By 2 August, he was able to walk a few metres with the help of a frame and two people. He was starting to produce occasional intelligible words. A report of 16 June 1998 from his treating neurosurgeon said he had made an amazing recovery. His speech was almost normal and his memory for recent events reasonable. He still had problems with fine movements of his right upper limb. There was mild weakness of his right lower limb. He could not fully straighten his right knee and had no motor function around his right ankle. Mr Thompson was not able to be left on his own and was still residing at a halfway house, going home on weekends. 
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    13    The neurosurgeon's view was that it would be impossible for Mr Thompson to resume his former occupation and, while he might be able to gain some employment, it would be limited to fairly simple tasks that do not require any complex mental processes. 
     
      
    14    Mr Thompson previously worked for the Commonwealth Bank and, at the time he was assaulted, he was aged fifty. 
     
      
    15    When arrested on 17 June 1997, at his recorded interview, the applicant denied the offences involving Mr Thompson and his car. However, later on that day he admitted his involvement.  
     
      
    16    On the afternoon of 13 June 1997, having consumed quantities of tablets he described as “like Valium” and beer, the applicant decided to go and rob someone because he needed some speed. He armed himself with a screwdriver and went to a park where he came upon Mr Robert Campbell at about 11.30pm. He spoke to and had some drinks with Mr Campbell. They talked for some time, amongst other things, about credit cards. One can infer that the applicant was trying to find out the pin numbers of Mr Campbell's credit cards. Mr Campbell gave him some information then stood up to go. The applicant grabbed Mr Campbell and pulled out the screwdriver. He put it to Mr Campbell's throat and demanded his cards and PIN numbers, threatening to kill him if he did not comply. One card was produced, otherwise Mr Campbell refused to comply. The applicant pushed the screwdriver harder against Mr Campbell's throat until it went in. The applicant then went into a frenzy and stabbed Mr Campbell about the throat, face and head forty-seven times. He then removed a card which had a paper slip with a PIN number on it and went to a bank and withdrew $200 from Mr Campbell's account at an ATM. An attempt to use another card failed. 
     
      
    17    The applicant went home, dropping the cards and some of Mr Campbell's other personal possessions in a drain. 
     
      
    18    Arriving home at about 2.30am, the applicant washed his hands and the screwdriver in an attempt to remove Mr Campbell's blood, returning the screwdriver to the kitchen drawer. He changed and rinsed his clothes, which had blood on them, and left them in the laundry to soak. He then took a taxi to Port Kembla and used part of Mr Campbell's money to buy speed. He then returned home.  
     
      
    19    When questioned on 18 June 1997 the applicant freely admitted his involvement in Mr Campbell's murder. 
     
      
    20    At the hearing on sentence, the sentencing Judge was provided with a number of psychiatric and psychological reports. From these it appears that the applicant came from a dysfunctional family. He alleged that he had been sexually assaulted when at an age between nine and eleven. He left school at the age of fifteen and had been unemployed since the age of seventeen. His substance abuse began when he was about nine or ten. The sentencing Judge said that he seemed to have been a heavy drug user by the time of the offences with which we are now concerned. Hulme J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With some variation in type, the prisoner seems to have been a heavy user of the drugs which I mentioned until the commission of the subject offences. He seems not to have used heroin or LSD, except at times when he has been in gaol.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21    The medical reports also suggest that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder of significant severity. At the time of commission of these offences, he was, it appears, disinhibited by alcohol and benzodiazepines. Hulme J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing to suggest that the prisoner will not revert to a life of drug-taking on his release….” 
        
       
       
      
    22    At the time of sentencing the applicant was aged twenty-seven. His criminal history began when he was about twelve. The sentencing Judge observed that, until 1992, the offences for which he had been found guilty were of a minor nature in the scheme of things. 
     
      
    23    From the remarks on sentence it is difficult to assess, and indeed the sentencing Judge found it difficult, the prison history of the applicant with any degree of certainty. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The pattern is clear. For years the prisoner's life has been dominated by drug-taking, and he has supported it by crime, although he has largely eschewed violence. The more serious of the instant offences were uncharacteristic in that respect.” 
        
       
       
      
    24    His Honour referred to a victim impact statement which was before him from the Thompson family. The sentencing Judge carefully set out in his remarks the principles on sentencing to be applied. He said that the applicant's chances in life from an early age had been far less than those of most people. He acknowledged the applicant's pleas of guilty. He acknowledged that the applicant was still moderately young. His Honour did not regard the fact that the offences were committed under the influence of drugs as a mitigating factor. He stressed the need for general deterrence. He found that on both occasions, the surrounding facts and circumstances suggested that the applicant, at the time of committing them, was in considerable possession of his faculties. His Honour paid particular attention to the cases which demonstrate that, in imposing sentence on offences of the sort here in question, regard has to be had to the gravity of the offences, looked at objectively. His Honour also took into account the principle of totality. 
     
      
    25    When his Honour came to impose sentence in respect of the offences of stealing and maliciously destroying Mr Thompson's motor vehicle, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These offences were committed after further thought and, in one case, in a conscious attempt to avoid the consequences of what had previously occurred. By the terms of the legislation, they are themselves deserving of significant penalty. However, I think the appropriate way of dealing with the prisoner's criminality on 3 June is to impose, in respect of the robbery charge, a penalty which reflects the overall criminality on that day and, in respect of the lesser charges, sentences concurrent with that imposed on the robbery charge. In these circumstances, the length of those sentences is probably insignificant.” 
        
       
       
      
    26    On this application Mr Byrne SC appeared for the applicant. He developed in oral submissions what had already been before the Court in the applicant's written submissions. The nub of those submissions was that the overall sentence was excessive and the sentence imposed in relation to the robbery was excessive. Expressly no challenge was made to the sentences for 3 June and the sentence of murder being cumulative, nor was any challenge made to the sentence imposed for murder. 
     
      
    27    Mr Byrne submitted that the s98 sentence for the robbery was excessive, standing alone, and in the course of that submission made the further point that, whereas the minimum sentence was twelve years, the additional sentence was three. In that regard, an argument was advanced related to what used to be referred to as the statutory norm of sentencing under s5 of the Sentencing Act 1989. It is perhaps important immediately to refer to what this Court said in R v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376. In the course of that judgment and by reference to s5(2), their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The language of the provision is clear. The additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term unless the Court considers there are special circumstances. The statute does not provide that the additional term must be less than one-third of the minimum term.” 
        
       
      
    28    It is also worth observing, whereas the statute requires reasons to be given if the additional term is to exceed one-third of the minimum term, or if a fixed term is to be imposed, there is no such statutory requirement in relation to reasons if the additional term to be imposed is less than the minimum term.  
     
      
    29    In support of the submission that the s98 sentence was excessive, we were taken to statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for the period from 9 January 1990 to July 1999. Those statistics related to s98. It was pointed out that out of the full terms of all offenders for 105 cases, only three of those terms exceeded the fifteen years here imposed by Hulme J. It was also pointed out that, for the same number of offenders, only one of the minimum fixed terms exceeded the minimum of twelve years imposed by Hulme J. 
     
      
    30    Finally, in statistics showing full terms (one count priors, different type, plead guilty) only one case out of thirty-one in the statistics was above the term of fifteen years. The trouble with those statistics in regard to the sentence imposed here is that, as Hulme J made plain in the passage that I have quoted from his remarks on sentence, the sentence imposed took account of the total criminality of the 3 June 1997 offence, which included not only the s98 offence but also serious crimes after further thought of stealing Mr Thompson's car, and then burning it, offences which, as I have said, carry maximum penalties of ten years penal servitude. 
     
      
    31    I do not regard the statistics produced as having any useful significance in the circumstances of this application. 
     
      
    32    Before coming to the various matters specifically that were raised by way of subjective considerations, I should refer to what was described as a surprising omission from the remarks on sentence, namely, any reference to the evidence given by the applicant on sentencing. In this regard, we were taken to the following passage in the applicant's evidence in chief. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you want to say anything to the relatives of these people? A. That I’m sorry. I really didn't know what I was doing. I'm sorry for, like the victim and their families, and my family too. Because I thought they went through a lot of - everyone is involved. I've put them through heaps, even myself. It's almost weekly I'm seeing people getting bashed and stabbed and it's just horrible. Especially when you're just seeing it.” 
        
       
      
    33    Earlier, the applicant had been asked as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Plainly, one factor that his Honour will consider as well, if you are shown any leniency, will this sort of behaviour happen again? A. Never. It can never happen again. I can assure you.” 
        
       
      
    34    In the course of his cross-examination he was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In response to your counsel you indicated that in the future you thought this could never happen again; why do you say that? A. Because I got off the drugs. I wouldn't be in that position to do it ever again. I'm not like that at all. I wouldn't do it.” 
        
       
      
    35    Mr Byrne referred to the fact that the additional term for the s98 offence was three years, as compared with a twelve-year minimum term. It was suggested that in the absence of any reasons or explanation in his Honour's remarks, this could be simply a mistake. Similarly, the point was made that the total sentence effectively involved a term of twenty-two years full-time custody and an additional term of only five - again, without any acknowledgment or reason for what was said to be a departure from the conventional sentencing structure. I do not accept that there was any such possibility. As I have indicated, there was no statutory requirement that his Honour give reasons and indeed when I come to examine the sentence as a whole, it will be apparent that I do not regard these so-called departures as of any significance at all. 
     
      
    36    The subjective matters were dealt with in the written submissions filed. They were matters to which his Honour, in the course of his remarks, gave attention. The first that was referred to in the written submissions was the plea of guilty to all offences. It was submitted that this was a case where the plea of guilty should have been given greater weight by virtue of its representing a degree of remorse on the part of the applicant. 
     
      
    37    There is then reference to the first of the passages from the transcript evidence to which I have referred and also evidence of a passage in a report prepared by Katherine Barrier where she recorded the applicant as saying:  
     
      
       
        
        “I can't believe it, he didn't deserve it, he should not have died, I could have just punched him.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour observed the applicant had been honest with the psychiatrist and psychologist. 
       
      
    38    In The Queen v Kalache 2000 NSW CCA 2, Sully J said at para 38 in relation to the utilitarian benefits that derive from the guilty plea: 
     
      
       
        
        “…that there will inevitably be cases where the sheer enormity of the criminal conduct involved is such as to require that the proper protection of the public, and the maintenance in every other proper way of the rule of law, will entail that the utilitarian principle must, albeit exceptionally, yield to considerations of greater weight.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    39    In the balance, it has to be remembered that when first spoken to, the applicant denied any involvement in the crimes against Mr Thompson. There is, to my mind, little to be gained from a statement that he could have just punched the murder victim. The fact that the sentencing Judge accepted the applicant as honest with the psychiatrist and the psychologist does not particularly lead to a conclusion that the appellant was remorseful. His Honour had the benefit of what the applicant said in evidence and there is no reason to suppose that his Honour did not take that into account. I am not persuaded that his Honour, in any way, gave less than due account to the guilty pleas from the applicant. 
     
      
    40    Next, the applicant relied on the absence of violence in his prior criminal history. No doubt in many cases this would be a matter of significance but, in respect of the offences for which the applicant has here been convicted, it seems to me to be of little significance in terms of mitigation.  
     
      
    41    As I have already said, these crimes were horrific. They demonstrated a degree of violence on two quite separate occasions of, as I have said, a most brutal sort. In my opinion, there is nothing to be taken from the applicant's prior criminal history to which his Honour referred which would in any way contribute to a reduction of the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    42    Part of the argument was that that history might suggest a lesser likelihood that the offences would be committed in the future. I do not regard that background in the light of these offences as contributing to that conclusion. 
     
      
    43    Thirdly, reference was made to the significantly deprived background of the applicant. His Honour gave weight to those matters in his reasons for judgment. No doubt these are factors to be recognised but again, in a case of offences as serious as the ones with which the Court is here concerned, it is of very, very substantial importance that the sentences reflect the denunciation of the crimes and the moral outrage of the community towards them.  
     
      
    44    It is to be remembered Mr Thompson is a victim who happened to be exercising his right to go for a walk and found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
     
      
    45    With Mr Campbell, who was possibly a more vulnerable member of society because of alcoholism, there is an even more valid argument for a punishment to reflect considerable community outrage and to contain a significant deterrence element. I do not think that his Honour gave any less than appropriate account to the applicant's background. 
     
      
    46    Fourthly, reference is made to drug use as a contributing factor and passages were extracted from the various reports made by Doctor Westmore, Ms Barrier, Doctor Nielssen and the psychologists, Mr Webster and Ms Webber. In their opinions, or in the opinions of some of them, the offences would not have occurred but for the applicant's addiction, that the risks of re-offending relate to drug use and that drug and alcohol had played a dominant part in the applicant's life, both as an adolescent and as an adult. However, as the Crown pointed out in its written submissions, there was also evidence of a serious personality disorder.  
     
      
    47    Reference was made to the evidence, which I have already quoted, in regard to the applicant's intentions about his future behaviour. There is no reason to suppose that his Honour did not take this evidence into account but I am not persuaded that his Honour was not entitled to conclude, as he did, that there was nothing to suggest that the applicant would not revert to a life of drug taking on his release. In that regard, some mention was made of his continuing drug use after he was arrested, although Mr Byrne rightly pointed out that there was evidence that he was successfully on a methadone program. 
     
      
    48    The applicant relied upon the disproportion of the sentence, to which I have already referred, and I will return to say something more about that. 
     
      
    49    In the Crown's submissions, emphasis should be placed on the total effective sentence of twenty-seven years that Hulme J imposed. It was submitted that that was primarily what this Court had to look at in determining whether or not it would interfere. I have already set out in summary form the nature of the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced. I am not persuaded that that total sentence was outside the range of an appropriate sentence for those offences. In my opinion, that sentence must, and does, have regard to the enormity of the applicant's criminal conduct. Nor am I persuaded that it was inappropriate that that sentence be divided, as it was, between a minimum sentence of twenty-two years and an additional sentence of five.  
     
      
    50    The Crown submitted that even if in the structure of the s98 sentence some error emerged, the appropriateness of the total effective sentence would dissuade the Court from interfering. However, I am not persuaded by the able advocacy of Mr Byrne that the sentence for robbery and inflicting grievous bodily harm, in the context in which it was imposed and bearing in mind what Hulme J said at the time he fixed it, in any way did other than reflect the overall criminality of what occurred on that day and is itself outside the appropriate range. 
     
      
    51    Again, the challenge was principally directed to the length of the minimum sentence and the length of the additional sentence. I do not, as I have said, accept that there was any mistake made by an experienced Judge in approaching the matter without regard to s5 of the Sentencing Act. I have no doubt in my own mind that his Honour was appropriately conscious of the seriousness of the offences but equally, as his remarks on sentence amply demonstrate, he was conscious of the subjective factors that were advanced before him and have been advanced to this Court. 
     
      
    52    In all the circumstances, in my opinion, the applicant has failed to demonstrate any error in the sentencing process which would enable, or require, this Court to interfere. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    53    DOWD J: I agree with the proposed orders of the presiding Judge and his reasons therefor. 
     
      
    54    BARR J: During the hearing of this application it was submitted this Court should infer error from the mere facts that the sentence for the offences of robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm carry minimum and additional terms in the ratio of four to one and that his Honour gave no reasons for choosing that ratio. 
     
      
    55    There is no statutory norm whereby, in the absence of special circumstances, the additional term of a sentence may not be less than one-third of the minimum term - R v GDR. Of course, it is normal and proper for the sentencing Judge to provide for an appropriate period of time on parole after the expiry of the custodial portion of a sentence. In practice, the result is often that, where there are no special circumstances justifying the imposition of an additional term that exceeds one-third of the minimum term, the additional term imposed is equivalent to one-third of the minimum term. However, there is nothing about the present case that dictates that the proportion of the sentence for the first count allocated to the additional term should not be less than one-third of the minimum term, or that the additional term should exceed three years. As the facts recited in the remarks of the presiding judge show, this was one of the worst cases of this kind. 
     
      
    56    Neither, in my opinion, is there any reason why the overall additional of a term of five years was insufficient. 
     
      
    57    I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding Judge for the reasons his Honour has given. 
     
      
    58    SHELLER JA: The orders will be as I have announced them.

       JUDGMENT -  
       Application for Verdict by Direction 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: Mr Stratton submits that the Crown has failed to establish a prima facie case as against his client, the accused Deborah Davidson, and accordingly he seeks a verdict by direction. It is Mr Stratton's submission that at the time the accused performed the acts relied upon by the Crown as constituting her an accessory after the fact to murder, the Crown had failed to exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased, Paul Harris, was still alive. 
     
      
    2    Mr Stratton pointed to evidence that no person at the unit had made any checks to determine whether the deceased was indeed dead. 
     
      
    3    Dr Jain and Dr Duflou considered that the evidence of an accumulation of blood in the left pleural cavity was suggestive that fractures to the left rib region were sustained whilst the deceased was still alive. This, it was submitted, points to the deceased being alive at a time after the last episode of strangling, having regard to the chronology of events described by the witness, Edward Szkudelski. 
     
      
    4    On such a view some further act or acts causing, or significantly contributing, to the death of the deceased may have occurred after the body was carried out of the Trinculo Place unit. 
     
      
    5    The accused could not be an accessory after the fact if the crime was not complete when she provided assistance to the principal felon. 
     
      
    6    Drs Jain and Duflou both expressed the opinion that the death of the deceased was due to strangulation. The evidence of the witness, Edward Szkudelski, in combination with the medical evidence, would in my view permit the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was killed in the unit at 10/30 Trinculo Place, and that the accused, Deborah Davidson, was aware of the commission of that offence at the time she did the acts upon which the Crown relies.

       70023/99 - REGINA v PIETER EGBERT HELMHOUT 
        
        
       JUDGMENT - Admissibility of ERISP with Pieter Helmhout 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: On 21 February 2000, the accused, Pieter Egbert Helmhout, was arraigned before me jointly with Mark William Helmhout, Deborah Joy Davidson and Joanne Rose Delly, upon an indictment charging him with the murder of Paul Joseph Harris on 20 June 1998. Mark William Helmhout was also charged with the murder. Both Deborah Joy Davidson and Joanne Rose Delly were charged with being accessories after the fact to the murder. A jury was empanelled on that day. Prior to the Crown opening, I was invited to deal with a number of preliminary issues as to the admissibility of evidence. In the case of each accused, objection was taken to the tender by the Crown of an electronically recorded interview. 
     
      
    2    As a result of the ruling I made concerning the admissibility of the interview between Mark Helmhout and police, Mr Webb made an application for a separate trial in relation to his client, Pieter Helmhout. That application was successful and, pursuant to s 365(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900 (“the Act”), I directed that the count against Pieter Helmhout be severed and that Pieter Egbert Helmhout be tried separately. The jury which had been empanelled in the joint trial was discharged on 28 February 2000 without verdict in relation to Mark Helmhout, Pieter Helmhout and Deborah Davidson. The jury were directed to return a verdict of acquittal with respect to Joanne Delly. The Crown indicated that it would proceed with the trial of Mark William Helmhout and Deborah Joy Davidson and it was agreed that the trial of Pieter Helmhout would immediately follow the conclusion of those proceedings. 
     
      
    3    On 25 February 2000, I commenced a voir dire hearing as to the admissibility of an electronically recorded interview between Pieter Helmhout and Detectives Nixon and Squire. That hearing was not completed on that day. It was stood over for further hearing to 3 March and thereafter to 10 March 2000. In the meantime, I embarked upon the trial of Mark Helmhout. I set out this history in order to explain certain of the evidence which was before me on the voir dire hearing.  
     
      
    4    On 25 February, when the voir dire hearing commenced, a number of statements were tendered being the accounts of various civilian witnesses as to the events of the day preceding the killing of Mr Harris. These statements were tendered because they included reference to the observations made by the witnesses as to the extent of Pieter Helmhout’s intoxication in the period prior to his arrest. By the time evidence was completed on the voir dire, I had heard evidence in the Mark Helmhout trial from these and other witnesses. The evidence in the Mark Helmhout trial concerning the accused’s state of intoxication was of a more extensive nature than that contained in the statements. I was invited, by consent, to have regard to the evidence given at the trial of Mark Helmhout on this issue. I should also note that on 22 February 2000, in a voir dire hearing concerning the admissibility of the electronically recorded interview between Mark Helmhout and investigating police, James Richard Jeffery, a solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service gave evidence. By consent, the evidence given by Mr Jeffery on that occasion was tendered in the proceedings before me on the present voir dire. 
     
      
    5    Pieter Helmhout was arrested at premises at 10/30 Trinculo Place, Queanbeyan at about 8.45am on 20 June 1998. He was informed that he was arrested in connection with a murder which had taken place earlier that morning. Police had information from a man named Edward Szkudelski that Pieter Helmhout and his brother, Mark, had strangled the deceased and disposed of his body in an area of bushland at Fyshwick. 
     
      
    6    The accused was conveyed to the Queanbeyan Police Station where he was detained pursuant to Part 10A of the Act. He was subsequently charged with the murder of Paul Harris. 
     
      
    7    Shortly after his arrival at the Queanbeyan Police Station, the accused was introduced to Sergeant Dagwell, the custody manager. This was not later than 9.05am. Sergeant Dagwell attended to the completion of the custody manager’s protocol which includes reading to the detained person a statement of his rights pursuant to Part 10A of the Act and administering a questionnaire to him or her. That process was completed at around 9.20am when the accused was taken to an interview room. The electronically recorded interview commenced at 9.43am. 
     
      
    8    Objection is taken to the admission of the interview upon two grounds: 
     
      
      (i) the failure of the police to comply with the requirements of cl 28 of the  
      Crimes (Detention after Arrest) Regulation 1998 
       (“the Regulation”), 
       
      (ii) the accused’s apparent state of intoxication was such that it would be unfair to the accused to use the interview in evidence. 
       
      
    9    Part 10A was introduced into the Act by the Crimes Amendment (Detention after Arrest) Act 1997. It makes provision for the detention of a person who is under arrest for a period of time to enable the investigation of the person’s involvement in the commission of an offence. This represents a significant alteration to the position at common law. Provision is made in Part 10A, and in the Regulation, for the protection of the rights of the detained person in a number of important respects.  
     
      
    10    Section 356A(1)(b) provides that the regulations may make provision for the modification of the application of Part 10A with respect to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. That has been done by the provisions of Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulation. Clause 28 is contained within Part 5. It provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a detained person is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, then, unless the custody manager is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning of the person, the custody manager must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) immediately inform the person that a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation will be notified that the person is being detained in respect of an offence, and 
           
           
          (b) notify such a representative accordingly.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    11    Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders are “vulnerable persons” for the purpose of the Regulation (cl 5(1)(d)). The protective nature of the scheme with respect to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is highlighted by the terms of cl 28 of the Regulation. Unless the custody manager is aware that the detained person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning, the custody manager’s obligation is to notify the Aboriginal legal aid organisation of the fact of the detained person’s custody. This is so whether the detained person wishes an Aboriginal legal aid organisation notified or not. 
     
      
    12    Sergeant Dagwell said that he could not recall whether he had contacted the Aboriginal Legal Service in respect of the detention of Pieter Helmhout on 20 June 1998. In cross examination it was suggested to Sergeant Dagwell (in the context of the obligation imposed by cl 28) that unless a person made a request of him to remind him of the duty he may not have made contact. To this he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, I can’t recall, but irrespective of whether that person said something to me or not with respect to that, I’ve got to do it, I have to do it and I - well, that’s what I was just saying. I know that the regulation is there that I have to do it, but I cannot recall doing it.”  
        (T.212-3)  
        
       
      
    13    Mr Jeffery, solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service, gave evidence that neither he nor his field officer, Mr Brandy, were contacted in relation to the arrest and detention of either Pieter or Mark Helmhout on 20 June 1998. The Crown accepted, in the light of Mr Jeffery’s evidence, that no contact had in fact been made with the Aboriginal Legal Service in conformity with the requirement imposed on the custody manager pursuant to the Regulation.  
     
      
    14    I accept that Sergeant Dagwell did not notify the Aboriginal Legal Service on 20 June 1998. Sergeant Dagwell impressed me as an honest and conscientious officer. I consider his failure on this occasion was an oversight. It was a busy morning for him. He was required to process four persons in accordance with the Part 10A protocol. The protocol requires the custody manager to complete a pro-forma document in manuscript and to administer a questionnaire to the detained person by reference to a series of computer screen prompts. As at 20 June 1998, neither of these procedures contained a reminder of the need, in the case of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, to comply with cl 28 of the Regulation. Had Sgt Dagwell been prompted by the terms of the pro forma document or the questionnaire to notify the Aboriginal Legal Service I have no doubt he would have done so. The omission of a reminder, in the case of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees, of the requirements of cl 28 appears to be a defect in the design of the protocol as it stood in June 1998. As I noted in my reasons for judgment in the related matter of Regina v Mark Helmhout 23 February 2000, if this has not been addressed in revisions to the protocol, I suggest that it should be. 
     
      
    15    The failure to comply with the provisions of Part 5 of the Regulation which relevantly modify the application of Part 10A of the Act enlivens the operation of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. The Crown did not seek to contend the contrary. Accordingly, the interview is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of admitting it given the manner in which it was obtained. In this respect I have regard to the matters set out in s 138(3)(a)-(h) inclusive. 
     
      
    16    In the course of the interview, the accused gives a varied account of his knowledge of an assault committed the previous evening upon a person who it might be assumed is the deceased. He makes no admission to involvement in the assault. However, he does acknowledge driving the assailant and the body to the vicinity of the Oaks Estate where the body was removed from the vehicle. He says he used his brother’s car for this purpose. There is evidence in the Crown case that the vehicle in which the body of the deceased was carried belonged to Mark Helmhout. Incriminating evidence (although not the body) was dumped in the vicinity of the Oaks Estate. I consider the probative value of the assertions made in the interview to be high. 
     
      
    17    The evidence forms an important plank in the Crown case. The Crown case depends substantially upon the evidence of a witness, Edward Szkudelski. On his own account, Mr Szkudelski was present at the time of the killing and assisted in the disposal of the body of the deceased. I will be obliged to give the jury a strong reliability warning pursuant to s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act in relation to the evidence of Edward Szkudelski. He is a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings. It is against this background that the accused’s record of interview assumes considerable significance. 
     
      
    18    Section 138(3)(c) requires me to take into account the nature of the relevant offence. It is sufficient to note that the accused is charged with murder. 
     
      
    19    I am also required to have regard both to the gravity of the impropriety or contravention and whether the same was deliberate or reckless. I consider that the failure to conform with the requirements a statutory scheme designed to provide special protections for vulnerable persons to be a serious matter. I do not consider that Sergeant Dagwell’s neglect was either deliberate or reckless. He struck me as an officer who would faithfully comply with each of the requirements of the protocol given to him. It is unfortunate that none of the prompts drew attention to the requirements of cl 28. Sergeant Dagwell readily acknowledged his awareness of the terms of cl 28. I accept that, in the circumstances in which he found himself on this occasion, he simply forgot to do so. 
     
      
    20    Neither the provisions of s 138(3)(f) or (g) are applicable in the circumstances of this case. As to para (h), I consider there would have been no difficulty in obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
     
      
    21    The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy me that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of so doing. On the balance I am satisfied that this onus has been discharged. My finding that Sergeant Dagwell’s behaviour was neither reckless nor deliberate is important to this conclusion. 
     
      
    22    An alternative (although in some respects related) basis upon which the admission of the interview was challenged related to the evidence of the accused’s state of intoxication at the time of the interview. The interview commenced at 9.43am. It was concluded at 11.07am. It appears that the deceased was killed in the early hours of the morning of 20 June. There is a considerable body of material to suggest that the accused was very intoxicated during the course of the afternoon and evening of 19 June and continuing into the early hours of the following morning.  
     
      
    23    The accused was described by the witness, Noel Gardener, as being “very, very intoxicated”. Michael Bradley described him as being “pretty out of it” when he observed him around midnight on the evening of 19 June. He demonstrated how the accused’s head was lolling from side to side. A shop assistant from the Mac’s Liquor outlet at Woolworths, Queanbeyan, gave evidence that he refused to serve the accused since he appeared to be too intoxicated. This would have been around 10.30pm on 19 June 1998. The witness noted that the accused’s speech was slurred, he smelt of alcohol, he was not able to stand straight and was stumbling all over the place. There were a number of other witnesses of who gave accounts consistent with the view that the accused, Pieter Helmhout, was very intoxicated in the hours preceding the killing. He appears to have been smoking marijuana as well as drinking a substantial quantity of beer and other alcoholic drinks.  
     
      
    24    The police were contacted by the witness, Edward Szkudelski, at 5.15am on 20 June. I consider it reasonable to infer that the accused had his last drink not later than 5.00am on that morning. 
     
      
    25    Detective Nixon was the officer in charge of the investigation. He conducted the interview with the accused. He said that when he first spoke with the accused “I thought that he had had a heavy night”. He said that accused smelt both of alcohol and of cigarettes. He did not consider that the accused was under the influence of any intoxicant at the time he first spoke with him. Detective Squire was also present during the interview. He said of the accused, “He appeared to me to have had a big night, hung over”. He formed the opinion that the accused was coherent. He noted that the accused responded appropriately to the questions asked of him. When police first saw the accused in the Trinculo Place unit, Detective Squire observed that he may have been a bit unsteady on his feet. However, he did not note signs of unsteadiness back at the police station. The accused’s eyes were bloodshot. 
     
      
    26    Margarite Helmhout gave evidence on the voir dire. She is the mother of the accused. She was an impressive witness. Among her achievements, she co-founded the Aboriginal Legal Service in Queanbeyan. She has worked for a number of years with young offenders, both as a Commonwealth and New South Wales Public Servant. Mrs Helmhout had viewed a portion of the record of interview between Detective Nixon and her son. She said, “that is not my son talking”. It was her opinion that the accused was affected by a combination of matters, including deep grief, some anxiety, alcohol, marijuana and other drugs at the time of the interview. She had made observations of the accused on the day of the funeral. She said it had taken him half an hour to put his shoes on. He was experiencing deep grief and a sense of devastation. 
     
      
    27    I viewed the whole of the record of interview during the course of the voir dire hearing. The accused’s appearance and demeanour during that interview are consistent with a view that he was still affected, to some degree, by the effects of the substantial quantity of alcohol and drugs consumed in the preceding hours. Mr Webb characterised his answers as having, at times, a rambling quality. There are passages in the interview where that seems to me a fair description. 
     
      
    28    The only authority to which I was referred which touches on the question of intoxication as it may relate to the admissibility of admissions under the provisions of the Evidence Act is Regina v Donnelly (1997) 96 ACrimR 432. In that case there was some evidence that the accused was affected by prescribed drugs in combination with a condition of severe depression. Hidden J in the context of reviewing the considerations set out in s 85(3) of the Act observed (at p.441): 
     
      
       
        
        “The common law relating to the admissibility of confessions by persons suffering a mental disorder or disability was summarised by Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Parker 
         (1989) 19 NSWLR 177 at 183-4, and what his Honour there said, is applicable mutatis mutandis, to the relevant provision of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . As his Honour observed, ‘Persons who are intellectually handicapped or who suffer from disease or disorder of the mind are by no means necessarily incapable of telling, or admitting the truth’.” 
        
       
      
    29    The Crown contends that the accused’s answers in the course of the interview contain a number of patently false assertions. Broadly, the accused gives an account that he was drinking by the river the previous evening when a stranger assaulted someone who may have been deceased. The stranger then required the accused, at gunpoint, to obtain a car and convey him and the body to the vicinity of the Oaks Estate. There are a number of implausible aspects to the account. No expert evidence has been led to suggest that accused’s state of alcohol intoxication was such as to give rise to concerns as to confabulation. Mr Webb does not submit that the circumstance that the accused may still have been intoxicated raises an issue as to the admissibility of the interview pursuant to s 85(2) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    30    It was Mr Webb’s submission that I would exclude the interview in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 90 of the Evidence Act. That section permits a court to refuse to admit evidence of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, it would be unfair to the accused to use it. Mr Webb submits that the circumstance that the accused was still suffering the effects of intoxication in combination with the failure of the custody manager to comply with cl 28 of the Regulation together produce a result that it would be unfair to admit the evidence. 
     
      
    31    In R v Ostojic (1978) 18 SASR 188, Wells J (with whom Hogarth J and King J agreed) considered that statements made by a person so severely intoxicated as to be unaware of “his surroundings, of the identity of his interrogator, and of the drift of questions put that he is incapable of choosing whether to speak or not and is just gabbing” might be involuntary. His Honour was, of course, concerned with the position at common law. However, his Honour went on to observe (at p 197): 
     
      
       
        
        “Liquor may loosen a man’s tongue; it may impair his ability to continue fraudulent conduct when under close questioning; it may inhibit his inventiveness and hence weaken his capacity to lie effectively. In such circumstances, if there is no more, I see no ground in principle or authority for excluding his answers..…it is a question of fact and degree.”  
        
       
      
    32    In R v Smith (1992) 58 SASR 491, Perry J excluded admissions made by an intoxicated accused. There was expert evidence that given the combination of mild organic brain damage and a probable blood alcohol reading of .2, the accused was likely to be amnesiac for the subject event and, if questioned, likely to confabulate. His Honour considered the evidence pointed to the accused being incapable of making a rational decision between speaking and remaining silent (at p 500). He rejected the admissions as not voluntary.  
     
      
    33    In R v Garth (1994) 73 A Crim R 215, Olsson J, with whom Prior J agreed, held that admissions contained in an electronically recorded interview with an intoxicated suspect were voluntary. His Honour took into account that the accused’s answers to questions generally appeared coherent and responsive. When asked to read three pages of a detective’s handwritten notes, the accused did so without apparent difficulty, on occasions identifying errors in them concerning the spelling of his name. He was able to gesticulate during the interview and his motor functions appeared coordinated and controlled. He had demonstrated a remarkable memory for various details of the events of the day. His Honour concluded that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “… fully appreciated his situation, agreed to answer questions, understood what was asked of him and gave rational responses, the accuracy of a number of which were independently verified by other objective evidence”. 
         (At p 234) 
        
       
      
    34    As noted above, I consider the appearance of the accused during the course of the interview to be consistent with a person still affected, to some degree, by the effects of the substantial quantity of alcohol and drugs consumed by him some hours earlier. However, I am satisfied that the accused was aware that he had been arrested and was being interviewed in connection with an allegation of murder. The introductory questions and answers make clear that the accused was aware of his surroundings and that he was able to recall the sequence of events from the time he was woken by police and informed that he was under arrest. In answer to question 23 he corrected a piece of incidental information he had supplied in the preceding answer. The accused acknowledged both that Sergeant Dagwell had told him he was entitled to have a solicitor present (question 26) and that he was cautioned (question 25).  
     
      
    35    In answer to question 29, the accused said, inter alia, “I don’t know the Paragon Mall out at Fyshwick”. This has some significance for present purposes because, at the very commencement of the interview, Detective Nixon informed the accused “Detective Squire and myself are making enquiries into the discovery of a body at the Paragon Mall, Fyshwick earlier this morning”. There is no further reference to the Paragon Mall until the accused’s answer to question 29. It would appear that the accused was able to absorb information given to him and to retain it for a period.  
     
      
    36    Detective Nixon asked the accused if he agreed that he had been informed that he was allowed to telephone a lawyer (question 32). To this the accused replied “well I don’t think I need one at the moment”. The accused’s view in this respect might be thought to have been ill-advised, but the significance of the exchange is that the accused acknowledged that he had been informed of his right to contact a lawyer and, again, he appears to have been able to recall the earlier discussion. 
     
      
    37    Generally, the accused’s answers to the questions asked of him were responsive. The account he gave might be thought to be, at times, implausible. However, when his attention was directed to a topic, he responded appropriately in the sense of giving an answer to that question. 
     
      
    38    In The Queen v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159 at 189, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, in considering the “fairness discretion” at common law, observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfairness then relates to the right of an accused to a fair trial; in that situation the unfairness discretion overlaps with the power or discretion to reject evidence which is more prejudicial than probative, each looking to the risk that an accused may be improperly convicted. While unreliability may be a touchstone of unfairness, it has been said not to be the sole touchstone. It may be, for instance, that no confession might have been made at all, had the police investigation been properly conducted.” 
        
       
      
    39    The fact that the accused may have made admissions (using the term in the way in which it is defined for the purposes of the Evidence Act) in part because his tongue was loosened by the effects of alcohol and drugs does not, in my view, make it unfair to admit the interview for the reasons given in Ostojic.  
     
      
    40    I have given consideration to whether the failure of police to contact an Aboriginal legal aid office in combination with the accused’s state of intoxication might make it appropriate to exercise my discretion to exclude the interview. Had the police investigation been conducted in accordance with the statutory scheme, the Aboriginal Legal Service at Queanbeyan would have been notified of the accused’s detention. There would have been no obstacle to a solicitor, or field officer from that Service, attending and giving the accused some advice. In the event the accused received no legal advice and, while still affected to some degree by intoxicating substances, participated in an interview with the investigating police. I do not know that I can infer what advice might have been given to the accused had a representative of the Aboriginal Legal Service spoken with him. I do not see how I can infer what the accused’s response to any advice might have been.  
     
      
    41    Having regard to the opening passages in the interview, I accept that the accused was not so affected by alcohol or drugs as to not understand that he had a right to refuse to answer questions. Further, I accept he was informed that he had a right to make contact with a lawyer and that he chose not to do so. In these circumstances, I am not of the view that it would be unfair to the accused to allow the evidence to be given.

      70093/95 -  
      R v Guiseppina ESPOSITO 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: When arraigned on 23 August 1999 the prisoner, Guiseppina Esposito, pleaded not guilty to the murder of Maxwell Andrews at Kings Cross on 24 April 1995 but guilty to the alternative charge of manslaughter, which plea the Crown accepted in full settlement of the indictment. This arraignment followed an earlier trial where the jury found the prisoner guilty of murder but the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed an appeal by her and ordered a new trial. 
    2    Before me an agreed statement of facts was tendered which showed the following: On the afternoon of 24 April 1995 the prisoner went to Liverpool to collect her prescribed dose of methadone. She later went to Cabramatta where she obtained from a pharmacy 200 tablets of Rivotril containing the drug Clonazepam. At Cabramatta she met two men, Paul Ross and George Russell, who had gone to Cabramatta to buy heroin. All three travelled together by train to Kings Cross. En route she gave Ross some Rivotril tablets which he consumed. All three also drank some beer.  
    3    They left the train at Kings Cross station and went to The Crest Hotel nearby where the prisoner was seen speaking to various male patrons in a bar, one of whom was the deceased, Mr Andrews. No witness heard any of this conversation. After a short time Mr Andrews left the hotel and walked down William Street alone. The prisoner followed just behind him while Ross and Russell were a little way behind her. At the corner of William and Brougham Streets the prisoner was seen by Ross to put her right arm over Mr Andrews' shoulder and there was a brief struggle. Mr Andrews turned around, walked a short distance and collapsed with blood coming from a wound in his chest. Ross and Russell then left the scene and returned to the Kings Cross area, and later that evening at Kings Cross the prisoner sold two gold rings, apparently belonging to the deceased, to another person. The prisoner and Ross then bought some heroin and injected themselves. Ross apparently overdosed but was treated and recovered later that night. 
    4    On 26 April the police spoke to the prisoner. In her bag they found a knife and some Rivotril tablets. She said she always carried a knife as she had once been raped. In an ERISP she said she had been to Liverpool and Cabramatta on 24 April and had returned by train in the company of two men, but she claimed to have left the train at Redfern, gone to her home at Waterloo, and stayed there all night. A sample of her blood showed a high level of Clonazepam, .91 milligrams per litre of blood.  
    5    On 15 May 1997 Ross and Russell each pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company of Mr Andrews. Each gave an undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution in any trial of this prisoner. Each was sentenced to two years' penal servitude. 
    6    Ross and Russell both gave evidence for the Crown in the prisoner's first trial. Ross' evidence was that he had seen the prisoner put her arm over the deceased's shoulder just before he collapsed with a wound to his chest. He also gave evidence of the prisoner showing him the knife and wiping it clean. The evidence of Russell was of less weight with the witness uncertain or having a vague memory of specific details. The prisoner gave evidence testifying she could not remember anything of the events of the night of 24 April 1995. 
    7    Professor Graham Starmer of the University of Sydney, a pharmacologist, gave evidence about the possible effect of the drugs ingested by the prisoner, particularly Clonazepam. He said that the reading of .91 milligrams was up to nine times the generally accepted toxic concentration, and one of the recognised side-effects was a form of amnesia. He had reached a tentative conclusion that she might have a passing appreciation of what was going on around her and possibly a limited appreciation of the consequence of her actions, but he would not take it any further than that. The witness Ross had since died of a drug overdose.  
    8    Defence counsel, Mr I McClintock, raised the possibility of a plea to manslaughter with the Crown Prosecutor in mid July 1999 after the prisoner was successful in the appeal against her conviction for murder, and the plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered at the first available opportunity. The prisoner has been in custody continuously since 26 July 1995 in relation to this matter. 
    9    It was the Crown case that although the prisoner may have no memory of having done so she held the knife that dealt the fatal blow to the deceased. Although affected by drugs at the time she was still mentally and physically capable at the time of the assault and the plea to manslaughter was entered by the prisoner and accepted by the Crown on the basis that holding a knife pointing at the deceased's chest was an unlawful and dangerous act. The plea to the lesser charge negatived any intention of guilt or inflict grievous bodily harm.  
    10    The prisoner was born on 16 December 1965. She was aged twenty-nine at the time of the offence and is now thirty-four. She was raised in Sydney of Italian parents who separated when she was young. She is one of three siblings, all of whom have had some unfavourable contact with the criminal justice system. Her father, to whom she claims to have been close, died aged fifty-three in about 1990. Her education was interrupted from time to time to visit Italy with her mother, and she left school at the age of sixteen without completing her school certificate.  
    11    She had a few jobs in supermarkets and completed part of a secretarial course, but in the meantime started using drugs including cannabis, amphetamines, LSD, ecstasy, cocaine and tranquillisers such as Valium, Serepax, Rohypnol, Normison and Rivotril, to which, especially heroin and tranquillisers, she subsequently became addicted. She has not worked for many years but lived on social security benefits and her life has been dominated by drug abuse and the criminal culture. She was on a methadone programme for some years up to and including the incident on 24 April 1995, but notwithstanding that she continued to abuse heroin and tranquillisers.  
    12    In January 1986 when aged twenty-one she was convicted of stealing and subsequently in July 1987 of self-administer prohibited drug (heroin). Since then she has had a large number of convictions mainly for stealing and like offences, no doubt committed to finance an ever-increasing and ever more expensive drug habit. 
    13    She was first sentenced to imprisonment in September 1987 and, on a rough calculation, between then and the current offence she seems to have spent more time in prison than at large. Prior to this offence she was last released on 27 October 1994 and at the time of the offence she was also subject to a recognisance to be of good behaviour entered into in the District Court on 25 August 1994 following breach of an earlier recognisance granted following convictions for making and using a false instrument. 
    14    It was the opinion of Dr Westmore, who saw her before her 1997 trial at the request of her solicitors, that the combination of methadone and Rivotril combined with alcohol and possibly cannabis would have had a significant detrimental effect on an individual's mental state resembling intoxication. He conceded the prisoner showed evidence of some antisocial personality characteristics, drug dependence and abuse; and a subsequent psychological report by the prison psychologist is consistent with Dr Westmore's opinion. 
    15    Whilst in custody on remand for this offence the prisoner has successfully completed a number of computer related courses, and become quite proficient in that area and also attended other workshops and training programmes. From October 1997 to October 1999 she worked as a clerk for the Manager of Industries in prison, utilising her computer skills and also engaged in telephone skills, office administration and management, and she was regarded by the manager as diligent, conscientious, honest, trustworthy and discreet. But in October 1999 urine testing showed she was again using tranquillisers whereupon she stopped her methadone treatment and told the manager in no uncertain terms that she no longer wished to work for him. I am informed from the Bar table that she has since returned to that job. 
    16    She has also attended drug and alcohol and psychological counselling and continues to do so but it is clear both from a psychologist's report and the Pre-Sentence Report that, although she has acquired skills to fit her for employment in the outside world, she needs strict guidelines as to what is expected of her, and clear goals to enable her to make positive changes to her lifestyle. 
    17    In particular I am satisfied that her rehabilitation will depend essentially on whether she has the will and capacity to overcome her multi-drug dependency. She has made some progress in this regard whilst in prison, but although one can be hopeful she will ultimately succeed, especially if she continues structured counselling and the use of support systems whilst in custody and on her release, she has not yet demonstrated that this will be so, and her attempts at rehabilitation to date have not been entirely successful. In this regard I consider that she will benefit from a significant period of conditional liberty with close supervision and the prospect of returning to prison if she has further lapses, and this constitutes special circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 
    18    I have taken into account her plea of guilty which was indicated when the option was first offered her. I also note she was grossly affected by drugs at the time, but this is not a mitigating factor. She still claims she has no recollection of the offence, which may be the case, but the plea demonstrates contrition and remorse. However, the fact remains that manslaughter is a serious crime in any event as it involves the unlawful killing of another human being. The deceased was walking down the street and, apart from a chance meeting shortly before, was unknown to the prisoner or her co-offenders and was minding his own business. The motive for approaching him with the knife exposed was robbery to finance the purchase of further illegal heroin. The evidence, accordingly, calls for a significant sentence even taking into account the various subjective features to which I have referred. 
    19    I have been referred to and considered a number of earlier cases including R v Maguire (CCA - 30 August 1995); R v Bryant [1999] NSWCCA 181 and R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310, and I have also taken into account the statistics noted by the Judicial Commission. The other cases to which I was referred, I found of little relevance because the circumstances were so different. As has been pointed out previously, manslaughter takes so many different forms and arises out of so many different circumstances that sentences in other cases are of very limited value. 
    20    The prisoner has been in custody since 26 April 1995 and the sentence will date from that date. 
     
      
      
    21    Guiseppina Esposito, for the manslaughter of Maxwell Andrews I sentence you to imprisonment for a minimum term of eight years which shall be deemed to have commenced on 26 April 1995 and I fix an additional term of four years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 25 April 2003. Exhibit 2 may be returned.

     Friday 24 March 2000 
     
     
     R v RAT 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J. This is an appeal by the appellant against his conviction on two counts of indecent assault contrary to s 76 Crimes Act 1900 as it stood at the relevant time, and one count of carnal knowledge contrary to the former s 71. The appellant was arraigned on six counts, the two indecent assault counts and one carnal knowledge count were alleged to have been committed between 9 October and 31 December 1977 and there were three further counts of carnal knowledge allegedly committed between the following dates: 
     
      7 June and 31 December 1979 (count 4); 
      
      1 January and 21 December 1980 (count 5); 
      
      9 October and 21 December 1980 (count 6). 
      
     At the close of the Crown case, the trial Judge, (His Honour Judge Armitage QC) directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the 5th count and the jury subsequently found the appellant guilty on the first three counts and not guilty on counts 4 and 6.  
      
    2    The complainant was born on 10 October 1967. The appellant was her stepfather who came to live with the complainant and her mother when the complainant was 3 or 4 years of age. In 1973 her mother gave birth to the complainant's half-sister, C. The appellant was C's natural father.  
    3    The complainant gave evidence that one morning when she was aged about 10 years and living at an address in Kingsford, whilst she was readying herself for school and after her mother had gone to work, the appellant kissed her on the lips then placed her on a black and orange lounge in the lounge room, laid her on her back and then lay on top of her and pushed himself against her whilst they were both fully clothed. He told her not to tell anyone, it would be ""their little secret"" (first count).  
    4    She said that one or two days later when she was again readying herself for school he sat her on the edge of the bed, fondled and kissed her about the neck, laid her on the bed, separated her legs, lowered his pants, pulled her underpants to one side and attempted to insert his penis into her vagina. He again told her not to tell anyone and said ""no-one will understand, if you tell your Mum she'll leave"" (second count).  
    5    A few days later, she said, the appellant called her into the bedroom where he laid her on the bed, moved her underpants to one side and began touching her and ultimately placed his hand over her mouth and forced his penis inside her vagina, withdrawing after about five minutes and ejaculating on the bed. He again told her not to say anything, that her mother would not understand and that she would leave (third count). She said that neither her mother nor her half-sister were present in the premises on either of these occasions.  
    6    About Easter 1979, the complainant, her mother and half-sister went to Malta for some months where they stayed with the mother's family, and one day she was talking to a cousin, JA, when a discussion started as to whether she had ever kissed a boy and ultimately she told her cousin that the appellant was doing things that he should not do, ""he's putting his thing inside me"". This evidence of ""complaint"" was corroborated by the cousin JA who gave evidence in the Crown case. 
    7    After their return to Australia in 1979, the family moved to an address in Eastlakes and the complainant said that on a Saturday morning in 1979, after the appellant had taken her mother to work, he entered her bedroom which she shared with her half-sister and in which the half-sister was sleeping at the time, told her to get up then removed a ""dressing gown cord"" that was hanging behind the bathroom door, closed both the bathroom door and the door to the bedroom occupied by the half-sister and tied the handles of each door with the length of cord. He then told the complainant to go into the other bedroom, closed the door to this other bedroom and placed a sewing machine against it, told the complainant to remove her clothes, which she did, they got into bed where the appellant had vaginal intercourse, withdrawing and then ejaculating on the bed sheet. Whilst this was going on the half-sister was heard trying to open the bedroom door and calling out for the complainant to open the door (fourth count).  
    8    The complainant also said that on another occasion following her return from Malta, the appellant approached her between the lounge and the coffee table in the unit at Eastlakes, kissed her and laid her on the floor, lifted her legs and inserted his penis into her vagina, and when he withdrew he ejaculated on the floor. She said she did not know the whereabouts of her mother when this occurred (fifth count).  
    9    In her evidence-in-chief she was asked to clarify when this incident occurred relative to that in count 4 and she said this incident occurred before the incident involving the dressing gown cord, which was contrary to what she had said in her statement. At the close of the Crown case the Crown Prosecutor sought leave to amend count 5 in the indictment by enlarging the particulars to allege commission of the offence between 9 October 1979 and 16 July 1981 and his Honour granted leave to make the amendment conditional on the Crown recalling the complainant to permit further cross-examination, but the complainant did not appear for further cross-examination, so his Honour revoked leave to amend the indictment, and directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on this count.  
    10    Towards the end of 1980, the appellant travelled overseas. The complainant said that shortly prior to his departure he was preparing to spray paint his car in the garage forming part of the apartment block at Eastlakes, and that while he was masking the windows she was sitting in the car when the appellant climbed in and started kissing her, removed her pants and ""started to have sex"" with her by inserting his penis into her vagina. The complainant's mother and a cousin, Sandra, tried to enter the garage at this time and the complainant heard her mother ask for the door to be opened, whereupon the appellant quickly lifted himself and told the complainant to dress (sixth count).  
    11    Whilst the appellant was overseas the complainant played truant from school for approximately two months during which time she met another young man, FG, but following the appellant's return an argument developed between him and the complainant about her not attending school, during which the appellant slapped the complainant's face and threw an ash tray at her. Later that evening the complainant left the Eastlakes premises and went to FG's home, he later drove her back to Eastlakes and suggested she go inside, but she told FG that her father ""was having sex with me and stuff like that"" so she did not return home and later moved into an apartment with FG and enrolled at another school under a false name. 
    12    Shortly afterwards police located the complainant and FG and both were taken to Kings Cross Police Station where the complainant spoke with a female police officer and later with a social worker, Ms Voight. The complainant could not recall whether she told Ms Voight of her father's conduct, but Ms Voight gave evidence that she did, although her notes could not be located, and because of the lapse of time, no record of what had happened or been said at Kings Cross Police Station could be located. The complainant was placed in temporary foster care but after a time she and FG drove to Melbourne where they settled and lived for 3 to 4 years pursuing a personal and sexual relationship in the mean time. They subsequently returned to Sydney but after a year or two their relationship ceased.  
    13    The complainant also gave evidence that she was subjected to various forms of general ongoing abuse by the appellant whilst she was living at home including being forced to eat all that was placed on her plate at meal times including at times her vomit, having her hand placed on a hot plate for stealing coins, being struck with electrical cords and belts, being made to take cold showers in winter, being hit with a belt whilst in the shower and having her cuticles pushed back into her fingers causing pain, and sometimes bleeding. She said she did not complain about the appellant's sexual abuse of her prior to her journey to Malta because she was fearful of the consequences, nor did she tell any of her school friends about what had been occurring to her. She also gave evidence that from 1979 onwards (i.e. count 4) until she left home the appellant had sexual intercourse with her at least once or twice a week.  
    14    FG was granted a certificate pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 s 128 and gave evidence of the conversation he had with the complainant the night she left home and of their subsequent life together, whilst the cousin, Sandra, gave evidence of an occasion close to the time the complainant left home, when she slept overnight at the appellant's home in the complainant's bedroom and during the night she saw the appellant walk in and lay next to the complainant under the blanket. The complainant said ""no"" or ""stop it"", and after the appellant left the room she could see a tear in the complainant's eye. She also gave evidence that she had seen the appellant slap the complainant, force her to strip, place her in a cold bath one winter's night and force her to eat her regurgitated food.  
    15    The appellant gave evidence denying each of the offences with which he was charged. He denied that the family arrangements were such that at the relevant times he was ever at home alone with the complainant in the mornings before she went to school. He denied ever having supervised the complainant or her half-sister in the shower. He said he never owned a bathrobe or dressing gown and there was none hanging up in the bathroom at any time. In relation to count 6 he said that the garage associated with the units at Eastlakes had a wire mesh fence through which the contents of the adjoining garage were visible, that he never spray painted cars in that garage and it was never his practice to lock the garage door from the inside as the door lacked an internal locking mechanism and the door was always secured by an external padlock. He denied ever having placed the complainant's hand on a hot plate, forcing her to take cold showers, forcing her to eat her vomit or pushing her cuticles back into her fingers. He said he could not recall any occasion on which Sandra slept in his home.  
    16    The complainant's mother also denied that the complainant was ever left at home alone with the appellant before school prior to the trip to Malta, and said that in a telephone conversation in 1987 her daughter told her that she had been young and stupid and that she and FG had made up the story about her father sexually assaulting her so that if they got caught by the police FG would not get into trouble. She said that she never heard the complainant say anything about having her hand forced on the hotplate by the appellant, nor did she ever see the complainant regurgitate her food and the appellant force her to eat her vomit. She said she recalled an instance when Sandra stayed overnight in the complainant's room at a time when the appellant was in South America. She did see the appellant smack the children using a belt, but she disapproved of this form of reprimand. She said she owned a bath robe that she sometimes hung on the back of the bathroom door at the Eastlakes unit, whilst the half-sister said she had no memory of ever being locked in her bedroom.  
    17    There was a considerable attack made by defence counsel on the credit of the complainant. She was cross-examined at length over two days, but although there was some cross-examination in relation to the circumstances surrounding counts 4 and 6 there was virtually no cross-examination concerning counts 1, 2 and 3 except a formal putting of the appellant's denial to the complainant in supposed compliance with the so called rule in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67. Most of the extensive cross-examination was directed to the complainant's credibility, and to the collateral issues of whether she had been forced to eat her own vomit, have cold showers, etc. 
    18    FG was also cross-examined as to his character, particularly his prior criminal convictions and his knowledge of the complainant's age when he was having a sexual relationship with her. It was put to him, but he denied, that he and the complainant fabricated the allegations against the appellant in the event that the police discovered their living arrangements and the complainant was forced to return home.  
    19    Although, on the complainant's evidence, Sandra was present with the mother outside the garage at the time of the events alleged in count 6, no evidence was led from her concerning that incident; and not surprisingly, she was not cross-examined about it. However, the jury did ask a question as to why she had not been asked about it and they were properly directed that they were entitled to infer from the failure of the Crown to ask any questions of her on that issue that her evidence would not have assisted the Crown case, but that they did not have to draw that inference, and that there is never any obligation upon an accused to ask any questions of a witness at all. They also asked whether there were any photos of the inside of the garages, and were correctly told that there were none in evidence (SU 82, 96-98 - the intervening pages were taken up with argument as to how those and other questions should be answered). 
    20    The grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant are that: 
     
      
      1. The verdicts are inconsistent; and  
       
      2. Having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported. 
      
      
    21    Although there is some relationship between the two grounds it is desirable to deal with them separately. The matter of inconsistent verdicts was recently considered by the High Court in MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 365 to 368, where the majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) pointed out that regard must be had to the jury as the ""constitutional"" tribunal for resolving disputed factual questions and the court's reluctance to undermine jury verdicts or to infer from them that the jury, drawn from the community, have done otherwise than their duty. On the other hand where doubt is cast upon a verdict because logically it cannot stand together with another verdict, the appellate court must decide whether the conviction based upon the verdict which is impugned is unsafe and unsatisfactory (or to use the terminology now current whether such verdict cannot be supported and/or is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence: Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68, 158 ALR 379, R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53). 
    22    In dealing with inconsistency alleged to arise from different verdicts on different counts in the same originating process the majority approved the test laid down by Devlin J in R v Stone (unreported - 13 December 1954), followed in R v Hunt [1968] 2 QB 433, and went on to say that if there was a proper way by which the verdicts could be reconciled, allowing the conclusion that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted; and if there is some evidence to support the verdict(s) said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. Their Honours went on (at 367): 
     
      
       
       ""In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellant court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count; a function which has always been open to, and exercised by, juries,""  
       
      
      
     and they referred with approval to the remarks by King CJ in  
     R v Kirkman  
     (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. 
      
    23    Finally they referred to the cases where different verdicts represent an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise by the jury or confusion or a misunderstanding of their function, and said that it is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that the intervention necessary to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction(s) will be set aside. 
    24    In relation to the three counts on which the appellant was convicted, the evidence of the complainant was simple and straight-forward, she claimed the offences all took place over a short period of time in the house at Kingsford and on these counts her credibility received a degree of support from her cousin, JA's evidence of what she had said to him in Malta at about Easter 1979. Although she was cross-examined over two days, the cross-examination was directed almost entirely to issues of credit and to circumstances surrounding the allegations relating to the 4th, 5th and 6th counts.  
    25    On the other hand, in relation to counts 4 and 6, there was considerable cross-examination regarding the circumstances; in relation to count 4 whether there was in fact a bathrobe or dressing-gown on the back of the door and, if so, whether it had a waist cord or ""belt"" and the complainant's half sister, whom the complainant alleged was present in the bedroom and who called out, gave evidence denying that anything of that nature had occurred.  
    26    Furthermore in relation to count 6 (the alleged incident in the car in the garage) there was evidence not only from the appellant, but also from the complainant's mother (whom the complainant alleged was outside and disturbed them, which she denied) that the only latch or lock to the garage was on the outside of the door and that there was only a mesh wall between the appellant's and the adjoining garages. In relation to these latter counts there was evidence of complaint to FG and to Ms Voight but it was put to the former that he had a motive for lying in that he had at the relevant time been having sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then underage and he had been given an indemnity, while Ms Voight's evidence reads as rather vague; and although the ""complaint"" to her was in 1981 at Kings Cross Police Station, nothing was done about the matter until 1995 and nothing emerged during the trial explaining why no charges were laid against the appellant after the complainant was taken to Kings Cross Police Station in 1981. 
    27    The jury may not have been as comfortable with the evidence of FG and Ms Voight as they were with that of JA, they were apparently concerned that the complainant's cousin, Sandra, was not asked any questions in relation to the 6th count by either the Crown Prosecutor or Defence Counsel, and whether the wall between the appellant's garage and the adjoining one was only wire mesh was left unresolved. The jury, without necessarily doubting the complainant's evidence may have taken the view that it was simply not good enough for the Crown to seek a conviction whilst there were these apparent gaps in the evidence.  
    28    Moreover the complainant gave evidence that the appellant was having sexual intercourse with her two or three times a week at that stage, and the jury had been warned that they could not substitute another incident for those charged in the indictment and they had been directed to return a verdict of not guilty on count 5 because the evidence did not fit the dates charged in the indictment. 
    29    Taking all these factors into account, the different verdicts do not impress me as an affront to logic and common sense nor do they suggest compromise, confusion or misunderstanding on the part of the jury, but are explicable on the basis of the different issues and different evidence which were referable to the different charges. Because of the collateral issues which were raised relating to the 4th and 6th counts, and the other matters to which I have referred, the jury in following the judge's direction to consider separately the case presented in respect of each count may have felt less comfortable in respect of the 4th and 6th counts than they did in respect of counts 1 to 3, and accordingly felt constrained to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt and to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of the former. 
    30    Finally on this aspect, the trial had lasted a lot longer than anticipated, the jury had been in and out of court repeatedly whilst objections to evidence, questions of law and procedural matters had been argued in detail and they had listened to very lengthy cross-examination (mainly on issues of credit) and then addresses. They retired at 11.35 am on Tuesday 15 December 1998 (the 17th day of the trial) and returned with their verdicts at 4.25 pm. It may be that, having worked through the first three counts and being unanimously satisfied on them beyond reasonable doubt, and having in mind that there were a number of competing issues to resolve in relation to the latter two remaining counts, they decided that, rather than have to come back again the following day (with all the inconvenience that would involve to their employment and personal lives) that justice would be sufficiently served by returning verdicts of guilty on the three counts on which they were already agreed, returning what might be called 'merciful verdicts' on the two remaining counts. 
    31    In support of the other ground of appeal, that having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of guilty on counts 4 and 6 are unreasonable and/or cannot be supported, the appellant relied heavily on the judgments of the High Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and the submission was to the effect that as the only direct evidence of the commission of any of the offences was that of the complainant which was contradicted on oath by the appellant, the verdicts of not guilty on counts 4 and 6 meant that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her evidence was truthful and reliable in respect of those counts (otherwise they would have convicted), therefore it was not open to the jury, acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her evidence was truthful and reliable in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3; and accordingly they were bound to acquit on those counts.  
    32    Stripped to its bare essentials the submission appears to amount to this: that whenever in a sexual assault case with multiple counts involving a single complainant and a single accused, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, then if the jury acquits on any one of the charges, they are bound to acquit on all the other charges. 
    33    In Jones the appellant was charged with 3 counts of sexual assault each alleging penile penetration, committed against the same complainant who was aged 11 and 12 years at the time of the alleged offences, but did not make any complaint until more than 4 years after the first alleged incident. The jury acquitted on the 2nd count and convicted on the other two counts, but the High Court upheld the appellant's appeal and directed verdicts of acquittal be entered in relation to the two counts on which he had been convicted. 
    34    Brennan CJ at 446 referred to the delay between the commission of the offences and the complaint and the failure of the trial judge to give a warning concerning the difficulties which such delay could pose of the appellant, particularly in relation to the 1st count where a witness called in the defence case felt constrained to admit the possibility that her evidence might possibly be wrong on a material point, and after considering the possible effect of such lack of direction in relation to the 1st count, the acquittal on the 2nd count, the delay in complaint and the apparent friendliness the complainant exhibited to the appellant and his wife after the alleged intercourse, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""The absence of an adequate direction, the acquittal on the second count, the delay in the prosecution and the evidence of the relationship of the child with the appellant and his wife showed that the verdict of guilty on the first and third counts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. Once the jury decided to acquit on the second count, the only proper verdicts which a reasonable jury could have returned on the first and third counts had they followed the direction which ought to have been given were verdicts of acquittal.""  
       
      
      
    35    The majority (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) referred to the evidence, both for the Crown and the Defence, in some detail and at 453 said that: 
     
      
       
       ""Implicit in the appellant's acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant's account of events which were said to give rise to that count.  
       (They discussed possible reasons for the acquittal on count 2 and continued.) 
        Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury's rejection of the complainant's account on the second count diminished her overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence concerning the incident the subject of the second count . . . There is nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count."" 
       
      
      
     Finally at 455 their Honours concluded: 
      
       
       ""Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first and third counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof."" 
       
      
    36    Jones' case has been considered by this Court in a number of subsequent cases. In R v Wells (CCA 17 June 1988) there were three counts some years apart and the jury convicted on one, acquitted on another and were unable to agree on the third. The Crown case on all counts depended on the evidence of the complainant. Simpson J (with whom Newman and Studdert JJ agreed) rejected a submission that the guilty verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory on the principles set out in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, but in quashing the conviction, held that the matter came within Jones, the principle of which she expressed (at p 13) as being that where there are different verdicts in such a case, it is only open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused in relation to one count if there exists something in ""the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the (count on which he was acquitted)"". 
    37    In R v James [1999] NSWCCA 191 the appellant had been charged with five counts of indecent assault. The jury had convicted on three of them, acquitted on one and been unable to agree on the other. The three counts on which the jury had convicted related to incidents alleged to have occurred when there were no other persons present, whereas in respect of the count on which he was acquitted the complainant said that it occurred in a disused building when they were inspecting a property with other family members from whom they became separated, whilst there was evidence, apparently reliable, that at the time there was no building of any kind on the property. In relation to the count on which the jury were unable to agree, the complainant's evidence was that the appellant had called out a reference to her night dress although she was at the time wearing day clothes. The appellant had given sworn evidence denying all offences.  
    38    The Court (Simpson and Bell JJ, Beazley JA dissenting) allowed the appeal. Simpson J, with whom Bell J agreed, said (at [63]) that in Jones the acquittal on one count was fatal to the Crown case on the two charges which resulted in conviction because it was only explicable by doubts the jury must have held about the complainant's credibility, and if they entertained doubts about her credibility on one count, they must have had equal doubts on the other counts. Her Honour could see no distinction between Jones and the instant case. She concluded that where there was any positive material to contradict, or create a doubt about, the complainant's claims, the jury doubted her credibility and then axiomatically they must (or ought) to have doubted her credibility generally (at [64]).  
    39    Beazley JA, who dissented, agreed (at [10]) that the complainant was not believed on her oath on the count in respect of which the appellant was acquitted, and this was a matter which affected her credit, but pointed out that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing both the appellant and complainant and clearly believed the complainant on the counts in respect of which they returned guilty verdicts; and she considered that a logical and reasonable explanation of the differences in the verdicts was that the jury obeyed, as they were bound to do, the direction that each charge had to be considered on its own and that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused before being able to come to a guilty verdict. She also (at [11]) considered the jury's inability to agree on the other count, meant that one or more jurors were not satisfied that the incident happened, or happened as alleged, and the jury must have again applied the direction that each count had to be considered separately. Her Honour then considered Jones and concluded there were a number of factual features in the instant case which distinguished it from Jones and that the verdicts were not inconsistent in the sense that the guilty verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
    40    In R v Meola [1999] NSWCCA 388 there were three counts of sexual offences with the same complainant and the appellant had been convicted on one and acquitted on the other two. The case was described by Sully J, with whom Hulme and Sperling JJ agreed, as ""a classic example of the word against word kind of trial of this particular type"" and the acquittal of the appellant on counts 2 and 3 necessarily reflected a view of the jury that it was not prepared to accept the complainant's evidence as establishing beyond reasonable doubt either of those charges, and accordingly it could not have been any stronger in respect of count 1. 
    41    In R v Whitmore [1999] NSWCCA 247 there were three counts all alleged to have been committed over the same holiday period, and the appellant was convicted of the 1st and 3rd counts and acquitted of the 2nd. In respect of the 2nd count the complainant said that the appellant committed a similar offence (indecent assault) on his own daughter at the same time (with his other hand) and in respect of the 3rd count that the daughter was outside the room whilst the offence was being committed (after the girls had left the bath together), and that she called out whereupon the appellant left the room. The appellant denied all offences and called his daughter who denied the happening of the events referred to in count 2 and could not recall any circumstances consistent with the events alleged in count 3. 
    42    The appeal was allowed on other grounds and a new trial ordered, but in considering the ground that the convictions were inconsistent with the acquittal in reliance on Jones, Greg James J, with whom other members of the Court agreed, (at [43]) did not consider the credibility of the complainant was so tainted that there should be acquittals on the two remaining counts. 
    43    I have already referred, at paras [24] to [27] above, to a number of differences between the evidence relating to the first three counts on the one hand and the 4th and 6th counts on the other and a number of possible explanations can be proffered for the different verdicts. The jury had been warned (a number of times) to consider the evidence in relation to each count separately, and that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before convicting on any count. They had the advantage referred to in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 of seeing and hearing the witnesses, an opportunity we do not have, but which, with the jury, the trial judge had and in his Remarks on Sentence he said (at p 5): 
     
      
       
       ""My own view of [the complainant's] evidence is that she was truthful from beginning to end. The events of which she spoke happened many years ago, and it is not surprising that she was unable to be precise as to some matters of detail. Further, she is a lady of rather volatile disposition, not unusual in persons of her background, and the manner in which, and the speed at which, she gave her evidence, accompanied as it was by certain mannerisms, may, in the eyes of some, have affected her credibility. In my eyes, it had no such effect. She was subjected to a lengthy and testing cross examination from which she emerged, in my view, unscathed."" 
       
      
      
     But it is worth noting that immediately before that he also said: 
      
       
       ""My view as to the jury's reasoning in finding the prisoner guilty of the first three charges, but not guilty of counts 4 and 6, is that it accepted the substance of [the complainant's] evidence, but acquitted on counts 4 and 6, because it was persuaded that the surrounding circumstances, to which I have referred, gave rise to a reasonable doubt."" 
       
      
      
    44    The fact remains that all counts depended on the evidence of the complainant being accepted as true beyond reasonable doubt and on the only two counts where her evidence could be set against other apparently or potentially reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof in the eyes of the jury. There is nothing in her evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to the first three counts where it could not be tested than it was in relation to the other counts where it could be, and was, tested. On the two counts where on the complainant's evidence, corroboration was available, such corroboration was not forthcoming. The very matters which justify a finding that the verdicts are not inconsistent in the sense of being a compromise are matters which call into question the complainant's credibility in respect of the counts on which the appellant was acquitted. 
    45    In those circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that her evidence as transcribed carries conviction, that it does not, in my opinion, contain discrepancies or inconsistencies such as were apparent in M v The Queen and the trial judge who like the jury had the opportunity of seeing the complainant and other witnesses was satisfied she was telling the truth, I consider that in accordance with Jones, the convictions on counts 1 to 3 must be regarded as unreasonable and cannot be supported, and must be set aside and judgments of acquittal entered. 
    46    If I am correct in my understanding of the effect of Jones, then I believe consideration needs to be given to the directions regularly given to juries in such trials. Juries are constantly told that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and also that they may accept part of a witness' evidence and not accept other parts of the evidence of that same witness. But Jones appears to establish a qualification to these directions to the effect that in sexual cases, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if they are for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is not open to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that she (or he) is telling the truth in relation to any other count; and therefore in such cases (i.e. where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences) if they find an accused not guilty on one count, they must also find him not guilty on all counts. They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence, such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside. 
    47    In my view the appeals should be upheld the convictions and sentences quashed and judgments of acquittal entered. 
     
      
      
    48    HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the Reasons for Judgment of Dunford J. There is nothing in his Honour’s account of the evidence in the case or in his reasons for concluding that the first ground of appeal is not made out with which I would disagree. However, I respectfully differ from his Honour’s conclusion in respect of the second ground. In my view the appeal should be dismissed.  
    49    An aspect of the remarks of the majority of the High Court in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 453 quoted by Dunford J which was critical to the decision in that case is the statement “There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstance which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” In this case there is a difference in the surrounding circumstances of sufficient significance to account for the difference in the jury’s verdicts.  
    50    The credibility of the complainant, so far as the counts on which the jury convicted, was supported by her cousin’s evidence as to conversations between them in Malta at about Easter 1979 to the effect that, using the complainant’s words, the Appellant was “doing things that he shouldn’t do to me, he’s putting his thing inside me” and in the words of the complainant’s cousin, that the complainant said she had “done it before” with “Dad”. 
    51    The complainant’s evidence and credibility so far as the other counts were concerned did not have this support. Of course there was evidence of other complaints but it does not follow that because the jury may have been disposed to believe the complainant’s cousin and the complainant when her credibility was supported by her cousin’s evidence, they were bound to believe her in other respects and also the other witnesses who gave evidence on the topic of complaint. Furthermore, not only were any complaints concerning the events the subject of counts 4 to 6 made later, but they were made at a time when there were grounds to think the complainant’s relationship with the Appellant had deteriorated further and the complainant may have had greater incentive to lie. In so far as complaint was made to Mrs Voight or any one other than FG, it occurred after the complainant had been located living in an apartment with FG and enrolled at another school under a false name and at a time when she might well have felt it desirable to divert attention from, or seek to excuse, the improper - because she was under 16 - relationship she had been having with FG.  
    52    FG had his own problems so far as credibility is concerned and it was certainly suggested that he and the complainant had put their heads together to tell a false story. The complainant’s activities with FG after Easter 1979, may also have inclined the jury to have doubts on what she said concerning the Appellant’s activities the subject of counts 4 and 6. 
    53    Decisions in court cases, be the tribunal of fact judge or jury, are often finally balanced. Whether the standard of proof be the civil or criminal one, very little may be sufficient in a particular case or in relation to an individual count to tip the scales. The evidence of the complaint to the complainant’s cousin may well have provided that “very little” in the case of the first three counts. 
    54    Of course there may have been other reasons for the different verdicts. As Dunford J has said, the jury may have delivered merciful verdicts in the case of the fourth and sixth counts thinking, at 4.25 pm on 17th day of the trial, that three convictions were sufficient. But be that as it may, there was something, viz. the strengthening of the complainant’s credibility in relation to the first three counts, which is capable of accounting for the differing verdicts of a jury instructed, and properly instructed, to consider the evidence in relation to each count separately. 
    55    I have said enough to explain why I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed. However, it is appropriate that I say something about Dunford J’s suggestion that the directions to juries in some sexual cases may need supplementing. I agree with his Honour that in some cases, a direction as contemplated by his Honour may be appropriate. However, it seems to me that before such a direction is required, not only would the complainant’s evidence have to be the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences but there would have to be nothing else in the evidence bearing on her credibility or in the evidence of surrounding circumstances which leant support for one charge rather than another. 
    56    The remarks of the High Court in Jones and the decision in this case and some of the others to which Dunford J has referred would seem to provide an incentive for the Crown to minimise the number of counts in any one indictment.  
     
      
    57    BARR J: I confine my remarks to the second ground of appeal. I agree, for the reasons given by Dunford J, that the appeal should be upheld, the convictions and sentences quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered.

       REGINA v Michael Shand WALKER 
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was convicted by a jury of murder. He was sentenced by Sully J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to serve a minimum term of fourteen years penal servitude, and an additional term of five years. The appeal is against his conviction. 
     
      
    2    The Appellant shot and killed a taxi driver, Wendy Bell, on 4 May 1995. At his trial, the issue was whether or not the fatal shot was the result of a deliberate act of the Appellant, with intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    3    In murder, the elements of a deliberate act and of an intention may be separate, but in the way the case was run below, and in this Court, those two elements overlapped considerably in terms of a defence of an accidental discharge. 
     
      
    4    In the trial below manslaughter by an unlawful dangerous act was also left to the jury. However, the jury convicted of murder. 
     
      
    5    There are two grounds of appeal. First, the Appellant submits that certain evidence of a police informer concerning alleged conversations with the Appellant should not have been admitted into evidence. Secondly, the Appellant asserts that having regard to certain matters, the verdict of guilty of murder was ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". 
     
      
    6    On 4 May 1995, the Appellant hailed a taxi at Manly. He sat in the rear of the taxi which took him to various points in the vicinity. At one point during the course of the drive, the deceased taxi driver activated an alarm which indicated that the driver felt that she was under threat. The taxi was then in Dee Why in the vicinity of a police station. Near the police station, the revolver that the Appellant was holding wrapped in a towel discharged and the taxi driver was shot in the back. One shot was fired from the Appellant's revolver. The shot passed through the back of the taxi driver's seat and into the body of the driver. The shot fired by the Appellant was fatal. These basic facts were not in issue at the trial. The Appellant's case was that the shooting of the deceased had been accidental. It will be necessary to refer in more detail to the evidence when considering the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    7    The first ground of appeal was that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of the witness who was a fellow prisoner of the Appellant. The admissibility of the evidence was contested at trial. After an extensive voir dire, the trial judge admitted the conversations into evidence. Before his Honour, and in this Court, the objection was based on s90 (the unfairness discretion) and s138 (the impropriety discretion) of the Evidence Act 1995. Reliance was not placed on s137 (the unfair prejudice discretion). 
     
      
    8    There were three pertinent conversations about which the prison informer gave evidence. I will set them out as they are also material to the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    9    The first conversation occurred prior to any contact between the prisoner and the police in the presence of a third prisoner. The evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It was a conversation amongst all of us. We were all talking and another inmate happened to say to Walker, ‘How does it feel knowing that you have killed someone?' He then said (that is to say Walker said to the other inmate), 'What's today?' And the other inmate replied, 'Its Tuesday.' He replied, 'That's how it feels.' Some time later I had a conversation with him again and he told me that the police were going down path A and which really there was a path B."" 
        
       
      
    10    According to the evidence of the prison informer it was this conversation which struck him as being cold and callous, and which gave him the idea that he could improve his own position by becoming an informer. He originally gave evidence to the effect that he had proposed to come forward out of some altruistic motive, but his Honour did not accept that evidence. The prisoner's position at that stage was that he had been arrested for a series of offences, including five armed robberies and one larceny of a motor vehicle. These offences had been committed while he was on parole from a prior conviction. The prisoner was facing a substantial sentence, something in excess of four years for the remaining period of which he was parolled for the original convictions, to which would have to be added the additional offences. 
     
      
    11    The second conversation was given in a somewhat different version in the voir dire from that which ultimately emerged before the jury. In the version that was given on the voir dire, the second conversation included the following reference: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He decided to take the woman for a dummy ride. .... 
         
        He said that 'I needed a vehicle for my scam anyway. I could plug her off anyway - I ended up driving to Warringah Medical Centre after the Mona Vale Cemetery', and I can't recall everything what he said your Honour"". 
         
         ""Yes, when I was in the cab with her, I heard her speaking on the microphone saying something like, 'I'm outside Dee Why Police Station'. I noticed a cab go past. I thought I was going to get caught, and that's when I fired the gun."" 
        
       
      
    12    The third conversation about which the prison informer gave evidence extended over approximately five pages of transcript. It is unnecessary to set out the whole of the conversation. During this conversation, the Appellant is alleged to have explained to the informer the nature of a plan he had to shoot a male taxi driver, to make it appear that it was in fact the Appellant, so that the Appellant would be able to collect something in excess of $700,000 on a life insurance policy. As will presently appear, a scheme of this general character was contained in a document found in the Appellant's possession on the night of the killing. 
     
      
    13    According to the prison informer the Appellant explained to him that he had intended to shoot a male taxi driver, disfigure his body in order to make it unrecognisable, place various items of jewellery, wallet, clothes and other items which would lead to the identification of the body as his own. He explained that he had left a will with a solicitor and appointed an “Uncle George”, who lived in Scotland, as his trustee. He anticipated that he would be able to collect monies from that uncle in due course. 
     
      
    14    With respect to the occasion on which the killing occurred, the evidence of the conversation included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yes I asked him … ‘How come it was a female taxi driver’. He said: ‘Well I fucked up and it was supposed to be a man’. I said: ‘What happened?’ He said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘What I done I went to a Manly taxi rank, just down the road from the police station. I seen a station wagon taxi with a male in it. That's the cab I wanted to get. As I got close to the cab, an old lady beat me to it, so I had to get the next cab. I got inside the taxi. From the outside it looked like a bloke but once I was in there I realised it was really a woman. I thought what the hell, I'm here now. I may as well take her for a dummy ride. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I told her to take me to Mona Vale Cemetery. I had been to Mona Vale Cemetery before and checked it out. ... That's where I planned to kill the driver. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          While we driving along I had a conversation with the lady taxi driver. I told her that I hadn’t been down this way for a while. I was visiting an old relative and told her some bogus story while I was having a conversation with her. She then told me that she didn't have any family and that she knew what it was like. I then thought because she's got no family, no-one would miss her, I may as well go ahead with my scam anyway and plug her off, I've got the opportunity, with the cab now. I need a vehicle for my scam. I can always get a body somewhere else. I may as well go ahead with the scam. So I then asked her, because it has been a long time since I have been down this way, if she knew where there was a florist. … She said ""yes"" we then drove to a florist. … I went inside bought some flowers went back to the cab. We drove to Mona Vale Cemetery. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Because I knew the lay out of the cemetery, there's a dip in the road and I even checked out a headstone. From where the dip in the road is, where the headstone is, no-one would be able to see the cab. That's where I could plug her. We got to the headstone, where I directed her. I told here that I might be a bit emotional and that I would like to get a towel out of my brief case. I sat the brief case on my knees and I opened it in a way where she wouldn't be able to see it. I grabbed the yellow towel which had a gun in it. I put the flowers down and I pretended to wipe my face with a towel. I had my hand on the gun. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As I started walking towards the cab, when I was just about to plug her, you wouldn't believe it, a fucking hearse drives past. There's this funeral going on, so I can't do her there. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I get back in the cab and I told her that I was feeling sick and could she take me to Warringah Medical Centre. Just outside the cemetery I told her I was feeling sick and would she pull over. She pulled over. I got out of the cab and I pretended to be sick on the side of the road. I got back into the cab but this time I got in the back seat, right behind her. I told her that because I had just been sick I didn't want to breathe all over her. That's why I got in the back seat. She then drove me to Warringah Medical Centre.”’ 
          
         
        
       
      
    15    Two aspects of this particular extract were the subject of comment in the Appellant's submissions on the basis of unreliability. 
     
      
    16    First, was the reference in the passage I have just quoted to the assertion that the taxi driver had said that she didn't have any family. It was in that connection that, according to the prison informer, the Appellant had said to him, ""that's when I thought she's got no family, no-one will miss her."" This assertion was wrong. The evidence before the trial Judge on the voir dire and before the jury, was that she did have a family who would miss her. 
     
      
    17    The second aspect which was said to go to unreliability, was the reference to the hearse driving past. According to the evidence below there was no funeral at that time at that cemetery. Accordingly there could not have been a hearse driving past. 
     
      
    18    Further evidence was given about the visit to the medical centre and according to the prison informer the Appellant said that he had shown to the taxi driver his card from the Metway Bank. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She was arguing about the fare and that's when he produced the Metway Card and she said that there were 'no banks around here that would take that card.' He said he cocked the hammer back of the gun and then he went on to show me how, with a towel in my cell, he had the gun wrapped in the towel. 
        
       
       
       … 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He went on to tell me that the gun he had was a five shot ex-police revolver. 'The gun had no safety on it so I used to leave the first chamber empty. That was my safety, but once you cock the hammer back, the barrel spins and the gun is ready to go.' He said: 'I cocked the gun back and at that stage I fired, but the hammer got caught in the towel and the gun didn't go off. She then took off. 
        
       
       
        
        The next thing I know, she is out of the front of the police station and I heard her say something on the microphone in the cab that 'I'm out the front of Dee Why Police Station'. And I also seen a taxi go past too. I thought then I was gone. I was going to get caught. They'll find the gun so that's when I fired. 
        
       
       
        
        I got out of the back seat opened her front door up but I fucked up because the car was still put in drive not park, and when I tried to push her over her foot slipped on the accelerator and the car took off. I was holding onto the steering with my right hand and I was getting dragged along beside the car. I thought if I let go I would get run over. 
        
       
       
        
        The next thing we smashed into the police station and I nearly got knocked out. I broke my toe. I was trying to push her over to get into the driver's side and drive away. There was police all standing around me and then I was taken into the police station.'"" 
        
       
      
    19    In his reasons of 12 March 1998 on the admissibility of the prison informer's evidence Sully J referred to his rejection, after an earlier voir dire, of certain evidence proposed to be given by investigating police with respect to a conversation with the Appellant on 13 May 1995. His Honour had found that on that day the police had clearly understood that the conversation which had occurred with them as police officers was a conversation which the Appellant was not prepared to repeat in a formal interview, and that he was not prepared to have any formal interview until after he had spoken to and taken advice from a lawyer. 
     
      
    20    The first conversation between the prison informer and the Appellant occurred on 16 May. The police had had no involvement of any character with the prison informer with respect to this matter prior to that date. 
     
      
    21    The prison informer had contact with the police officer in charge of his own case on 17 May in which he indicated his willingness to speak to the police investigating the case involving the Appellant. On 17 May the prison informer had the second conversation to which I have referred. 
     
      
    22    On 18 May the prison informer discussed his contact with the Appellant with the investigating police of the case now before the Court. 
     
      
    23    It was on 20 May, after the prison informer had been moved into the same cell as the prisoner, that the lengthy and detailed conversation to which I have referred as the third conversation occurred. On 22 and 23 May investigating police took detailed statements from the prison informer. 
     
      
    24    Sully J noted the fact that the prison informer was at risk of having to serve in excess of four years by reason of the breaches of his parole and also was facing substantial additional sentences for the further offences that he had committed whilst on parole. He found that the prisoner was actuated by a perception that he might be able to exploit his access to the accused so as to enlist some police support for his own forthcoming sentencing. 
     
      
    25    His Honour made findings of fact as to the conduct of the investigating police officer, Inspector Byrnes, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) From the time of his first contact with the prisoner, Inspector Byrnes was aware that some form of assistance with the prison informer's sentencing would be involved. 
       
       
      (ii) In the letter of commendation to the District Court in connection with the prisoner's sentencing in November 1995, Inspector Byrnes had said, ""I know that he held out some hope of receiving assistance but he did not mention it ... when I became aware of the totality of the prisoner's evidence I advised his solicitor that I would provide a letter to his Honour."" (His Honour found that the expression ""held out"" was meant in the sense of ""held""). 
       
       
      (iii) He noted that at the time of first contact the prisoner ""had very little information but was confident that if Inspector Byrnes was interested he could cement a friendship with (the accused) and elicit that evidence"". 
       
       
      (iv) That Inspector Byrnes had let the prisoner know that he would definitely be interested in any information the prisoner might be able to draw out of the Appellant and if the prisoner was able to advance the police case against the accused then Inspector Byrnes would do what he could to help the prisoner, but without making any particular promises. 
       
       
      (v) Inspector Byrnes was well aware from the time of the conclusion of his meeting on 13 May with the Appellant, that the Appellant was not prepared to talk on the record until he had first seen a lawyer. 
       
       
      (vi) That as at 17 May Inspector Byrnes believed that he could not obtain judicial authorisation for the use pursuant to the  
      Listening Devices Act 
       1984 for a listening device in any attempt to record inculpatory statements made unwittingly by the accused. 
       
      
    26    These findings of fact listed as (i) to (vi) are not challenged in this appeal. 
     
      
    27    His Honour's attention was directed to the most recent authority recently delivered with respect to the various discretions at common law: The Queen v Swaffield; Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159. Of particular relevance to the case was the decision of Cox J in R v Pfennig (No 1) (1992) 57 SASR 507, on which the Appellant relies in this appeal, and also the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Bailey & Smith (1993) 97 Cr App R 365. It is the case that the decision in Pfennig bears some resemblance to the present case. His Honour's attention was not drawn to another case, that of R v Lowe [1997] 2 VR 465. 
     
      
    28    In submissions to this Court, the Appellant did not identify any wrong decision on any question of law that arose with respect to the admission of this evidence. In terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Appellant relies on the proposition that by reason of the admission there was a miscarriage of justice. In the case of each of s90 and s138, findings of fact must be made and discretions are reposed in the trial judge. There are well known restrictions on an appellate court reviewing findings of fact and interfering with the exercise of a discretion at first instance. 
     
      
    29    His Honour made certain findings of fact which were open to his Honour and which have not been challenged on appeal. In order to establish a miscarriage of justice within s6, the Appellant must do more than simply convince an appellate court that it may have exercised a discretion in a manner different from the way in which the judge at first instance exercised that discretion. 
     
      
    30    Section 90 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “90 In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or to refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and  
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    31    In submissions, Mr Agius SC, counsel for the Appellant, drew attention to particular aspects of the unreliability of the evidence of the prison informer. 
     
      
    32    Firstly, the word is used in the sense of an element of unreliability about the making of the confession itself. Secondly, there is a question of reliability that may be seen to arise as to whether or not the words, said to be a confession, were said at all. In this case a good deal of the doubt associated with the evidence is concerned with the motive of the prison informer to make up a confession. This goes to the question of the reliability of the evidence to be used to establish the confession, rather than the reliability of a confession that has been made. Many of the references in the Authorities, particularly most recently Swaffield, to which reference was made in the submissions, particularly paragraphs [16], [17], [27], [28], [36], [66] and [126], were references to reliability in the sense of reliability of a confession, rather than reliability of the evidence. 
     
      
    33    Nevertheless, there is a point about the reliability of the confession, in the context in which it was made here associated with what Kirby J referred to in the following passage in Swaffield: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Within a criminal subculture, false boasts of criminal behaviour, bravado and false accusations against others may be common and perhaps even considered necessary in certain circumstances.” [126] 
        
       
      
    34    The circumstances of each of the conversations being between prisoners gives rise to an element of unreliability in that sense. 
     
      
    35    In my opinion the decision by his Honour to find that the evidence of the admission would not be unfair to the defendant, was a finding that was open to his Honour, and not one with which I am disposed to interfere. 
     
      
    36    His Honour distinguished the case of Pfennig in which elements of the fairness discretion and elements of the s138 impropriety discretion overlapped. I will presently refer to his Honour's comments about Pfennig in the latter regard. In many respects the accused accepted the prison informer's version of the contents of the conversation, and how the conversations had come about. In his evidence, however, the accused denied that the terminology relied upon by way of admission had been used by him. 
     
      
    37    Nevertheless, there was no real dispute that the conversations were freely engaged in, and included some discussion with respect to the killing, namely, the exculpatory assertion that what had been said was to the effect that the discharge had been accidental. However, in this situation there was no evidence suggesting that the prison informer had held out any form of inducement, or made any threat, or engaged in any form of trickery with respect to engaging in the conversations. The issue was the content of the conversations. 
     
      
    38    The Appellant submitted in this Court, as he appears to have done before Sully J, that Pfennig was indistinguishable. It was submitted, as in Pfennig, the police had in fact made the prison informer their agent, and that the informal interrogation of the accused on behalf of the police would come under the same condemnation as a formal interrogation by the police would have attracted. As Cox J said in Pfennig at 514: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The police set a trap for the accused of an impermissible kind"". 
        
       
      
    39    This was said to go both to the question of unfairness in the circumstances, but, alternatively, was said to constitute an element of impropriety and also went to the balancing exercise between the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way and the desirability of admitting evidence, for the purposes of s138. These aspects of police conduct were put on the basis that they went to both s90 and s138. It is convenient to treat them together. 
     
      
    40    Sully J distinguished Pfennig on a number of bases. First, he noted it was the prisoner who made the first approach to Inspector Byrnes and not vice versa. I agree that this is a material point of distinction, and at this stage it cannot be said that the ""police set a trap"", in the words of Cox J in Pfennig. Nor can it be said that the police had made the prison informer their ""agent"". This is obvious with respect to the first conversation which was of some material significance in the case and with respect to which there was no police involvement of any character. 
     
      
    41    In this case there is, in this respect, some analogy with the facts in Lowe. That case also involved conversations between two prisoners. There had been a number of such conversations between the prisoners, Lowe and Reid. Indeed Reid had acknowledged in his evidence that he had tricked Lowe into believing that he was working for a ""bent lawyer"" who would be prepared to take up Reid's case. Those conversations continued for a considerable period, prior to Reid first making contact with police. After he made contact with the police, Reid continued to speak to Lowe for the purpose of getting more information, and from time to time he would pass on that information to the police officers. Indeed, after a certain period of time, on three occasions, the police fitted Reid with a tape recorder. 
     
      
    42    The grounds of appeal were similar to the grounds in this case albeit arising under the discretions at common law. The trial judge had made the following findings of fact, which are set out by the Court of Appeal at 476. They include: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is demonstrable that thereafter Reid encouraged Lowe to speak; it is demonstrable that Reid set Lowe up; it is demonstrable that Reid told lies and adopted stratagems towards Lowe. But the police officers did none of that. Nor did police officers cause it to be done; they did not have any control over the situation, nor did they have any sanction to operate in relation to it. It thus seems to me to be plain that it was not the police officers who were ‘effectively interviewing’ Lowe as has been submitted. Rather there were two prisoners talking voluntarily together … It seems to me, in the circumstances, that the police did nothing illegal, nor did they do anything improper by being the beneficiaries of what occurred - initially at Lowe’s instigation and which was then encouraged by Reid - in the prison.” 
        
       
      
    43    The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, in a joint judgment of Winneke P, Brooking JA and Southwell AJA, said, at 477 to 478: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We can see no valid reason for concluding that the learned trial judge was in error in determining, as he did, that Reid was not acting as ‘an agent’ or ‘tool’ of the police in obtaining the admissions which the applicant sought to exclude. The role played by the police was a question of fact and degree which had to be determined by the trial judge upon the evidence before him and upon an evaluation of the circumstances which that evidence exposed. The belief which Reid himself might have held was not determinative of the question. The judge considered all the evidence placed before him on the voire dire and came to the view that, for relevant purposes, Reid was not acting as ‘an agent’ of the police. It is clear from the tenor of his Honour’s ruling that he was satisfied by the material before him that it was the applicant, and not Reid, who was the initiator of the conversations which occurred and that he needed little or no prompting by Reid to unburden himself. In our view his Honour was entitled to find, as he did, that this was not a case of a trap being set by police to induce a confession from a reluctant talker, but rather a case where the police were the beneficiaries of information which one prisoner was willingly giving to another. The learned trial judge was entitled to accept, as he did, the evidence of Sergeant Bartsch that no ‘coaching’ was given to Reid, and no instructions given as to questions to be asked but rather to ‘keep making conversation and see what comes’.” 
        
       
      
    44    Their Honours went on to say in a passage which I respectfully adopt at 479, 
     
      
       
        
        ""The line between what is permissible and what is impermissible might, in some cases, be a fine one. Whether such line has been crossed will, in most instances, depend upon the view of the circumstances taken by the trial judge in the particular case. The trial judge in this case was clearly not satisfied on the material before him that the police officers had crossed that line. Indeed he was, to the contrary, positively persuaded by that material that the officers had adopted a neutral role and had not, in any way, controlled the conversations between the applicant and Reid. We can discern no basis for interfering with his Honour’s conclusions.” 
        
       
      
    45    I have set out above the findings of fact that his Honour, Sully J, made with respect to the police involvement in the attaining of this evidence. In general terms, it appears to me to be of the same character as that referred to in Lowe. 
     
      
    46    In the present case, Sully J noted that there were significant limits upon police conduct in a situation such as that which faced Inspector Byrnes. But as his Honour put it: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I cannot see why within properly guarded, non specific and non contractual limits Inspector Byrnes was prevented from acknowledging what both he and the prisoner knew to be the relevant facts of life, namely, that the prisoner needed police assistance and was prepared in order to get it to run the risks inherent in giving assistance to police investigations of a murder."" 
        
       
      
    47    His Honour also contrasted the facts in Pfennig, when he found that the prisoner did not do anything to trick the accused into confiding in him. As his Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The questions asked by the prisoner so far as the evidence discloses them seem to me to have been few, non-leading and generally innocuous, except in the sense that they keep on foot a conversation in which the accused was quite willingly taking part.” 
        
       
      
    48    His Honour went on to say that he rejected the submission that the circumstances in which the prison informer drew the accused out in conversation made the statements of the accused, taken as a whole, unreliable. 
     
      
    49    He identified the fact that there was one detail given by the accused which was demonstrably incorrect, and another detail he found, at the time of the voir dire, to be arguably incorrect. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is however in my opinion unacceptably artificial to deduce from one plain error and one other possible error occurring in the course of a very discursive narrative that the remainder of what is said is so clearly unreliable as to make it unfair to permit the entirety of the consideration to be given in evidence before the jury.” 
        
       
      
    50    The word “consideration” as appearing in that passage is, probably a reference to “conversation”. 
     
      
    51    His Honour concluded that for these reasons he had not been persuaded, on the probabilities, that he should refuse in the exercise of his discretion under s90, to admit the evidence in accordance with the submission. In my view his Honour was entitled to form that opinion. I do not see any basis upon which the Court should interfere on the exercise of this discretion. 
     
      
    52    His Honour went on to consider the parallel submission made pursuant to s138, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “138(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law; 
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way the evidence was obtained.” 
        
       
      
    53    With respect to s138 of the Act, his Honour proceeded on the basis that the onus was upon the Appellant to establish on the balance of probabilities a relevant impropriety. If that were done then it was for the Crown to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting the evidence that had been obtained in the way in which the evidence had been obtained. 
     
      
    54    His Honour found that the accused had not discharged its onus of establishing that the evidence was obtained improperly or in contravention or in consequence of any such impropriety or contravention. His Honour further held that, if he had found that the Appellant had discharged his onus, then he would have found that the Crown had made out its onus of establishing that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way. 
     
      
    55    In this regard his Honour no doubt intended to refer to the findings of fact that I have outlined above, enumerated (i) to (vi), as the factual findings upon which he based both aspects of the judgment. When I say both aspects, I refer to the reliance placed on s90 and s138. 
     
      
    56    Both before his Honour, and in this Court, particular attention was directed to the findings of fact that his Honour made, and which his Honour numbered, and I have numbered (vi) above, namely, that at the relevant time Inspector Byrnes believed that he would not have been able to obtain approval to fit a listening device to the prison informer at the relevant time. His Honour found that this did not constitute a relevant impropriety. 
     
      
    57    The evidence adduced in cross-examination of Inspector Byrnes was to the effect that on 17 May, he had told the prison informer that he would ""weigh up what he gave me in relation to the case and I would then see what assistance could be given to him"". The Appellant submitted that this constituted a representation to the effect that the more incriminating the conversation that he was able to report, the more assistance the prison informer would receive from the police with his own sentencing matters. I do not believe that this is a reasonable construction of the evidence of Inspector Byrnes. If such a construction could be placed on the conversations then there may have been a relevant impropriety in that regard. 
     
      
    58    The finding of Sully J that both parties to the conversation, the prison informer and Inspector Byrnes, knew that some form of assistance may be forthcoming with respect to the prisoner's sentencing was an understanding which did not constitute an element of impropriety, or any contravention, or a consequence of any impropriety or contravention of law, within the meaning of s138. 
     
      
    59    I agree with Sully J that for purposes of s138, the nature of the police involvement did not constitute any impropriety or contravention in the relevant sense. I also agree with Sully J that, had I to do so, the evidence would not have convinced me, as it did not convince Sully J, that balancing the desirability of admitting evidence against the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way, the discretion should be exercised in favour of refusing to admit the evidence. For those reasons I would reject ground one of the appeal. 
     
      
    60    The second ground of appeal was that the jury's verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. It was submitted that having regard to the evidence, the verdict could not be supported. An alternative formulation in the Appellant's written submissions was that the verdict was not reasonably open. 
     
      
    61    The Appellant used the terms of ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" which have traditionally been used in this State to identify both a ground for appeal and also to found a submission that the Court should direct a verdict of acquittal, rather than an order for a new trial. As the High Court noted in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 73 ALJR 1; (1998) 158 ALR 379; (1998) 103 A Crim R 121 at [12], the phrase, ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" is ""potentially confusing"". It is important, as the Appellant has done here, to direct attention to the particular terminology in s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on which the Appellant relies. This the Appellant has done by using the particular words of s 6(1) that the verdict of the jury ""is unreasonable"". 
     
      
    62    Following the decision of the High Court in Fleming, this Court has emphasised that an Appellant should identify a ground of appeal in the terms of the statute (see R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53; (1999) 104 A Crim R 416 especially at [43] to [44]). The other work hitherto done by the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground of appeal should be the subject of a separate heading in submissions with respect to the order sought. In many cases the orders sought under what was referred to as the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground, is a verdict of acquittal. Attention does need to be directed to the inter-relationship between subs 6(2) and subs 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. (See R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 especially at 380; R v Giam supra at [31]-[46], R v Brownlee [1999] NSWCCA 57; (1999) 105 A Crim R 214 at [31]-[34]. 
     
      
    63    In many cases the order sought is the verdict of acquittal which is the default order under s6(2). In the present case, the Appellant's position was to seek the Court to substitute the alternative verdict of manslaughter. 
     
      
    64    The relevant test with respect to the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground is still that articulated by the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    65    This remains the test notwithstanding the abandonment of the phrase ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". See Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-452. The reasoning of the High Court in M at 493-494 remains appropriate when determining whether the verdict of a jury should be set aside ""on the ground that it is unreasonable"" within s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. See also Jones v The Queen supra at 450-452. 
     
      
    66    The basic submission of the Appellant in this regard was that the Crown had not negated the likelihood that the shooting was an accident. It was submitted that there was evidence as to the operation of the revolver to the effect that there was a possibility that a cylinder might locate itself in a position different from that intended by the handler. Particular reliance was placed on the types and quantity of drugs that had been prescribed for the Appellant and the expert evidence as to the possible effects of those drugs. 
     
      
    67    Particular emphasis was given to the absence of a motive for the killing. There was a body of evidence with respect to the insurance fraud which the Appellant had planned, but the sex of the intended deceased was a crucial part of that plan. It was submitted that there was no basis for a conclusion of an intent to kill a woman. Mr Agius acknowledged that motive was not a necessary element of an offence, however, he submitted, that where the defence relied on accident, the absence of a motive was of significance. 
     
      
    68    The basic issue at the trial and on this appeal was whether or not the fatal shot was caused by some deliberate act of the accused or with the requisite intention. It is pertinent to outline the relevant evidence on the issue of intent. 
     
      
    69    It was common ground that at some point of time the Appellant had a plan to murder a taxi driver in aid of a plan to defraud an insurance company. The idea was to disfigure the body and also to plant various matters on the body which would tend to identify it as that of the Appellant. Indeed, in the briefcase which the Appellant had with him on the night of the killing, there was a document, that became Exhibit U in the proceedings, that set out in great detail the various steps which the Appellant proposed to take in pursuance of this plan. 
     
      
    70    In the period up to 21 April, the Appellant had bought the gun, had changed his will, had left requisite documents with his solicitor. At the time after his arrest there was found in his room a mallet, a machete, hand cutter and surgical gloves which were relevant to the proposal to disfigure a body. 
     
      
    71    Of course, it was an essential component of this plan that the taxi driver be male. The circumstance that the Appellant happened to encounter a woman taxi driver was relied upon by the Appellant as inconsistent with the implementation of the planned murder. The Crown case, however, was that the original intention having been foiled, the Appellant had formed the intent to carry out the killing in some way as a ""dummy run"" for the plan itself. 
     
      
    72    The Appellant's case was that he had abandoned the plan some considerable time before, and indeed before 21 April. However, on 21 April he bought the gun and he also left the relevant documents with his solicitors including sealed instructions as what to do upon his death. Nevertheless, he maintained a position that he had abandoned the plan some time prior to this date. All of this was before the jury for the purposes of assessment. Given the acts of 21 April, and his possession on the night in question of the check list that became Exhibit U, and also his possession at that time of relevant equipment, it was plainly open to the jury to decide that as at 4 May, when the killing occurred, he was pursuing this particular plan. He had made some attempts in his evidence to explain his conduct in this regard. 
     
      
    73    However, apart from it being open to the jury to reject his version in the case, there is the second aspect of the evidence on which the Crown relied. Certain admissions had been made to the police. Some occurred prior to the formal record of interview. Others are contained in the records of interview. The evidence was not entirely clear as to the extent to which the Appellant confessed in the conversation prior to the record of interview. 
     
      
    74    The Inspector's evidence included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I said, ‘I saw a hole through the driver's seat of the taxi. Did you shoot the female taxi driver through the back of the driver's seat?' The accused appeared sullen and he paused and then he said 'Yes'. He also acknowledged with a nod of his head and he raised his right hand up to about abdomen height, extended his right hand with his fingers in that fashion appearing to emulate the gun."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      and 
       
        
        ""As he did this he said 'Initially I hadn't intend to fire the gun but then I did and I don't know why I did it.'"" 
        
       
      
    75    The evidence as to how the Appellant raised his hand and emulated a gun at about abdomen height is, of course, inconsistent with the evidence that he gave and to which I will presently refer as to the circumstances of the allegedly accidental discharge of the weapon. 
     
      
    76    In the first record of interview the questions and answers that occurred, to which I have just referred in the evidence of Inspector Burns, were referred to in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Do you agree that you also told me that initially you hadn't intended to fire the gun? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And you went, do you agree, that you went on to say that you had fired the gun and you don't know why you did it? 
         
        A. ...my hand, my finger, I think she moved forward slightly in the traffic, I think my finger slipped, no, I, there was no intention to fire the weapon. I was simply trying to keep it out of her sight while I got my wallet. Yes, I agree with what I said to you earlier."" 
        
       
      
    77    In the course of the first record of interview the following question and answer occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What happened when you got to the set of lights just on the intersection of St Davids Avenue and Fisher Road?"" 
        
       
       
      and I am omitting certain parts, 
       
        
        ""A. I asked her to...find me a...teller machine so that I could use my auto keycard...because I noted she didn't have one in the car, a lot of the Manly taxis do. And...while I was fumbling around, cause as I say I have these dizzy spells and...hence why I don't carry anything in my pockets...and I was searching in my case for my keycard and...told her I needed a State Bank or a St George, cause I have a Queensland account but it works at various other banks and she said there would be one at the Mall...so I was just fumbling around in that. I tried to move the towel with the revolver in it...'cause it was in the way of me closing it and it...went off."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Subsequently in the record of interview he said: 
       
        
        ""I had it by the butt and my finger on the gun, not on the trigger, and I know it was only a few minutes ago but it seems you know it happened so fast...the gun was cocked albeit empty chamber so ...no it was. I think there was but I had my finger not on the trigger on the shield in front of the trigger the curved bit while I was, yeah, I really wasn't paying attention to this hand. I was paying attention to getting my wallet and stuff out."" 
        
       
      
    78    He was asked about the conversation prior to the shooting and the Appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We've been chatting about a couple of things, she was telling me when she was gunna knock off, she was gunna go down to the club and um I said I had to get the scripts filled and I'd be going back home to rest and ‘cause I wasn't feeling the greatest...certainly then we were having a normal conv, as I said, that's why I moved over ah...so I could hear her better cause of the...my bad hearing and...I did I got closer to her."" 
        
       
      
    79    The following also transpired in the first record of interview: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Did you have any arguments or...disagreements? 
         
        A. Oh, no. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. ...with her...? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. During the course of your trip? 
         
        A. No, she was a very congenial...kind of person."" 
        
       
      
    80    The Appellant also gave evidence that he was holding the firearm in the towel on his lap so that it wouldn't fall while he was getting his keycard. He also said the following in response to questions as to whether or not he pulled the trigger. 
     
      
       
        
        ""I pulled it but I don't remember it as a conscious act. I didn't turn around and point it at her and, and take it out of its covering or... no, I didn't, there was no forethought there, if that's..."" 
        
       
      
    81    The evidence as to admissions had to be assessed by the jury in a context in which there was a body of uncontested evidence about the events immediately prior to the killing. The killing occurred about twenty minutes past midday. Evidence about the period of five to ten minutes before that moment was available to the jury for it to consider. This included the following. 
     
      
    82    The deceased activated an alarm from the taxi to her base, known as a M13 alarm. This was described as the “ultimate alarm” that a driver would press “if they felt they were in trouble” (T36). The effect of that alarm is to open up the microphone in the taxi so that the radio room supervisor can hear what is occurring.83    On this occasion the radio room supervisor first heard “quiet voices in the car”. The radio room supervisor then placed a call to the taxi about which she gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         ""'Taxi 1654, do you have an M13 situation?' She said 'No'. Then she said 'Yes'. I said 'Where are you?' She told me 'the corner of Warringah and Pittwater Road.' I said 'Which direction are you heading?' She said 'I am trying to get to Dee Why Police Station.'"" 
        
       
      
    84    The radio room supervisor said, in answer to a question about what sort of voice the deceased had: ""very quiet, very unlike her"". 
     
      
    85    According to two witnesses in the radio room, it was at this point that the deceased started to scream for help. According to one witness: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I heard her say before she screamed that she didn't need the situation, she didn't want the situation. I really can't remember the words she used but the situation, she didn't need it."" 
        
       
      
    86    Evidence was given that when an M13 alarm is sounded, this opens a clear channel to other taxis so that they can also hear what is happening inside the taxi. There is also evidence that it was common practice for a driver who had activated an M13 alarm to also put on hazard lights whilst driving. Another taxi driver gave evidence that the deceased's taxi was weaving in and out of traffic with its hazard lights on, at about that time. 
     
      
    87    The M13 alarm, the use of the hazard lights, the weaving in and out of traffic at some speed, about which there was evidence, and the particular conversation immediately before the scream to the effect that she “did not need the situation”, or words of that character, indicate a level of fear on the part of the taxi driver that is not consistent with the nature of the Appellant's case as to a discussion concerning an ability to pay with a particular form of card. 
     
      
    88    This was all evidence before the jury available for it to assess the evidence of the Appellant and also the other confessional evidence both in the conversation with the police and in conversation with the police informer. 
     
      
    89    In my view the assessment of that body of evidence was a matter for the jury. There was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably convict. 
     
      
    90    The Appellant also relied, in his submissions in this Court, on evidence concerning the possibility with respect to the mechanism of the particular firearm, i.e., that the cylinder with a live round in it could have located itself in a position other than that intended by the Appellant. The Appellant's case was that, as some kind of safety measure, he loaded the five-shot revolver with only four live rounds. His intent was that the empty cylinder would be located in line with the hammer. There was evidence to the effect that the operation of the revolver could act in such a way as to locate this cylinder in a manner other than that intended. It was a matter to be assessed by the jury in coming to its own conclusion as to the deliberate quality of the act and the intent with which the act was performed. Whether the accused's evidence as to how he loaded the gun should be accepted was a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    91    There was a body of evidence as to the accused's medical condition and practice with respect to prescription drugs. There was evidence from Dr Hornibrook, an ophthalmologist, who treated the Appellant for double vision. The Appellant placed particular reliance on the extraordinary variety of drugs he was taking at the time. 
     
      
    92    There was evidence from a treating doctor, an independent expert and a pharmacist about the scale of drug taking and the effects of the particular drugs and their combination. This evidence was clearly and accurately summarised for the jury in Sully J’s summing-up. No criticism has been directed to any part of that summing-up. 
     
      
    93    Much of the evidence was of a theoretical character, namely, what kind of effect could this habit of drug usage have on a person's ability to perform a deliberate act or to form the requisite intent. 
     
      
    94    As appeared during the course of the trial, and was clearly indicated in the summing-up, the jury had a particular form of evidence which it could use to assess the applicability of this theoretical evidence in the circumstances of this particular case. I refer to the first electronically recorded interview. Within forty minutes of the relevant incident a video recording was made of the Appellant. This video recording is of significance for the assessment of the expert evidence. In particular, both the treating doctor, Dr Nelson, and the independent expert, Professor Starmer, were asked questions based on the appearance of the Appellant in the video. Both agreed that they could not see evidence of confusion. 
     
      
    95    This, of course, was also a matter which the jury could observe for itself. 
     
      
    96    Professor Starmer did not see the three videos in full, as the jury did. The issue of whether or not the drug taking by the Appellant was of such a character as to mean that the Crown had not negated the likelihood that the shooting was an accident was quintessentially a jury question. It was left to the jury in a manner which the Appellant does not criticise in terms of the summing-up, some of which I have outlined above. 
     
      
    97    In my view there was evidence before the jury, including the evidence of the prison informer, notwithstanding the attack on the reliability of that evidence. I should note, additionally, no challenge has been made to the direction the trial judge gave with respect to the way the jury should approach the evidence of the prison informer. 
     
      
    98    The second count on the appeal, that the jury verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, in my view should be rejected. 
     
      
    99    In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    100    IRELAND J: I agree. 
     
      
    101    SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    102    SPIGELMAN CJ: The appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v. KAREN DENISE SKINNER 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Karen Denise Skinner, who was previously indicted before me on an indictment jointly with Fabrizio Calderoni, has pleaded guilty to one count that she did, between 1 February 1996 and 30 April 1996 with intent to hinder the investigation of a serious offence, namely the murder of Peter Marneros by Graeme Anderson Brown and Fabrizio Calderoni, give false information to the police and did encourage Fabrizio Calderoni to give false information to the police. She is convicted on that plea. 
    2   That plea has been accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment now presented against her and in respect of the previous indictment which included one count of accessory after the fact to the murder of Peter Marneros by Fabrizio Calderoni on 11 June 1991. The Director of Public Prosecutions does not proceed any further on that former indictment. 
    3   Fabrizio Calderoni was tried before me and a jury for that murder, and was acquitted by the verdict of the jury last Friday. The basis upon which the Crown put its case in that trial was that Graeme Anderson Brown was a principal in the first degree in the murder and that Fabrizio Calderoni was either an accessory before the fact, or alternatively was an aider and abettor or principal in the second degree, present and assisting in the murder. One Brett Skinner, it had been alleged, was also a party to the killing, although the Crown has not proceeded against him. 
    4   In short compass, it was alleged by the Crown that Brown was seeking to recover monies from either Peter Marneros or a person George Karipis, also known as George Page, and for that purpose was utilising the assistance of Calderoni and Brett Skinner to rob Marneros. 
    5   There was evidence that Brown's lover, one Patricia Adams (a protected witness giving evidence under a pseudonym) had knowledge of Brown's intentions and gave evidence in the trial that Calderoni had said prior to the robbery ""Graeme will kill him"". The acceptance by the jury of that latter fact was crucial to a finding that Calderoni was an accessory before the fact. 
    6   I cannot be satisfied of that fact in the light of the verdict of the jury. Even though these are other proceedings, I would not be satisfied of that fact in these proceedings, nor has the Crown sought that I should be. 
    7   I am able to be satisfied of the fact that the deceased met his death during a robbery being performed by Brown, Calderoni and Brett Skinner, and that Brown, on all the evidence, appears to have been the principal who advanced the idea of the robbery; carried out the principal role in the robbery; carried out the killing; and fled with the majority of the proceeds, having left behind some portion of the proceeds for the protected witness Patricia Adams as repayment of a loan. 
    8   The Crown has accepted in the present proceedings that it is unable to show that the present prisoner received any material benefit from the robbery or the killing. Brown has fled and has not been brought to justice. 
    9   It is not alleged against the present prisoner that the actions on which the Crown relies were designed by her for the purpose of intending to assist Brown's evasion of apprehension. It is alleged that some five years after the events, during a re-investigation by police, she actively sought to conceal the name and identity of her lover, Calderoni, from the police and to conceal the degree of association between Calderoni and Brown, and the degree of association between her brother and Brown; to conceal that they were involved in the robbery on the night; to conceal their later whereabouts, particularly that of Calderoni, and to enlist in so doing, the protected witness, who unbeknown to her was either making note of what was said or was equipped with recording devices. 
    10   Her activities were triggered following the interviewing of her by the police, and in consequence she made a number of phone calls seeking to achieve a state of non co-operation by, not only Brett Skinner and Calderoni, but possibly others. 
    11   It is clear she sought herself actively to deceive the police. Those phone calls, however, unbeknown to her, were the subject of telecommunications interceptions and it has been agreed from the bar table in what has been put to me that her actions, although intended generally to frustrate the investigation, sought to do so particularly at least, so as to conceal from the police the identity of Calderoni as a person ""Fred"" who was nominated in a written document left by Graeme Brown before he fled. 
    12   Her efforts did not in fact corrupt the investigation but had the effect of assisting it by providing material admissions from herself and Calderoni which were recorded by the interceptions or were recorded by the recording device attached to the transmitter attached to the protected witness. 
    13   In effect, her attempts to assist her lover and her brother provided the Crown with valuable material against them, and indeed had she not sought to assist them in the way in which she did, it is highly likely there never would have been a case against her brother and her lover. 
    14   The offence with which she is charged, and to which she has pleaded guilty, is the offence under s.315 of the Crimes Act 1900 which was introduced to replace certain of the common law offences against justice. It is punishable by a maximum of seven years imprisonment. 
    15   What she did was intended to hinder or frustrate a most important investigation. Firstly, it was the investigation of a murder, that being a most serious crime. Secondly, it had the effect of seeking to divert investigation of a robbery, a robbery in company, another most serious crime. But she is not charged with that. Although in that context it is impossible for me to put that matter aside since it laid the foundation for the very murder in question, in so far as her actions were intended to frustrate or hinder the investigation, I am unable to say that she was not motivated by an impulse that proceeded from a belief that her brother and her lover were not guilty of the murder. The only material to suggest to the contrary was the statement contained in a recorded conversation between her and the protected witness on 3 April 1996 where the words ""well it was a premeditated murder"" were said. It is not possible to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those words did not refer to after knowledge gained by her of Brown's intent. 
    16   Indeed, it is not possible to be satisfied when she gained any knowledge of what had occurred since, on the Crown case, she was asleep when those involved in the robbery/murder returned from that event to premises on the Central Coast. Her knowledge may have been gained from what was said by various of the persons over the succeeding five years, the publicity that had been given to the events in the media, and what had been said to her by the police when they sought to interview her. 
    17   The gravamen then of the offence in her case at the highest can be said to be seeking to conceal the involvement of those that she, at least on personal grounds, considered should not have been the subject of any murder conviction from being unjustly brought to book and that in the light of the matter having been some five years left in limbo no doubt due in part to the inactivity or inappropriate activity of police formally engaged in the matter and in part to a concealment of the truth or at least an unwillingness to bring it to light. 
    18   The re-investigation commenced apparently as a consequence of what had occurred during the Royal Commission into the Police Service. Apparently there was certain information provided as to the police at Kings Cross who might otherwise have investigated the murder much earlier. 
    19   Although the murder had occurred five years earlier, this matter has been hanging over the prisoner now since 1996, when the conversations to which I have referred came to the knowledge of the authorities. The delay, however, is explicable by the necessity to ascertain the correct and precise charge, the difficulty of obtaining various witnesses in a milieu in which any witness as to matters of fact required an indemnity or a certificate under s.128 of the Evidence Act 1995. The Crown has quite properly drawn to my attention that the prisoner sought to test the evidence at committal by availing herself of her legal rights considering she was charged as an accessory after the fact in circumstances which, until the matters that were revealed in the recent trial, might well have suggested greater culpability. This is not a circumstance that in my view should deprive her of the opportunity to take advantage of the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 since she pleaded guilty as soon as she was charged with the present offence. Thus, I would not regard this as a late plea. On the other hand, I would not regard it as evidencing vigorous and early co-operation with the authorities. That would be preposterous in the context of the prisoner's intention to try to frustrate the endeavours of the authorities. But I do see that, after all the time that has been involved and looking at her subjective circumstances particularly considering that although she has a criminal record which is accepted by both parties as inconsequential as far as sentencing is presently concerned, this is not matter which would warrant a custodial sentence, particularly a sentence of any real significance. 
    20   She is a resident of Queensland and the alternatives to full time custody are notoriously difficult to implement in such circumstances, but it is a serious offence nonetheless to seek to frustrate a murder investigation. Whilst it would appear, particularly from the submissions I have received from both Crown and defence, that this is a case in which a recognizance under s.558 of the Crimes Act 1900 would be appropriate and deferral of sentence and that recognizance should be conditioned only on her being of good behaviour, it is nonetheless a matter of some considerable degree of significance so that that recognizance should be for a fairly lengthy period. 
    21   In all the circumstances, I defer passing sentence upon the prisoner entering a recognizance herself in the sum of $3,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of three years and to come up for sentence if called on. The recognizance may be entered before a justice or magistrate.
